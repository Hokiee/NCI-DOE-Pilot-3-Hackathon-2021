DIAGNOSIS:
A. Mesentery, cecum, biopsy: Involved by metastatic

adenocarcinoma.

B.Uterus, hysterectomy: FIGO grade III (of III)
endometrial

adenocarcinoma, serous type identified forming a mass (3.8
x 3.3 x ' 3 " "W"“ “3“.

0.9 cm) circumferentially involving the endometrial
cavity and

arising in association with a polyp. The tumor invades
0.5 cm into

the myometrium (total wall thickness 1.6 cm). The tumor
does not

involve the endocervix. Lymphovascular space invasion is
not

identified. Anterior uterine serosa is involved by
metastatic ‘"'—‘

adenocarcinoma. The cul de sac shows endosalpingiosis.
The left

tube and ovary show endometriosis. The right tube and
ovary and

cervix are without diagnostic abnormality. There is a
single

intramural leiomyoma (5.3 cm in greatest dimension)
identified in

the myometrium.

C, D, E, F. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, excision: Multiple
(3

external iliac, 4 internal iliac, 2 common iliac, 17
obturator) left

pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

G, H, I, J. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, excision:
Multiple (6

external iliac, 5 internal iliac, 2 common iliac, 12
obturator)

right pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

K, L, N, O. Lymph nodes, left and right para-aortic,
excision:

Multiple (9 left, 1 right) para—aortic lymph nodes above
the

inferior mesenteric artery and multiple (2 left, 7 right)
para—aortic lymph nodes below the inferior mesenteric
artery are

M, P. Gonadal vessels, left and right, excision: The
left and
right gonadal vessels are negative for tumor

Q.Soft tissue, pyloric region, excision: Benign
epithelial
cyst (0.7 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm). Negative for neoplasm.

R.Omentum, omentectomy: Negative for neoplasm. A single
omental lymph node is negative for tumor.

This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic

examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of
the

specimen(s).

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled "cecal mesentery" is a 0.3 x
0.2 x 0.2 cm

tan—red tissue fragment. All submitted.

B.Received fresh labeled "uterus, left and right tubes and
ovaries" is a 165.0 gram uterus with attached bilateral
tubes and

ovaries and an unremarkable cervix. The uterine serosa
has focal

fibrous adhesions suspicious for endometriosis. There is a
3.8 x 3.3

x 0.9 cm mass filling the entire endometrial cavity with
1.6 cm

myometrial thickness. There is a single intramural
leiomyoma 5.3 cm

in greatest dimension. There is a 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm
right ovary

with a 9.7 x 0.4 cm right fallopian tube with adhesions.
There is a

2.2 x 1.6 x 0.7cm left ovary with a ragged outer surface
and a solid

cut surface with adhesions with a 7.8 x 0.6 cm left
fallopian tube

with adhesions. Representative sections submitted.

C.Received fresh labeled "left pelvic external lymph
nodes" is

a 5.5 x 4.7 x 1.3 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic
tissue. All

lymphatic tissue submitted.

a 2.5 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic
tissue. All

lymphatic tissue submitted.

E.Received fresh labeled "left pelvic common lymph nodes"
is a

3.5 x 2.7 x 1.4 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic
tissue. All

lymphatic tissue submitted.

F.Received fresh labeled "left pelvic obturator lymph
nodes" is

a 5.7 x 4.5 x 2.0 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic
tissue. All

lymphatic tissue submitted.

G.Received fresh labeled "right pelvic external lymph
node" is

a 5.7 x 4.7 x 1.8 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic
tissue. A11

lymphatic tissue submitted.

H.Received fresh labeled "right pelvic internal lymph
node" is

a 1.8 x 1.6 x 0.9 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic
tissue. All

lymphatic tissue submitted.

I.Received fresh labeled "right pelvic common lymph node"
is a

2.0 x 1.4 x 0.9 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic
tissue. All

lymphatic tissue submitted.

J.Received fresh labeled "right pelvic obturator" is an
(5.7 x

5.4 x 2.4 cm) aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.
All

lymphatic tissue submitted.

K. Received fresh labeled "right para aortic lymph nodes
above IMA"

is a 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic
tissue.

All lymphatic tissue submitted.

L.Received fresh labeled "right para aortic lymph nodes
below

IMA" is a 3.2 x 2.0 x 1.3 cm aggregate of adipose and
lymphatic

tissue. All lymphatic tissue submitted.

M.Received fresh labeled "right gonadal vessel" is a 8.3
cm in

length by 0.4 cm in diameter portion of unremarkable blood
vessel.
