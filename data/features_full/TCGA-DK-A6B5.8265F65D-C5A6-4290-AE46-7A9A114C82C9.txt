3)The specimen is received fresh, labeled “Left ureter #2”. It consists of a 0.3 x 0.3 cm fragment of mucosa with attched 0.4 cm
adipose tissue. The mucosa is entirely frozen.

5. The specimen is receive! fresh labeled, " Cystoprostatectomy“. It consists of a bladder or prostate and seminal vesicle
specimen measuring 13 cm from superior to inferior. 13.5 Cm laterally and 5.5 cm from anterior to posterior. The specimen is
inked as follows: The right side is inked green and the left side is inked blue. The prostatic urethral margin is shaved and submitted
for frozen section. The bladder measures 9.5 x 9.3 x 4.5 and is opened along the anterior midline to reveal an irregular ulcerating
lesion measuring 2 x 1.5 cm which is grossly situated within the left anterior wall . The lesion is situated 1 cm from the left orifice
and 3 cm from the right. Both ureters are probe patent measuring up to 0.2 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion is sectioned to
reveal possible extension into muscularis. Extension to the inked fat is grossly not identified. A second irregular ulcerating lesion
measuring 2.6 X 1.5 cm is seen 2.7 cm from the ﬁrst tumor and grossly situated within the right anterior/ lateral wall . The
lesion is present within 0.3 cm from the right orifice and 2.5 Cm from the left. Both ureters are probe patent measuring up to
0.2 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion is sectioned and appears limited to lamina propria. Extension to the inked fat is grossly
not identiﬁed. A third tan polypold nodule is present at the dome of the bladder measuring 0.9 x 0.9 cm and 4.5 cm from the ﬁrst
lesion. A fourth possible lesion is identiﬁed also in the dome about 1 cm from the nodule. The remaining bladder mucosa is
grossly unremarkable. Discrete perivesical lymph nodes are grossly not identified. The prostate measures 3.5 x 2.5 x 2 cm and
is serially sectioned to reveal unremarkable fibromuscular tissue. Representative section of the specimen. including entire lesions
are Submitted including two sections from each prostatic quadrant and transition zone. TPS is submitted. The specimen is
submitted for lymph node dissection and all possible lymph nodes are submitted.
