SPECIMEN(S) SU BMITTED: GROSS DESCRIPTION

1. Pectoralis muscle: Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis is a single segment of skeletal muscle with attached
ﬁbroadipose tissue and soft tissue measuring 6.5 x 4.0 x 1.5 cm. The specimen is unoriented. One surface is inked black
and the oppoeile surface is inked orange. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted for frozen section
diagnosis in three cassettes. The frozen section remnant is submitted in cassettes A - C.

2. Right breast: In formalin labeled with the patients name and medical record number is a 2374-gram. 26 x 18 x 11 cm
right simple mastectomy surfaced by brown skin. The specimen is oriented with a short stitch designated as superior and
a long stitch as lateral. The skin surface displays a 19 x 15.5 cm nodular gray-yellow mass involving the entire nipple
areolar complex. The nipple is not deﬁnitively identiﬁed. The mass comes to within 1.5 cm of the inferior skin margin. 2.5
cm of the superior skin margin, 1.8 cm of the lateral skin tip. and 8 cm of the medial skin tip. The superior skin margin is
inked blue, the inferior skin margin is inked green. and the deep margin is inked black. Upon sectioning the mass
involves all four quadrants and approaches the deep margin. Red—brown muscle is identiﬁed at the deep margin. which
also appears to be involved by tumor grossly. The cut surface of the mass is pink-gray to tan-yellow, firm, and glistening.
The mass occupies approximately 80% of the breast parenchyma. The remaining cut surface displays yellow adipose
tissue intermixed with dense tan—white ﬁbroglandular tissue. Representative sections are submitted in nine cassettes as
follows: A - B - superior skin margin, C - D - the inferior margin. E - F - mass to include the deep margin. G - the deep
margin to include muscle, H — I - the mass to include skin involvement. The specimen is placed in formalin at

giving a total formalin ﬁxation time of approximately 8.5 hours. i" ’ ‘
