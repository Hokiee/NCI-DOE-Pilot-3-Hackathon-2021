PROCEDURE
Flexible bronchoscopy, left robotic assisted thoracic surgery, left
upper lobe posterior segmentectomy

HISTORY
Left upper lobe metastatic melanoma

GROSS
Part A. Received fresh, labeled "posterior segment left upper
lobe," is a 12 x 4.5 x 2.5 cm, 41~gram wedge—shaped portion of lung.
The pleural surface shows a puckering over a 2 cm zone. Deep to
this puckering is a 3 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm tan mass. This mass is 0.5 cm
from the staple line surgical margin. The remainder of the pleural
surface is pink-red and the uninvolved cut surface is pink—red. A
portion of the surgical margin is submitted for frozen sectionz'A
sample of the tissue is submitted for research studies per protocols

Representative sections submitted in six cassettes. Sent for TCGA
research.

Sections are taken as follows:

1 as frozen

2_3 as green inked puckered mass
4—5 as additional mass

6 as uninvolved lung ~

Part B. Received fresh, labeled "wedge resection left lower lobe,"
is a 5.5 x 1 x 0.6 cm, 1 gram wedge—shaped portion of lung. The
pleural surface is pink~red and shows a black 0.5 cm nodule. A
portion of the nodule is submitted for frozen section. Submitted
entirely in two cassettes.

Part C. Received fresh, labeled "wedge resection left upper," is a
wedge—shaped 2.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm fragment that weighs less than 1
gram. It has a pink—red pleural surface with a 0.2 cm blackunodule.
All of the specimen except the staple line is submitted for frozen
section in one cassette.

Part D. Received in formalin, labeled "wedge of left lower lobe,"
is a 1.5 x 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm less than 1 gram wedge—shaped portion
of lung. The pleural surface is red—black. The tissue on cut
section is red. All of the tissue except the staple line is
submitted in one cassette.

Total time in 10% neutral buffered formalin from collection through
processing: . Total cold ischemia time:
