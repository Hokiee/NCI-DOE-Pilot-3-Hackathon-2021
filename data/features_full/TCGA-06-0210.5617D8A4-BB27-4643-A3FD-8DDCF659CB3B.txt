Operation/Specimen: Right temporal lobe. 4/! (I,
Clinical History and Pre—Op Dx: year old woman with recurrent
glioma.

GROSS PATHOLOGY:
A. Received fresh, four fragments, 0.7 cm across the largest one.
Tan-gray, semifirm. In total 1-3.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Frozen section diagnosis:

in, right temporal: High histological grade glioma, consistent with
blastoma multiforme.

B. Received fresh, two fragments, 0.3 and 1.3 cm across, respectively.
Tan-pink, soft and glassy. In total 4 and 5.

MICROSCOPIC: A. Portions of a neoplastic proliferation of glial cells
with clear features of anaplasia including pleomorphic and
hyperchromatic nuclei, mitoses and endothelial vascular proliferation.
Perivascular astroblastomatous pseudorosettes are present.

B. Portions of a neoplastic proliferation of glial cells with
morphological features similar to those described for part A. Focal
areas of necrosis are observed.

COMMENT: lhe lesion is a high histological grade glial neoplasm that
has a prominent astroblastic pattern. This feature is not uncommonly
seen in glioblastomas multiforme.
