Colon Cancer

Lymp No e, Le t I iac

Colon Segment, rectal sigmoid junction
Anastamotic Rings

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. The specimen is received fresh labeled with the name of
the patient and identified as colon segment, rectosigmoid

junction.

Length: 19 cm
Circumference: 6.5 cm
Margins: Stapled closed
Serosa: Smooth

Mass:

Size: 3.5 x 3.2 x 1.2 cm
Type: Polypoid centrally ulcerated
Region: Rectosigmoid
Distance from Mucosal Margin: 4.5 cm, undesignated
Circumference: Approximately 65%
Perforation: No
Mesorectum: N/A (Serosa present the entire
length of specimen)
Depth of Invasion: Grossly involves the wall
Distance from Radial Margin: 7 cm
Block Summary: Margins, 1—2; radial margin, 3; mass, 4—9;
random colon, 10. All potential lymph nodes are submitted
as follows: four potential nodes each, 11—12; five
potential nodes each, 13-14.

B. The specimen is received in formalin labeled with the
name of the patient and labeled as lymph node, left iliac.
The Specimen consists of a piece of red—tan soft tissue,
which measures 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. The Specimen is bisected
and totally submitted in one block.

C. The specimen is received in formalin labeled with the
“ name of the patient and identified as anastomotic rings.
. " Received are two complete segments of colon tissue measuring

1.9 cm and 2.4 cm in greatest dimension. tative
section of each is submitted in one block.

'~ DIAGNOSIS BASED ON GROSS AND MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

A. Colon, rectosigmoid, resection:

— Invasive adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, with
invasion through muscularis propria into subserosal tissue.
— Metastatic adenocarcinoma in 3 of 17 lymph nodes (3/17).
~ See cancer case summary checklist.

[T-59600 M—81403 154.1 P3—44090]

B. Lymph node, left iliac, biopsy:

- One benign lymph node, negative for metastatic carcinoma
; *. (0/1).

— See cancer case summary checklist.

[T-C4000 M—09470 V71.l P3—44050]

C. Anastomotic rings, excision:

— Colonic wall with no significant pathologic alteration.
— No malignancy identified.

[T-59000 M-00110 V7l.9 P3—44040]
