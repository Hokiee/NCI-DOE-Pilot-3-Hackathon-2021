F. RIGHT BREAST

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "left breast" is a 2229, 18.5 x 16 x 2.3cm
oriented (stitch in axilla) simple mastectomy with attached 4.3 x 2cm tan-pink skin ellipse. The skin
surface is grossly unremarkable. lnk code: anterior—superior: blue. anterior-inferior: orange, areola-
green, posterior-black. The specimen is sen‘ally sectioned from lateral to medial into 15 slices. revealing
a 2 x 1.8 x 1.60m tan-pink, ﬁrm, well-circumscribed mass. 0.2cm from the deep margin and 2.4cm from
the skin surface in the LOQ-LC of slices 6-7. A 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2cm ﬁrm, nodular area is identiﬁed, 3.2cm
from the deep margin and 1.2cm from the anterior-inferior margin of the LC of slices 10-11. The small
nodule is 2.2cm inferior to the areolar stitch. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue
procurement. Representatively submitted:

F1: LOQ slice 5

F2-F3: UOQ slice 6

F4: LOQ with skin slice 6

F5-F6: mass with deep margin LOQ slice 6

G. LEFT BREAST SKIN

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and “left breast skin' are two unoriented tan-
pink fragments of unremarkable skin 3.2 x 1.8 x 0.40m and 6.5 x 3 x 0.50m. The specimens are serially
sectioned and representatively submitted in G1.

ADDENDUM:

SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS
Specimen: Surgical Excision
Block Number: F9

 

ER: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0
PR: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0

 

COMMENT:
The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the

proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of
cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60°/o of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak
intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring
range from 0 to 8.

ER/PR positive is deﬁned as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is deﬁned as an Allred score
of less than or equal to 2.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
Immunohistochemistry was performed usinn the mouse anti-human ER (ER 105, 1:100) and PR (PGR
136, 1:100) provided by ' , following the manufacturer 8 instructions. This
assay was not modiﬁed. Interpretation oi me ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published
results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal
review of staining performance.
