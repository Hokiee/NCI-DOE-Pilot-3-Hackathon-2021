l) . The specimen. is receiVed trash, labeled “Omentum.” It consists of a 21
x 14 x 1.5 cm fragment of adipose tissue consiatent with omentum. Serial
eeotioning reveals tan-Yellow lobulated adipose tissue. No discrete lesions
or abnormalities are grossly identified. Representative sectione are

submitted.

2). The Specimen is received trash, labeled "Right oolon" and cor-niece of a
segment of terminal ileum. cecum with attached appendix and ascending colon.
The terminal ileum measures 1-1.0 Cm in length and 3.7 cm in circumference

at the proximal resented margin. The remaining colon measures 33.5 cm in
length with a circumference of 8.5 cm at the distal resented margin. The
attached appendix measures 6.0 cm in length and. averages 1.0 cm in diameter.
T1513 appendioeal nerona is pin): tan. and the wall at the tip is partially
thickened. recall}; hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans
the length oﬁ the «specimen measuring up to 3.0 cm in. thickness. The
intestinal nerosa around oecal pouch displays a 6.0 .x 4.0 cm hemorrhagic
puckered. focus. Thin area and the surrounding pericolic adipose tissue are
inked blue. The specimen is opened to reveal an underlying ulcerated tumor
measuring 3.0 cm in length and 4.7 cm in width. that it: 2.0 cm from the
ileooecal valve and 24.5 cm from the distal colon margin. Sectioning uhowa
that the tumor invades into a depth of. 0.8 cm. grossly involving through the
musculari- and approaching the serene. The remaining mucosa in tan pink and
displays approximately 20 smooch tensile polyps ranging from 0.3 cm to 1.2
cm in greatest dimension. All the polyps over 1.0 cm are submitted entirely
and representative sentient of the remaining specimen are eubmitted.
Multiple lymph nodes are identified in the attached adipose tissue and are
submitted. A portion of. the specimen is submitted tor TPS.
