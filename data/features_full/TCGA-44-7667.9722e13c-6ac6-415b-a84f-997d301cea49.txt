CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Right lung mass.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. Received in formalin, labeled "level 9 lymph node" is a

0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm slightly rubbery gray black tissue which
is submitted in toto. AS-1.

B. Received fresh, labeled "sixth rib" is a 15.5 cm

slightly curved tan white portion of bone ranging from 1.2
to 1.5 cm in diameter. The specimen is in keeping with rib.
Representative sections are submitted in one block following
fixation and decalcification. RS-1.

C. Received in formalin, labeled "level 11 lymph node" are

three slightly rubbery tan red-gray tissues in keeping with
lymph nodes measuring up to 1.3 cm in greatest dimension. The
largest tissue is bisected and the specimens are entirely submitted
in two blocks as labeled. AS-2.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Two whole nodes; 2 - bisected largest node.

D. Container D is labeled with the patient's name, medical

record number and right lower lobe. The right lower lobe
weighs 549.3 grams and measures 18 x 13 x 10 cm. in greatest
dimensions. The pleural surface is stretched taught over a rounded
mass. When incised the mass measures 15 x 9 x 10 cm. in greatest
dimensions. The mass does not appear to invade through the pleural
surface. The center of the mass is markedly necrotic. The
periphery of the mass is firm,tan and fleshy. The mass comes to
within 0.5 cm. of the bronchial margin. The remainder of the
pulmonary parenchyma is spongy and beefy red. RSD1 — Bronchial
margin; D2—D7 — representative sections of the tumor; D8 -
uninvolved lung parenchyma.

E. Received in formalin, labeled "level 12 lymph node" are

five slightly rubbery gray black tissues ranging from 0.25
to 0.6 cm in greatest dimension which are submitted in toto. AS-1.

F. Received in formalin, labeled "level 7 lymph node" are

three diffusely cauterized rubbery gray black tissues
ranging from 0.6 to 2.8 cm in greatest dimensio The specimens are
entirely submitted in three blocks as labeled.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Two whole tissues; 2 & 3 - sections of largest
tissue.
G. Received in formalin, labeled "level 4 lymph node" are
two rubbery gray black-tan tissues in keeping with lymph
nodes averaging 0.9 cm in greatest dimension. The specimens
ected and entirely submitted independently in two blocks.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

A. The sections of the level 9 lymph node demonstrate 1
lymph node with no evidence of metastatic disease.
B. The rib is unremarkable.
C. Level 11 lymph nodes demonstrate no evidence of
metastasis in 5 lymph nodes.
D. Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma

Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated

Primary tumor (pT): 15 cm., pT3

Margins of resection: Negative

Direct extension of tumor: Not identified.

Venous (large vessel) invasion: Suspicious

Arterial (large vessel) invasion: Suspicious

Lymphatic (small vessel) invasion: Suspicious

Regional lymph nodes (pN): Negative as described in other
specimens (pNO)
Distant metastasis (pM): Can not be evaluated by this

specimen (pMX).
Other findings: None

E. There is no evidence of metastasis in five level 12
lymph nodes. F. There is no evidence of metastasis in
eight level 7 lymph nodes. G. There is no evidence of
metastasis in three level 4 lymph nodes.

DIAGNOSIS
A. Level 9 lymph node, resection:
No evidence of metastasis in one lymph node (0/1).
B. Sixth rib, resection:
Unremarkable bone present.
C. Level 11 lymph nodes, resection:
No evidence of metastasis to 5 lymph nodes (0/5).
D. Lung, right lower lobe, lobectomy:
Adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated, 15 cm. in greatest
dimension, surgical margins uninvolved.
E. Level 12 lymph nodes, resection:
No evidence of metastasis to 5 lymph nodes (0/5).
F. Level 7 lymph nodes, resection:
No evidence of metastasis to 8 lymph nodes (0/8).
G. Level 4 lymph nodes, resection:

No evidence of metastasis to 3 lymph nodes (0/3).
