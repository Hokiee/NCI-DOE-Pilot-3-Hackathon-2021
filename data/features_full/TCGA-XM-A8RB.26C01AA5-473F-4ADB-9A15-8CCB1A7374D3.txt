l.) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled
“Pro—laryngeal nodule" and consists of a tan nodule measuring 2.2 x 2 x 1.6
cm. The specimen is inked black and serially sectioned to reveal tan—pink,
fleshy cut surEaCes. A representative section is submitted for frozen
section. The reminder or the specimen is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
PSC - frozen section control
as - remaining specimen

2) .The specimen is received fresh. labeled "Total thyroidectomy with
substernal extension" and consists of a thyroid weighing 220 g. The right
lobe measures 10x3.5x3.0 cm , the left lobe measures 9.5x5.0x4.0 cm and the
isthmus measures 3xlx0.5 Cm. There is a 3.0x2.5x1.5 cm protruding nodule at
the posterior aspect ot.’ the lett lobe. A 3x1.5x0.5 on skeletal muscle is
seen attached to the anterior surface or right lobe. The external surface is
covered by a thin fibrous capsule. The posterior surface of the specimen is
inked black. and the anterior is inked blue. Sectioning reveals multiple
nodules in both left and right lobes ranging from 0.5 cm to 3.0 cm in
greatest dimension. The nodules show gelatinous cut surface with focal
hemorrhagic and. cystic. yellowish greenish areas. The remaining thyroid
parenchyma is red tan and beefy. There is a 2.0x1.5x0.5 cm lymph node-like
nodule at the isthmus region. Representative sections of the specimen are
submitted.

Summary of sections:

RL - right lobe

LI. - left lobe

IS — isthmus

IAN-bisected node-like nodule

3). The specimen is received fresh for ﬁrozen diagnosis and labeled with
‘12th mass". It consists of a mass with attached fatty adipose tissue
without orientation. The specimen measures 7x5.5x3.5 cm and. is entirely
inked with blue. Serial sectioning reveals a capsulated tumor measuring
5x3x3 cm. The tumor has red yellow tan variegated soft cut surface. The
tumor does not invade the capsule and the surrounding adipose tissue
grossly. The specimen is photographed and submitted to TPS.
Representatively submitted.

4.) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left lobe of thymus" and
consists o! a. unoriented, 16.0 g. 8.9 x 3.2 x 1.2 cm, lobular tragment of
fatty tissue partially surrounded by a thin. focally hemorrhagic and
fragmented. translucent sheath. The surface is inked in black and the
specimen is sectioned to reveal focally hemorrhagic lobules 05 yellow
adipose tissue separated by a thin band 0: tissue. devoid of a grossly
identifiable lesion. Representative sections are submitted.
