taken and the specimen is submitted in toto in FSC1.'
D. 4R LYMPH NODE
Are multiple tan—purple fragments ofsoit tissue aggregating to 1.3 x l 0 x 0.3 cm. Touch preps
are taken and the specimen is submitted in toto in FSD].
E. 2R LYMFH NODE

specimen is submitted in toto in FSE1..
F. 11R LYMPH NODE LOWER LOBE '
Are 3 tan—pink possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 x 0. 4 x 0. 4 cm to 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm. The
specimen is submitted entirely as follows.

F1: 2 possible lymph nodes

F2: largest lymph node trisected
G 11R MIDDLE LOBE '
Are 2 tan-pink lymph nodes, 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm. The specimen is
submitted entirely 1n cassette GI.
H. LEVEL 7
Are 3 tan-pink lymph nodes ranging from 0.6 x 0. 4 x 0 4 cm to 2.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. The specimen
is submitted entirely as follows: '

H1: 2 possible lymph nodes

H2: 1_ lymph node serially sectioned
I. POSTERIOR PARTIAL RIGHT LOWER LOBF, ATTACHMENTS OF TUMOR
Uncriented tan-pink membranous soft tissue fragment, 4.0 x 3.0 X 0.4 cm. The specimen is
serially sectioned and submitted in toto in cassette Il-I3.
J. RIGHT LOWER LOBE
Is a 315 gm right lower lobe measuring 17 x 12 x 4.5 cm. The bronchial margin is shaved and
submitted for frozen section in FSJ l. The pleural surface is red-purple, is remarkable for a gray—
white discolored firm area located at the periphery measuring 9.0 x 8.0 cm. The pleural surface
surrounding this area is inked blue and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a gray-white .
well circumscribed ﬁrm mass with a maximum depth of 3.5 cm, measuring 5.0 cm from the
bronchial margin and abuts the pleural surface. The remainder lung parenchyma' lS red-purple
and grossly unremarkable. 5 possible hilar lymph nodes are identiﬁed, the largest of which
measures 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue
procurement. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

FSJ 1: bronchial margin submitted for frozen section

12-129: entire tumor with adjacent parenchyma and pleural margin

J 30—131 : representative section of uninvolved lung parenchyma

J 32: 5 possible hilar lymph nodes

 

DIAGNOSIS:
A. LYMPH NODE, LEVEL 7 SUBCARINAL, BIOPSY:
— ONE FRAGMENTED LYMPH NODE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (Oll ).

B. LYMPH NODE, 4L, BIOPSY:
- ONE LYMPH NODE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/1).

C. LYMPH NODE, SECOND 4L, BIOPSY:
— ONE FRAGMENTED LYMPH NODE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/1)._

D. LYMPH NODE, 4R, BIOPSY:
- ONE FRAGMENTED LYMPH NODE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/1).

E. LYMPH NODE, 2R, BIOPSY:
— ONE FRAGMENTED LYMPH NODE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/1).

F. LYMPH NODE, 11R LOWER LOBE, BIOPSY:
— THREE LYMPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/3).

G. LYMPH NODE, 11R MIDDLE LOBE, BIOPSY:
- TWO LYMPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/2).

H. LYMPH NODE, LEVEL 7, BIOPSY:
- THREE LYMPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/3).

I. RIGHT LUNG, POSTERIOR PARTIAL LOWER LOEE ATTACHMENTS OF TUMOR,
RESBCTION: '
- PLEURAL AND SOFT TISSUE WITH CHRONIC INELAMMATION AND
FIBROVASCULAR ADHESIONS.
- INCIDENTAL NODULULAR LANGERHANS CELL PROLIEERATION
- SEE COMMENT.
~ NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.

J. RIGHT LUNG, LOWER LOBE, LOBECTOMY:
- INVASIVE, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CELL
CARCINOMA WITH MARKED CLEAR CELL CHANGE.
- TUMOR IS 9.0 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION
- BRONCHIAL MARGIN IS FREE OF TUMOR
— PERITUMORAL OBSTRUCTIVE CHANGES AND INFLAMMATION.
— SUBPLEURAL AND INTERSTITIAL FIBROSIS WITH PLEURAL
FIBROVASCULAR ADHESIONS.

 

 

COMMENT: In the biopsy from the pleura there is a microscopic nodule of Langerhans cells
and accompanying eosinophils. The signiﬁcance of this is not clear, but it is possible that the
patient has an underlying pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH) related to tobacco-use.
There is scarring in the accompanying lung tissue which could be related to this process, but
deﬁnitive evidence of PLCH in the lung is not otherwise seen. -
