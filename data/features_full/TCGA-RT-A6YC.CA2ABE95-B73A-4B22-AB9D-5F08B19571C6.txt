nuclear pleomorphism are noted. Necrosis, capsular invasion, vascular
.invasion and extension into the peri-adrenal adipose tissue are not
identified. Mitotic figures are <3/10 high power fields (HPF). The
Pheochromoeytoma of the Adrenal gland Scaled Score (PASS) for this tumor
would be <4. Tumors with PASS <4 are expected to behave in a benign
fashion. Tumors with PASS 4 have a potential for a biologically aggressive
behavior.
