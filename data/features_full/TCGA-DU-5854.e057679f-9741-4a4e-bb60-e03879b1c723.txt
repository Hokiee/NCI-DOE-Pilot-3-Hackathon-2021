CLiNICAL HISTORY

—
lower

extremities weakness, and more _ On
imaging, -

there is a 2.3 cm patchy, irregularly enhancing lesion involving the
white

matter at the level of the atrium and posterior body of the lateral
. ventricle, 7

and extending to the right paramedian parietal lobe. The lesion has
been _

enlarging recently.

OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
Brain tumor

Operation/Specimen: A: Brain, right parietal lesion, biopsy
B:_Brain, right parietal lesion, biopsy

‘JPATHOLOGICAL‘DIAGNOSIS:
A and B. Brain; right parietal, excisional biopsies:
1. 'AstrocytOma, anaplastic {WHO ill).
2. MIR—1 proliferation index: > 10%.
See Microscopy Description and Comment.

COMMENT

The specimens are cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter in which

ithere is ‘

extensive cautery artefact. The brain tissues are diffusely and
sparsely .to ,

moderately infiltrated by an astrocytic neoplastic proliferation.
There are

no nuclear anaplastic features. There are a handful of mitotic
figures and '

the MIB 1 proliferation index is higher than 10%. There is no
microvascular

cellular proliferation or tumor necrosis.

 

 

The neoplasm is an astrocytoma that infiltrates diffusely the brain

parenchyma
and has mitotic figures, in the absence of microvascular cellular
proliferation or tumor necrosis, i.e. an anaplastic astrocytoma.

Interpretation
I.'POSITIVE: Allelic loss and chromosome arm 19g is detected.

There is partial deletion on chromosome arm lp as evidenced by LOH at

only
D13496 locus

Informative loci are: D18548, Dis5s2, D18496, D198219, D19s412, and
pLA2G4c

,Results—Comménts
‘ Test performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block and
peripheral blood for germline comparison.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA

(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19g. The 3
markers _ .

on 1p are DlSS48, D181592, and D18552 (with D15468, D181612, and
DlS496 as

backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D198219,Dl98412, and
' PLA2G4C

(with D195606 and D1981182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites
(2 Or 4 ‘

nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat)
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score,
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used
if the

first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or
otherwise

ambiguous in‘their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each
- chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas
' with lp
and 19q deletion.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results

from a
stand alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its

performance

results are

provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted

only in _
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.

:I'TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non—neoplastic cells in

MlCROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

IuMnNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates a moderately fibrillary
background. The EMA has a diffuse, tenuous background positive

'. reaction,

 

probably artefactual. The CD163 depicts moderately activated, mostly
perivascular microglia. A majority of neoplastic astrocytes over
express the 7‘

p53_protein.' With the MIBhl there is a proliferation index of about
10%_"' 7 I 1

(including non—neoplastic nuclei).
