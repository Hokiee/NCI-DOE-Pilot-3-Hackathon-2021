Tumor focality: Unifocal.
Gross extent of tumor:

Extension into perinephric tissue: Absent.

Extension beyond Gerota‘s fascia: Absent.

Extension into renal sinus: Not grossly apparent.

Extension into renal vein: Not grossly apparent.

Extension into collecting system: Not grossly apparent.
Adrenal gland: Absent.
Gross notes:

Gross tumor characteristics: Tan-yellow, centrally hemorrhagic,
well-demarcated, solid mass with diffusely soft cut surfaces.

Kidney weight: 43 g.

Kidney dimensions: 5.5 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm.

Distance to margin: The tumor grossly appears to abut the inked
parenchymal margin.

Lymph nodes: Absent.

Inking details: The parenchymal resection margin is inked black
and the margin is designated by the surgeon.

Biorepository sample submitted: Yes, see block key.

Other: Representative sections from.the cut surface of the tumor
are submitted for frozen section in one block.

Block key for specimen A:

A1) Representative sections from cut surface of tumor, submitted for
frozen section.

A2-A4) Additional sections of tumor in relation to inked parenchymal
margin.

A5) Mirror image of tissue submitted for IRB study

A6) Section of tumor in relation to outermost surface (renal
capsule).

use of immunohistochemistry tests that were developed and whose
performance characteristics were determined by
