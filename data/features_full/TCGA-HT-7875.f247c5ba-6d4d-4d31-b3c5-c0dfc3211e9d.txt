Tumor Identifier:
Normal Identifier:

Microscopic Description:

Sections demonstrate a mildly to moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm composed of
cells with round mildly enlarged nuclei and prominent perinuclear halos. The tumor
diffusely infiltrates both gray and white matter. No mitotic figures are identified in 25
high-power fields examined. Neither microvascular proliferation nor necrosis are present.

Addendum Discussion:
A few scattered M[B-1 reactive cells are present. The labeling index is 1.1%, indicative a
modestly proliferative neoplasm and consistent with the low grade histologic features.

Diagnosis:
Low-grade Oligiodendroglioma (who grade II)
MIB-l Labeling Index: 1.2%
