O.R. CONSULTATION:
SPECIMEN LABELED "#8 RIGHT LUNG DIAPHRAGM & PERICARDIUM" (FSA):
Bronchial resection margin, negative for tumor.

 

The senior physician certifies that he/she personally conducted a gross and/or
microscopic examination of the described specimen(s) and rendered or confirmed
the rapid diagnos(es) related thereto.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received fresh, in eight parts, each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.

Part A, "#1. Port site #1", consists of a tan/yellow soft tissue fragment (3.9
x 3.9 x 1.4 cm) with attached skin ellipse (2.6 x 0.5 cm). The specimen
consists of yellow lobulated adipose tissue with a central area of fibrosis
extending from the skin ellipse to the deepest aspect. There are no masses or

lesions identified. Representative sections are submitted for histologic
examination.

Micro Al—AZ: Soft tissue with skin ellipse in A1, 1 frag each, RSS.
Part B, "#2. Rib", consists of a portion of rib (15.2 x 2.1 cm) with attached
red/brown fragments of skeletal muscle. There are no masses or lesions

identified. A rib bone marrow squeeze is submitted for histologic examination.

Micro B1: Rib bone marrow squeeze, multi frags, RSS.

Part C, "#2. Level 2R node", consists of a tan/pink lymph node (1.2 x 0.6 x 0.5
cm). The specimen is entirely submitted for histologic examination.

Micro Cl: Lymph node, 1 frag, ESS.

Part D, "#4. SVC node", consists of a tan/brown/yellow lymph node (1.8 x 0.7 x
0.4 cm). The specimen is entirely submitted for histologic examination.

Micro D1: Lymph node, 1 frag, ESS.

Part E, "#5. Level 8 node", consists of a tan/brown anthracotic lymph node (1.0

x 0.9 x 0.4 cm). The specimen is entirely submitted for histologic
examination.

Micro El: Lymph node, 1 frag, ESS.

Part F, "#6. Level 4R node", consists of a tan/yellow soft tissue fragment (0.6

x 0.4 x 0.2 c ). The specimen is entirely submitted for histologic
examination.

Micro F1: Soft tissue fragment, 1 frag, ESS.

Part G, "#7. Level 7 node", consists of a tan/brown focally anthracotic lymph

node (0.8 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm). The specimen is entirely submitted for histologic
examinatidn.

Micro Gl: Lymph node, 1 frag, ESS.

Part H, "#8. Right lung, diaphragm and pericardium (FS)", consists of a 1518
gram moderately disrupted extrapleural pneumonectomy specimen (31 x 23 x 7.4
cm) including lung (21 x 14 x 5 cm), parietal pleura, pericardium (7 x 6 cm)
and hemidiaphragm (18 x 11 x 1.2 cm). There is a bronchial resection margin
(3.3 cm in length x 2.2 cm in diameter) that is submitted en face for frozen
section analysis as FSA. The parietal pleura is gray/white/brown, moderately
disrupted, and covered with multiple (greater than hundred) partially confluent
tan/white nodules (0.5 to 5.0 cm) up to 0.8 cm in thickness. Tumor is present
close to all pleural resection margins. The visceral pleura contains multiple
(greater than fifty) tan/white partially confluent nodules (up to 1 cm). Tumor
bulges (1.7 cm) into lung parenchyma of all lobes and thickened up to (1.2 cm)
the entire distance of all intralobar septae. The diaphragmatic parietal
pleura is fused (100%) and thickened (1.4 cm) by nodular tumor. The
diaphragmatic margins are grossly free of tumor with the closest approach to
tumor being 0.5 cm from the anterior margin. The tumor invades to a depth of
0.2 cm into the muscle of diaphragm, but the inferior surface is free of tumor.
There are mild emphysematous changes in the peripheral lung parenchyma. There
are three firm anthracotic hilar lymph nodes, the largest measuring 1.3 cm in
greatest dimension.

Micro H1: Bronchial resection margin, en face, FSA remnant, l frag, ESS.
Micro H2: Apical parietal pleural margin, 1 frag, RSS.

Micro H3: Medial parietal pleural margin, 1 frag, RSS.

Micro H4: Lateral parietal pleural margin, 1 frag, RSS.

Micro H5: Anterior parietal pleural margin, 1 frag, RSS.

Micro H6: Posterior parietal pleural margin, 1 frag, RSS.

Micro H7: Medial diaphragm margin, 1 frag, RSS.

Micro H8: Lateral diaphragm margin, 1 frag, RSS.

Micro H9: Anterior diaphragm margin, 1 frag, RSS.

Micro H10: Posterior diaphragm margin, 1 frag, Rss.

Micro H11: Diaphragm, deepest extent of tumor, 1 frag, RSS.

Micro H12: Tumor and intralobar septae, 1 frag, RSS.

Micro Hl3-Hl4: Tumor extension into lung parenchyma, 1 frag each, RSS.
Micro H15: Uninvolved upper lobe, l frag, RSS.

Micro H16: Uninvolved lower lobe, 1 frag, RSS.

Micro H17: Pericardium with closest extension of tumor to pericardial surface,
1 frag, RSS.

Micro H18: Hilar lymph nodes, 3 frags, ESS.

Part I, "#9. Level 8 node #2", consists of tan/brown/yellow soft tissue
fragment (3.0 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm). The specimen is entirely submitted for
histologic examination.

Micro I1: Soft tissue fragment, 1 frag, ESS.

By his/her signature below, the senior physician certifies that he/she
personally conducted a microscopic examination ("gross only" exam if so stated)

of the described specimen(s) and rendered or confirmed the diagnosis(es)
related thereto.
