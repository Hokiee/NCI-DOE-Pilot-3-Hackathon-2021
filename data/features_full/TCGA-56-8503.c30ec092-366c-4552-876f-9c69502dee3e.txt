CLINICAL INFORMATION

SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPTION

A) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, interlobar

Labeled "level 11 interlobar lymph node" are two black anthracotic 0.5 to
0,9 cm soft tissue fragments. The specimen is entirely submitted in one
cassette

B) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, level 11
Labeled "level 11 lymph node” is a 1 cm partially anthracotic lymph node.
The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.

C) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, level 7 suboarinal

Labeled "level 7 lymph node subcarinal" are four fragmented partially
anthracotic lymph node fragments ranging from 0.7 to 2 cm in greatest
dimension. The nodes are entirely submitted in four cassettes as follows:
C1. Two nodes

C2. One node sectioned

CB—C4. Largest node sectioned

D) SOURCE: Lung, right lower lobe with en bloc chest wall resection
Received fresh labeled ”right lower lobe with en bloc chest wall resection"
consists of a right lower lobe measuring 18 x 10 x 5,8 cm with attached
ribs 8. 9, and 10 anteriorly. The anterior soft tissue of the chest wall
resection is inked orange, the anterior margins of the bone green, and
posterior bone margins red. Beneath the ribs is a palpable lesion extending
to the pleural surface, in both the anterior and posterior aspects. The
pleura overlying this mass is inked black. The resection margin displays
tan-pink tumor at the margin but not attached to the bronchus. The
bronchial margin is taken en face and submitted on chuck 1 for frozen
section diagnosis.

INTRAOPERATEVE PATHOLO ION WiTH FROZEN SECTION: "Bronchial
margin negative“ is rendered by -

  

A tan-pink 1 org lymph node is found and is Cohsi‘idered level 12 per surgeon.
One additional‘OS cm lymph node is found at the hilum. The tumor is
sectioned from posterior to anterior revealing a mostly well-circumscribed
focally necrotic tumor mass measuring 5 x 4 x 3.8 cm. The tumor appears to
attach to the posterior soft tissue of the intercostai muscle but does not
appear to invade into the bone. The tumor is 2 cm from the nearest bony
resection margin which is the anterior aspect of rib 9. It extends to the
pleural surface both anterior and posteriorly but does not extend through

it. The anterior ribs and soft tissue are removed and the subsequent
underlying tissue of both the ribs and the tumor are inked yellow. It

appears that the tumor is firmly adherent to rip 9 and the intercostal soft
tissue between ribs 8—9 and 9-10. The ribs 8 and 10 appear to be detached
from the tumor. The anterior chest wall resection is removed from the lung
and each aspect has been inked yellow. The anterior and posterior bone
margins of the ribs are taken en face. Sections are taken of the bone at
number 9 where the tumor was attached most firmly revealing the tumor to
extend through the parietal pleura and does not appear to invade the
periosteum of the bone in rib number 9. Tumor does not appear to be within
the soft tissue proper of the intercostal soft tissue. There is a dense
desmoplastic 1 cm rind “ffd’caily at the tumor, Eib number 9 junction.

The remainder of the parenchyma is tan-pink and spongy with moderate
anthracosis. No additional satellite lesions are seen. Note that tissue is
taken for possible ancillary studies.

Note: A photograph is taken.
Representative sections are submitted in 22 cassettes labeled:

1. Frozen section bronchial resection margin

2. Level 12 lymph node sectioned

3. One additional hilar lymph node bisected

4. Vascular margin

5—9. Representative tumor to area of rib (yellow ink) and pleura (black
ink)

10-12. Full thickness rib number 9 from area of tumor attachment to
anterior soft tissue margin (orange ink)

13. Rib 8 anterior margin

14. Rib 9 anterior margin

15. Rib 10 anterior margin

16. Rib 8 posterior margin

1?. Rib 9 posterior margin

18. Rib 10 posterior margin

19-20. Longitudinal section of bronchus immediately after frozen section

3 to include turgur
21—22. Random p renchyma remote from tumor.

Note that 10-18 will be decalcified.

E) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy. level 9
Labeled "level 9 lymph node" is a tan~gray partialiy anthracotic lymph node
which is sectioned and entirely submitted in a single cassette.

F) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, peri esophageal
Labeled ”periesophageal lymph node” is a 1 cm partially anthracotic lymph
node which is sectioned. The specimen is submitted in toto in one cassette.

 

G) SOURCE: Lymph node biops’f level 10 R:
Labeled "10 R lymph node“ is a s ngle fragmented 0.7 cm anthracotic lymph

 

node. The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.

H):SOURCE Lymph node bi iopsy, level 4R
Labeled "4R level lymph node" are two separate yellow-tan focally red—black
tissues, 1.8 x 1 x 0.7 cm in aggregate, disclosing three apparent lymph
nodes ranging from 0.5 to 0.9 cm in greatest dimension. The largest lymph
node includes a small amount of attached fat. Entirely submitted in two
cassettes as follows:

1. One sectioned lymph node
2. Two lymph nodes, in toto.
