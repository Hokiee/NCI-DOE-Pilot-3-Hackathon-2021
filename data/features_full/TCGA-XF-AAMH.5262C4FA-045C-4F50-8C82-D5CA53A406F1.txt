GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labelled "Right distal
ureter F/S." It consists of a segment of ureter measuring 0.2 x 0.4 cm. The
specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in cassette AFS.

B: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labelled "Left distal
ureter F/S." It consists of a segment of ureter measuring 0.3 x 0.5 cm. The
specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in cassette BFS.

C: The specimen is received fresh from the 0.R. and labelled “Right common
iliac lymph nodes." It consists of two nodes, one measuring 3.5 x 2 x 0.8 cm,

and the other measuring 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. The entire specimen is embedded for
frozen section in cassette CFS.

D: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labelled “Urethral margin
F/S.“ It consists of a fragment of pink-tan tissue measuring 2.2 x 0.9 x 0.4
cm. The entire speCimen.is submitted for frozen section in cassette DFS.

E: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labelled "Urinary bladder &
prostate." It consists of a cystoprostatectomy specimen with overall
measurements of 14 X 10.5 x 4.5 cm. The peritoneum measures 251x 10.7 cm and is
pink—tan to gray and unremarkable. The right distal ureter measures 6.4 cm in
length and is 0.7 cm in circumference, and the left distal ureter measures 3.0
cm in length and 1.7 cm in circumference and appears slightly ragged and
erythematous. The bladder measures 8 x 6 cm and measures 1.7 cm in thickness.
In the left posterior wall of the bladder is a pink—tan, fungating tumor
measuring 4.5 x 3.4 cm. The tumor grossly appears to measure 2.6 cm in
thickness and appears to invade into the surrounding perivesical fatty tissue.
The tumor abuts the ureterovesical junction but does not appear to invade into
the left ureter. The remaining bladder mucosa is pink—tan and slightly
erythematous. The prostate measures 4 x 3 x 2.7 cm with an enlarged median bar
measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. The prostatic urethra measures 2.2 cm in length
and 1.3 cm in circumference and the verumontanum measures 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm.
The left seminal vesicle measures 4.7 x 2.2 cm, and the right seminal vesicle
measures 4.5 x 1.6 cm. Serial sections of the prostate show pale tan parenchyma
with a hypertrophic nodule in the left lobe,‘measuring 2.5 cm in greatest
dimension. Representative sections are submitted in 15 cassettes.

F: The specimen is received in formalin and labelled "Aortic bifurcation lymph
nodes." It consists of a fragment of yellow fatty tissue measuring 3.5 x 2 x
0.5 cm. The entire specimen is submitted in one cassette.

G: The specimen is received.in formalin and labelled "Right node of cloquet."
It consists of a rubbery to firm, pink—tan lymph node measuring 1.4 x 0.9 x 0.7

cm. Bivalving the lymph node reveals a pink—tan, smooth, homogeneous cut
surface. The entire specimen is submitted in one cassette.

H: The specimen is received in formalin and labelled "Right obturator /
hypogastric lymph nodes." It consists of multiple fragments of yellow adipose
tissue measuring in aggregate 8.4 x 7.5 x 1.7 cm. Multiple lymph nodes are
palpated. the largest measurin? 2.4 cm in greatest dimension and containing a

pink-tan, smooth, homogeneous cut surface. Representative sections are
submitted in six cassettes.

I: The specimen is received in formalin and labelled "Left obturator /
hypogastric lymph nodes.“ It consists of mutliple fragments of yellow adipose
tissue measuring in aggregate 8 x 6.5 x 1.7 cm. Multiple lymph nodes are
palpated, the largest measuring 2.3 cm in greatest dimension and containing a
pink-tan, smooth, homogeneous cut surface. Representative sections are
submitted in eight cassettes.

J: The specimen is received in formalin and labelled "Left proximal ureter."
It consists of a segment of ureter measuring 1 x 1 cm. The entire specimen is
submitted in one cassette.

K: The specimen is received in formalin and labelled "Right proximal ureter."
It consists of a segment of ureter measuring 1.2 cm in length and 0.6 cm in
diameter. The entire specimen is Submitted in one cassette.

COMMENT

Sections confirm the gross impression that this tumor is through the wall and
into perivesical fat . This is an interesting tumor in that there is rather
extensive vascular space invasion in sections from the left side of the specimen
as well as the prostatic urethra.
