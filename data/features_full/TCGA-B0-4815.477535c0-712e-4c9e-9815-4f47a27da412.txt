FINAL DIAGNOSIS
KIDNEY, LEFT, RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY —-
. POORLY DIFFERENTIATED RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (7.9X7.2X4.0 CM).
. FUHRMAN GRADE IS 3-4I'4.
. TUMOR PENETRATES RENAL CAPSULE AND EXTENDS INTO THE PERINEPHRIC FAT
. RENAL ARTERY, RENAL VEIN, AND URETERAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR.
. MARGINS 0F SURGICAL RESECTION 'ARE FREE OF TUMOR.

NO ANGIOLYMPHATIC 0R PERINEURAL INVASION ARE IDENTIFIED.
PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE T3a NX MX.

Final Diagnosis
POLYP, STOMACH, ENDOSCOPIC BIOPSY-

iLL CARCINOMA, MOST LIKELY TO BE METASTATIC (SEE COMMENT)

Comment:
Biopsies show atypical clear cells in the mucosa. Given patient’s previous history of renal cell carcinoma, current biopsy ‘

is most likely to be a metastatic carcinoma. Special stains are pending to confirm its renal origin.

Tumor cells are immunoreactive with cams. 2 vimentin CD10 and EMA iv for RCC, 0K7, CK20, and CDX2. Ab0ve
pe is compatible with a metastatic renal cell carcinoma. vieWed the case and concurs.

1. LEFT SHOULDER, BIOPSY OF BONE LESION: ‘
METASTATIC CLEAR CELL CARCINOMA CONSISTENT WITH RENAL ORIGIN, SMAL’L FOCl.

2. LEFT SHOULDER, BIOPSY OF BONE LESION:
METASTATIC CLEAR CELL CARCINOMA, CONSISTENT WITH RENAL ORIGIN.

3. LEFT SHOULDER, BIOPSY OF BONE LESION:
METASTATIC CLEAR CELL CARCINOMA, CONSISTENT WITH RENAL ORIGIN.

Comment:
On immunohistcchemistry, tumor cells are strongly positive for low moiecuiar weight cytokeratin and vimentin. and focally for EMA..

Histological features and immunoproﬁles are consistent with a renal clear cell carcinoma.
