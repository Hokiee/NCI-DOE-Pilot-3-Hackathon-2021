Clinical Notes: ,
Paraganglioma. A) Fresh tissue saved for tissue

bank.

Diagnosis:
A. Right adrenal gland, excision:
— Adrenal cortical adenoma (1.8 cm).

— Paraganglioma (2.2 cm).

Gross:

A. The specimen is labeled "right adrenal and
paraganglioma." Received fresh in and transferred

to formalin is a 46.2 gram, 10.5 x 5.5 x 1.5 cm, adrenal
gland with attached yellow lobulated adipose tissue. The
outer surface is inked black and the specimen is serially
sectioned to reveal a well encapsulated 1.8 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm
soft yellow—tan nodule attached to a 4.5 x 2.4 x 0.6 cm
adrenal gland with grossly unremarkable yellow cortex. The
central tan medulla appears slightly expanded. Additionally

within the yellow lobulated adipose tissue there is a 2.2 x
1.6 x 1.3 cm soft, pink to slightly orange, well-
circumscribed, soft nodule. Representative sections are
submitted as follows:

Cassette Designation:

Accession #:

Al—3 Adrenal nodule
AQ-S Nodule in adipose tissue
A6~8 Adrenal gland

Microscopic:
A histological examination has been performed.

A. Sections show a diffusely enlarged adrenal gland with
expanded medulla and a 1.8 cm nodule predominantly composed
of clear cells resembling zona fasciculata cells, consistent
with adrenal cortical adenoma. There is no evidence of
increased mitoSes, necrosis, or capsular or vascular
invasion. Additionally, there is a 2.2 cm nodule within the
adjacent adipose tissue. Sections show an unremarkable
ganglion with an adjacent well circumscribed lesion composed
of nests and trabeculae of bland cells with abundant
granular cytoplasm and round nuclei with coarse chromatin
within a rich, vascular network. Immunostains for
Synaptophysin and Chromogranin Show positive staining within
the tumor cells while S—lOO protein highlights the
sustentacular cell network. There is no evidence of
increased mitoses, necrosis, or vascular or capsular
invasion.
