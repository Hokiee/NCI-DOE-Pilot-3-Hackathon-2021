CLINICAL HISTORY

Metastatic meIanoma, right ainIa; unknown primary.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

1. LabeIed "pigmented Iesion, right posterior shouIder": The specimen consists of
a tan

skin eIIipse. Short stitch marking anterior and Iong stitch marking IateraI aspect
are

notedk The anterior aspect wiII be designated 12 o'cIock and the IateraI aspect 3
o'c oc .

The specimen measures 5.5 (12 to 6 o'cIock) by 2.0 (3 to 9 o'cIock) by 0.9 cm. The

0 'cIogk aspect is marked with bIack ink and the 9 o‘cIock aspect with que ink.
Centra y
there is an irreguIarIy shaped unevenIy pigmented Iesion which measures 1.2 (3 to 9

f0 'cIock) by 1.2 (12 to 6 o 'cIock dimension). The specimen is seriaIIy embedded
rom

anterior to posterior in cassettes A through E.

2. LabeIed "right ainIary contents": The specimen consists of a fat pad which
mIgsng?2.5 x 4.0 cm. At one end of the specimen there is a tan skin eIIipse which
migsgrgs3'5 cm. It has a recentIy sutured IongitudinaI incision which measures 6.5
cTehnth. At the opposite end of the specimen there is a stitch marking highest
:E§d§:;:The undersurface is fascia with some tags of skeIetaI muscIe. Deep aspect

prev1oust incised reveaIing a previoust bisected tan tumorous noduIe which
measures 1.8

cm in greatest dimension. Contiguous with this noduIe is a muItinoduIar matted

tumorous _ .

mass which measures 1.5 cm 1n greatest d1mension. Sectioning deep to the skin
e 1pse

revegIs an indurated poorIy defined area which varies in coIor from tan to yeIIow
to re

and measures 4.0 x 2.5 x 3.0 cm. It abuts the deep aspect of the specimen.
