Clinical History

The patient is a year~old woman with a history of biopsy-proven low-grade invasive and in situ ductal
carcinoma ( ‘) who undergoes left breast needle-localized lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node
sampling.

Gross Description
The specimen is received fresh in ﬁve parts each labeled with the patient's name and unit number.

Part A is additionally labeled ‘ _. it consists of one soft, pink-yellow, irregular,
glistening, unoriented, fibroadipose tissue fragment that is 2.8 x 1.8 x 0.9 cm. The specimen is entirely
submitted for frozen section. The frozen remnant is entirely submitted in cassette A1.

Part B is additionally labeled , , _ .. a ' It consists of one soft, pink—yellow,
irregular, glistening, unoriented, ﬂbroadipose tissue fragment that is 3 x 2.5 x 0.7 cm.A single large lymph
node candidate is identiﬁed, bisected, and entirely submitted for intraopera 've consultation with the
remnant submitted in cassette Bl. The remaining adipose tissue is submitted in cassette B2.

Part C is additionally labeled ' " It consists of a lumpectomy specimen measuring 5.4
cm from superior to inferior, 6.4 cm from medial to lateral and 2.6 cm from anterior to posterior. The
specimen has been oriented with a long black surgical indicating the lateral position and a short black
surgical suture indicating the superior position. The specimen is coronally sectioned from medial to
lateral into 13 slices to reveal diffusely white-yellow breast parenchyma with an apparent biopsy site
cavity extending from slices 7 through 10 and measuring 2.6 cm from superior to inferior, 4.4 cm from
medial to lateral and 2.4 cm from anterior to posterior. The specimen is inked as follows for microscopic
evaluation of surgical margins: Anterior-superior black-yellow, anterior—inferior green and posterior
black. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Cassette Cl: Slice 1 (medial margin), perpendicular.
Cassette 02: Slice 3.
Cassette C3: Slice 4, inferior.

Procedure/Addenda for
ADDENDUM. Date of Addendum.:

 

Addendum Comment
An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as for HER2 was performed
on block A1.

The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells.
The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >90% of tumor cells.
Result of HERQ/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over-expression.

An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the C811 monoclonal antibody to HERZ/neu
oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3.

Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HERZ/neu oncoprotein.

Those with a staining intensity score 01'2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining
intensity scores of 2 do not show gene ampliﬁcation. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for
FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory.

Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over~expression of HERZ/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this
category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene
ampliﬁcation.
