Breast, right, simple mastectomy: Invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade III (of III), is identiﬁed forming a 1.7 x 1.3 x 1.0

cm tumor (AJCC pTlc) in the upper outer region of the breast. The deep and lateral margins of resection are negative for tumor.

The closest margin is deep and is free by 2.8 cm. The overlying skin and nipple are negative for involvement by carcinoma.

Lymph nodes, left axillary sentinel, excision: Multiple (2) left axillary sentinel lymph nodes, both containing blue dye, are
negative for metastatic carcinoma [(AJCC pNO (i-)]. Immunohistochemical cytokeratin stain was performed on the parafﬁn
embedded sentinel lymph node tissue and conﬁrms the H&E impression.

Lymph nodes, right axillary sentinel, excision: Multiple (4) right axillary sentinel lymph nodes are negative for tumor [(AJCC
pNO) (i-)]. A single lymph node (1A) contains blue dye. Immunohistochemical cytokeratin stains were performed on the parafﬁn
embedded sentinel lymph node tissue and conﬁrm the H&E impression.

Her-2/NEU has been ordered on parafﬁn-embedded tissue on the left breast.
