SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

* Addendum *

  

clinical Diagnosis a History: 5 .
.4.
Myxofibrosarcoma of right axilla.

Specimens Submitted:
1: Level 3 lymph node right axilla (fs)
2: Radical resection right axillary sarcoma

DIAGNOSIS :

1. Lymph node, level 3, right axilla: excision:
- Five benign lymph nodes (0/5) .

2. Axillary sarcoma, right, radical resection:

— Myxofihrosarcoma, high grade, involving adipose tissue and skeletal
muscle.

- Tumor measures 12.5 x 1.1.6 3: 7.2 cm.

- Myxoid changes comprise about 80-85%

- Necrosis is present in 10-20%.

- One benign lymph node (0/1)

- Tumor is seen less than 1mm from lateral (skeletal muscle) and 1mm
from axillary margin (adipose tissue). other margins are negative.

~ Negative skin.

Note:'rumor is multinodular and shows both low and high grade areas and the

low grade component tracks along septal planes and seen close to above
specified margins.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED

Gross Description:

1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen consultation. labeled “Level 3
lymph node'I and consists of a red tan fatty tissue fragment measuring 3.5 x
2.1 x 1cm. Five lymph nodes ranging in diameter from 0.5 cm to 1.5cm were
identified. All lymph nodes were submitted in 2 cassettes.

Summary of sections:

FSC1_l frozen section control (3 lymph nodes; 1 large bisected and 2 small
inked black)

FSC1_2 Frozen section control (2 Lymph nodes: each bisected, inked black)

2) The specimen is received fresh, labeled “Radical resection right
axillary sarcoma", and consists of an irregular adipose tissue. measuring
13.2 x 12.5 x 7.6 cm. A piece of tan skin is covered with one surface,
measuring 7.5 x 6.2 on. Long stitch is designated as lateral margin and
inked black: medial margin is inked green. Short stitch is designated as
axillary margin and inked orange, white long stitch is designated as
thoracic dorsal margin and inked red/orange; white short stitch is
designated as latissimus margin and inked yellow; blue short stitch is
designated as superficial and inked blue; blue long stitch is designated as
skin margin lateral and inked red/black. Inferior margin is uninked. The
specimen is serially sectioned and cut surface reveals myxoid, white-yellow
mass, measuring 12.5 x 11.6 x 7.2, with focal hemorrhage and necrosis. The
representative sections of the margins and tumor are submitted. TPS and
photos are taken.
