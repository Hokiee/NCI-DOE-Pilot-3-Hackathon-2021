Right eye enucleation

Macroscopy

Microscopy

The tumor described macroscopically correspond to a melanoma. It is made mostly of
fusiform cells with ovale nucleus most often nucleolated. Mitotic ﬁgures are present (4
mitosis by 10 ﬁelds at the 400 magniﬁcation).Absence of necrosis or microcalciﬁcation.The
tumor is developed immediately behind the ciliary body which is sometimes inﬁltrated. The
internal third of the sclera is inﬁltrated. The iris and the anterior chamber as well as the optic
nerve on its entire course and the meningeal sheaths are free.

Conclusion

Melanoma with fusiform cells developed behind the ciliary body which is inﬁltrated
sometimes on the entire thickness.

Size ofthe tumor: 16 mm main line
Extension to the internal third of the sclera without extrascléral extension

The iris and the anterior chamber as well as the optic nerve on its entire course and the
meningeal sheaths are free.
