Gross Description:

Received are five containers labeled with the patient's name. The first two
containers are received without formalin for frozen section. The
remaining three containers are received with formalin.

The ﬁrst is labeled "A, left distal ureter FS" and contains a full thickness

cross section of apparent ureter measuring 0.4 cm in diameter and 0.3 cm in
length with a small amount of associated fat. The specimen is submitted in toto
for frozen section diagnosis with the residue now resubmitted for permanent
section in cassette A1 .

The second container is labeled "B, right distal ureter" and contains a short
segment of apparent ureter measuring 1.2 cm in length with an average diameter
of 0.6 cm. One aspect is tagged with a suture. A representative section is
submitted for frozen section diagnosis with the residue now resubmitted for
permanent section in cassette B1. The remaining tissue is now serially
sectioned and submitted entirely in cassette 82.

The third container is labeled "anterior exenteration" and contains an anterior
exenteration specimen including the urinary bladder, which measures 5.5 x 4.5 x
3.2 cm, the uterus which measures 7.2 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm and an excision of vaginal
cuff surrounding the cervix measuring 5.2 x 3.8 cm in area. The soft tissue
surfaces overlying the bladder are inked black. The irregular resection margins
surrounding the vaginal cuff are inked blue. The specimen is opened
longitudinally revealing a papillary tumor involving the approximate midline
trigone area of the bladder mucosa, measuring 1.4 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm. Adjacent to
the right of the tumor is an area of previous fulguration measuring 2.0 x 1.9 cm
in area. Combined, these two areas measure 2.9 cm in greatest dimension.
Sectioning of this area reveals gross invasion to a depth of 1.0 cm at a

distance of 0.2 cm from the inked posterior soft tissue surface. The mass does
not grossly appear to invade the uterine cervix or other structures.

 

Representative sections of the bladder are submitted in the following manner:
C1 urethral margin;
C2 12 to 3 o' clock vaginal cuff mucosa margin;
CS 3 to 6 o' clock vaginal cuff mucosa margin;
C4 6 to 9 o' clock vaginal cuff mucosa margin;
C5 9 to 12 o' clock vaginal cuff mucosa margin;
C6-7 relationship of mass to vaginal mucosa;
C8-11 mass with deepest invasion in right posterior soft tissue;
C12 bladder dome;
C13 left bladder wall.

The uterine ectocervix is pink-tan, smooth and glistening with no grossly
suspicious lesions. The endocervix is pink-tan and velvety with a few small
cystic spaces on the cut surface containing mucoid material. Sectioning of the
myometrium reveals an average endometrial thickness of 0.3 cm and an average
myometrial thickness of 1.0 cm. There are no grossly suspicious endometrial or
myometrial lesions. The left ovary measures 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm and has a
cerebriform outer surface. The attached segment of fallopian tube includes the
fimbriated end and measures 3.0 cm with an average diameter of 0.6 cm.
Sectioning of both the left adnexal structures reveals no grossly suspicious
lesions. The ovarian cut surface is white-tan and homogeneous. The right

Representative sections from the uterus are submitted in the following manner:
C14 anterior cervix;
C15 posterior cervix;
C16 anterior full thickness endomyometrium;
C17 posterior full thickness endomyometrium;
C18 left adnexal structures;
C19 right adnexal structures.

The paravesical fat is trimmed and subjected to chemical clearing and Carnoy' 3
solution prior to exhaustive lymph node search, which reveals a few small
possible lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.2 to 0.3 cm in greatest dimension.
The nodes are submitted entirely in cassettes C20 and 021.

The fourth container is labeled "D, right pelvic nodes" and contains two strips

of yellow-tan lobulated fatty tissue measuring 4.2 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm and 3.5 x 1.5

x 0.6 cm. The specimen is subjected to chemical clearing in Carnoy' s solution
prior to lymph node search, which reveals two gross lymph nodes measuring 1.4
and 3.5 cm in greatest dimension.

The specimen is submitted entirely in the following manner:

D1 largest lymph node bisected;
D2 one lymph node bisected;
D3-4 remaining fatty tissue.

The fifth container is labeled "E, left pelvic lymph nodes" and contains a

single fragment of yellow-tan lobulated fatty tissue measuring 4.5 x 1.8 x 1.8
cm. The specimen is subjected to chemical clearing with Carnoy' 3 solution
prior to exhaustive lymph node search, which reveals three grossly identifiable
lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.4 to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension.

The specimen is submitted entirely in the following manner:
E1 two whole small lymph nodes;
E2-3 one large lymph node bisected;
E4-5 remaining fatty tissue.

Microscopic Description:
The ﬁnal diagnosis of each specimen incorporates the microscopic examination
