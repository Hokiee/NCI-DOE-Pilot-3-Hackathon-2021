.. SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT '

Gross Description;

The specimens are received in seven containers of formalin, each
labelled with the patient’s name. The first specimen container is
labeled "FSl, ovary, left." It contains two unoriented fragments

Measuring 2.0 x 2.0 x 0.2 cm in aggregate. Labeled

The second specimen container is labeled "X1, ovary, left.” It
contains a previously opened and fixed ovary with attached
fallopian tube. The ovary measures 5.0 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm. The
serosal surface is light blue, glistening, and smooth except for
areas where there are well circumscribed yellow, firm nodules
suspicious for tumor studding ranging in size from 0.2 to 0.5 cm
in greatest dimension. Sections demonstrate a multilobular
cavity, measuring 1.5 cm in greatest dimension, containing clear
fluid lined by a tan, smooth wall except for areas containing
papillary excrescences ranging in size from 0.2 to 1.3 cm in
greatest dimension. The excrescences are yellow, firm, and well
circumscribed. Labeled XlA to XlE — left ovary. The attached left
fallopian tube measures 5.5 cm in length with an external diameter
of 0.6 cm. The serosal surface is pale blue, smooth and
glistening except for several areas where there are well
circumscribed, firm, yellow nodules suspicious for tumor studding
ranging in size from 0.2 to 0.6 cm in dimension. Sections
demonstrate an unobstructed lumen lined by white tissue. However,
there grossly appears to be encroachment of the fallopian tube
W serosal surface by tumor. Labeled XlF - fallopian tube.

The third specimen container is labeled "tumor.“ It contains
multiple, unoriented fragments of firm, yellow tissue admixed with
hemorrhage measuring 8.0 x 4.0 x 3.0 cm.

The fourth specimen container is labeled "uterus, cervix, and
right salpingo—oophorectomyi" It contains a uterus with attached
right ovary and fallopian tube weighing 140.0 grams and measuring
9.0 cm fundus to ectocervix, 5.5 cm cornu to cornu, and 4.5 cm
anterior to posterior. There are numerous leiomyomas distorting
the serosal surface ranging in size from 0.5 to 1.6 cm. Sections
demonstrate white, firm, whorled tissue without gross evidence of
necrosis, softening or hemorrhage. There are numerous fibrinous
adhesions covering the posterior serosa of the cervix. However,
there is a single area measuring 1.0 cm in greatest dimension
suspicious for tumor studding on the deep posterior paracervical
soft tissue. The ectocervix measures 4.0 x 2.5 cm. It is light
tan, glistening, and smooth. There is a horizontal 05 with a
diameter of 0.3 cm. The endocervical canal is light tan and has a
length of 3.5 cm. The myometrium is tan, trabeculated, and has a
thickness of 2.0 cm. It is distorted by numerous leiomyomas
ranging in size from 0.3 to 2.2 cm in greatest dimension. Sections
demonstrate firm, whorled, well circumscribed tissue without gross
evidence of necrosis, softening, or hemorrhage. The endometrium
is light tan, has a thickness of less than 0.1 cm and measures 3.0
_cm cornu to cornu and 4.5 cm fundus to endocervical canal. The
attached right ovary measures 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. The serosal
surface has fibrinous adhesions as well as a single well
circumscribed firm, yellow area suspicious for tumor studding
measuring 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. Sections demonstrate a
unilocular cystic cavity containing clear fluid measuring 1.2 cm
in greatest dimension. It is surrounded by white ovarian
parenchyma. There is a single excrescence in the cystic cavity
measuring 0.2 cm in greatest dimension. The attached right
fallopian tube measures 2.5 cm in length with an external diameter
of 0.6 cm. There are several fibrinous areas ranging in size from
0.1 to 0.2 cm.in greatest dimension of suspicious for adhesions
on the serosal surface. Sections demonstrate an unobstructed
lumen lined by white tissue. Labeled CXl ~ anterior cervix; CX2 —
posterior cervix, including area suspicious for serosal tumor
studding; EMl — anterior endometrium including myometrial
leiomyoma; EMZ - posterior endometrium.including subserosal
leiomyoma. Labeled ROI through R04 — right over . Submitted in
toto; RTl and RT2 — right fallopian tube. i

The fifth specimen container is labeled "bladder tumor." It
contains multiple unoriented fragments of white and yellow firm
tissue admixed with yellow adipose tissue and hemorrhage measuring
7.0 x 5.0 x 1.5 cm in aggregate.

The sixth specimen container is labeled "omentum." It contains an

unoriented segment of tissue measuring 15.0 x 15.0 x 1.0 cm.
Replacing 95% of the tissue is white, firm tissue suspicious for
tumor.

The seventh specimen container is labeled "appendix." It contains
an appendix with a stapled base measuring 3.2 cm in length with a
diameter of 0.6 cm. It has a small portion of mesoappendix
attached measuring 4.0 x 0.3 X 0.3 cm. The serosal surface has
hemorrhage, but otherwise it is unremarkable. Sections
demonstrate a lumen lined by white tissue. In some portions of
the lumen there is fecal matter. A lengitudinal section is taken
of the tip and shave sections are taken of the base and the middle
of the specimen.
