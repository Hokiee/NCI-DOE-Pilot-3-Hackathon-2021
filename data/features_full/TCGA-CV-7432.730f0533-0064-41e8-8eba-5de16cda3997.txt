GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) UPPER AND MID JUGULAR NODES, HEMOSTAT SUPERIOR — A fragment of adipose
tissue (5.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm) containing sixteen lymph nodes ranging in size
from 0.2 to 1.8 cm. Lymph nodes are serially dissected from superior to

inferior and submitted in A1-A12, in order.
SECTION CODE: Al—A9, A12, Sin le lymph node in e
small lymph nodes; All, three smal? lymph nodes.
*Fs/DX: PERIPHERAL NERVE, NO TUMOR PRESENT.
(3) LEFT MANDIBULAR NERVE, HEMOSTAT PROXIMAL - A strip 0 nerve tissue (3.0 x
0.3 x 0.3 cm) with hemostat designating proximal margin. The distal margin is
inked black and is taken for frozen_section en face with the adjacent nerve in

ette; A10, three

  
 

longitudinal. The proximal d red and the remaining tissue is
totally submitted in 32.
(C) TONGUE MARGIN, HEMOSTAT MARGIN INKED - An irregular strip

of tongue tissue (5.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm)’with hemostat designating anterior. The
new margin is preViously inked by surgeon.
INK CODE: Anterior—red, posterior—yellow, deep—black, previously inked.

SECTION CODE: C1—C4, new margin en face for frozen section terior to
posterior; C5—C6, random mucosal s permanent. d

*Fs/Dx: No TUMOR PRESENT.
(D) BUCCAL MUCOSAL MARGIN, HEMOSTAT ANTERIOR — A strip of red—tan mucosa (4.0
x 1.0 x 1.0 cm) wdth hemostat designating anterior.
INK CODE: Anterior—red, posterior-yellow, deep—black. q
.SECTION CODE: D1—D3 margin, en face, anterior to posterior, or rozen
section.

*Fs/Dx: NO TUMOR PRESENT. W _
(E) ANTERIOR TONSILLAR PILLAR MA TAT ANTERIOR — A strip of red—tan

,

mucosa (2.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm) with a hemostat designating anterior.

INK CODE: Anterior—red, posterior—yellow, deep-black.

SECTION CODE: E2, margin, en face for frozen section, anterior to
posterior.

*FS/DX: NO TUMOR PRESENT. _
(F) TUMOR HEMIMANDIBLE AND SUBMANDIBULAR TRIANGLE - Tumor and soft tissue
(6.0 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm) with contiguous submandibular triangle (5.0 X 4.0 x 1.0
cm and portion of left hemimandible (compOSite hemimandibulectomy) (7.0 x 3.0
x 1.0 cm). Overl ing mucosa on the soft tissue measures 5.0 x 1.0 cm.

A crescent shape centrally ulcerated tumor is present on the mucosal ’
surface, it measures 3.0 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm and has pus ing borders, but there is
no definite invasion into the submandibular triangle. The tumor is whitefgray
with a vague lobulated appearance. The margins have been preViously examined
by frozen section. _ _ .

Five possible lymph nodes ranging in Size from 0.5 to 0.8 cm are .
dissected. The portion of mandible is grossly unremarkable. The bone iS
pending decalcification. _ _

SECTION CODE: F1—F4, tumor; F5, tumor and contiguous salivary land

tissuemle lymph node in each cassette; F10, one possib e lymph
node.
