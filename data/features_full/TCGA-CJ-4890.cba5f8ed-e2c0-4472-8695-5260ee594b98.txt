DIAGNOSIS
(A) PERIAORTIC LYMFH NODE:
One lymph node, no tumor present.
(B) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL:
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR CELL) TYPE, FUHRMAN
NUCLEAR GRADE 4 (14.0 CM).
TUMOR INVADES RENAL PELVIS AND RENAL SINUS ADIPOSE TISSUE.
TUMOR iNVADES RENAL VEIN.
Ureter, hllar vascular and soft tissue margins free of tumor.
Adrenal gland free of tumor.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
(A) PERIAORTIC LYMPH NODE - A single lymph node 2.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm.
The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in A1 -A2.

(B) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL - A nephrectomy specimen (21.0 x 18.0 x
13.0 cm) with attached unremarkable adrenal gland (7.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm).

A tan-yellow variegated solid tumor mass with focal hemorrhagic and
cystic areas (14.0 x 14.0 x 12.0 cm) comprises approximately 80% of the
entire kidney. The tumor grossly involves the renal sinus, renai vein,
and is present in the pelvis. The tumor extends to perinephric fat and
is 0.2 cm from the closest soft tissue margin. The ureter, rena! vein,
and artery margins are free of tumor. Representative portions of tumor
are submitted to tumor bank and electron microscopy.

INK CODE: Black - closest external surface of tumor.

SECTION CODE: B1, renal vein, artery and ureter margins; 32, tumor
in pelvislureter; B3, tumor in renal vein; B4 tumor in renal sinus;
B5-B6, tumor with closest external surface; BT-B15, additional sections
of tumor'l B16, uninvolved kidney; B17, section of adrenal gland.
