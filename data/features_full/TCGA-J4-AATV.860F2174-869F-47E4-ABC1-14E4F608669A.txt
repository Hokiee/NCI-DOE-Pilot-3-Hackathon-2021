Gross Description

A, Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"right pelvic nodes~FS" are two gray/tan frozen section tissue
fragments measuring 1.2 x 0‘7 cm. Wrapped and entirely
submitted in A1.

B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient‘s name and
"right pelvic nodeseNFS" is an aggregate of yellow fibrofatty
tissue fragments measuring 5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The fat is trimmed
and four probable lymph nodes are grossly identified. The
largest measures 1 x 0.7 cm; the smallest, 0.5 x 0.2 cm.

Wrapped and entirely submitted in 31.

C. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"left pelvic lymph nodesnFS“ are two gray/tan-frozen section
tissue fragments. The larger measures 1.7 x 0.3 cm; the
smaller, 1.2 x 0.6 cm. Wrapped and entirely submitted in CI.
D. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"left pelvic nodes—N98" is an aggregate of yellow fibrofatty
tissue fragments measuring 4 x 2 x 0.5 cm. The fat is trimmed
and three probable lymph nodes are grossly identified. The
largest measures 2 x 1.2 cm; the smallest, 1.2 x 0.5 cm.

Wrapped and entirely submitted in D1, D2.

E. Received in formalin labeled "prostate gland, seminal
vesicles and vasa deferentia“ is a radical prostatectomy
specimen which includes a 39 gram prostate gland with attached
seminal vesicles and vase deferentia. The prostate gland
measures 4 x 3.5 x 3 cm and has a shaggy capaule that is
disrupted at the bladder resection margin and has been
previously inked black on the left and blue on the right. The
right seminal vesicle measures 2 x 1.5 cm. The right vas
measures 1.5 x 0.5 cm. The left seminal vesicle measures 2 x 1.5
cm. The left vas measures 1.5 x 0.5 cm. The inferior prostate
is sectioned transversely, removed from the rest of the specimen
and sectioned from anterior to posterior following the plane of
the urethra. The remaining gland is Serially sectioned
transversely and shows a firm, focally nodular parenchyma. The
seminal vesicles and vase deferentia show no abnormalities.
Representative sections submitted as follows: inferior prostate
demonstrating apical margin submitted entirely anterior to
posterior in El—Ee; bladder resection margin shaved and serially

ES, 810; posterior in Ell, 312; complete section of upper third
of gland, anterior in E13, 214; posterior in 315, E16; remainder
of the posterior gland entirely submitted in 317-322; right
seminal vesicle and vas deferene in E23; and leﬁt seminal
vesicle and vas deferens in E24.
