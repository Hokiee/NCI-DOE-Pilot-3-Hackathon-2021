Nature of sampling : thymectomy and right upper lobe lung biopsy
Macroscopic examination :

1) Thymus :

Addressed a piece marked with a blue wire on the top right thymic horn , a

green wire on the top left thymic horn and a purple wire to the front of

thymus . Piece measuring 15 x 8 x 4 cm weighing 1159 fresh . Presence of a nodule
tumor corporeal left much limited by a thin capsule 4.8 cm . A cutting,

tumor is composed of a pink tissue remodeling and having few bleeding .

No necrosis. Section slices inked in green.

2) biopsy of the right upper lobe:

A wedge resection of 30 x 10 mm having a small hard nodules of 4 mm in diameter.
Limited resection marked by a green ink.

Microscopic examination :

1) Thymus ( Blocks A to H):

Histopathological examination revealed a well-circumscribed biphasic tumor capsule,
fibrous without refraction.

We find a first tumor epithelial contigent, predominant in

certain areas ( approximately 20 % ) . These areas are comprised of epithelial cells
spindle is bundled with rosettes and sometimes in small clumps. cells

epithelial show no cytonuclear atypia . They are associated with a

lymphocytic contingent with more or less important depending on the area . It
consists of small round cells sometimes entangled in the epithelial proliferation .
There is no differentiation of bone marrow . No perivascular clear spaces

There are a few areas ﬁbrous within the tumor.

The tumor is surrounded by a thicker fibrous capsule . Absence of capsular invasion.
Complete resection ( sliced sections inked in green).

The contingent of spindle epithelial cells is labeled with the antibody

anti- cytokeratin KL1 , focally by the anti - CD20 antibodies and negative for
anti- CD117 and CD5.

Lymphocyte contingent consists of immature T lymphocytes, CD5 + . CD1a + .

2) right upper lobe lung biopsy :
Presence of a small focus of intrapulmonary osseous metaplasia .

Conclusion :

Thymoma 4.8 cm long axis , sub type AB , completely encapsulated .
Complete surgical resection. ﬁll) -c» 5'
