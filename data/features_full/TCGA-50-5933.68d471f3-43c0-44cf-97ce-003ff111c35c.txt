COMMENT:

In Part 2, special stain for elastin shows that the neoplasm nxtands into but not through the visceral pleura. A
microgcopic focus of neoplastic cells is present within the arterial wall at the vascular margin nf resection. This
neoplastic focus is seen on the frozen snction and not on {immanent section. Deepnr Iavels of this margin are non-
contributory. The frozen section $Iide was reviewed and our diagnosis regarding this margin remains unchangad. Givnn
the positive vascular margin, the tumor clusters in part 7( nodule on aortic arch) likely represents contiguos spread rather
than a true etasisis. Hence this lesion is best classifies as PtII N2 Mx

I.

In Part 7, cytokeratin stain confirms the presence of neoplastic cellls of epithelial origin within the vessel wall. has been
ordered to confirm the epithelial origin of the neoplastic cells.
