DIAGNOSIS: Sill: ﬂmdzwu Elam

C. Pancreatic head, duodenum, common bile duct, Whipple
resection: Invasive moderately differentiated, grade 3 (of 4)

ductal adenocarcinoma is identiﬁed forming a mass (3.2 x 2.3 x 1.6
cm) located in the pancreatic head and neck. The tumor extends
beyond pancreas to involve peripancreatic soft tissue. The
pancreatic duct is also involved. Angiolymphatic invasion is
absent. Perineural invasion is present. The portal vein groove
margin is focally positive for invasive carcinoma. However, after
re-excision of this area (see part D below), all surgical margins,
including uncinate, common hepatic duct, and pancreatic neck (see
parts A and B below), are negative for tumor. The patient has had
no prior treatment. The adjacent non—neoplastic pancratic
parenchyma shows marked chronic pancreatitis. The gallbladder is
unremarkable. Multiple (14) regional lymph nodes are negative for
tumor. The pancreatic parenchyma is distorted with curvilinear
change possibly related to preoperative abscess formation and tumor
growth as it extends into peripancreatic fat.

A. Hepatic duct, common, margin, excision: Negative for tumor.
B. Pancreas, neck, margin, excision: Negative for tumor.

D. Portal vein, excision: Focally involved by grade 3 (of 4)
adenocarcinoma in the mid-region of the segmentally-resected portal

vein. However, the superior and inferior margins are negative for
tumor.

AJCC stage (with available surgical material): pT3NO (7th edition).

Frozen section histologic interpretation of portion of portal vein
performed by:

This ﬁnal pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic
examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the
specimen(s). A revised report will be issued to document the ﬁnal
interpretation after review of the Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)
permanent sections.

ADDENDUM:

Frozen section interpretation has been conﬁrmed by Hematoxylin and
Eosin (H&E) permanent section review.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received fresh labeled "common hepatic duct" is a 1.3 X 1.1 x
0.4 cm portion of pink mucosa with a lumen with orientation. All

submitted en face. Grossed by

B. Received fresh labeled "pancratic neck margin" is a 2.8 x 1.4
x 0.5 cm portion of pancreas with orientation. Margin submitted.

C. Received fresh labeled "head of pancreas, gallbladder,
duodenum, common bile duct, portion jejunum" is a Whipple specimen
consisting of 29.0 cm in length portion of duodenum, 6.9 x 4.2 x 3.1
cm portion of pancreas, 9.1 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm gallbladder. The
pancreatic uncinate margin is inked yellow and shaved, the portal
vein groove is inked black and submitted perpendicularly. There is
a 3.3 x 2.3 x 1.6 cm inﬁltrative mass within the neck/head,
abutting the portal vein groove margin. The mass extends to
peripancreatic fat. A stent is present within the common bile duct.
The gallbladder contains no choleliths. Surrounding the proximal
duodenum and pancreatic head is extensive necrosis and exudate,
which involves the pancreatic parenchyma. Peripancreatic lymph
nodes and periduodenal lymph nodes are identiﬁed. Representative
sections are submitted. Research tissue collected, '
Grossed by 7'

D. Received fresh labeled "portion portal vein" is a 1.4 cm in
length medium caliber vein with orientation. The superior and
inferior vein margins are submitted en face. The central part of
the vein is focally indurated, 0.3 cm to the inferior margin.
