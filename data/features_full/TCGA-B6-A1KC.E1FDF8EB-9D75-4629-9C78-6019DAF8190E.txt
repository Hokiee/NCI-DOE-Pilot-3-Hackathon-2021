CLINICAL HISTORY:
Per Browser: Right breast mass at 9:00 position, invasive ductal carcinoma.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Sentinel node #1, hot and blue". Received fresh and placed in formalin is
a 2 x l x 1 cm brown-yellow fragment of fibroadipose tissue. The specimen is
sectioned and submitted entirely in block A1.

B. "Sentinel node #2, hot not blue". Received fresh and placed in formalin is
a 3.5 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm fragment of brown-yellow fibroadipose tissue. The
specimen is sectioned and submitted entirely in blocks 81 and 82.

C. "Rightkbreast mass". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 10.5 (M—L)
by 7.7 (AeP) by 4.0 (5—1) cm excisional breast biopsy. The anterior is inked
blue, the posterior is inked black, the superior is inked red, and the
inferior is inked yellow. There is a 4.6 x 1.5 cm ellipse of skin. There is
a 2.0 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm well circumscribed firm white nodule in the anterior
middle portion of the biopsy. The mass approaches within 2.0 mm of the
anterior margin and within 0.5 cm of the ellipse of skin. Representative
sections are taken medially to laterally from blocks C1-C25.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Cl— most medial section

C2- second most medial section

C3—10— representative sections moving laterally towards mass
c11—21— representative sections with mass

C22-25- representative section moving laterally

D. "Final anterior, inferior margin". Received fresh and placed in formalin
is a 3 x 2 x 1 cm fragment of brown—yellow fibroadipose tissue. A stitch is
placed on the margin by the surgeon. Blue ink is placed next to the suture,
the suture is removed, and the specimen is bisected. The inked blue side is
placed in blocks D1 and D2. The rest of the specimen is placed in block D3.
