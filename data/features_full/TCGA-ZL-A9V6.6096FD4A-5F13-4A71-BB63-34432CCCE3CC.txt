SPECIMEN INQUIRY REPORT

 

 

 

 

 

Received: _ , - Subm. Dr: — Spat-hi—
Service Date:

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS:

Thymoma, Clinically Stage 1

SOURCE OF SPECIMEN:
Thymus Gland

 

THYMUS GLAND: THYMUS GLAND SHOWING MIXED LYMPEOEPITHELIAL THYMOMA (TYPE AB) WITH
PROMINENT CYST FORMATION.

THE TUMOR IE REPORTED TO HAVE MEASURED 4.2 x 3 CM BY IMAGING.
THE INKH! MARGINS OF RESECTION ARE HISTOLOGICALLY CLEAR.

TUMOR MICROFOCALLY COMES TO APPROXIMATELY 2 MM FROM THE INKED EXTERNAL SURFACE
OF THE SPECIMEN AT ITS NEAREST POINT.

BACKGROUND HISTOLOGICALLY UNREMARKABLE ATROPHIC THYMIC TISSUE.

NOTE: Immunoltains for broad spectrum cytokeratin, synaptophysin and chromogranin
(the latter two stains both negative) were used to evaluate the specimen. Flow

cytometry reveals a benign, T-cell dominant lymphoid population with no antigenic
aberranciea.‘ The minority B—cell population is polyclonal.

Received: Specimen # z - (Continued)

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: (Continued)

with scanty cytoplasm and monotonously uniform short spindled nuclei with evenly
distributed chromatin, small to absent nucleoli and no appreciable mitotic activity.
They are generally arranged in a patternless fashion, but in focal areas, vague whorls
may be seen. Scattered small foci of glandular differentiation composed of cells with
similar morphologic characteristics well oriented around luminal spaces or
occasionally around the perimeters of micropapillary formations. A small
inconspicuous population of lymphocytes is scattered about. The lymphoid component
represents approximately 20 to 25% of the cellular elements. It shows focal germinal
center formation and generally small aggregates of cytokeratin positive epithelial
cells which are not readily apparent on HaE stained sections. The inked external
surfaces of the specimen are histologically clear. Tumor microfocally comes to within

2 mm of the inked surface in block 1. Atrophic histologically unremarkable thymic
tissue is present in the background.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is identified on the requisition slip and specimen container as "thymus
gland". .Received fresh for operating room examination is an irregularly shaped
yellow-tan thymus gland weighing 96 grams and measuring 29 x 5 x 3 cm. The specimen
is inked and sectioned revealing the presence of a partially cystic firm-tan mass
measuring 3.8 cm in greatest dimension, located at one pole of the unoriented
specimen. The remainder of the specimen is composed primarily of glossy yellow soft
tissue. A portion of the cystic mass is submitted for tumor banking and a portion is
submitted for flow cytometry. Representative Sections are submitted as follows:

SECTION CODE:
1 through 4 — contain the cystic mass and surrounding area
5 through 8 - representative sections of grossly uninvolved thymus

OPERATING ROOM EXAMINATION: APPROXIMATELY 4 CM PARTIALLY CYSTIC MASS AT ONE POLE OF

RESECTED THYMUS GLAND MEASURING 20 X 5 X 3 CM. PORTION SUBMITTED FOR TUMOR
BANK.

A thymus gland was submitted for immunophenotyping.

CD45 vs. side scatter showed the lymphocytic population to comprise 88.1% of the
cellular elements. The lymphocytes are T-cell dominant. The T—cells show no
antigenic aberrancies. The CD4/8 ratio is 2.1%. 6.2% show characteristic

of CD4 and CD8. The minority B-cell population (CD19=17.9% and
CD20=18.3%) is polyclonal (skappa=8.5% and slambda=8.1%).
IMPRESSION: POPULATION OF NORMAL THYMIC LYMPHOCYTES.
