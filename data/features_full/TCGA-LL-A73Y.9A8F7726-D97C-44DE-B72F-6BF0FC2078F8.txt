GROSS DESCRIPTION :
The specimen is received in two parts. Both parts are received labeled with the patient's
name.

A. Received in formalin. labeled with the patient‘s name and “right sentinel node” is a 3.5
x 2.5 x 2.0 cm portion of yellow. lobulated adipose. The adipose is trimmed to have a
flattened. 2.6 x 2.0 x 0.6 cm nodular, fatty lymph node. The node is sectioned
perpendicular to the long axis to be entirely submitted per sentinel lymph node protocol
cassettes Al—AB.

B. Received fresh for tissue banking. labeled with the patient's name and ”right breast” is
a 962 gram. 23.0 x 20.0 x 4.5 cm fibrotatty breast consistent with simple mastectomy
specimen. There is a suture designating the region of the axilla and an overlying 12.5 x
4.5 cm black—brown skin ellipse. The skin ellipse has a central. 5.0 x 4.5 cm areola which
extends to the skin margins and a central 1.3 cm erect nipple. The deep margin is
predominantly smooth and intact with a focal. minor, inferior medial area of disruption.
The deep margin will be inked blue and the breast is serially sectioned to have a diffusely
fatty parenchyma. The upper inner quadrant has a 1.7 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm tumor mass. The mass
is 2.5 cm from the superior peripheral margin. The __~*_ is 17 cm from the inferior
peripheral margin, is approximately 4 cm from the medial peripheral margin and at least
16.5 cm from the lateral peripheral margin. The tumor comes to within 0.7 cm of the deep
‘margin. The remainder of the breast has glistening. yellow adipose with diffuse. delicate
and focal scant dense—white fibrous tissue. There is a central area of possible Iibrocystic
change. The white fibrous tissue makes up between 15 and 20% of the parenchyma and is more
pronounced towards the medial aspect of the breast. No additional indurated lesions or
tumor-like masses are identified. Representative sections are sampled as labeled:
