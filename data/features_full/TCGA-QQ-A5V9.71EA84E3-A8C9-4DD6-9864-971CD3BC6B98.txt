Received is an en bloc resected specimen comprising of a huge
tumor with the adherent kidney and the perinephric fat. The
overall dimensions of the specimen are 27x9.0 to 14.0x7cm. It
weighs 13009m. The tumor seems encapsulated and measures

small portion of attached liver is identiﬁed which measures
3x1 x0.90m. The sections are submitted as follows:

AD1 to AD3: from the adrenal

K1 and K2: kidney

RP: renal pelvis

D: distal ureter

TPCP1 and TPCP2: tumor with capsule

PF: perinephric fat

T1 to T10: tumor (T9 section is taken from the tumor with

the diaphargm)

LV: liver

FS1A and F813: frozen on the tumor
