Gross Description: Received ﬁ‘esh labeled " patient name and medical number,
right tube and ovary". It consists of a previously opened cystic ovary

with attached fallopian tube weighing a total of 167 grams. The cystic
ovary measures 14.5 x 10 X 5 cm. The outer surface is gray-tan, rough with
moderate adhesions noted. The cyst is opened to reveal a unilocular Smooth
walled cystic cut surface. The cyst wall is grossly thickened in some

areas measuring from 0.1 up to 2.5 cmin greatest thickness. The attached
fallopian tube measures 4.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The fallopian tube is serially
sectioned revealing a small patent lumen in the surrounding wall measuring
up to 0.2 cm in thickness. Representative sections of thickened areas from
cyst are frozen in 2FS. The remainder of the specimen is representatively
