Clinical Information

Lung mass.

Gross Description
"A, lnterlobar node." The specimen consists of a 0.7 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm anthracotic lymph node. -

"B, Upper lobe lung." The specimen consists of a 14.7 x 11.7 x 2.5 cm portion of lung. The pleural surface is red-gray with
mild adhesions. There is a 3.6 cm ﬁrm elevated puckered area present on the pleural surface. This area has previously been
inked black by the pathologist. The specimen has previously been partially sectioned and there is a 3.7 x 3.3 x 1.5 cm
ill-deﬁned ﬁrm gray-tan mass which abuts the overlying pleural surface and comes to within 3 cm of the bronchial margin. On
further examination there is a 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm ill-defined firm gray-tan mass which lies 1.2 cm from the larger mass. This
mass comes to within 1 cm of the overlying pleural surface and lies 4.3 cm from the bronchial margin. The remaining lung
parenchyma is red-tan and mildly congested and no additional lesions or areas of interest are grossly identiﬁed. Mild
emphysematous change is noted at the periphery of the specimen. Five possible peribronchial lymph nodes are identiﬁed.
These range in size from 0.6 to 0.9 cm. "B1 bronchial and vascular margins; "82-84," mass #1 with overlying pleura; "BS,"

ﬂdjacent parenchyma; "BB," mass #2; "B7," emphysematous change; "BB," peribronchial lymph nodes. _
