Microscopic

Sections demonstrate a moderately to markedly hypercellular glial neoplasm that
diffusely infiltrates by gray and white matter. The tumor cells have round nuclei
and consistently demonstrate perinuclear halos. Atypia is moderate. Scattered
mitotic figures are seen with up to 4 mitoses identified in 10 high power fields.

No microvascular proliferation or necrosis is seen.

Addendum

Sections demonstrate a moderate to marked hypercellular glial neoplasm
consisting of sheets and nests of atypical cells which resemble oligodendrocytes.
The tumor cells exhibit moderate cytologic atypia, prominent perinuclear halos
and round nuclei. Scatttered microgemistocytes are also present. The tumor
infiltrates the adjacent brain parenchyma. Architecturally, the tumor
demonstrates both microcyst and microcalcifications. Neither microvascular
proliferation nor necrosis is seen. The histologic features are consistent with an
oligodendroglioma.

The MlB-1 labeling index ranges up to 15.5% in the most proliferative regions of
tumor consistent with an anaplastic oligodendrglioma
