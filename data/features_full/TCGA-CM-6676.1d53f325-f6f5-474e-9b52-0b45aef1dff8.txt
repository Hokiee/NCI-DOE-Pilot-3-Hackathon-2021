------------------------------------------------------------ Page 2 of 4
Not Identified
Non-Neoplastic Bowel:
unremarkable
Lymph Nodes:
Total number examined: 17
One lymph node contains metastatic carcinoma, consistent with
prostatic origin, see comment.
Tumor Staging (AJCC 7th Edition):
pT2 (Tumor invades muscularis propria)
Lymph Node Stage (AJCC 7th Edition):
N0 (No regional lymph node metastasis)
Comment: Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumor cells in the
lymph node are positive for PSA, while negative for CK7, CK20, CDx-2, TTF-l,
chromogranin, and synaptophysin, consistent with a prostate origin.

2. Colon, distal ring; excision:
-Benign colonic tissue with hyperplastic changes.

3. Colon, proximal ring; excision:
-Benign colonic tissue.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

Gross Description:

1) The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "sigmoid colon". It
consists of an unoriented segment of sigmoid colon that measures 26 x 6 cm.
The serosal surface is unremarkable. The radial resection margin is inked
black and the specimen is opened to reveal a polypoid tumor that is located
2.4 cm from one margin and 21 cm from the opposite margin. The tumor
measures 2.5 cm in length and 2 cm in width. Serial sectioning reveals that
the tumor maximum thickness is 1.5 cm. The remaining mucosa is unremarkable.
Pericolic adipose tissue spans the entire length of the specimen with a
maximum thickness of 12 cm. It is submitted for lymph node dissection and
thoroughly examined for lymph nodes, and all possible nodes are submitted.
Representative sections are submitted. TPS is submitted.

Summary of sections:

M1 - margin closer to the tumor

M2 - margin farther from the tumor
T - tumor

U - uninvolved mucosa

LN - lymph nodes

BLN - bisected lymph node

2) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "distal ring" and consists
of a ring of pink tan soft tissue measuring 2.5 x 1.8 x 1.3 cm. Multiple
sutures and staples are attached. The mucosal surface is pink tan and
focally hemorrhagic. The sutures and staples are removed, and the soft
tissue is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U - undesignated

3) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "proximal ring" and
consists of a ring of pink tan soft tissue measuring 2.0 x 1.8 x 1.4 cm.
Multiple sutures and staples are attached. The mucosal surface is pink tan
and focally hemorrhagic. The sutures and staples are removed, and the soft
tissue is entirely submitted.
