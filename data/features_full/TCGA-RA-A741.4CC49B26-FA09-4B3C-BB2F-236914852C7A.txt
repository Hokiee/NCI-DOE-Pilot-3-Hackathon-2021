COMMENT(S)

A. The biopsy material was received fresh with tissue selected for

and tissue banking.

The biopsy shows a dense. cellular proliferation of strands of epithelioid cells with
marked. nuclear pleomorphism. hyperchormatic nuclei and varying degrees of eosinophilic
cytoplasm. There are also numerous apoptotic cells as well as scattered mitoses. There is
an associated lymphohistiocytic infiltrate. Immunohistochemical stains performed include
P16. P63. 34BE12. CK5/6 and CEA. P16 shows strong, diffuse nuclear staining. P63 and
34B312 show diffuse cytoplasmic staining. CK5/6 and CEA stain a minority of cells. These
stains are consistent with a squamous cell carcinoma. It is likely of cervical origin.
Pankeratin stains performed on the lymph nodes in Parts "B“ and “C” are negative for
metastasis.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh for Tissue Banking is a fragmented. 2.2 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm. indurated.
mucinous appearing tissue biopsy. The tissue is bisected and sampled under sterile
conditions, Precision Diagnostic. fresh tissue is sampled for Tissue Bankino and 50% of the
biopsy is submitted for permanent histologic evaluation, cassette 1.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: (Continued)

Received in two additional parts. Each part is in formalin. labeled with the patient‘s
name.

B. Labeled "left pelvic lymph node“ is a 3.4 x 3.3 x 1.2 cm aggregate of yellow. lobulated
adipose. The adipose is sectioned to have a single. 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm nodular fatty lymph
node. The node is bisected and entirely submitted cassette Bl.

C. Labeled "right pelvic lymph node“ is a 3.0 x 2.7 x 1.5 cm aggregate of yellow. lobulated
adipose. The adipose is sectioned to have three nodular. fatty lymph nodes. The nodes
range from a linear 1.1 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm to an indurated 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm. The medium
sized node is inked blue. Each node is bisected and the nodes are entirely submitted
cassettes C1~C2.
