Main diagnosis/diagnoses:

Locally advanced, peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically mixed adenocarcinoma of the
right upper lobe of the lung with an acinar and solid component, slight mucin formation and
localization in S1 and S2.

TNM classification on the basis of this material pT3 pNO pMX V1 R1, stage IIB.

C34.1 M8255/3.

Comment/supplementary remark:

The carcinoma has spread into the adhesive part of the chest wall, where it has infiltrated both
the soft tissue and the 3rd rib, extending in a circumscribed manner as far as the outer
resection surface at the thoracic skin, which explains the R1 classification. The carcinoma has
also spread as far as the visceral pleura of the adhesive part evidently from S6 of the upper
lobe. The resection margin of the bronchus and vessels, the other resection margins of the
resected chest wall material, the lung parenchyma of the resection material evidently taken
from S6 and all the lymph nodes identified and removed are tumor-free.
