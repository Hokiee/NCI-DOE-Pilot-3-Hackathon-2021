Received in formalin labeled with the patient’s identification and ’left axillary sentinel lymph
node #1’ is a tan pink lymph node 1.6 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned. Toto A1.

B. LEFT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and ’left axillary sentinel lymph
node #2’ is a tan pink lymph node 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned. Toto Bl.

C. RIGHT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1

Received in formalin labeled with the patient’s identiﬁcation and ’right axillary sentinel lymph
node #1’ is a tan pink lymph node 2.6 x 1.8 x 1.6 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned. Toto C1.

D. RIGHT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2

Received in formalin labeled with the patient’ 5 identiﬁcation and ‘right axillary sentinel lymph
node #2’ is a tan pink lymph node 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned. Toto 01.

E. EXCISION MID BACK MELANOMA

Received fresh labeled with the patient‘s identiﬁcation and ’excision mid back melanoma’ is an
oriented tan pink skin excision 16 x 5.7 cm excised to a depth of 3.5 cm. The skin surface is
remarkable for a centrally located raised well demarcated pigmented lesion 1.8 x 1.5 cm, 1.5 cm
from the closest inferior margin. Gross photographs are taken. Ink code: superior—blue, inferior-
orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from presumptive medial to lateral. The lesion does
not grossly appear to involve the underlying adipose tissue. A portion of the specimen is
submitted for tissue procurement. Representatively submitted:

E1: presumptive medial margin

E2: presumptive lateral margin

E3—E4: shave of superior margin— closest to lesion
E5—E6: shave of inferior margin- closest to lesion
E7-E8: one section of lesion bisected

E9-E10: one section of lesion bisected

Ell-E12: one section of lesion bisected

£13-E14: one section of lesion bisected

E15—E16: one section of lesion bisected

DIAGNOSIS:
A. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL — LEFT AXlLLA, EXClSlON:

— METASTATlC MELANOMA TO ONE LYMPH NODE (1/1).

B. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL — LEFT AXILLA, EXCISION:

- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTATIC TUMOR (0/1).

C. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL- RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION:

— ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTATIC TUMOR (0/1).

D. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL - RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION:

- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTATIC TUMOR (0/1).

E. SKIN, MID BACK, EXCISION:

- RESIDUAL MALIGNANT MELANOMA

- 3.0 MM IN DEPTH

- CLARK'S LEVEL IV

- ALL MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY

- THE MELANOMA IS 1.5 CM FROM THE INFERIOR MARGIN (CLOSEST MARGIN).
- NO ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IDENTIFIED

- ASSOCIATED WITH MARKED CHRONIC INFLAMMATION AND MELANOPHAGES.

The interpretation of the above immunohistochemistry stain or stains is guided by published
results in the medical literature, provided package information from the manufacturer and by
internal review of staining performance and assay validation
The use of one or more reagents in the above

tests is regulated as an analyte speciﬁc reagent (ASR). These tests were developed and their
performance characteristic determined by the g 7

They have not been cleared or approved by the US. Food and Drug
Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.

Special stains and/or immunohistochemical stains were performed with appropriately stained
positive and negative controls.

ADDENDUM: The residual melanoma is focally ulcerated.
