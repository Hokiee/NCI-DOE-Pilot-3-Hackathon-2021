CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm corpus uteri.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Peritoneal biopsy (AF1)“, unfixed for frozen section and placed in
formalin at 12 pm on is a 8 x 8 x 8 mm fragment of tissue, entirely
submitted in A1.

B. "Uterus and bilateral adnexa (BF1)", unfixed for frozen section placed in
formalin at 12 pm on is a 135 gm, 11.1 x 7 x 4.2 cm hysterectomy
specimen.

There is 6 x 3.5 x 0.4 cm exophytic mass that involves the uterine isthmus,
the lower uterine segment and the superior part of the cervix. The mass
involves both the interior and posterior surfaces. It did not appear to
penetrate the 1.5 cm thick myometrium. In addition, there is a 9.6 x 6.7 x 1.8
cm aggregate of tumor and blood clot that came out of the endometrial cavity
when it was opened. Otherwise, the serosal surface and myometrium are
unremarkable. Right and left ovaries and fallopian tubes are unremarkable.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

‘I x 0.8 x 0.3 gm lymph node is identified. This is sectioned and submitted in
