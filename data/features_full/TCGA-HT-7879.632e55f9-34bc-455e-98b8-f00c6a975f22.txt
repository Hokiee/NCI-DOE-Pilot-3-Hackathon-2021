Microscopic

Microscopic examination reveals a moderately cellular glial neoplasm. The
tumor is composed of cells with both astrocytic and oligodendroglial features.
The oligodendroglial component exhibits a proliferation of cells with round to
oval, moderately pleomorphic nuclei with prominent preinuclear halos.

Scattered microgemistocytes are identified, as well. The minor astrocytic
component consists of neoplastic cells with oval to elongate nuclei and moderate
cytologic atypia. Overall, only a rare mitotic figure is seen; however, mitoses are
focally elevated at up to 3 mitoses per 10 high power fields. Neither necrosis nor
microvasculascular proliferation are identified. The neoplastic cells are identified
infiltrating the adjacent brain parenchyma. The histologic features are consistent
with an oligoastrocytoma. A final diagnosis will be issued pending review of MlB-
1 labeling index.

Addendum

A MlB-1 labeling index was performed on three blocks of tissue. Overall, the
MlB-1 labeling index is low at 2.4-3.7%; however, a focal region of tumor
demonstrates increased proliferative activity at 6.2%. The focally elevated MlB-1
labeling index, in conjunction with focally increased mitotic activity at 3 mitoses
per 10 high power fields, are suggestive of very early anaplastic progression in
an otherwise low grade glioma.

Diagnosis

Oligoastrocytoma, (oligodendroglioma predominant), with findings consistent with
early anaplastic progression, WHO grade III
