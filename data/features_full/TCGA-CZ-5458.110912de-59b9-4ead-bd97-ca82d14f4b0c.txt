PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS;

SPECIMEN DESIGNATED "RIGHT QIDNEY, NEPHRECTOMY“:
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (9.2 cm), clear cell t , with focal
spindle cell areas, Fuhrman nuclear grade III (of IV).
The tumor extends through the renal capsule and into the
perirenal adipose tissue.
The resection margins are negative for tumor.
No lymphovascular invasion identified.
The ureter, vein, and artery margins are negative for tumor.
AJCC Classification (6th Edition): T3 Nx MX.
The non—neoplastic kidney will be evaluated by Renal Pathology, and the

findings will be reported in an addendum.

NOTE:
Selected slides were reviewed with Dr _ Pathology Service, who

COHCUI‘S .

CLINICAL DATA:

History: None given.

Operation: Right radical nephreotomy.
Operative Findings: None given.

Clinical Diagnosis: Preop: Right kidney mass.

ORGAN/TISSUE SUBMITTED:
All. Right kidney to tumor bank.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh in one part, labeled with the patient's name,

unit number, and “#1. Right kidney“, and consists of a TBS—gram radical

nephrectomy specimen including right kidney (17.8 x 10.1 x 7.0 cm), ureter (9.5

x 0.4 cm in diameter), renal vein {0.6 cm in length x 1.0 cm in diameter),
renal artery #1 (1.5 x 0.5 cm in diameter), and renal artery #2 (2.3 x 0.4 cm
in diameter). A focal hemorrhagic, well encapsulated tan/yellow to tan/red
focally cystic mass (9.2 x 8.1 x 7.0 cm) is located in the upper pole. The
mass abuts the kidney capsule and is 0.2 cm to the inked margin, 12.0 cm to
ureter, 2.2 cm artery #2, 3.3 cm artery #1, and 2.2 cm to the vein margins.
There is focus suspicious for extracapsular invasion, however, the renal pelvis
does not seem to be invaded. The outer surface is inked black.

Representative sections of the tumor were sent for cytogenetics, electron
microsCOpy, and submitted to the tissue bank. Representative sections of
normal cortex.were submitted for electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and
tissue bank. Representative sections are submitted for histology.

METAPHASES COUNTED: 11 ANALYZED: 7 SCORED: 4 BANDING: ems

INTERPRETATION:
Ten of 11 metaphases from specimen labeled T2 contained the clonal aberrations

described above. Loss of the short arm of chromosome 3 is a characteristic
finding in renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type.

COMMENTS:
Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the

standard methods employed. Chromosome analysis was performed at a level of 400
bands or greater.

No metaphases were available from specimen labeled T1.

INDICATION FOR TEST:
? Renal Cell Carcinoma
