Frozen Section Diagnosis

Frozen section diagnosis per

13A: "High grade glioma"
Gross Description

Two containers are received labeled with the patient's name and medical record
number.

Specimen one is received fresh for frozen section labeled "left frontal lesion".
The specimen is a 1‘8 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm portion of pink—tan soft tissue. Half of this
tissue is submitted for frozen section. Submitted in total in cassette lFA, and
1A.

Specimen two is received in formalin labeled "left frontal lesion", is a 46.60 g
portion of pink—tan focally hemorrhagic brain tissue. The tissue is 9.0 x 7.5 x
3.0 cm in aggregate. Sectioning shows a grey to dusky pink glistening cut surface.
No discrete nodules are identified. Representative sections submitted in cassette
2A-2D.

ACCESSION

'Adaend‘ﬁm Discussion

lp/19q FISH

Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for deletions of 1p and/or 19q
are performed on sections from block "2A".

Calculated lp/lq ratio = 0.49 («3.74 is deleted)
Calculated 19q/19p ratio = .055 (<0.88 is deleted)

The results are interpreted as deleted for 1p and 19q. This assay was read by Dr.

A result of a deleted 1p and 19q suggests a favorable prognosis. A solitary 1p
deletion suggests an intermediate prognosis. A 19q solitary deletion may suggest a
favorable prognosis in a smaller subset of tumors. The lack of either 1p and/or
19q deletion(s) is considered a poor prognostic indicator and may be associated
with decreased disease—free survival and overall survival.
