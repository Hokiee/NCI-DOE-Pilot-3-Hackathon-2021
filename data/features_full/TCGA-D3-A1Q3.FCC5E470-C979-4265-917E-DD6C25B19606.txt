GROSS DESCRIPTION
(A) METASTATIC MELANOMA, LEFT HEEL — A 9.0 x 6.0 x 1.3 cm excisionai segment
of skin and subcutaneous tissue. The specimen is oriented by the surgeon. A
short suture designates the superior margin and a iong suture designates the
mediai margin. A centrai, 4.5 x 4.0 cm, area of scar is resent. Just
Taterai to the scar is a 1.5 x 1.0 cm, uicerating, whitis nodu1e.
Approximateiy 0.3 cm from this 1esion is another 0.6 cm uicer with
granuiation
tissue. This smaii uicer is 1.0 cm from the nearest iaterai margin.
Approximateiy 0.8 cm from the superomediai margin is a 0.2 cm incision with a
suture. NO other Tesions are identified on the Skin surface. On the deep
aspect of the excision, is a 2.5 x 1.5 cm area that does not represent the
tﬁue margin as the surgeon submitted a separate deep margin in this area.
T 1 5
area is inked green.

A separate 0.6 cm, tan—brown noduie is identified superior and iaterai
to
the main sateiiite noduie (1.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm) The sateiiite noduie is 0.5
from the deep mar in.
