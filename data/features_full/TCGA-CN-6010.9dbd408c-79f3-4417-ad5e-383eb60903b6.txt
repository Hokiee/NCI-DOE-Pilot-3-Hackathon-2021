GROSS DESCRIPTION:
Part 1 is labeled with the patient' s name, initials, xx, MRN and as
"laryngeal tissue." Received originally fresh for frozen section and now
subsequently in formalin are multiple fragments of tissue that measuring in
aggregate approximately 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. The specimen is submitted in its
entirety in cassette lAFS for frozen section control within a tea bag.
Part 2 is labeled with the patient' s name, initials, xx, MRN and as "left
neck, level 2 through 4." Received in formalin is a single fragment of tan,
rectangular-shaped tissue that measures overall approximately 10.1 cm x 3.0 X
1.1 cm. The tissue is unoriented and consists of tan, fatty tissue with
multiple nodular fragments of tissue grossly consistent with lymph nodes. The
stemocleidomastoid and jugular vein are grossly inapparent.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:
2A-2C one end of tissue (with 2A containing four possible lymph nodes, 2B
containing three possible lymph nodes, and 2C

containing multiple possible lymph nodes)
2D and 2E mid portion of tissue, each containing multiple possible lymph nodes
2F-2H opposing end portion of tissue (with 2F containing bisected lymph node
and 2G containing two bisected lymph nodes, one

of which is inked blue, and 2H containing multiple possible
lymph nodes).
Part 3 is labeled with the patient' s name, initials, XX, MRN and as "right
neck, levels 2 through 4." Received in formalin is a single fragment of tan,
fatty tissue that measures overall approximately 9.8 x 2.5 x 1.1 cm. Upon
serial sectioning, there are multiple nodular fragments of tissue grossly
consistent with lymph nodes and no grossly apparent jugular vein or
stemocleidomastoid muscle. Representative sections of the specimen are
submitted as follows:
3A-3B one end of tissue (3A containing bisected lymph nodes, 3B containing
ﬁve possible lymph nodes)
3C—3D mid portion tissue (3C three possible lymph nodes, 3D multiple possible

lymph node
3E—3F opposing end of tissue (3E containing five possible lymph nodes, 3F

containing multi le ossiblel h nodes .
Dictated By:
Part 4 is rece1ve es a e e w1t e pat1ent's name, initials xx and

designated "total larynx". The specimen consists of a larynx which measures
8.1 cm from superior to inferior, 7.9 cm from left to right and 5.1 cm from
anterior to posterior.

A section of ulcerated lesion has been removed for tissue bank that measured
2.1 x 1.7 cm and was supraglottic with transglottic extension to the left and
right true vocal cords. The area that has been banked is inked in red. The
previously mentioned ulcerated lesion is red-brown in color, transglottic and
appears to extend to the laryngeal surface of the epiglottis. There is also a
0.3 x 0.2—cm ulcerated lesion on the false vocal cord and a 0.4 x 0.3 cm
ulcerated lesion on the true vocal cord. The lesion appears to extend to
within 0.1 cm of the thyroid cartilage on both the left and right sides in the
region of the glottis. The area where the tumor extends is tan-yellow in
color and ﬁrm in texture. Near the anterior commissure, the tumor extends
superiorly through the pre-epiglottic space and extends to the pre—epiglottic
soft tissue resection margin.

Digital images were taken.

Part 5 is labeled w1t e pat1ent s name, initials, xx, MRN and as "left

hypopharyngeal margin." Received originally fresh for frozen section and now
subsequently submitted in formalin is a fragment of tan-brown tissue that
measures approximately 1.7 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is submitted in its
entirety in cassette 5AFS for frozen section control within a tea bag.

Part 6 is labeled with the patient' s name, initials, xx, MRN and as "left

lateral hypopharyngeal wall." The specimen was originally received fresh for
frozen section and now subsequently in formalin is a single fragment of
tan-brown tissue that measures approximately 2.5 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. The specimen
is submitted in its entirety in a tea bag in cassette 6AFS for frozen section
control.

Part 7 is labeled with the patient' s name, initials, xx, MRN and as "base of
tongue." Received originally fresh for frozen section and now subsequently in

formalin is a single fragment of tan-brown tissue that measures approximately
2.1 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is submitted in its entirety in a tea bag
cassette 7AFS for frozen section control.

Part 8 is labeled with the patient' s name, initials, xx, MRN and as

"additional left pharyngeal wall." Received originally fresh for frozen

section and now subsequently in formalin is tan-brown tissue. Currently within
the container there are two fragments of tissue, one within the tea bag that
measures approximately 1.1 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. Additionally within the container
is a second fragment of tan-brown tissue that measures 1.2 x 0.2 x 0.4 cm. the
specimen is submitted in its entirety as follows:
