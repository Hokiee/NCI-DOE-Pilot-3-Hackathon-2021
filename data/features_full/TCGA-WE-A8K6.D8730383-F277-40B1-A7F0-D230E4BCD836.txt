CASE HISTORY _

Right axillary nodes - previous history of melanoma ?Metastatic to

lymph node.

MACROECOPIC .
These are two cores of tissue each 10 mm in length.

MICROSCOPY:
We received lx H+E slide and 6 immunohistochemistry slides from
labelled n. , Lx3, SlOO, MELA, CK7, CKZO, CK5/6 and

PSA" for discussion at the

Core biopsy showing aggregates of atypical naevoid cells (SlOO
positive) which are mitotically active and which Show focal
necrosis, in keeping with metastatic malignant melanoma.

DIAGNOSIS:
RIGHT AXILLARY LYMPH NODE BIOPSY: METASTATIC MALIGNANT MELANOMA.

CASE HISTORY: 7/;9/14/

Metastatic melanoma. Specimen has been tissue banked. Has
splenomegaly therefore ?non—Hodgkin lymphoma

MACROSCOPIC:
Fat and attached muscle 15 x 8 x 4 cm which has been inked and
incised at one point (A = node nearest suture). At the incision

site is an involved lymph node 3 cm diameter which is at least 0.5
cm from the closest margin (B).

MICROSCOPY:

Metastatic malignant melanoma is present in one lymph node, 3 cm
diameter (macroscopic measurement). The capsule of the node is
fibrotic but there is no definite extracapsular spread. 16 other

lymph nodes are negative for tumour. There is no evidence of
lymphoma

DIAGNOSIS:
RIGHT AXILLARY DISSECTION: METASTATIC MALIGNANT MELANOMA

? stage IV

Report:

Comparison is made to the previous CT from

There is a 7 mm enhancing lesion seen within the medial
right fronto parietal cortex (series 4, image 22; series 6,
image 45). This was not present previously, and is
suspicious for a metastasis. No other focal parenchymal
lesion.

There is no supraclavicular, left axillary, hilar or
mediastinal adenopathy. There is a 43 x 78 mm mass within
the right axilla at the site of previous surgery. This has
increased in size from 28.x 70 mm previously. There is
peripheral reticular shadowing seen within the lungs in
keeping with fibrosis. There are pleural plaques suggesting
this is related to previous asbestos exposure. No
destructive bone lesion.

There is a new 16 mm low-density lesion in segment 4 of the
liver (image 45). A smaller 10 mm lesion is seen within
segment 6 (image 58). These are in keeping with metastases.
The spleen is enlarged measuring 19 cm unchanged from
previously. There are splenic hilar varices and left gastric
varices unchanged from previously.

The pancreas, adrenals and kidneys appear normal. There are

non—enlarged upper abdominal nodes unchanged from
previously. No abdominal, pelvic or inguinal adenopathy. No
large stenosing lesion evident in the unopacified large
bowel. There are no skin or subcutaneous nodules.

Conclusion: Progressive disease with enlargement of the
right axillary mass with new cerebral and liver metastases
in keeping with stage IV disease.
