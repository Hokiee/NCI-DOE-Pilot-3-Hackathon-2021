PATHOLOGIC TUMOR STAGING SUMMARY:
Histologic type and grade: papillary carcinoma. classical variant.
Primary tumor: pT1b, 1.8 cm in greatest dimension, limited to thyroid.
Regional lymph nodes: pN1 a, two of three lymph nodes involved (2/3), including
right pen-thyroid and central lymph nodes.
Distant metastasis: NIA.
Pathologic tumor stage; plll.
Margin status: R1, positive posterior margin (anterior margin is very close).
Lymphatic and perineural invasion: Not identiﬁed.

COMMENT: The prior right lobe FNA diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma is noted
. The ﬁndings are communicated to "

Regarding margin status: The College of American Pathology notes that "tumor at the

margin (Le. capsule andlor ink) does not correlate to incomplete excision" and that

"most surgeons, endocrinologists, and nuclear medicine specialists request

information on margin status ..... while this makes intuitive sense and it is

recommended that a positive margin be mentioned in the final pathology report,

FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Clinical HistoLyIOperative Dx:

Thyroid cancer.

Gross Description:

A. Part A is labeled total thyroid. lie is on right lobe. Initialty received in the fresh state for possible
Oncogenotyping studies is an 11 gram total thyroidectomy specimen: the right lobe is 3.3 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm
and the left lobe is 3.3 x16 x 1.3 cm, and both lobes are bridged by a 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm isthmus. The
Surfaces are now differentially inked as follows:

Anterior half of the right lobe of thyroid is marked blue,
Anterior half of the left lobe of thyroid is marked orange,
Posterior surfaces are marked black.

The apex of the right lobe of the thyroid is marked with a long black suture. The right lobe is serially
sectioned perpendicularly through the superior~intertor long axis to reveal a fairly circumscribed.
variegated, dense, light gray to softened tumor (1.8 x 1.3 x 1 cm) with papillary features, positioned in the
inferior half or the lobe and within 1 mm of the posterior and 1 mm of the anterior. and 2 mm of the
inferior margins. A representative portion of this lesion is submitted for Onoogenotyping studies. The
lesion is entirely submitted for routine histology. The remainder of the superior third of the lobe
demonstrates a meaty. deep red-tan appearance, without additional discrete lesions.

The isthmus demonstrates a meaty deep red appearance. The left lobe is now serially sectioned
perpendicularly through the superior-interior long axis, to reveal a large gelatinous, yeltow-gray nodule,
replacing the upper two«thirds of the lobe, and measuring upwards of 2.7 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm. The remaining
cut sections of the inferior aspect of the lobe demonstrates a meaty, deep red appearance, without
additional discrete nodularily. The thyroid tissue is entirely submitted for microscopic evaluation.

Cassette summary:

AlaAe) right thyroid. superior to inferior,

A7) isthmus.

A8-A12) left lobe of thyroid. superior to interior,

B. Part B is labeled central lymph node. initially received in the fresh state is a lobular fragment of
yellow~tan fatty soft tissue. 1.8 x1? x 0.6 cm. Sectioning demonstrates rubbery, yellow~gray fibrofatty soft
tissue with a single discrete lymph node, 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The lymph node candidate is submitted
within a ﬁlter bag in B1 and the remainder of the fatty soft tissue is submitted in 82 for microscopic
evaluation.

Microscopic Description:
A. Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic ﬁndings are reflected in the diagnosis
rendered.
