CLINICAL NOTES

PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Cecal cancer

GROSS DESCRIPTION

to

Received fresh for tissue procurement labelled "right

colon" is a previously unopened 25 cm segment of proximal
right colon with attached 21 cm of distal ileum surfaced by smooth
to slightly scabrous tan—pink serosa with a copious amount of
attached mesocolon, mesentery, and unremarkable omentum. No
appendix is identified grossly. The proximal and distal margins
measure 4.5 and 10.2 cm in circumference respectively. On opening,
there is a moderately well—circumscribed, 5.0 x 4.2 cm rubbery
tan—white—red tumor mass located 3.5 cm distal to the ileocecal
valve. A portion of tumor and a portion of normal mucosa are
submitted for tissue procurement as requested. On sectioning, the
tumor measures up to 0.8 cm in thickness, grossly extending into
muscularis to within 0.15 cm of the inked free radial serosal
surface (see blocks 2—4). Two additional sessile rubbery pale tan
polypoid lesions measuring 0.4 and 1.0 cm in greatest dimension are
present 8 and 2 cm distal to the aforementioned tumor (see blocks 6
and 7 respectively). The ileal and remaining uninvolved colonic
mucosa are unremarkable glistening tan—pink with regular folds and
the walls average 0.5 cm in thickness. Multiple soft to slightly
rubbery tan—pink tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up

1.4 cm in greatest dimension are recovered from the attached
mesocolon and mesentery. Representative sections are submitted in
15 blocks as labelled. RS—15.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — proximal and distal margins; 2—4 — tumor

full—thickness to inked free radial serosal surface; 5 — tumor to
normal; 6 — small additional polypoid lesion; 7 — bisected larger
additional polypoid lesion; 8 — random ileum; 9 — ICV; 10 — random

colon; 11—12 — eight whole lymph nodes per cassette; 13 — s whole
lymph nodes; 14—15 — five whole lymph nodes per cassette.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Histologic type: Invasive adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified.
Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated.
Primary tumor (pT): Tumor invades into muscularis propria, no

invasion into pericolonic fat is identified and the serosal surface
is negative for tumor (pT2).

Proximal margin: Negative for tumor.

Distal margin: Negative for tumor.

Circumferential (radial) margin: Not truly applicable, but the
serosal surface is negative for tumor.

 

Distance of tumor from closest margin: 20 cm from distal margin

Vascular invasion: Not identified.

Regional lymph nodes (pN): Twenty—six lymph nodes are dissected

from the specimen. They are all negative for metastatic tumor
(pN0).

Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: Not identified.

Distant metastasis (pM): Could not evaluate, pMX.

Other findings: One tubular adenoma is identified and one serrated

adenoma is identified. Random sections of colon and small

intestine

are unremarkable.

Invasive adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, invasive
into muscularis propria (pT2).
Twenty—six lymph nodes negative for metastatic tumor (pN0).
One tubular adenoma and one serrated adenoma.
