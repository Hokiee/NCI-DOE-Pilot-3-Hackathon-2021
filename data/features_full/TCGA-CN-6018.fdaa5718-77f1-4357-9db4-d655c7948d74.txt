My s1gnature 1s attestation that I have personally reviewed the submitted
material(s) and the final diagnosis reﬂects that evaluation.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in eleven parts.

Part 1 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
labeled "left mandibular mass." It consists of a 1.0 X 1.0 X 0.5 cm portion
of soft, tan, friable tissue and bone. The specimen is received for
intraoperative consultation and is resubmitted in cassette lAFS. The
remaining unfrozen portion is submitted in cassette lDR.

Part 2 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
labeled "left mandibular mass, Part 2." It consists of two fragments of soft,
tan-pink tissue, 1.3 X 1.0 X 0.4 cm and 1.7 X 1.2 X 0.5 cm. The specimen is
received for intraoperative consultation and is entirely resubmitted in
cassette 2AFS.

Part 3 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
labeled "proximal inferior alveolar nerve, inked true margin." It consists of
a 0.3 X 0.2 X 0.3 cm portion of soft, tan tissue received for intraoperative
consultation and is entirely resubmitted in cassette 3AFS.

Part 4 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
labeled "left ﬂoor of mouth, suture anterior." It consists of a 4.0 X 0.4

X 0.3 cm portion of pink-tan, soft tissue. The specimen is inked black at the
site of the suture and green at the opposite end. The specimen is received for
intraoperative consultation and is entirely resubmitted in cassette 4AFS.
Part 5 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
labeled "left buccal margin, suture anterior, inked new margin." It consists
of a 1.5 X 0.7 X 0.5 cm portion of pink-tan, soft tissue. The specimen is
inked black at the site of the suture. The specimen is received for
intraoperative consultation and is entirely resubmitted in cassette 5AFS.
Part 6 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
labeled "left gingival labial margin, suture anterior, inked new margin." It
consists of a 2.0 X 0.6 X 0.4 cm portion of soft, pink-tan tissue. The site of
the suture is inked black. The specimen is received for intraoperative
consultation and is entirely resubmitted in cassette 6AF.

Part 7 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
labeled "symphyseal marrow." It consists of fragments of tissue and bone, 0.3
X 0.3 X 0.3 cm in aggregate. The specimen is received for intraoperative
consultation and is entirely resubmitted in cassette 7FS.

Part 8 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
labeled "left retromolar trigone, inked new margin." It consists of a 1.5 X
0.5 X 0.4 cm portion of pink-tan, soft tissue. The specimen is received for

intraoperative consultation and is entirely resubmitted in cassette 8AFS.

Part 9 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and

labeled "left composite resection, suture anterior." It consists of a 10.0 X

6.0 X 5.0 cm left composite resection with a portion of mandible (ramus -- 5.0

X 3.4 X 0.6 cm, body -- 5.5 X 2.1 X 1.2 cm), submandibular gland (2.5 X 1.8 X
1.0 cm), skin ellipse (3.5 X 1.2 cm) and mucosa (6.0 X 5.0 cm). A suture

marks the anterior mucosa.

Within the center of the mucosa is a 4.0 X 4.5 cm ulcerated lesion with
white-tan, friable tissue in the ulcerated cavity extending to a depth of 1.5

cm. The mandible has a fracture in an area of gross tumor involvement between
the ramus and the body. The attached skin ellipse is not grossly involved by
tumor. The normal mucosa surrounding the tumor averages 0.5 cm in width. A
1.4 X 1.4 X 1.1 cm grossly positive lymph node is present in the deep soft

tissues between the submandibular gland and the tumor. The lymph node
metastasis is discretely separated from the tumor by 0.2 cm.

Ancillary studies:

Normal, prim tumor and metastatic tumor to a lymph node are banked for the
head and neckah tissue bank.

Digital photograp s are taken.

Ink Code:

Black - Floor of mouth

Blue lateral

Red - banking sites.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

9ADR anterior mandibular bone shave margin

9BDR posterior mandibular bone shave margin

9CDR-9DDR representative sections of mandible at fracture and closest tumor
9E section of grossly positive lymph node in relationship to main tumor
9F representative section of tumor with normal mucosa

9G representative section of submandibular gland in relationship to tumor and
positive lymph node (same lymph node as in 9E)

9H representative section of uninvolved skin in relationship to tumor.

Part 10 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
labeled "left neck, levels 2, 3, 4." It consists of a 14.0 X 6.0 X 1.0 cm
portion of yellow, lobulated adipose tissue with thin, pink ﬁbrous strands.
Multiple possible lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.3-2.0 cm in
greatest dimension.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

10A - one possible lymph node, bisected from level 2

10B possible lymph nodes from level 2

10C - possible lymph nodes from level 3

10D possible lymph nodes from level 4.

Part 11 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
labeled "right neck levels 1, 2 and 3." It consists of an 8.0 X 5.0 X 1.5 cm
portion of ﬁbroadipose tissue with an attached submandibular gland (3.3 X 2.0
X 1.0 cm), and vessel (4.5 cm long X 0.3 cm in diameter). Multiple possible
lymph nodes are identiﬁed.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

11A representative section of submandibular gland

11B possible lymph nodes from level 1

11C possible lymph nodes from level 3

11D possible lymph nodes from level 2.
