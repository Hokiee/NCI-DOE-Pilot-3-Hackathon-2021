Pathology Report
DIAGNOSIS
(A) RIGHT KIDNEY:
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL, FUHRMAN'S NUCLEAR GRADE 3.
(SEE COMMENT)
TUMOR CONFINED TO THE KIDNEY.
TUMOR MEASURES 5.5 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION.
Ureteral, vascular and soft tissue margins are free of tumor.
Renal medullary interstitial tumor (0.2 cm).

COMMENT

The renal cell carcinoma is composed of approximately 70% clear cells
and 30% eosinophilic cells. Centrally, the tumor demonstrates an area
of marked hyalinization. There is no unequivocal tumor extension into
the perinephric adipose tissue. The tumor abuts the renal sinus without
invasion into the adipose tissue.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) RIGHT KIDNEY, EN BLOC - A nephrectomy specimen (18.0 x 10.0 x 9.0 cm). The kidney measures 12.0 x 7.0 x 5.0 cm with
attached grossly unremarkable segment of ureter measuring 4.0 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter.

A 5.5 x 5.5 x 5.0 cm, irregular mass is identified at the lower pole of the kidney. The tumor has variegated cut surfaces
with hemorrhagic areas, a central ﬁrm ﬁbrotic tan-yellow area and a peripheral fleshy areas. The tumor appears to abut the
perinephric adipose tissue without unequivocal invasion. The tumor approaches the renal sinuses. However, no gross tumor is
identiﬁed in the adipose tissue of renal sinus. No tumor is identified within the renal vein or renal calyces.

Four small tan-white, well-circumscribed nodules measuring 0.3 cm in maximum dimension each are identiﬁed within the
renal medulla. The rest of the renal parenchyma is unremarkable. No lymph node or adrenal gland is identified. A small portion of
the tumor is submitted for possible microscopic study. Specimen photographs are taken.

SECTION CODE: A1, resection margins of renal vein, ureter, renal artery; A2, A3, tumor with perinephric adipose tissue;
A4-A6, representative sections from the central ﬁrm and ﬁbrotic area; A7-A9, representative sections of the tumor from the
hemorrhagic area; A10-A12, representative sections of the tumor from the ﬁeshy area; A13, A14, tumor with renal sinus; A15, four
small medullary nodules; A16, representative sections of the uninvolved kidney. -

CLINICAL HISTORY
None given.
