RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR CELL) TYPE, FUHRMAN
NUCLEAR GRADE 3 (6.0 CM).
TUMOR FOCALLY INVADES THE RENAL SINUS FAT.
LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION PRESENT.
Vascular and soft tissue margins, no tumor present.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) RIGHT KIDNEY EN BLOC LYMPH NODES ~ A nephrectomy specimen (23.0 x
14.0 x 6.0 cm, overall measurement) with kidney (13.0 x 8.0 x 5.0 cm)

and attached 11.0 cm segment of ureter (0.5 cm in circumference).

A tumor (6.0 x 5.0 x 4.0 cm) is present in the lower pole and mid pole

of the kidney. it is mostly tan, focally yellow with myxold areas. The
tumor is confined to the kidney and does not involve perinephric fat.
There are focal areas where possible renal sinus invasion may be
present. The renal pelvis is tan and smooth. The uninvolved renal
parenohyma appears unremarkable. The hilar vessels are not involved by
tumor.

SECTION CODE: A1, hilar vascular margins and ureteral margin;
A2-A7, tumor and renal sinus; A8, tumor and renal pelvis; A9-A10, tan
portion of tumor; A11-A12, yellow portion of tumor; A13-A14, myxoid
areas of tumor; A15. uninvolved renal parenchyma; A16, tumor to
perinephric fat; A17, one possible lymph node.

(8) LEFT ADRENAL -An adrenal gland with surrounding fatty tissue (5.0
x 2.0 x 1.5 cm). Cut section reveals a tan-yellow-red,
well-circumscribed mass (1.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm).

lNK CODE: Blue - surrounding adrenal tissue.

SECTION CODE: B1, adrenal vein margin; 52-134, adrenal tumor; B5,
uninvolved adrenal parenchyma

CLINICAL HISTORY
None given.
