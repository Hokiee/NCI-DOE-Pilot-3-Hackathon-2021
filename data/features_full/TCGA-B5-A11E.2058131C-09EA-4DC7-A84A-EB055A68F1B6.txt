GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries (AF1)", re 'ved fresh for

frozen section and transferred to formalin at -on is a 186 gram,
9.8 x 9.2 x 5.2 cm uterus. The cervix is amputated and per surgeon was
macerated during surgery. The separate portion of cervix measures 3.5 x 2.6 x
1.9 cm and demonstrates a tan smooth ectocervix with a 1.3 cm 05. The
endocervical canal is covered with a tan—yellow mucosa which focally appears
friable. The endometrial cavity is 6.5 (cornu to cornu) x 7.3 cm (to point of
cervical amputation) is filled with a 7.8 x 5.5 x 2.1 cm friable fungating
mass. The tumor primarily involves the anterior wall but extends over the
fundus partially onto the posterior wall to within 1.1 cm of the amputation
site of the cervix. The tumor is focally necrotic and invades 1.1 cm into a
1.6 cm myometrium. A representative section of the tumor is frozen as AFl
(remnant Al). The remaining endometrium is tan and approximately 1 mm in
thickness. The myometrium which is on average 2 cm thick is tan and partially
trabeculated with one intramural white whorled nodule, up to 0.7 cm,
consistent with leiomyoma. The serosal surface is tan and smooth with no
gross abnormalities identified.

The right fallopian tube, 8.5 cm long is distally dilated to 1.7 cm in

diameter. Proximally, the diameter is 0.4 cm. The surface of the right
'~" . fallopian tube demonstrates focal yellow discoloration and opening the tube
reveals a cystically dilated tube with yellow studding of the luminal
surface. The cystic dilated portion is filled with brown—red liquid. The
right ovary, 3.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm, is grossly unremarkable. The left fallopian
tube, 8 cm long x 0.5 cm in diameter, and left ovary, 2.5 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm, are
grossly unremarkable.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: Hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and lymph node
dissection

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 7th Edition): pTx pNo pr

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

RIGHT OVARY: FREE OF TUMOR.
RIGHT FALLOPIAN TUBE: CHRONIC SALPINGITIS WITH ASSOCIATED HYDROSALPINX.
FIBROVASCULAR ADHESIONS.
SINGLE FREE FLOATING FRAGMENT OF TUMOR IN TUBAL
LUMEN, SEE COMMENT.

LEFT OVARY AND FALLOPIAN TUBE: DETACHED FRAGMENT OF ADENOCARCINOMA
PRESENT. SEE COMMENT.

COMMENT: There is a freely—floating, minute cluster of tumor cells'within in
a cystic space in the right fallopian tube. It is not clear whether this

represents a contaminant ("floater" . Additionally, there is a free floating
fragment of adenocarcinoma with surrounding smooth muscle found in the section

of the left fallopian tube and ovary, not invading either of these tissues. As
with the right tube, it possible this represents a contaminant.

B. "RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE" (LYMPHADENECTOMY):

EIGHT LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (O/B).

C. "LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES" (LYMPHADENECTOMY):

TWELVE LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (0/12).

D. “LEFT PARAAORTIC LYMPH NODE" (LYMPHADENECTOMY):

ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (O/l).

E. "RIGHT PARAAORTIC LYMPH NODES (LYMPHADENECTOMY):

THREE LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (0/3).
