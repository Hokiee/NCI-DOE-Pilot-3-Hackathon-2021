Gross Description

A. The specimen is received fresh for OR. consult labeied “spleen and panoreas (check margin},
homo section". The specimen comaiats of a renewed portion of the pancreas with adjacent spleen
{14.5 x 9.0 'x, 7.6 cm). The pancreas measures 6.5 x 4.0:: 2.5 cm). A palpable mass is groasly
appreciated. The overlying tissue is marked with blue ink. Serial sections reveal a partially calcified
brown—tan iii-deﬁned mass {3.0 x 2.3 x 2.3:}. The mass is located 433 cm from the pancreatic surgical
margin of resection abutting the ovenying soft home. A portion of the tumor is taken and submittea for
W section an FSAE. The nancreatic margin is removed tangentiaﬂy and entirety submitted tor
frozen sections FEM and FSAZ. We pancreatic duct is prooatent and grosstyfrce of tumor. The
remaining pancreatic parenchyma is grossly unremarkable. The attached :spleen measures 31.5 x 5.5
x 5.5 cm. The capsule is red brown and intact. Cut surface exhibits a grossly unremarkable spleen
parenchymat Adjacent to the tissue is a moderate amount of fat {25.0 x 9.0 x 2.0 cm}, A
repmentative section of the tumor is submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory. Permanent
representative sections ate submitted following decalciﬁcaticn as:
