DIAGNOSIS

(A) LEFT KIDNEY:
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (50% CLEAR CELLS AND 50% EOSINOPHILIC CELLS), FUHRMAN'S NUCLEAR GRADE

4. TUMOR EXTENDS INTO THE PERINEPHRIC ADIPOSE TISSUE AND RENAL SINUS ADIPOSE TISSUE. TUMOR EXTENDS iNTO THE
RENAL VEIN. (SEE COMMENT)

VASCULARILYMPHATiC INVASION PRESENT.

TUMOR MEASURES 14.0 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION.

Vascular, ureteral and soft tissue margins of resection free of tumor.
(8) BIOPSY OF LEFT LIVER MASS:

Hepatic parenchyma with adjacent fibrosis. (See comment)
(C) LEFT ADRENAL GLAND:

METASTATIC RENAL CELL CARCINOMA IN ADRENAL GLAND.
(D) SPLEEN:

Spleen, no tumor present.

One hilar lymph node, no tumor present.

COMMENT
The renal cell carcinoma extends into the intrarenal portion of the renal vein. In addition to extending into the renai vein, the tumor is

also present in large vessels in the renal sinus adipose tissue. The biopsy of left liver mass (specimen B) demonstrates hepatic
parenchyma and adjacent fibrosis. No histologic evidence of metastatic carcinoma is identified; however, the biopsy may not be
representative of the entire lesion. Correlation with the radioiogic and clinical findings and a re-hiopsy are suggested if clinically

indicated.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
(A) LEFT KIDNEY - A left nephrectomy specimen with attached perirenal fat (25.0 x 14.0 x 10.0 cm, overall).There is a variegated
yellowllight tanired, partially cystic, partially necrotic tumor (14 x 9 x 9 cm) in the mid pole of the kidney. The tumor
focally extends into the perirenal fat. Focally, the tumor is 0.1 cm from Gerota's fascia. There is tumor in the intrarenal vein. Tumor Is
also focally within the renal sinus. The vein, artery, and ureter margins are grossly free of tumor.
There is a 0.4 cm nodular Eight—taniwhite mass in the cortex, in the lower pole, separate from the main tumor mass. Otherwise, the renal
parenchyma away from tumor is unremarkable.
Sections of tumor are submitted for possible electron microscopy study. Tumor is submitted for tumor bank.

INK CODE: Black - Gerota's fascia

SECTION CODE: A1, tumor approaching Gerota's; A2, additional tumor approaching Gerota's; A3, tumor In lntrarenal vein; A4, 0.4
cm noduiar mass away from main tumor; A5-7, tumor in renal sinus; A8-A15, additional representative tumor; A16, unremarkable kidney;
A17, renal vein, artery and ureter margins on face.
(B) BIOPSY OF LEFT LIVER MASS — A tan-red core liver biopsy measuring 2.0 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm. Entire specimen submitted in B for frozen
section.

*FSIDX: RARE ATYPICAL CELLS AND MARKED FIBROSIS, DEFER TO PERMANENT.
(C) LEFT ADRENAL GLAND - An adrenai gland and attached periadrenai adipose tissue (8.0 x 5.0 x 3.5 cm, overali) including the
adrenal gland (5.0 x 3.1 x1.1 cm, 40 grams). There is a well-circumscribed 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm medullary based
hemorrhagic fleshy tan nodule that is grossly 0.2 cm from the nearest parenchymai margin. At the opposite edge is a cystic area (1.0 x
1.0 x 0.8 cm) and the cyst contents are composed of hemorrhage and a smooth 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm fleshy tan nodule.

INK CODE: Black, parenchymai margin.

SECTION CODE: 01, suprarenal vessel margins; C2-C3, first nodule; 04-05 cystic area; CB, cyst contents.-
(D) SPLEEN - A spleen (13.0 x 8.0 x 4.5 cm). The capsular surface has an overlying post-surgical clot measuring 6.0 x
1.0 x 1.0 cm. Spleen shows mild red pulp expansion and prominent white puip modularity but no masses.

SECTION CODE: D1-DZ, representative sections of spleen; DS, splenic hilar fat with one possible lymph node.-
