Squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. [io‘bﬁﬂq

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Right lowar lobe wedge", received fresh for frozen section and placed in
formalin at . is a 3.88 gram and 7 x 1.9 x 1 cm wedge of lung.
The pleura is grossly unremarkable. The staple line is removed and the
underlying surgical resection margin inked blue.

Sectioning demonstrates five distinct‘well-circumscribed firm white nodules.
Module 1 (representative frozen as AFI) measures 0.7 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm and
directly underlies the pleura. Nodule 2 measures 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm and
directly underlies both the pleural surface and the resection margin. Module
3 measures 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm and directly underlies the pleural surface and
the resection margin. Module 4 measures 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm and directly
underlies the pleural surface opposite the resection margin. Module 5
measures 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm and directly underlies the pleural surface. The
uninvolved parenchyma appears grossly unremarkable.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Al~ representative nodule 1 (frozen remnant AFl)

AZ— representative nodule 2 (approximately 90%)

A3- representative nodule 3 (approximately 80%)

A4- representative nodule 4 (larger fragments, larger nodule, approximately
80%) and representative nodule 5 (smaller fragment, smaller nodule,
approximately 90%)

A5~ representative uninvolved parenchyma

B. "Right upper lobe wedge“, received fresh for frozen section and placed in
formalin at is a 3.95 gram and 5.2 x 1.9 x 1 cm wedge of

lung. The pleural surface is grossly unremarkable. The staple line is
removed and underlying resection margin is inked blue. Three discrete
well—circumscribed firm white nodules are identified. Nodule 1 measures 0.5 x
0.4 x 0.4 cm and comes to within 0.1 cm of the nearest overlying pleural
surface. A representative section of nodule l is submitted for frozen section
as BFl. No remaining nodule l is identified in the fixed tissue. Nodule 2
measures 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm and comes to within 0.1 cm of the nearest pleural
surface and 0.4 cm of t e nearest resection margin. Nodule 3 measures 0.3 x
0.3 x 0.2 cm and directly underlies the pleural surface and comes to within
0.5 cm of the nearest resection margin. Nodule 4 measures 0.1 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm.
The uninvolved lung parenchyma is grossly unremarkable.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

81- representative module 1 (frozen remnant BFl)

BZ- parenchyma adjacent to nodule

B3- representative nodule 2 (approximately 50%)

B4~ representative nodule 3 (approximately 90%)

BS— representative normal parenchyma and nodule 4.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
A. "Right lower lobe wedge”:AFl (rep of nodule)-squamous cell carcinoma.

B. ”Right upper lobe wedge":BF1 (rep of nodule)~squamous cell carcinoma

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

\_

Microscopic examination is performed,

DIAGNOSIS:
A. RIGHT LOWER L088 (WEDGE RESECTION}:

LUNG TISSUE FOSITIVK FOR MULTIPLE PLEURAL BASED SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMAS,
MORPHOLOGICALLY CONSISTENQ WITH METASTASIS FROM ESOPHAGEAL PRIMARY.
SEE COMMENT.

TUMOR SIZE: 5 NODULEE w 0.1 T0 0.7 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSIOR.

OPERATIVE MARGIN: FREE OF TUMOR.

B. RIGHT UPPER LOSE (WEQGE RESECTION):

LUNG TISSUE POSITIVE FOR MULTIPLE yLEURAL SASED SQUAMOUS CELL CARCIKOMAS,
MORPHOLOGICALLY CONSISTENT WITH METASTASIS $ROM ESOPHAGEAL PRIMRRY.
SEE COMMENT. ‘

TUMOR SIZE: 4 HODULES * 0.1 T0 Q.5 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION.

OPﬁRATIVE MARGIR: FREE OF TUMOR.

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS: SMALL AIRWAYS DISEASE.

COMMENT: Per medical record, the patiant has a history of squamous cell
carcinoma of the esophagus. No pathology from the esophagus is available for
review and comparison to the current case. The above tumor nodules are well
circumscribed and peripherally located. This distribution and morphologic
appearanca favors metastatic Equamous carcinoma.

I certify that I personally conducteé the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s} and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).
