and focally hemorrhagic areas noted. The anterior surface is inked red,
medial surface Blue, the lateral surface green, the superior and deep
margins black, and the inferior yellow. Sections through the remaining
tissue reveal red—tan skeletal muscle. areas of yellow tan soft tissue, and
thin bands of white tan tissue. Representative sections are suhmitted to
TPS, for permanent section, and photographs are taken.
