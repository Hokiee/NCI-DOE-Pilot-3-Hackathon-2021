B. Received fresh labeled with the patient’s name

designated "SENTINEL NODE #1 RIGHT SIDE" consists OI a 2.4 x 2.0 x 0 8 cm
irregular portion Of soft tissue. Sectioning reveals 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm
pink tan lymph node. The lymph node is unevenly bisected. The specimen is

entirely submitted as follows:

Bl: lymph node

designated "LEFT BREAST" consists of a 1321 gram mastectomy spGCImen
oriented with a short stitch superior and long lateral. The specimen
measures 28.0 cm superior to inferior, 23 cm medial to lateral, and 4.0 cm
anterior to posterior. The lightly pigmented superficial skin ellipse

superficial margin is inked blue. Serial sections reveal a well
circumscribed gritty pink tan mass involving the upper mid and upper inner
quadrant Of the breast. The mass measures 5.0 x 4.2 x 2.7 cm and is
located 3.0 cm from deep margin and 0.2 cm from superficial surface.
Located 1.0 cm from the mass, within the central portion of the breast, is
a 1.0 cm tan white rubbery nodule consistent with a fibroadenoma. The
emainder of the breast is composed of lObulated yellow tan adipose tissue
