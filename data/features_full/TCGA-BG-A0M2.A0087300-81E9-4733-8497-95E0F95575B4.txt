ENDOMETRIAL ADENOCARCINOMA, ENDOMETRIOID TYPE, FIGO GRADE 2, NUCLEAR GRADE 2.

THE TUMOR INVADES 59% OF THE MYOMETRIAL THICKNESS (1.0 CM INVASION OF 1.7 CM THICK

MYOMETRIUM).

THE TUMOR INVOLVES APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE ENDOMETRIAL CAVITY SURFACE.

CERVIX WITH BENIGN TUNNEL CLUSTERS AND CHRONIC CERVICITIS, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.

LYMPHOVASCULAR SPACE INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

THE BACKGROUND ENDOMETRIUM SHOWS COMPLEX ATYPICAL HYPERPLASIA AND POLYPS IN THE

LOWER UTERINE SEGMENT.

THE MYOMETRIUM SHOWS LEIOMYOMATA UTERI (0.5-2.5 CM).

BILATERAL OVARIES ARE UNREMARKABLE.

BILATERAL FALLOPIAN TUBES ARE UNREMARKABLE.
