GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1, NOT BLUE, IN VIVO 259, EX VIVO 332 - A tan-pink lymph node is 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm. The
specimen is serially sectioned and two touch preps are performed. Total A.
‘FS/DX: ONE LYMPH NODE, NO TUMOR PRESENT ON TOUCH PREPS.
3‘? SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2. RIGHT, BLUE. IN VlVO 21, EX VIVO 17 - A tan-pink lymph node with blue dye is 0.8 x 0.5 x
‘ .5 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned and two touch preps are performed. Total B.

'FS/DX: ONE LYMPH NODE, NO TUMOR PRESENT ON TOUCH PREPS.

 

(C) SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #3, RIGHT, NOT BLUE, IN VIVO 50. EX VIVO 71 - A tan-pink lymph node is 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm.
The specimen is serially sectioned and two touch preps are performed. Total C.

'FS/DX: ONE LYMPH NODE, NO TUMOR PRESENT,

(D) RIGHT SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY, SHORT STITCH SUPERIOR, LONG STITCH MEDIAL - An oriented right segmental
mastectomy specimen (6.0 x 6.0 x 3.0 cm). The specimen is oriented as short stitch superior, long stitch medial.

The specimen is serially sectioned sequentially from lateral to medial aspect in seven slices. The cut surface reveals the
most lateral aspect (slice #1) towards medial aspect (slice #5), a white firm lesion (1.5 x 1.0 cm). The lesion is distant
approximately 0.5 cm from closest to superficial margin, 0.4 cm from closest lateral margin, 0.4 cm from closest inferior margin,

1.5 cm from closest superior margin, and 2.0 cm from closest deep margin.

INK CODE: Superficial - yellow, superior - blue, interior - green, medial and lateral - red, and deep margin - black.

SECTION CODE: Slice #1, most lateral aspect, Di -D3, in perpendicular sections; slice #2, D4, tumor including superficial
margin; D5, superior margin; D6, inferior margin; D7, deep margin; slice #3, ea. tumor including superficial margin; D9, section
including superior and deep margin; D10, section including superficial and inferior margin; slice #4; D11, tumor including
superficial margin; 012, section including superior and deep margin; D13, section including inferior and deep margin; 014, section
including deep margin; slice #5; D15. tumor including superficial and superior margin; 016, section including superior and deep
margin; D17, section including superficial and inferior margin, slice #6; 018, section adjacent to the tumor, slice #7; 019, D20,
representative sections in perpendicular, most medial aspect.

(E) SECOND SUPERFICIAL INFERIOR AND LATERAL MARGINS CLIPS ON TRUE MARGIN, SHORT STITCH ANTERIOR.
LONG STITCH SUPERIOR - An oriented irregular fragment of adipose tissue 4.0 x 4.0 x 0.8 cm. The specimen is oriented as clip
on true margin, short stitch anterior, long stitch superior. The specimen is serially sectioned sequentially from superior to inferior. .

INK CODE: Anterior-yellow, true margin-black. l‘ %

SECTION CODE: E1-E7, entirely submitted from superior to interior. '
(F) ADDITIONAL INFERIOR MARGIN CLIPS MARK TRUE MARGIN - An oriented irregular fragment of adipose tissue (3.5 x 2.0
x 0.8 cm). The specimen is oriented as clip on true margin. The true margin is inked in black. The specimen is serially sectioned
and entirely submitted in F1-F4. -

(G) LEFT EXCISIONAL BIOPSY. SHORT STITCH SUPERIOR, LONG STITCH MEDIAL - An oriented lett excisional biopsy
specimen (3.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm). The specimen is oriented as short stitch superior, long stitch medial (%

The specimen is serially sectioned sequentially from medial to lateral aspect in six slices. The cut surface reveals fibrous ‘
area and also on slice #3, a surgical coil is present, distant approximately 0.5 cm from closest superior margin. 0.7 cm from
closest superficial margin and 0.5 cm from closest deep margin. No tumor is grossly identified.

INK CODE: Superficial - yellow, superior - blue, interior - green, medial and lateral - red, and deep margin - black.

SECTION CODE: Slice #1. most medial aspect, entirely submitted in perpendicular in 61-63. Slice #2, G4, superior
aspect including margin; G5, inferior aspect including margin; slice #3, G6, superior aspect including margin; G7, inferior aspect
including margin; slice #4, G8, superior aspect, including margin; G9, interior aspect, including margin; slice #5, G10, superior
aspect including margin; G1 1, interior aspect including margin; slice #6, most lateral aspect; G12, G13, entirely submitted in
perpendicular.
