greatest aimennion. All identiﬁiad lymph nodes are examined by frozen
section and entirely submitted.

4). The specimen is received freah for frozen section consultation,
labeled ”Level seven subcarinal lymph nodes“ and consists of two pieces of
pink ten tissue measuring 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm each. Entirely submitted for

frozen section-

5). The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation. labeled
"Right upper lobe lung wedge“ and consists of a lung wedge measuring 5.3 x
2.4 x 2.2 cm. The pleural surface is pink—tan and smooth, with a cantraily
located white tan and slightly puckered indurnbea area identifiea.
sectioning through this area reveals a 2 x 1.8 x 0-9 cm whitHAban
ill-defined nubpleural tumor nodule, which is loeated 0.2 cm from the
nearest stapled margin. The remainder of the lung parenohyma is redwtan
and spongy with dilateé areas iﬁentifiad. Representative sections of the
nodule are submittaé for frozen section consultation, for permanent section

and the TPS.

8). The specimen is received fresh, later placed in termelin, labeleé
”Right lower lobe lung" and consists cE a lung lobe measuring 15 x 11.9 x
5-9 cm. A previous incision is identified at the eurfaca measuring 6.3 cm
in greatest dimension. This area has been autureﬁ shut. The bronchial and
varculur margins are identified, and appear grossly uninvolveﬁ by tumor.
Upon opening, the bronchus is £11196 with thick reﬁ-tan mucoid material. The
pleural surface is pink—tan and primarily smooth. Sectioning through the
previously indisad area reveals a 5.6 x 5.1 x 3.1 cm ill ﬂeEined gray ten
centrally located tumor mass. The mass appears 3.5 cm from the nearaat
stapled resection margin. 5.7 cm from the bronchial margin, and the edge of
the mass abuts the pleural surface- Sectioning through the mass reveals an
extensive area of subpleural dilated spaces partially surrounding the tumor.

Further sectioning shows the mASB abutting the distal bronchial wall of
the smaller portion of the bronchus. with partial possible obliteration of
the distal bronchiala noted. Sectioning through the remainder of the lung
reveals extensive areas of dilated spaces, and few rod tan epongy soft
areas.
