ACCESSION: OPER DATE: REG DOC.
PROCEDURE: VERIFIED BY: .
-year-old male with a history of dysphagia and epigastric pain diagnosed

with carcinoma at the esophagogastric jmction, presenting for

gastrectomy and colon interposition. The patient did not have preoperative

chemotherapy or radiation.
PROCEDURE: VERIFIED BY:

1. ”Retroperitoneal nodule. Rule out metastatic carcinoma." Received in a
small container is a 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm yellou soft tissue fragment. Serially
sectioned. No mass identified.

Frozen section control. -

2. ”Celiac/left gastric lymph node ? CA.” Received in a small container is a
1.0 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm red-brown-yellou soft tissue fragment.

Frozen section control.

3. ”Esophagus and proximal stomach.” Received in a large container is an
esophagogastrectomy including 8 cm of esophagus and an 8.2 x 5.0 cm portion of
stomach. .A 6.8 x 5.5 x 2.3 cm ulcerated, partially necrotic tuner mass arises
from what appears to be the esophagogaetric junction. Tumor extends
approximately 4.3 cm into the stomach and 2.0 cm into the esophagus above the
EB junction and involves approximately half of the esophageal circunference.
Tumor is multinodular and the edges are rolled and somewhat serpiginoua. The
tumor is 4.0 cm from the proximal esophagus margin and approximately 1 to 1.5
cm from the gastric margin. Portions of gastric margin at closest approach are
sampled for frozen section. Sectioning reveals the tumor appears to penetrate
through the mderlying muscle and into fat. Houever, the leading edge of the
tumor is surrounded by white-tan probable fibrosis and there is no clear
border between fibrosis and tumor. Tuner extends to within 0.5 cm, closest to
the deep fat/radial margin. Multiple enlarged lymph nodes are noted beneath
the tumor.
