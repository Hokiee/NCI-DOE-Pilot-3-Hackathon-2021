presentative section submitted for frozen section in AFl and frozen section
remnant is submitted as block Al.

B. “Brain tissue", received fresh and placed in formalin cum 3 pm
are two tan-brown hemorrhagic soft tissue fragments ranging ' o 3

cm. Representative sections submitted in blocks Bl—BZ.

C. "Brain tissue", received fresh and placed in formalin out 4 pm

is a 5.7 x 2.2 x 1.2 cm tan—red—brown soft fragment of tissue consistent with
brain representative section submitted in blocks C1—C4.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
A. "Brain tissue": AF1~ high grade glioma

MGMT PROMOTER METHYLATION REAL TIME FOR ANALYSIS

ReceiveWrom
is a copy 6 an MGMT Promoter Methylati

obtained at quest
of Dr. , on paraffin block“ ‘ The
complete report from is on file in the ’

Result:

MGMT PROMOTER METHYLATION NOT IDENTIFIED.

Note:

The specimen is considered negative for MGMT promoter methylation when
Methylation Index (MI) is less than 4. MI between 4 and 16 is considered as
low level methylation and should be interpreted with caution since the
significance of low level methylation in gliomas is not well understood. MI
greater than 16 is considered as methylated.

Background:

MGMT (O(6)—methylguanine—DNA methyltransferase) is a DNA repair enzyme
that is involved in the repair of damage caused by a variety of DNA
crosslinking compounds, including alkylating agents. Increased
methylation of the MGMT gene promoter region causes diminished or
silenced expression of the gene, making cells more sensitive to DNA
damage. This relationship has been shown for glioblastomas and
alkylating agents such as Temodar(R)(temozolomide).

Approximately 40% to 45% of glioblastoma multiforme (GEM) tumors
exhibit MGMT gene methylation. Retrospective studies have shown that
detection of MGMT promoter methylation in tumor samples is associated
with an increased likelihood of a favorable response to temozolomide.

Methodology:
DNA is isolated from formalin~fixed, paraffin—embedded (FFPE)
specimen. Molecular analysis of the MGMT gene is performed by
methylation—specific PCR. Molecular-based testing is highly accurate but
as in any laboratory test, rare diagnostic errors may occur.

Results of this test are for Investigational Purposes Only. The
performance characteristic of this assay have been determined by

The result should not be used as a diagnostic procedure
without confirmation of the diagnosis by another medically
established diagnostic product or procedure.
