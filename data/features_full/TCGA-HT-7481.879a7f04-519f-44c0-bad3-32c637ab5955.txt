Microscopic

Sections demonstrate a glial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates both gray and white matter. In
the gray matter, there is prominent perineuronal satellitosis as well as subpial surface spread.
Tumor cells have round nuclei with few apparent cytoplasmic processes. Many demonstrate
perinuclear halos. There is little cytologic atypia. No mitotic figures are seen. There is no
microvascular proliferation or necrosis.

Addendum discussion:

Numerous MlB-1 reactive cells are present throughout the specimen. A labeling index of 21% is
calculated. This is indicative of a markedly proliferative glial neoplasm. Despite this, no mitotic
figures are identified on the- stain and only a rare mitotic figure was indentified on the
immunohistochemistry. Consequently, the tumor must be classified as low grade/grade ll.
Nevertheless, the very high MlB-1 labeling index suggests more aggressive behavior. Close
clinical follow-up is indicated.

Final Addendum Diagnosis:

Oligodendroglioma, low grade, WHO grade II
