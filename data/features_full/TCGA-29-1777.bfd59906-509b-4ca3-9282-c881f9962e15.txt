CLINICAL HISTORY: ',
Abdominal pelvic swelling.

GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. "Omentum (AFl)", received fresh for frozen section is a 14 x 8 x 4 cm

segment of yellow-tan omentum with innumerable studded tumor nodules
throughout. A piece has been previously submitted as frozen section AFl and
the remnant is submitted in block Al. Additional sections are submitted in

block A2.

B. "Omentum“, received fresh and placed in formalin is an 11 x 7 x 2.5 cm
segment of yellow—tan omentum with innumerable tumor nodules throughout.
Representative sections submitted in block Bl.

C. "Right ovary". Received fresh is an adnexal specimen consisting of a 26.3
gram, 2 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm ovary and attached 4 x 0.2 cm fimbriated fallopian
tube. The cut surface in the ovary is homogeneous, white—tan. Attached to
the adnexal tiesue is a 3 x 3 x 2 cm mass of tumor and soft tisaue

adhesions. Representative tube and ovary are submitted in block Cl and
representative tumor submitted in block C2.

D. “Left tube and ovary", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 19.5 gram
adnexal specimen consisting of a 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm presumed ovary with
attached 4 x 3 x 2 cm exophytic tumor. A 3.5 x 0.2 cm fimbriated fallopian
tube is identified. Representative tube and ovary submitted in block Dl.
Representative periadnexal tissue is submitted in block D2.

E. "Uterus", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 400 gram, 11 x 9 x 7
cm uterus with attached 4 cm cervix with 0.5 cm patent cervical os. The
serosal surface is remarkable for a 5 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm attached calcified
leiomyoma with numerous oaked, white—tan possible tumor spreading a geographic
distribution throughout. The endometrium is markedly distorted by multiple
leiomyomata with no evidence of hemorrhage or necrosis. The endometrial
surface demonstrates no evidence of thickening or mass lesion. The
endometrium averages 0.1 cm thick and the myometrium averages 2.7 cm thick.
Representative sections submitted as follows:

BLOCK SWARY:

El- anterior cervix

E2~ posterior cervix

E3— endomyometrium

E4- caked serosal thickening
E5— calcified serosal leiomyoma
