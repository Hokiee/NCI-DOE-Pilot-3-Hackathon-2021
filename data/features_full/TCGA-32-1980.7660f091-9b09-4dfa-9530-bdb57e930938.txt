SPECIMEN SOURCE:

Right temporal brain tumor
GBM -—

CONTROL
CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS:

Right. temporal brain tumor .TCGA'32‘1980

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
Received fresh for frozen section labeled with the patient’s name.and “right
temporal brain tumor" are multiple fragments of ten soft tissue aggregating to
1.3 x 0.1 x 0.8 cm. A smear is made. Entirely frozen on one chuck. '

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:
GLIOBLASTOMA. - ‘

l '19

Tissue submitted for frozen is subsequently submitted for permanent in one
cassette.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
Permanent sections of the frozen section specimen demonstrates a high grade
glial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates parenchyma. There are large areas
of tumor necrosis, sometimes with pseudopalisading. The tumor cells resemble
moderately atypical fibrillary and occasionally gemistocytic astrocytes.
Microvascular proliferation is also seen. Scattered mitotic figures are
noted.

DIAGNOSIS:
(PROVISIONAL)

RIGHT TEMPORAL BRAIN TUMOR, FROZEN SECTION BIOPSY:
GLIOBLASTOMA. PENDING REVIEW 0? ADDITIONAL TISSUE.

ADDENDUM DISCUSSION:
1. Please see previous report.
2. Right temporal lobe and tumor
3. Intratumor hematoma

ADDENDUM GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1. Pleasa see previous report.

2. Received in formalin labeled with the patient’s name and "right temporal
lobe and brain tumor" are multiple portions of tan—gray brain aggregating to
4.5 x 4.0 x 1.8 cm. Representative sections are submitted in three cassettes.

3. Received in formalin labeled with the patient 5 name and "intratumor
hematoma" is a 2.0 r\1.8 x 1.0 cm tan— —red blood clot. The specimen is entirely
submitted in one cassette.

ADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS:
2. Sections. again, demonstrate a high grade glisl neoplasm consistent with
glioblestome. The tumor demonstrates extensive necrosis. At the edges, there
is infiltration into the perenchyms. Microvasculsr proliferation and mitotic
figures are also seen,

3. Sections consist almost entirely of acute blood clot. A thin rim of tumor
cells and reactive blood vessels is also seen.

ADDENDUM DISCUSSION:

Fewer than 10% of cells overall demonstrate immunoreactivity for MGMT. Tumor
cells immunoreactivity is limited to perinecrotic areas.

  

ADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS:

1, 2. RIGHT TEMPORAL DRAIN TUMOR, BIOPSY AND RESECTION:
GLIOBLASTOMA

- TUMOR CELLS NEGATIVE FOR MGMT EXPRESSION.
