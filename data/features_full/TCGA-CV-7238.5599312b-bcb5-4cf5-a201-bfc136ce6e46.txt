GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT SELECTIVE NECK DISSECTION LEVEL l - Received is a fragment of fatty tissue with attached glandular tissue.
Glandular tissue measures 3.5 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm. Fatty tissue measures 6.5 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm. Dissection of the fatty tissue reveals six

possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 x 0.5 cm up to 1.1 x 1.0 cm. The cut surface of the glandular tissue is unremarkable.
Entire nodes and representative sections of the glandular tissue are submitted.

SECTION CODE: A1, four possible lymph nodes; A2, one sectioned possible lymph node; A3, one sectioned possible
lymph node; A4, representative sections of the glandular tissue.

(B) LEFT SELECTIVE NECK DISSECTION, LEVEL II - Received are ﬁbrofatty fragments of soft tissue (3.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm).
Specimen is palpated to reveal ten possible lymph nodes (ranging from 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm up to 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm). Specimen
nodes are entirely submitted.

SECTION CODE: 81, four possible lymph nodes; B2 two ossible lymph nodes; B3, two possible lymph nodes; B4, one
possible lymph node bisected; BS, one possible lymph ”Mm
(C) LEFT SELECTIVE NECK DISSECTION, LEVEL lII - Re fragments of soft tissue (4.0 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm in
aggregate). The specimen is palpated and serially sectioned revealing ten possible lymph nodes (ranging from 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.2
cm up to 1.7 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm). The specimen nodes are entirely submitted.

SECTION CODE: C1, four po ‘ nodes; C2, three possible lymph nodes; C3, two possible lymph nodes; C4,
largest possible lymph node, bisected.
(D) LEFT SELECTIVE NECK DISSECTION, LEVEL IV - An irregular fragment of fat (2.5 cm).

SECTION CODE: D1, four possible lymph nodes; DZ, ﬁve possible lymph nodesﬁ
(E) LEFT PARTIAL GLOSSECTOMY, STITCH-ANTERIOR, CHECK ALL MARGINS PER AND DEEP - Received is a
left partial glossectomy specimen (8.0 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm) which has been sliced from anterior (slice 1) to posterior (slice 11).

Within slices 6-8 there is a scirrhous, white tumor (3.4 x 2.0 cm, 1.4 cm depth of gross invasion) which approaches the
nearest lateral gingival margin to 0.7 cm. The tumor approaches the nearest medial margin to 1.0 cm and the nearest deep
margin to 2.2 cm. No other lesions are identiﬁed. The margins are shaved and submitted for frozen section. Perpendicular
section through slices 6-8 in relationship to lateral margin are submitted for frozen section.

INK CODE: Black-deep margin; blue-medial margin; orange-lateral margin.

SECTION CODE: E1-E7, mucosal shaved margins, en face (please see diaphragm); E8-E10, perpendicular sections
through slices 6, 7, and 8, respectively; E11, slice 5 (anterior to tumor); E12, slice 6, e endicular section; E13, E14, slice 7,
bisected, perpendicular sections; E15-E17, slice 8, trisected, perpendicular sections.“

mucosal lined tissue. The true margin is re-inked blue.

INK CODE: Blue-true margin.

SECTION OD ‘ 1-F5, posterior gingival margin, serially sectioned and submitted entirely from anterior to posterior
for frozen section.
