FINAL DIAGNOSIS: ’°

RENAL MAss, LEFT. PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY —
A. RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, WITH FEATURES OF BOTH PAPILLARY IPAPILLARY TYPE 2) AND CLEAR CELL

(CONVENTIONAL) TYPES (one comment). pp» 155. duo nu {um

CARCINOMA MEASURES 1.7 cm IN GREATEST DIMENSION.

CARCINOMA Is CONFiNED TO THE KIDNEY. = 5‘2.

FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE Is 3 OF 4.

ALL SURGICAL MARGINs OF RESECTION ARE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.

NO LYMPHOVASCULAR iNVASlON Is sEEN.

LIMITED BACKGROUND RENAL PARENCHYMA WITH MODERATE MIXED AND FOCALLY

XANTHOGRANULOMATOUS INFLAMMATION, INCLUDING HEMOSIDERIN-LADEN MACROPHAGES.

PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE (AJCC 7th EDITION): p11: Nx Mx.

F PTWPPP

COMMENT:
Histologic sections show a malignant neoplasm composed of architecturally-crowded papillae of eosinophillc cells with
abundant etromai macrophages. Moreover, fool of cytologicaliy malignant cells with distinct Clear cell features are also
identified In the periphery of this lesion. Results of parafﬁn section Immunohlstochemical analysis also highlight both
cell populations (see microscopic description). thereby supporting the above rendered diagnosis.
