defect [8 x 13mm from assumed tumour banking. There 1s a suture on one long margin will be designated
12 o '.clock Serial sectioning reveals multiple pale tan to dark brown nodules to a depth of 22mm Some
small areas of necrosis noted within the mass One representative section through mid specimen showing
closest deep surgical margin embedded in Blocks A-C.

2. "RIGHT AXILLARY CLEARANCE". A piece of ﬁbrofatty tissue, 140 x 120 x 40mm weighing 250g.
There is a suture at one end indicating apex end, at this end is attached skeletal muscle 90 x 55 x 15mm.

MICROSCOPIC REPORT

1. "WIDE EXCISION MELANOMA IN TRANSIT RIGHT SHOULDER".

The sections show skin and underlying subcutis. Centered within the subcutis is a circumscribed tumour
nodule composed of large epithelioid, some of which include intracytoplasmic pigment, consistent with
metastatic melanoma. There are large central areas of necrosis. The tumour is about 1mm clear of the deep
margin and 9mm clear of the nearest peripheral margin. There is a peritumoral inﬁltrate of lymphocytes in
some areas and the overlying epidermis and dermis show some inﬂammatory changes.

ZH'RIGHT AXILLARY CLEARANCE".
The sections show metastatic melanoma' in one of sixteen lymph nodes. The involved lymph node (that
measured 30mm 1n maximum dimension macroscopically) IS extensively replaced by a pleomorphic

HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

epithelioid cell tumour consistent with metastatic melanoma. There is focal necrosis. Probably extra nodal
spread is present that is difficult to measure but is probably approximately
7 x 3mm.
