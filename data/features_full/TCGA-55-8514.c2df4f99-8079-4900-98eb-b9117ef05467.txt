FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

 

Source of Specimen:
A. Lung;Right lung upper lobe

B. Lymph node;Righty lung 2R node
C. Lymph node;4R node

Clinical HistomIOperative Dx:
Lung cancer upper right side (right upper lobe)

Gross Description:

A. Received in formalin is a 122 gram right upper lobe of lung, 12.7 x 11.5 x 3.8 cm. The pleura is
glistening, deep purple to light pink and tan. The main bronchial margin(s) extend out to 0.7 cm. an
aggregate of 1.8 cm in diameter, grossly uninvolved with tumor.

Within 2.5 cm of the bronchial margin a palpable mass is appreciated, and the overlying associated
pleura is now marked blue. Sectioning reveals an irregular, fairly well demarcated, light to deep gray
tumor mass, measuring upwards of 4.1 x 3.1 x 2.3 cm. The lesion abuts the overlying pleura. A

representative portion oftumor, paranormal, and normal uninvolved lung are submitted for
Oncogenotyping studies. The remaining cut sections of the lung demonstrates consolidated, deep red

parenchyma and spongy light pink and tan tissue, with moderate anthracotic pigmentation. No additional
nodularity appreciated. Representative sections are submitted for microscopic evaluation.

Cassette summary: A1) bronchial and vascular margins represented. A2) two hilar—interlobar lymph node
candidates, one bisected (blue), one intact (orange), A4-A5) representation of tumor mass and ad'acent
pleura, A6) tumor mass, adjacent uninvolved lung, A7) consolidated and ﬁbrotic lung represented.

 

B. Part B designated right lung, 2R node. Received in formalin are two light pink to speckled dark gray
lymph node candidates, 0.6 x 0.4 cm and 0.8 x 0.4 cm each. Multiple lymph nodes are submitted for

microscopic evaluation in B1 -

C. Part C designated right lung, 4R node. Received in formalin are two lymph node candidates, 1.5 x 0.6
cm and 2.4 x 1.3 cm each. Sectioning through both nodes demonstrates a deep pink to darken gray
speckled cut surface. The larger node is submitted trisected in C1 and the smaller node bisected and in

02.-

 

Microscopic Description:

A. Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic ﬁndings are reflected in the diagnosis
rendered. Four peribronchial lymph nodes are present. negative for metastasis.

B. Sections demonstrate one lymph node, negative for metastasis
