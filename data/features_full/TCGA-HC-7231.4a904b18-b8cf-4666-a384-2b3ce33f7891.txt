Gross Description.

Received in a single container labeled “ :-.:._.. ' ' - prostate"

Is a 53 gram previously inked partialiy sections markedly distorted
prostate gland with attached bilateral seminal vesicles. The
prostate gland on reconstruction is approximateiy 5.0 x 4.4 x 3.9 cm
and has a shaggy capsule. The urethra appears patent. The specimen
is step sectioned to reveal a bulging tan gray multinodular ﬁbrotic
cut surface with compression of the urethra by the lateral lobes.
Noted in the left posterior aspect extending to within 0.3 cm of the
apex there is a poorly defined approximately 2.2 x 1.6 x 1.0 cm area
of pale tan gray to yellow slightly indurated ﬁbroeis which focally
extends into the left lateral lobe and right posterior lobe. This
grossly focally extends to within 0.1 cm of the inked nearest

margin. This extends toward the mid region of the specimen. The
seminal vesicles together measure 5.0 x 2.0 x 0.9 cm. These have
lobulated outer surfaces with multicystic gray tan ﬁbrotic cut
surfaces. Also receive ' tainer are three tissue
cassettes each labeled Representative sections are
submitted as labeled as follows: A ~ radial apical (distal) margin.
left; B - radial apical (distal) margin, right; 0 - shave vesical
(proximal) margin; D - left lateral lobe distal; E - right lateral

lobe distal; F - left posterior lobe distal: G — right posterior

lobe distal: H - left lateral lobe mid region; I - right lateral

lobe mid region; J w left posterior lobe mid region; K , right

posterior lobe mid region; L - left lateral lobe proximal region; M

- right lateral lobe proximal region; N - left posterior lobe

 

 

proximal region; 0 - right posterior lobe proximal region; P -
origin of the seminal vesicles; Q — representative left seminal
vesicle; R w representative right seminal vesicle.
