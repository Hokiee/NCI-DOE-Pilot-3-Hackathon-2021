(A) LEFT KIDNEY:
CHROMOPHOBE RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, FUHRMAN'S NUCLEAR GRADE 3. (SEE COMMENT)
TUMOR CONFINED TO KIDNEY.
TUMOR MEASURES 3.9 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION.
Vascular, ureteral and soft tissue margins of resection, free of tumor.

COMMENT

The tumor is friable and distorted clusters of tumor cells are present in artifactual clefts and spaces between the renal parenchyma
and renal sinus adipose tissue. These areas are interpreted as representing artifactual displacement of tumor cells rather than true
extension into the adipose tissue. Multiple additional deeper sections were examined.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT KIDNEY - A nephrectomy specimen (12.0 x 6.5 x 5.0 cm) including the left kidney (10.5 x 5.5 x 4.0 cm), a segment of
the renal artery and the renal vein (1.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in average diameter) and ureter (13.0 cm in length and 0.2 cm in
average diameter).
There is a 3.9 x 3.4 x 1.5 cm well-circumscribed tumor in the upper pole of the kidney. The tumor is yellow-brown, abutting the
renal sinus and appears to be conﬁned to the kidney. The adjacent kidney parenchyma is unremarkable. The pelvicalyceal
system is smooth and devoid of any lesions. No lymph nodes are identiﬁed in the hilum of the kidney.

Portions of the tumor have been submitted for possible EM. Tumor is also submitted to the tumor bank.

SECTION CODE: A1, renal artery and vein margin; A2, ureter margin; A3, tumor with adjacent uninvolved kidney; A4-A7,
tumor with adjacent renal sinus and uninvolved kidney; A8, A9, tumor with adjacent uninvolved kidney; A10, tumor with adjacent
uninvolved kidney and perinephric fat; A11, uninvolved kidney, representative section. -

CLINICAL HISTORY
Left renal mass.
