Frozen Section Diagnosis: 10FS— BRONCHIAL MARGIN IS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

Gross Description: Received fresh for frozen section consultation labeled

" patient name and medical number, right middle lobe". It consists of a 120
gram right middle lobe oflung measuring 10.5 x 8.5 x 5.5 cm. The
bronchial margin is procured for frozen section and the residue is in

10F S. Elsewhere the pleura has a large smooth indurated area with a few
dark red adhesions and large palpable mass in the specimen. The vascular
margins are grossly unremarkable. Opening of the bronchial tree discloses
tumor coming to Within 1.0 cm from the margin and a few dark black hilar
nodes measuring up to 0.8 cm. There is alarge right middle lobe lung
tumor measuring 6.0 x 6.0 x 4.5 cm occupying approximately 30% of the
middle lobe. Representative sections are submitted IDA—G.
