Diagnosis

This concerns a tubulovillous adenoma of the colon mucosa with mild dysplasia of the
cylindrical epithelium (in I).

II concerns a right hemicolectomy preparation with a slightly differentiated mucinous
adenocarcinoma with histopathological differentiation grade G 3, with significant
extracellular mucus accumulation, with chronic recurrent inﬂammation, with acute
inﬂammatory activity, with fine focal necroses, with erosion of the inner surface of the
tumor, with tumor infiltration of the colon wall layers up to the pericolic fatty connective
tissue, with carcinomatous lymphangitis, with tumor-free lymph nodes (0/36), with
moderate chronic lymphadenitis, with chronic appendicitis and with tumor-free overview
slices from all other resection sections described.

In relation to the section preparations examined, the spreading of tumor of the colon
carcinoma corresponds to tumor stage p T 3, p N 0 (0/36), MX, L1, R0.
