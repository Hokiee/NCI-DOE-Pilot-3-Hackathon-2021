Diagnosis:

A. - H.) LUNG, LEFT UPPER LOBE, AND MEDIASTINAL LYMPH MODES, LOBECTOMY

WITH MEDIASTINAL LYMPH NODE BIOPSIES:
- INVASIVE MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA.

- TUMOR SIZE: 1.9 CM IN DIAMETER.
- TUMOR PRESENT IN THE SEPARATELY SUBMITTED LEFT UPPER

LOBE WEDGE RESECTION (SPECIMEN A).
- SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA IN SITU, PRESENT IN BRONCHI

IN THE VICINITY OF THE INVASIVE CARCINOMA.
- THE BRONCHIAL RESECTION MARGIN IS FREE OF TUMOR.
- FOCAL EMPHYSEMATOUS CHANGE IN LUNG TISSUE AWAY FROM TUMOR.

- NINE LYMPH NODES, No TUMOR PRESENT (we).
- THIS INCLUDES EIGHT MEDIASTINAL LYMPH NODES (N10L, N11L xz,

N6, N9L, N7), AND ONE PERIBRONCHIAL LYMPH NODE.

COMMENT: —as reviewed representative slides, and concurs

with the diagnosis of invasive squamous cell carcinoma.

Gross Description:

A. The specimen is labeled wedge excision left upper lobe and is received without ﬁxative. It consists of a
wedge resection of lung measuring 6.6 x 2 x 2.4 cm and having a partially ﬁxed weight of 11 grams. A
T-shaped metallic staple line is present along one edge of the specimen. The pleural surface is pink-tan

with anthracotic stippling. There is a palpable area of ﬁrmness in the central lung wedge. On sectioning,
this palpable ﬁrmness is a discrete tan neoplasm which measures 1.9 x 1.9 x 1.4 cm. Centrally, it appears

slightly ﬁbrotic. A representative section of the neoplasm is submitted for frozen section as FSA1. The
staple line is dissected free and the resection edge IS inked. On further sectioning, the neoplasm is 0.4 cm

from the closest staple line. The remainder of the lung wedge is composed of red soft pulmonary
parenchyma. Representative sections are submitted.

Section Summary: A1) representative section of neoplasm from frozen section, A2—A3) additional sections
of neoplasm and stapled resection line, A4) uninvolved lung.

 

B. The specimen is labeled left lung upper lobe and is received without ﬁxative. It consists of a lobe of

lung which measures 21 cm from superior to inferior, 11.5 cm from anteriorto posterior, and 3 cm from
medial to lateral. The pleural surface varies from tan to pink and there is extensive anthracotic stippling.

There is a Y—shaped metallic staple line present along the posterior apical surface of the lung which is 8
cm in length. A second metallic staple line extends across the medial surface of the lung and posteriorto

the hilum, extending to the basilar edge. At the hilum. the bronchial margin is identiﬁed and removed as
a thin Shave for frozen section as FSB1. There is a single 0.9 cm anthracotic peribronchial node.

Dissection of the bronchi reveals no intrabronchial tumor. The metallic staple line at the posterior apical
portion of the lung is 5 cm from the hilum. Serial sections of the lung reveal no discrete masses.
Representative sections are submitted.

C. The specimen is labeled -ymph node and is received in formalin. It consists of a 1 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm
anthracotic appearing lymph node. it is serially sectioned and submitted in cassette C1. -

 

D. The specimen is labele- lymph node and is received in formalin. It consists of a 1.6 x 0.9 x 0.5
cm dull red to anthracotic node. It is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in cassette D1 .-

 
 

E. The specimen is labels-lymph node and is received in formalin. It consists of m
aggregate of anthracotic appearing tissue fragments which are submitted in cassette E1.

F. The specimen is labeled .lymph node and is received in formalin. It consists of a 2.3 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm
fragment of ﬁbrofatty and anthracotic tissue. On dissection, it contains a 2.7 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm fragment of
anthracotic and ﬁbrofatty tissue. Within the fatty tissue are three smaller fragments of anthracotic tissue

which vary from 0.2-0.3 cm in maximum dimension. The larger node is seriall sectioned and submitted in
cassettes F1 and F2. The smaller fragments are submitted in cassette F3.

 

G. The specimen is labeled-and is received in formalin. It consists of a 1 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm fragment of
fatty tissue which contains a discrete 0.4 cm area of anthracotic discoloration. The specimen is submitted

intact in cassette G2.-

H. The specimen is labels. and is received in formalin. It consists of three fragments of predominantly
anthracotic tissue which vary from 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm to 0.5 cm in maximum dimension. The two largest

fragments are inked with contrasting colors. They are serially sectioned and combined with the remaining
tissue in cassette H1. -
