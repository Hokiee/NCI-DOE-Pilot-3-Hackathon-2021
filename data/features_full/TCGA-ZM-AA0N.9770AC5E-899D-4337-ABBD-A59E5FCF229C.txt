Pathohistological diagnosis
Seminoma testis (pTZ NXMX)

Description:

Testicle with cut tumor, size 8:625 cm, and 8 cm long funiculus was received. The tumor has
irregular edges, is white to brown in color, of medium consistency and is 825:4 cm in size.
Histologically, the tumor is made of solid seats and tumor cell traces with round and oval
blight nuclei in which we see small nuclei and scarce, bright and pink cytoplasm. Inside the
tumor, at microscope’s large visual ﬁeld, we see 3-4 mitosis. Around tumor seats we ﬁnd
connecting tissue containing moderately abundant lymphocyte inﬁltrates. Several channels
adjacent to tumor are coated with unclassiﬁed intratubular germ cell neoplasia (IGCNU).
Performed imunohistochemical dying (positive PLAP in all tumor cells and in unclassified
intratubular germ cell neoplasia) with morphological examination indicates that this is a
malign testicular tumor of germ origin, seminoma.

The tumor inﬁltrates tunica albuginea and is present in lumcns of several blood vessels inside
tunica albuginea. The tumor was not detected in funiculus.
