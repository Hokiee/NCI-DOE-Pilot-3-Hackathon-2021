CLINICAL HISTORY:
Breast cancer.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Breast tissue long stitch lateral, short stitch superior", in formalin.
Tissue has been sent for ER/PR studies. A 5 x 8.5 x 5 cm fragment of breast
tissue and ellipse of skin measuring 5 x 1 cm. The specimen is oriented such
that a long surgical suture is present at the lateral side of breast tissue
and a short surgical suture demarcates the superior portion of the specimen.
The external surface of the specimen is inked in blue. The specimen has been
previously sectioned revealing a densely fibrotic area of tissue with a
central reddish-brown nodule measuring 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm. Th reddish nodule
is 0.1 cm from the closest surgical margin.

Block Summary:

Al— representative sections of skin.
A2-A15— sections of biopsy cavity and nodule.
AlG-AZO- representative sections of remaining breast tissue.

B. "Apex axillary nodes", fresh. A 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm fragment of reddish—tan
tissue submitted in toto in Block Bl.

C. "Axillary dissection", fresh. A 6 x 6 x 2 cm aggregate of fibroadipose
tissue. The specimen is oriented.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

The tumor resemble that seen in the previous needle biopsies ,-I

Most of the tumor consists of nests and cords of relatively large atypical
cells with round to oval vesicular nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli and
vaculoated cytoplasm. Although most of the tumor consists of solid nests and
strands, a few tubules are seen. There is a cribriform intrgguctal component.
Unequivocal vascular invasion is not identified. There is virtually no
inflammatory response. Microcalcifications are seen within benign lobules.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. "BREAST TISSUE, LONG STITCH LATERAL, SHORT STITCH SUPERIOR":

BREAST WITH INFILTRATING Egg/3Q CARCINOMA, 1.5 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENTSION,
NSABP HISTOLOGIC GRADE 2, NUCLEAR GRADE MODsRAIELY DIggggzumIATED.
INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS PRESENT IN THE INKED SURGICAL MARGIN IN BLOCKS A5
AND All.
No VASCULAR INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

B. "APEX AXILLARY NODES":

ONE LYMPH NODE, NO TUMOR SEEN.
C. "AXILLARY DISSECTION": mmdm
