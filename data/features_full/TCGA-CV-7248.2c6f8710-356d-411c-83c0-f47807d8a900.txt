(D) RIGHT JUGULAR BRANCH - The specimen is a 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm minute
fragment of pink-tan soft tissue. The speCimen is entirely submitted for

(E) LEFT SPINAL ACCESSORY NODE — A x 0.2 x 0.2

specimen is submitted entirely in E.

(F) LEFT LEVEL 23 — A singIe, 0.5 x . x . cm lymph node and a separate
1.0 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm fragment of fatty tissue. The lymp node is bisected and

submgtw in F1. The separate fatty tissue is bisected and submitted
in F .
(G) I HARYNGEAL MARGIN - A 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm fragment of mucosa
lined soft tissue entirely submitted for frozen sectio

*FS/DX: SQUAMOUS MUCOSA _ WITH MILD DYSPLASIA.
(H) LARYNGECTOMY AND BILATERAL NECK DISSECTION - A tota aryngectomy and
bilateral neck dissection, overaIl 7.0 x 8.0 x 4.0 cm. The right node
dissection is approximately 13.0 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm and grossly involved and
matted lymph nodes are identified. The left neck dissection is approximately
7.0 x 4.0 x 1.5 cm. No identifiable lymph node was found. .

The laryngectomy specimen showed an ulcerated, light-tan and geographic
lesion extending from t e right pyriform sinus to the right suprag ottic area
crossing the mi line and involving the entire epigIottic area measuring 4.5 x
2.5 x 1.5 cm. The tumor extends to the free space but does not extend to the
margin of resection. The mucosal margin of resection also appears to be
involved. Tumor extends submucosaIly under the supraglottic area on the Ieft
and abuts soft tissue margin of resection. The margin is submitted entirer
from right to Ieft sequentially under H1-H7, margin of resection on frozen;
H8—H33, sequential secti ' right to left including the supraglottic
area and the free space.
The fragment of Ieft neck issec ion (5 x 3 x 2 cm). The Iymph nodes are
dissected and with the largest measuring 1.0 cm in diameter. The lym h nodes
are submitted entirely. A separate unoriented, fragment of right nec
dissection is present. Lymph nodes are dissected With the largest measuring
3.5 cm in greatest dimension and containing apparent tumor metastasis.

SECTION CODE: H1—H7, mucosal margin 0 resection; H8-H33, tumor from left
to right; H34-H36, Iymph nodes of left neck dissection, submitted entirely
(H34, one bisected node, H35 and H 36, two nodes per casette); H37 and H38,
representative sections of two large lymph nodes with apparent tumor
metastasis, in right neck dissection; H39-H41, the remaining lymph nodes from

right neck dissection (three nodes per c ' , additional possible
lymph nodes from right neck dissection.

*FS/DX: NEGATIVE FOR INVASIVE SQU RCINOMA. ___
(I) LEFT PROXIMAL JUGULAR VEIN BRANCH - A fragment of soft tissu .2 x 0.1
x 0.1 cm). Ink is present on on enoting "true margin". In toto in I
for frozen section examination.
