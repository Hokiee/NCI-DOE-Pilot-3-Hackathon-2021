perinephric fat weighing ‘2 g in total. The kidney measures 22 x 15 x ll cm. The attached ureter measures 2.5 cm in tength and
0.3 cm in diameter The attached renal vein {treasures 1.3 cm in length and it on: in dianteterl The renal vessels and ureter
margins are grossly unremarkable. An adrenal giand is not identified. The kidney is inked black and bivalved to reveal a targe
cystic tumor measuring 17 x i i x 8 cm, involving the upper pole of the cortex and is filled with dark brown necrotic ﬂuid. and
yellow~browri necrotic tissue. The tumor is 5 can from the ureter margin. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a
pink brown parencnyma. with a weitdelined coniconiedullary junction. The cortex measures 0.7 cm and the catyces appear
normal. No lymph nodes are identiﬁed in the perinephdc let. The specimen is photographed. Representative sections are
