average diameter. The serosal surface is tan—pink smooth and glistening with
two Eocal puckered regions both 0.3 CM in greatest dimension. The raeial
resection margin is inkeo blue and the specimen is opened to reveal a tumor
that is located 10 cm from the proximal margin and ﬁive cm from the distal
margin. The tumor measures iive cm in length and 4.5 cm in width. Serial
sectioning reveals an ulcerating tumor invading through the bowel wall into
the pericolonic ﬁat and extending to the puckered serosa, to a depth of 2
cm. which is 4 cm from the closest radial margin. The remaining mucosa shows
normal folds and no gross abnormality. Pericolio and periwcclonic adipose
tissue is submitted for lymph node dissection, and all possible nodes are
submitted. Representative sections are submitted. T95 is submitted.

Summary of sections:

PM - proximal margin

DM - distal margin

RM ~ radial margin

T — tumor

PLN-grossly positive lymph nodes subjacent to tumor
0 « uninvolved mucosa

LN - lymph nodes

BLN—bisected lymph nodes

2), The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Gallbladder" and consists of a
green and purple gallbladder measuring 8.2 x 4.2 x 2.5cm. The surface at the
gallbladder is green purple and smooth. It is opened to reveal two black
green angulated granular calculi measuring 1.4 cm and 1.5 cm in greatest
dimension, with green black viscid bile. It also reveals a green yellow
velvety mucosa with a wall measuring up to 0.2 cm. Representative sections
including the cystic duct margin are submitted.

Summary of sections:

3). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Lymph node of callot" and
consists of a single lymph node measuring 2.3 x 1.4 x 0.8 cm. The lymph node

is bisected and entirely submitted.

4). The epecimen is received in formalin . labeled "Hepatic artery lymph
node“ and consists of a single lymph node measuring 3.8 x l.8 x 1.0 cm. who
lymph node is sectioned and entirely submitted.

5).The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left fallopian tube and
ovary" and consists of a fallopian tube with attached ovary. The fallopian
tube measures 2.5 cm in length and averages 0.8 cm in diameter. The
external surface of the tube is pink tan and smooth with a normal fimbriateﬁ
end. Cut section through the tube reveals a pinpoint lumen. The attached
ovary measures 2.5 x 1.7 x 1.0 cm. The external surface is white—tan and
cerebriform. Cut section through the ovary reveals a white'tan appearance.
Representative sections are submitted.

6}.The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Right fallopian tube and
ovary" and consists of a fallopian tube with attached ovary. The fallopian
tube measures 2.5 cm in length and averages 0.6 cm in diameter. The
external surface of the tube is pink tan and smooth with a normal fimbriated
end. There are several paretubal cysts identified which measure up to 0.5 x
9.3 cm in greatest dimensions. Cut section through the tube reveals a r
yinpoint lumen. The attached oVary measures 2.5 x 2 x 1.0 cm. The
external surface is white—tan and smooth. Cut section through the ovary
reveals a white—ten appearance. Representative sections are submitted.

7). The specimen is received in formalin wrapped around an anastomotic pin,
labeled "Proximal ring” and consists of a ring of pink tan soft tissue
measuring 1.8 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm. Multiple sutures and staples are attached.
The mucosal surface is pink tan and focally hemorrhagic. The sutures and
staples are removed and the soft tissue is entirely submitted.

8). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Distal ring“ and consists
of a ring of pink tan soft tissue measuring 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. ”ultiple
sutures and staples are attached. The mucoeel surface is pink tan and
focally hemorrhagic. The sutures and staples are removed and the soft tissue
is entirely submitted.
