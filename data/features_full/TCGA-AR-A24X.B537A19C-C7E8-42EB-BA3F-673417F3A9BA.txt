. ~-\

Breast, vi'ight,\fsimple mastectomy: lnvasiveductal and lobular carcinoma (mixed features), Nottingham grade II (of III) [tubules
2/3, nuclei 2/3, mitoses 1/3; Nottingham score 5/9], forming-a Ina‘éé; 7:1 x 1.4 x 1.3 cm, with associated biopsy site changes,
located in the superior/central region of the breast [AJCC pT2]. A second biopsy site is present in the subareolar region. A
separate nodule of ductal carcinoma in situ, 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm, is present in the upper inner quadrant. Lobular carcinoma in situ is
identiﬁed. The tumor does not involve the nipple, overlying skin, or underlying chest wall. All surgical resection margins,

including the deep margin, are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 0.5 cm, anterior/superior margin).

Lymph nodes, right axillary sentinel, excision: Multiple (7) right axillary sentinel lymph nodes are negative for metastatic
carcinoma [AJCC pNO (i-) (sn)]. Blue dye is not identiﬁed in any of the seven right axillary sentinel lymph nodes.
Immunohistochemical cytokeratin stain was performed on the parafﬁn embedded sentinel lymph node tissue and conﬁrms the
H&E impression.

Breast, left, simple mastectomy: Mild proliferative changes characterized by ductal hyperplasia without atypia. The pripr_biopsy
site is identiﬁed. The nipple is without diagnostic abnormalities. M '

Estrogen and progesterone receptor analysis and Her-Z/NEU have been ordered on parafﬁn-embedded tissue.
