Physician:

PROCEDURE
Left robotic partial nephrectomy

HISTORY
Left renal mass

GROSS
Received fresh, labeled “left renal mass," is a 3 x 3 x 3 cm,
12~gram partial nephrectomy. The surgical margin is marked with
black ink. The loosely attached fat is marked with green ink. Cut
section shows a 2.5 x 2.5 x 2 cm yellow to hemorrhagic mass. The
mass is well~circumscribed and is contained with in the renal
capsule. It is 0.1 cm to the black—inked surgical margin and 0.3 cm
to the green—inked circumferential surface. A sample of the tissue
is submitted for research studies per protocol. Tissue submitted for
the TCGA research study. Representative sections submitted in five
cassettes.

Sections are taken as follows:
1—2 as tumor with green-inked circumferential surface
3—5 as tumor with black—inked surgical margin

Total time in 10% neutral buffered formalin from collection through
processing: 34.5 hours. Total cold ischemia time: 15 minutes.

LINEAR DIMENSION. REMAINING MARGINS FREE OF TUMOR.

LYMPH NODES: NO LYMPH NODES PRESENT.

PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS IN NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY: ONLY A SMALL RIM OF
NORMAL PARENCHYMA IS PRESENT, WHICH SHOWS MILD INTERSTITIAL
