SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
Clinical History/Diagnosis: Left Renal Mass

Source of Specimen(s):
1: Left kidney
2: Renal hilar lymph nodes

Gross Description:
Received in two parts.
Source of Tissue: I. Labeled #1, "left kidney"

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled ",

left kidney" is a 569 gram left nephrectomy having a moderate amount of
attached perinephric fat. There is a 6.0 X 0.3 cm fragment of attached
ureter having a lumen, 0.2 cm which is patent to the renal pelvis. The
kidney itself is 12.0 x 6.0 x 5.5 cm in greatest dimension being covered
by a redupurple capsule. It is bivalved to reveal red—purple firm renal
parenchyma having a well-defined cortico-medullary junction. In the
middle and lower poles there is a 10.0 X 5.5 x 4.5 cm mass having yellow
to tan—brown soft out surfaces. Representative sections are submitted in

six blocks.

Designation of Sections: 1A~ ureter and vascular margins, lB-lE-a tumor,
1F~ random section kidney

Summary of Sections: multiple

Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled #2, ”renal hilar lymph nodes"

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled ",
renal hilar lymph nodes" are 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm of yellow~tan fibroadipose
tissue. No lymph nodes are grossly identified. The tissue is entirely

submitted in one block.
Designation of Sections: Block 2

Summary of Sections: undesignated—multiple

Final Diagnosis:

1. Left kidney, radical nephrectorny:

- Renal cell carcinoma, chromophobe type, Fuhrman nuclear grade 2 (10 cm),

limited to kidney, carcinoma focally invades into but not through the

capsule; see note.

 

— Ureter and vascular resection margins with no tumor seen.

Note: limnunohistochemistry stains show that the tumor cells are focally
positive for CK7, positive for CD117 (membranous), with cytoplasmic stain
for CD10, faintly stained with vimentin and focally positive for low
molecular weight keratin (CAMS .2). Although the immunostaining pattern is
somewhat mixed, the histologic appearance would be most consistent with a
chromophobe type carcinoma.

2. Renal hilar lymph nodes, excision:
— Fibroadipose tissue, No tumor seen.
— No lymphoid tissue identified.
