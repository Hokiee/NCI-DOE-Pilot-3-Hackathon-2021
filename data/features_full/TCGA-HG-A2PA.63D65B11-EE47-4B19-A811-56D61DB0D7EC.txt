GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE
Received fresh labeled with matching patient identiﬁers is a 2.7 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm lymph node. Specimen
is serially sectioned and has a uniform pink-tan cut surface. Touch prep is performed and the specimen
is submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis in cassettes FSA1-FSA3.
8. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES
Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "left pelvic lymph nodes" are 8 x 5 x
2cm of adipose tissue. within which, thirteen possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed. The nodes range
from 0.2 cm to 4.0 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm. The cut surfaces are ﬁrm white to tan-pink. The nodes are entirely
submitted:
B1-ﬁve lymph nodes
BZ-four lymph nodes
B3-one bisected lymph node
B4-B5-one lymph node, serially sectioned
B6-B7-one lymph node, serially sectioned
BB-B11-one lymph node, serially sectioned

C. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "right pelvic lymph nodes" are 7.5 x 5.5
x 2.0 cm of adipose tissue, within which, ten possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed. The nodes range
from 0.5 cm to 4.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm. The cut surfaces are ﬁrm white to tan-pink. Representative sections:
C1- two bisected lymph nodes (one node inked blue)

CZ-one bisected lymph node

C3-one bisected lymph node

C4-two lymph nodes

C5-one lymph node

C6-8 one lymph node. serially sectioned.

D.UTERUS AND CERVIX:

Specimen is labeled "uterus and cervix" and consists of a 265 gram radical hysterectomy specimen.
The uterus measures 6.5 x 7 x 5 cm. The cervix measuring 5 x 7 x 6 cm. The right parametrium soft
tissue measures 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The left parametrium soft tissue measures 2 x 1 x 0.6 cm. Both
are unremarkable. The serosa of the posterior uterus is entirely inked black, and the anterior is entirely
inked blue. The uterus is laterally bisected along the longitudinal axis to reveal fungating 8 x 6 x 2.5 cm
mass originating from the cervix and involving a vast majority of the endometrial cavity. The mass is
white, soft. and friable. It is at least 2cm of depth of invasion at the anterior cervix and 1.5cm at the
posterior cervix. It is at 1.0 cm from the vaginal mucosal margin and at 1.5 cm from the nearest
parametrium (right). Also, the uterine cavity showed a T shape intra-uterine device (3.5 x 3 cm). The
endometrial cavity is 3.3 cm from cornu to comu, and 5 cm from superior to inferior. The myometrium
has maximum thickness of 3.50m. The endometrium is of 0.3 cm thick. The following representative
sections are submitted:

D1: right parametrium

DZ: left parametrium

D3: right cul de sac tissue.

D4: left cul de sac tissue.

05-09: complete cross section through the anterior cervix (D7 and DB are one section from

TSS:

superior to inferior, respectively) (D5 also contains the nearest vaginal margin)
D10: additional vaginal margin

D11-D13: sections through the posterior cervix

D14: complete cross section of the myometrium from the anterior cavity

DI 5: complete cross section from the posterior myometrium and cavity
D16-Dl7: uninvolved posterior and anterior upper endometrium.

E. PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODES

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "para-aortic lymph nodes" are four
lymph nodes, ranging from 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm to 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. The cut surfaces are ﬁrm tan-pink.
Entirely submitted:

E1- two bisected lymph nodes (one inked black. one inked blue)

E2-one whole lymph node (inked blue) and one bisected (inked black)

F. APPENDIX

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "appendix” is a 6.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm
vermiform appendix. It has a smooth tan-pink serosa. It has an intact 0.3 cm wall. The lumen is
dilated, proximally, ranging from 0.1 cm to 0.6 cm, and contains soft feces. No tumor is identiﬁed.
Representative sections. E1.
