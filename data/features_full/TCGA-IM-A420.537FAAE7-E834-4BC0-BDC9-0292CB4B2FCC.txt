Gross Description:

A. Received fresh “Total thyroidectomy stitch on right isthmus" is a 27.2 gram of total thyroidectomy specimen.
The right lobe measures 5.5 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm. The left lobe is 5.0 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm. The pyramidal lobe is
present 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm. The external surface is inked black. The parathyroid glands are not present
grossly. In the right mid—pole there is gray-white and tiny lesions 0.3 cm in greatest dimension at less than
0.1 cm to anterior surgical margin. The left lobe, reveals gray-white and ﬁrm tumor measuring 4.0 x 3.0 x 2.0
cm and from superior to inferior pole at less than 0.1 cm from anterior and posterior resection margin. The
specimen is submitted in toto in twenty four cassettes.

Cassettes #1 -3 Superior pole

Cassettes #4-6 Mid-pole (cassettes #5&6 lesion in toto)
Cassettes #7&8 Inferior pole right lobe

Cassette #9 Pyramidal lobe

Cassettes #10-14 Superior left lobe

Cassettes #15-19 Midpole of left lobe

Cassettes #20—24 Inferior left lobe

8. Received fresh labeled "Left inferior parathyroid" is a gray-tan soft tissue fragment 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm.
Submitted in toto in one cassette for frozen section.

C. Received fresh labeled “Left superior parathyroid" is a gray-tan soft tissue fragment 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm.
Submitted in toto in one cassette for frozen section.

D. Received in formalin labeled “Left level 6" is a yellow-gray-tan soft tissue fragment 2.0 x1.5 x 0.5 cm. There
are seven possible lymph nodes measuring up to 0.9 cm in greatest dimension. Submitted in toto in five
cassettes. @

Cassettes #182 Two possible lymph nodes
Cassette #3 Three possible lymph nodes
Cassettes #4&5 Adipose tissue

E. Received in formalin labeled "Additional left inferior parathyroid" is a yellow-gray-tan soft tissue fragment 1.0
x 1.0 x 0.2
cm. Submitted in toto in one cassette.
