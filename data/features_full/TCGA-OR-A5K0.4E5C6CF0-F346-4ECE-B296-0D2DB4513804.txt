gram, excisional specimen of a nodular gray-tan adrenal gland with a thin rim
of surrounding periadrenal fat, measuring 9 x 6.8 x 4.3 cm. The specimen has

orientation is given. The remainder of specimen is inked blue, specimen is
serially sectioned to reveal a diffusely pink-gray, soft, nodular mass, with
smooth cut surface, arising from within a yellow/partially cystic adrenal,
with majority of lesion outside, and a residual of normal yellow adrenal, 3.0
