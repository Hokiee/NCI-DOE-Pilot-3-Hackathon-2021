DIAGNOSIS
(A) RIGHT KIDNEY:
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR CELL) TYPE, FUHRMAN NUCLEAR
GRADE 2 (5.5 CM), CONFINED TO THE KIDNEY.
Vascular and ureteral margins, no tumor present.
(B) PERICAVAL LYMPIâ€”i NODES:
Two lymph nodes, no tumor present.
(0) LEFT ADRENAL:
Adrenal myelolipoma (7.5 cm).

GROSS DESCRIPTION
(A) RIGHT KIDNEY ~ A right kidney (11.0 x 5.5 x 3.5 cm) has a tumor
(5.5 x 5.4 x 3.2 cm) which has a yellow, soft cut surface. The tumor is
distant from the perirenal adipose tissue margin and approaches into the
renal sinus.

No lymph nodes are identified. No other lesions are seen.

Portions are submitted for electron microscopy.

SECTION CODE: A1, renai artery and renal vein and ureteral
margins, en face: A2, perirenal adipose tissue margin, en face; A3, A4,
tumor with adjacent kidney; A5, A6, tumor with renai sinus tissue; A7,
A8, tumor with perirenal fat; A9, A10, distant normal kidney.
(B) PERICAVAL LYMPH NODES - Multiple yetlow-tan irregular ragments of
adipose tissue (7.0 x 5.7 x 1.5 cm in aggregate). The specimen is
sectioned and two possible lymph nodes are found (0.7 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm and
3.3 x 1.4 x 0.7 cm).

SECTION CODE: B1, one possible i mph node; B2, BS, one possible
lymph node serially sectioned
(C) LEFT ADRENAL - A left adrenal gland (8.5 x 6.5 x 4.5 cm) weighs 140
grams, and has a well-circumscribed mass (7.5 x 6.0 x 4.5 cm) covered by
a thin capsule. The cut surface of the mass has pale yellow and dark red
hemorrhagic areas. The attached adrenal gland present on one side is
unremarkable. A thin, compressed rim of bright gold tissue, resembling
adrenal cortex focaily surrounds the tumor.
Photograph is obtained.

Portions are submitted for electron microscopy.

INK CODE: Specimen inked in black.

SECTION CODE: 01, vascular margin; CZ, (33, adrenal gland with
tumor; C4-CB, tumor with perpendicular inked surface; 09, distant normal
adrenai gland.
