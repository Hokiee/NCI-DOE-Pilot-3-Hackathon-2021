CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm of corpus uteri.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Left pelvic lymph node“. Received is an 8 x 7 x 1 cm fragment of
tan—yellow fibrofatty tissue with multiple lymph node candidates. The specimen
is dissected for lymph node candidates which are submitted as follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Al—AZ— multiple lymph node candidates.
: A3-A4— one lymph node candidate.
1 AS—All- multiple lymph node candidates.

B. "Right pelvic node". Received is an 8.5 x 6.5 x 2.5 cm aggregate of

fibrofatty tissue which contains multiple lymph node candidates. The lymph
nodes are dissected and submitted as follows:

NI C. "Uterus“. Received is a 167.4 gram, 8 x 7.5 x 5 cm uterus with attached
bilateral adnexa which is most remarkable for heaped shaggy pink—gray mucosa
on the anterior and posterior endometrium (anterior=3.7 x 2.9 cm and posterior
3.9 x 1.1 cm). There appears to be invasion of the underlying myometrium
superficially.

i The remaining endometrial cavity (3.2 cm from cornu to cornu and 7 cm in

’ length), has a 0.2 cm thick endometrium overlying a 2.6 cm mildly trabecular
pink myometrium. The uterine serosa is smooth and glistening with no
adhesions. The endocervix and ectocervix are also smooth and glistening with a
0.4 cm patent cervical 03.

The left adnexa consists of a tan-white bosselated ovary (2.7 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm)
and a tan—pink fimbriated fallopian tube (6.7 x 0.5 cm) which has multiple
small paratubal cysts (largest=0.6 cm in greatest dimension). Sectioning of
the ovary demonstrates an unremarkable tan—pink cut surface with corpora
albuginea. Sectioning of the fallopian tube is unremarkable.

The right adnexa consists of tan-white bosselated ovary (2.3 x 1.7 x 1.7 cm)
which is on section grossly unremarkable, and fimbriated fallopian tube (6.7 x
0.5 cm to 0.9 cm) which is also normal.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Cl-CZ- anterior and posterior cervix, respectively.

C3—C4- anterior and posterior lower uterine segment, respectively.
C5—06- anterior and posterior endomyometrium, respectively.
C7-CB- additional anterior endomyometrium.
C9- additional posterior endomyometrium.

C10- right ovary and fallopian tube.
(, Cll- left ovary and fallopian tube.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: y;
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE: ‘
PROCEDURE: Hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and pelvic lymph
node dissections.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 6th Edition): pTlB pNO pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. "LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES" (LYMPHADENECTOMY):

EIGHTEEN LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (0/18).

E. "RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES" (LYMPHADENECTOMY):

TEN LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (0/10).

C. "UTERUS" (HYSTERECTOMY, BILATERAL SALPINGO—OOPHORECTOMY):

WELL DIFFERENTIATED ENpgpgTRIng ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE ENDOMETRIUM.
TUMOR SITE: DIFFUSE. " ' "““‘“"’”‘”“
HISTOLOGIC TYPE: ENDOMETRIO’I‘DM ADENOCARCINOMA.
FIGO GRADE: 1 OF 3. ' "
TUMOR SIZE: 3.7 AND 3.9 CM (TWO LARGEST GROSS NODULES) .
MAXIMUM DEPTH OF MYOMETRIAL INVASION: SEE COMMENT.
LYMPHATIC/VASCULAR INVASION: ABSENT.
ADJACENT NON-NEOPLASTIC ENDOMETRIUM: ENDOMETRIAL INTRAEPITHELIAL
NEOPLASIA (EIN).
REMAINING MYOMETRIUM: ADENOMYOSIS.
CERVIx: FREE or TUMOR.
SEROSA: FREE OF TUMOR.
SPECIMEN MARGINs: NOT INVOLVED

RIGHT AND LEFT OVARIES: FREE OF TUMOR.
LEFT FALLOPIAN TUBE: FREE OF TUMOR.
RIGHT FALLOPIAN TUBE: FREE-FLOATING TUMOR IN LUMEN, SEE COMMENT.

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation Of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).

COMMENT:

The depth of invasion is difficult to determine due to extensive
involvement of adenomyosis. There is carcinoma present at a maximum depth of
0.7 centimeters in a 2.6 centimeter thick myometrium, but the vast majority of
the tumor in the myometrium is within adenomyosis, which is considered
non-invasive disease. There are foci that likely represent invasion, but
these are very small areas and the overall depth of true invasion is likely no
more than 0.1—0.3 centimeters.
