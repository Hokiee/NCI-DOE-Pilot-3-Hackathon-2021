CLINICAL DETAILS

Carcinoma of the bladder in diverticulum. Cystectomy done.

MACROSCOPY

l. Specimen consists of bladder (160 x 65 x 37mm), prostate and peri-vesical

fat, entire specimen measuring 125 x 120 x 45mm. The right lateral wall contains
an ulcerated tumour (22mm maximum dimension) which appears to extend to the full
thickness of the wall to reach the fat. The lesion is within 2mm of the
circumferential surgical resection margin. The prostate appears macroscopically
normal. No lymph nodes are identiﬁed in the fat.

2. Lymph node measuring 26 x 8 x 5mm.

3. The specimen consists of fragmented nodal tissue measuring 40 x 20 x 8mm plus
fat.

4. Fatty tissue measuring 55 x 50 x 10mm containing 3 nodes, the largest 23mm in
maximum dimension.

5. Fatty tissue measuring 60 x 50 x 15mm. The largest node measures 25mm in
maximum dimension.

6. Fibrofatty tissue measuring 15 x 15 x 5mm.

7. Cylindrical piece of tissue 23mm in length x up to 4mm diameter.

8. Piece of tissue 15 x 5 x 3mm.

9. Cylindrical piece of tissue 15mm in length x 3mm diameter.

MICROSCOPY

1. Sections taken from the macroscopically identiﬁed tumour show a poorly
differentiated transitional cell carcinoma with a signiﬁcant lipoid cell

component, extending through the bladder wall to reach the perivesicle fat.

Areas of necrosis are noted. Extensive perineural invasion is seen. There is

some possible lymphovascular invasion.

The tumour host interface contains only a sparse lymphocytic inﬁltrate.

The overlying epithelium is largely denuded, but where present, is
morphologically normal with no evidence of dysplasia or carcinoma in situ.
Random sections from the rest of the bladder wall shows morphologically normal
urothelium.

The sections from both lobes of the prostate are morphologically normal.

The prostatic urethral resection margin shows no evidence of tumour or

dysplasia.

2. External iliac right; Reactive lymph node with no evidence of metastatic
carcinoma.

3. Right internal iliac; A reactive lymph node with no evidence of metastatic
carcinoma.

4. Right obturator node; Three reactive nodes with no evidence of metastatic
carcinoma.

5 . Left obturator node and internal iliac; Nine reactive nodes with no evidence
of metastatic carcinoma.

6. Right para rectal lymph node; A lymph node with no evidence of metastatic
carcinoma.

7. Right internal iliac artery; Sections conﬁrm a muscular artery with medial
degeneration and dystrophic calciﬁcation. There is no evidence of carcinoma.
8. Left ureteric resection; All the tissue was processed and shows ureteric
tissue largely denuded of urothelium. There is no evidence of invasive
transitional cell carcinoma.

9. Right ureteric resection margin; Ureteric tissue denuded of urothelium but
with surface ulceration lined by granulation tissue. The lamina propria is
oedematous and congested with a moderate chronic inﬂammatory cell inﬁltrate.
There is no evidence of urothelial carcinoma.

SUMMARY

Bladder and lymph nodes; The appearances are those of a poorly differentiated
transitional cell carcinoma extending into perivesicle fat. No evidence of
nodal disease. pT3b pNO pr
