Final Diagnosis

A, B) EPIDURAL MASS, RESECTION: _
- PARAGANGLIOMA, WITH FOCAL COAGULATIVE NECROSIS CONSISTENT WITH RECENT ISCHEMIA.
¢ MITOSES ARE NOT IDENTIFIED.
, TUMOR EXTENDS TO RESECTION MARGINS,

C) SCALP TUMOR. RESECTION:
~~ PARAGANGLIONIA (6 GM GREATEST DIMENSION}, METASTATIC TO SKULL.

~ TUMOR EXTENSIVELY INVOLVES THE BONE OF THE SKULL AND INVADES THROUGH THE BONE
BOTH EXTERNALLY AND INTERNALLY. THE OVERLYING SKELETAL MUSCLE AND ADIPOSE TISSUE
OF THE SCALP IS DISTENDED BY A PUSHING BORDER OF TUMOR. BUT ONLY FOCALLY INVADED. --
, LYMPHOVASCULAR iNVASION IS PROMINENT (SLIDE 612),

— THERE IS EXTENSIVE TUMOR NEC ROSIS.

- MITOSES ARE VARIABLY PRESENT {UP TO 3 PER HIGH POWER FIELD IN SOME FOCI) BUT ARE
RARE OVERALL.

- Ki—G? LABELING IS APPROXIMATELY 10% IN AREAS OF HIGHEST LABELING.

~ TUMOR EXTENDS TO BONE AND SOFT TISSUE MARGIN AT THE SHORT AXIS OF THE BONE
EXCISION (BEST SEEN IN C12).

- IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINING FOR SDHB IS NEGATIVE IN TUMOR CELLS AND POSITIVE IN
ENDOTHELIAL CELLS. CONSISTENT WITH A SDHX GENE MUTATION.
- IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINS FOR CHROMOGRANIN A AND TYROSINE HYDROXYLASE ARE

DIFFUSELY POSITIVE. . D4: ~3 -

Greet Descrlption
A. T2-3 EPIDURAL. MASS (FRESH) The specimen. labeled with the patients name and medical record number.
is a fragment of dark red to brown eon tissue (2.5 x 1.5 x 0.2 cm). The specimen In prooeeeed for Intraoperati‘ve frozen sedan

diagnosis andentirety submitted in cassaltee Al-Z {M = frorpen section remnant).

B. EFIDURAL TUMOR (#2 ADDITIONAL PIECE OF TUMOR) (FRESH): The specimen. labeled with the patients name
and medical record number. consists of multiple fragments of red to brown soft tissue ((1.5 x 0.4 x. 0.4 cm). The specimen

Is entirely submitted In cassette BI.

C. SCALP TUMOR (FRESH): The specimen. labeled with the patients name and modes record number,
consists of an ovoid soft tissue mass (6 x 5 x 2 an) attached to an ovoid fragment of skull (5.6 x 4 x 0.4 an). The cut surface
reveals a we“ circumsorlbed tan-pink mass distendlng but not invading the overlying ﬁbrous tissue and skeleta! muscle (6 x 4.5 x 2
cm). The mass penetrate: through the bone atthe mid portion of the specimen. closest to the resection margins along the short
axis. Resection margins along the long axis appear to be free of tumor. The specimen ls serially sectioned along the short axis and
entirety submitted consecutively from cassettes C14 7. The out surface of the mass Is ptnkdon with patchy yeilow areas of

necrosis. Approximately 20% of the tumor appears necrotic.
