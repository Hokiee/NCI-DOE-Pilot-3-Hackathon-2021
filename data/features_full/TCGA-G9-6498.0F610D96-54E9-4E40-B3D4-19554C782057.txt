A. PROSTATE

Received fresh labeled with matching patient identiﬁers Is a resected prostate gland weighing 48 g and
measuring 4.5-cm from right to ieit, 4.8-cm from anterior to posterior, and 3.5—cm from apex to base.
The exemal capsule is red. smooth and intact. The apex and base are removed from the specimen
yielding a new weight of 23 g. The specimen is seriaiiy sectioned from apex to base. Cut section shows
ﬁrm, tan ﬁbrous parenchyma. No lesions or nodules are grossly appreciated. The right and left seminal
vesicle measure 2.3 x 1.5 x 0.5. and 2.9 x 1.7 x 0.5 cm respectively. Both are bisected show beige tan
cystic tissue. The right and leit vas measure 3.1 x 0.2, and 1.9 x 0.2 cm. respectively. Both are
sectioned to show ﬁrm tan tube structure. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue
procurement. The remainder is entirely submitted for microscopic evaluation. Cassettes are submitted
as follows:

A1-A2: Right apex

A3: Leﬂ Apex

A4: Level 1 right anterior

A5: Level 1 right posterior

A6: Level 1 left anterior

A7: Level 1 left posterior

A8: Level 2 capsule. right side

A9: Level 2 capsuie. left side

A1 0-A1 1: Right lateral base

A12: Right base

A1 3-A14: Right base with proximal urethra! margin

unorlented soft tissue measuring 0.7 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm. The entire specimen is submitted in cassette Bi.
