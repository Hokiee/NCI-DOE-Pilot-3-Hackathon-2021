MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: ----------------------------
The non-neoplastic liver, seen best in blocks 1. 3 and 10. Shows no
evidence of cirrhosis. Tumor is present in blocks 1-5 and 7-12.
Sections of the tumor demonstrate hepatocellular carcinoma with
variable features. There are areas with solid and trabecular growth.
typical of hepatocellular carcinoma, and some areas with desmoplastic
Stroma and a suggestion of glandular growth. Some areas are well
differentiated (grade 2) while others are moderately (grade 3) and
poorly differentiated (grade 4) with anaplastic giant cells and
numerous mitotic figures. Some areas have tumor cells with cytoplasmic
fat, and some areas have hyaline globules. The surgical margins are
negative. but the satellite nodule noted grossly (block 3) is within 1
mm of the inked margin. The immunostain results support the diagnosis
of hepatocellular carcinoma.

SPECIAL STAINS: -------------------------------------------

Immunostains (blocks 1 and 5):

Alpha fetoprotein Strongly positive

Glypican-3 Strongly positive

Polyclonal CEA Canalicular staining predominantly

HepPar-l Variable patchy positivity

Cytokeratin 8 Positive in majority of tumor

Cytokeratin 7 Variable positivity. 10 to 25% of tumor cells
Cytokeratin 19 A few areas of positivity, most of tumor negative

EMA Scattered positivity, <22 of tumor cells

MOC-31 Patchy positivity. 25 to 50% of tumor

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: -----------------------------

Liver lesion

POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: ---------------------------

Same. pending pathology

SPECIMEN:

GALLBLADDER, PORTION OF LIVER ----------------------------------

GROSS DESCRIPTION; -------------------------------------

The specimen is received in one part and is labeled with the patient's
name and "portion of liver and gallbladder “ The
specimen consists of a portion of liver with attached gallbladder. The
“portion of liver measures 8.0 x 5.5 x 3.5 cm. The capsular surface is
tan-white and bosselated. The resection surface is inked black. and
the specimen is serially sectioned. The specimen consists of a
well-defined, irregular tan-white nodule. measuring about 4.0 x 4.
3.0 cm. The nodule is composed of tan-white firm tissue and is 0.

to the closest resection margin. The small separate nodule is 0.3 cm
away from the larger nodule. The remaining specimen shows tan-brown
unremarkable hepatic parenchyma. The attached gallbladder measures 7.5
cm in length x 3.0 cm in diameter. The cystic duct measures 0.1 cm in
length x 0.3 cm in diameter. The serosal surface is smooth and
congested. One lymph node. measuring 1.0 cm in length is identified
adjacent to the cystic duct. The mucosal surface is bile stained
without ulceration. The lumen contains dark green bile without
calculi. The gallbladder wall measures 0.1 cm in thickness.
Representative sections are submitted in six cassettes as follows:
cassette 1 - larger nodule with resection margin; cassette 2 - nodule
with external adherent gallbladder wall; cassette 3 - small separate
nodule with surgical margin; cassettes 4 and 5 - random sections of
larger nodule; cassette 6 - gallbladder and lymph node.

Additional sec!ions are submitted in six cassettes, labeled cassettes 7

through 12. (
