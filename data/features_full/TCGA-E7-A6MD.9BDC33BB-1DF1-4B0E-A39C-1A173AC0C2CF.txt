Surgical Date:

Gross Description: 1.Piece of cystoprostatectomy presenting the urinary bladder with a whitish,
ulcerated and necrosed multifocal tumoral proliferation, with invasive aspect and intramural evolution.
Histopathological aspect of inﬁltrative urothelial cell carcinoma, with high malignant potential,
moderately/ poorly differentiated, 62/63, with areas of neuroendocrine differentiation, intramural
evolution and invasion of the entire bladder wall, up to the perivesical fat tissue and the prostate, with
necrosis and ulceration; stpT4. Numerous intravascular tumoral emboli.

2.Right iliac commune tissue with eight (8) lymph nodes with a maximum diameter of 1.0 cm, the
biggest of them with metastasis of the urothelial cell carcinoma, 62/63, the rest with reactive aspect
and sinus congestion (1+).

3.Left iliac extern, intern and obturator tissue with six (6) lymph nodes with dimensions of 0.8 cm; two
of them with metastasis of the urothelial cell carcinoma, 62/63, the rest with reactive-aspect and sclero-
Iipomatous dystrophy (2+).

4.-5. Resection samples with preserved histological aspect.
