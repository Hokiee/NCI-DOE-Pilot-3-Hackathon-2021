(R) COMPOSITE RESECTION VENTRAL TONGUE. FLOOR OF MOUTH, WITH SEOMENTAL MANOIBULECTOMY .. Received
:5 a segment of central mandible measuring 6.5 x 3.5 x It) cm. Two metallic Implants are identified and no teeth are present.
Attached to the mandible is a portion of anterior tongue and anterior tloor of mouth tissue measuring 8.5 x 5.0 x 2.0 cm overall.
Bilateral salivary glands are identified. the left measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x l; the right measuring 2.8 x 1.6 x 0.8 cm. The mass Involves
the ventral surface of the tongue and the anterior floor of mouth. The ventral surface of the tongue has an ulcerated area which
measures 3.5 x 1.3 cm. The soft tissue from the floor or mouth is detached from the mandible and the specimen is serially
sectioned to reveal a mass ( 4.0 x 3.1 cm with a thickness of 1.2 cm}. The tumor is pele~white. glistening, and infiltrates the
skeletal muscle tissue of the tongue and is 0.5 cm from the deep margin, 2.5 cm from the right lateral bone margin 3.l cm from the
left lateral bone margin and 1 cm from the posterior resection margin. The tumor anteriorly abuts the bone but there is no evidence
of invasion. A portion of the tumor is submitted for tumor bank. The remainder of the tongue and the floor of mouth tissue is
unremarkable. No lymph nodes are identified. The bone is submitted for decatclfication,
