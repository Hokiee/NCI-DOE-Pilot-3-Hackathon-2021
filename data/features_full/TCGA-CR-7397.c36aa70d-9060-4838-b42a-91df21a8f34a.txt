CLINICAL DATA

Clinical Features: Uns ecified
Operator: ﬂ
Operation: Unspec1 1ed

Operative Findings: Unspecified

Operative Diagnosis: Unspecified

Tissue Submitted: 1) right neck level 3 for frozen section;
2) level 2 node; 3) level 2; 4) submental
lymph node; 5) level 1; 6) right
hemiglossectomy; 7) level 3,4; 8) level
2B; 9) anterior level 3

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1) SOURCE: Right Neck Level 3

The specimen consists of a single portion of yellow to red fatty soft

tissue measuring 3.8 X 3.7 X 0.6 cm. Palpating the tissue reveals a large
lymph node measuring 1.8 X 0.9 X 0.6 cm. There is a second lymph node
measuring 1.7 X 0.6 X 0.6 cm. Of the remaining fatty tissue, there are

three probable lymph nodes which range in greatest dimension from 0.4 to
0.6 cm. Serially sectioning the specimen reveals three additional possible

lymph nodes all less than 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is
representatively submitted as follows:

Summary of sections:

1AFSC, 1/1

1B, is the remaining portion of the node that had been frozen, 2/ 1;

1C, the second largest node bisected, 2/ 1;

1D, three bisected nodes which have been differentially inked, 3/1

1E, four possible nodes which have been differentially inked, 3/ 1.

2) SOURCE: Level 2 Node

Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and "level 2

node" is a 3.0 X 2.0 X 1.5 cm piece of fibroadipose tissue from which four

lymph nodes are dissected that range from 1.0 to 1.5 cm. The lymph nodes
are entirely submitted.

Summary of sections: 2A, 4/ 1.

3) SOURCE: Level 2

Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and "level 2"
is a 6.0 X 2.0 X 1.0 cm piece of fibroadipose tissue. Four lymph nodes are
dissected.

Summary of sections: 3A, four lymph nodes, 4/ 1.

4) SOURCE: Submental Lymph Node

Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and
"submental lymph node" is a 4.0 X 3.0 X 1.0 cm piece of fibroadipose
tissue. Four lymph nodes are dissected.

Summary of sections: 4A, four lymph nodes, 4/ 1.

5) SOURCE: Level 1

Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and "level 1"
is an 8.0 X 4.0 X 3.0 cm piece of fibroadipose tissue with attached

salivary gland and skeletal muscle. Multiple lymph nodes are dissected from
the specimen that range from 0.5 to 2.0 cm in their greatest eXtent. The
largest lymph node is rubbery, firm, and has a white, friable and necrotic
cut surface. An attached 3.5 X 3.5 X 3.0 cm salivary gland is serially
sectioned and is grossly unremarkable. The lymph nodes are entirely
submitted. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted.
Summary of sections: 5A, five lymph nodes, 5/ 1;

5B, large suspicious lymph nodes, 2/ 1;

5C, sections of salivary gland, 2/ 1;

6) SOURCE: Right Hemi-glossectomy

Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and "right
hemiglossectomy" is a 7.5 X 6.5 X 3.0 cm hemiglossectomy specimen that
harbors a 4.5 X 3.5 cm ulcer on its lateral mucosal surface. This lesion is

1.6 cm away from the anterior margin, 2.3 cm away from the medial margin,
2.0 cm away from the posterior margin, and 3.5 cm away from the lateral
buccal mucosal margin and 2.2 cm away from the deep, ﬂoor of mouth margin.
The specimen is inked as follows: 6A, anterior margin, blue, lateral margin

yellow, medial margin green, and ﬂoor of mouth margin black. The specimen
is serially sectioned to reveal the lesion to eXtend by 2.3 cm into the

tongue and has a solid, white, and fibrotic firm cut surface.

Summary of sections: 6A, anterior margin to mass, 2/ 1;

6B, representative section of mass to lateral, buccal mucosa margin, 1/ 1;

6C, representative section of posterior margin, 1/ 1;

6D, representative section of medial margin to tumor, 1/ 1;

6E-6H, representative sections of mass, 6E-6F, 1/ 1; 6G-6H, 2/1 each.

7) SOURCE: Levels 3, 4

Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and "level 3
and 4" is a 6.0 X 5.0 X 1.0 cm piece of fibroadipose tissue from which siX
lymph nodes are dissected.

Summary of sections: 7A, 6/ 1.

8) SOURCE: Level 2B

Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and "level
2B" is a 3.5 X 3.0 X 1.0 cm piece of fibroadipose tissue. T wo grossly
identifiable lymph node candidates are dissected. Representative sections
of the specimen are submitted.

Summary of sections: 8A, are two grossly identifiable lymph node
candidates, 2/ 1;

8B, representative sections of remaining adipose tissue, 1/ 1.

9) SOURCE: Anterior Level 3

Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and "anterior
level 3" is a 6.0 X 4.5 X 1.0 cm piece of fibroadipose tissue from which
one grossly identifiable lymph node is dissected.

Representative sections of the specimen are submitted.

Summary of sections: 9A, one grossly identifiable lymph node, 1/ 1;
9B-9C, representative sections of adipose tissue, 1/1 each;
