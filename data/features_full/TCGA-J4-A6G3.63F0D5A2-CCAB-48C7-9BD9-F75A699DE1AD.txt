PROSTATE CANCER

Gross Description

A. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"right pelvic lymph nodes—NFS" are eight fragments of dissected
fat measuring 2 x 2 x 2 cm in compact aggregate and showing
minimal induration. All material is submitted in Al, A2.

B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"right pelvic lymph nodes-PS" are three fragments of focally
indurated fat measuring up to 2.2 x 1 X 0.2 cm thick. All
material is submitted in Bl.

C. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"left pelvic lymph nodes—NFS" are multiple fragments of
fibroadipose tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm in compact
aggregate. All material is submitted in C1.

D. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"left pelvic lymph nodeSaFS" are four focally indurated pieces
of fat measuring up to 1.8 x 1 x 0.2 cm. All material is
submitted in 01.

E. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
”left peri-prostatic tissue-F5" is an irregular, firm, brown/tan
tissue measuring 9 x 7 x 2 mm thick. All material is submitted
in El. “‘ -—
F. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"prostate" is a 50 gram previously inked blue on the right and
black on the left measuring 3.5 cm anterior to posterior x 4 cm
superior to inferior x 4.5 cm right to left. The right and left
seminal vesicles project from the right and left 2 x 1.5 x 1.2
cm and 1.5 x l x 0.8 cm with the stubs of the right and left vas
measuring 1.5 x 0.3 cm on both sides. The superior aspect
reveals a somewhat prominent median lobe bulging above the
surface of the bladder aspect of the prostate. Both the distal
urethral portion of prostate and proximal bladder portion shall
be amputated from the remainder of the specimen sectioned
parallel to the plane of the urethra and then totally submitted
anterior to posterior. In addition, the area of the left
seminal vesicle shall be more extensively sampled. On
cross-sectioning, the prostate gland reveals a firm, focally
nodular parenchyma. The section code is as follows:
Fl‘F3:distal urethral margin, totally submitted anterior to
posterior; F4, F5=Complete section of mid-prostate, anterior
lobes; F6, F7=posterior lobes; F8, F9=complete section of upper
third of prostate, anterior lobes; F10, F11=posterior lobes;
F12—F14=remainder of posterior prostate; FIE-F19zbladder aspect
of prostate, totally submitted anterior to posterior; F20=shave
projecting left seminal vesicle; F21=additional cross—sections

of left seminal vesicle; F24=shave of right seminal vesicle and

vesicle and vas; and F26, F27=complete cross—section of junction
