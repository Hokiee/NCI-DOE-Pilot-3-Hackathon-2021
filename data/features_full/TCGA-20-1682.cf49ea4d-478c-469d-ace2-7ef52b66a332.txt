Source of Specimen(s):

I: Omentum, resection other than for tumor
2: right tube and ovary

3: left tube and ovary

4: supracervical uterus

5: left paracolic gutter

Gross Description:
Received in ﬁve parts.

Source of Tissue: 1. Labeled # 1, "omentum"

Gross Description: Received fresh in a container labeled " patient name and medical number,
omentum". It consists of a segment of omentum

measuring 300 x 12.0 x 2.0 cm. Approximately one-third of the omentum

has an omental caking and sections Show solid tan ﬁrm tumor.

Representative sections are submitted in 'lA-C.

Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled # 2, "right tube and ovary"

Gross Description: Received fresh in a container labeled " patient name and medical number,
right tube and ovary". It consists of an

irregular ragged possible ovary having an overall measurement of 12.0 x

10.0 x 6.9 cm. Centrally a markedly distorted fallopian tube is present

measuring 4.0 x 3.0 cm and is partially involved by lesion. Sections

disclose multiple smooth-walled cysts containing blood-tinged to yellow

thin ﬂuid. The cysts measure from 0.6 up to 7.0 cm. Elsewhere, the

ovary has a tan to brown friable predominantly necrotic tumor. No normal

ovarian structures are found.

Designation of Sections: 2A- potential fallopian tube, 2B-2E- right

ovarian tumor

Source of Tissue: 3. Labeled # 3, "left tube and ovary"

Gross Description: Received fresh in a container labeled " patient name and medical number,
left tube and ovary". it consists of a ragged
\ rubbery ovary measuring 7.0 X 6.5 X 5.0 cm. Externally there is some

tumor studding measuring up to 1.0 cm. The fallopian tube with ﬁmbria
measures 4.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm and is potentially involved with lesionai

tissue. Sections disclose a 5.0 cm cyst containing brown thin ﬂuid.

Some normal ovarian structures are present. The wall is white to ﬁrm
suggestive of lesion. The tumor involves 75% of the ovary.

Representative sections of the ovary with tumor are submitted in 3A—3C and
fallopian tube is in 3D.

Source of Tissue: 4. Labeled # 4, "uterus‘I '

Gross Description: Received fresh in a container labeled ” patient name and medical number,
uterus". It consists of a supracervical

hysterectomy specimen consisting of corpus uteri weighing 160-grams and
measuring overall 8.5 x 7.5 x 6.2 cm. The specimen is asymmetrical

distorted due to numerous serosal adhesions and what appears to be an
appreciable amount of tumor studding on the comua. The cervical stump
measures 1.9 cm and is unremarkable. The uterus is bivalved disclosing
endometrial cavity measuring 2.5 cm from comu to cornu and lined by a 0.2
cm endometrium. The myornetrium measures up to 1.9 cm in thickness and in
the posterior wall there appears to be tumor invading from the serosa.

The tumor comes to within 1.5 cm from the endometrium {4C & 4D].
Representative sections are submitted in 4A-G.

Designation of Sections: 4A—4B- adhesions on serosa at cornu, 4C-4D-
posterior endomyometrium with tumor invading from outside in, 4E— anterior
endomyometrium, 4F~ anterior lower uterine segment/cervical stump, 4G—

posterior lower uterine segment/cervical stump

Final Diagnosis:

1. Omentum:
Serous adenocarcinoma.

2. Right tube and ovary:
Serous adenocarcinoma involving ovary and fallopian tube.

3. Left tube and ovary:
Serous adenocarcinoma involving ovary and fallopian tube.
- Angiolymphatic invasion is identiﬁed.

4. Uterus:
Serous adenocarcinoma involving uterine serosa with invasion into outer

 

one—third of myometrium.
Inactive endometrium.
Endocervix with no tumor seen.
