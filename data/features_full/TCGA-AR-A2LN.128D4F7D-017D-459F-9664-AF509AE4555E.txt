Final Diagnosis

A. Breast, right, mastectomy: Inﬁltrating lobular carcinoma, Nottingham grade [I (of III)
[tubules 3/3, nuclei 2/3, mitoses 1/3; Nottingham score 5/9], forming a 2.8 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm mass
located in the upper outer quadrant of the breast [AJCC, 7th ed., pT2]. Angiolymphatic invasion
is present. The non-neoplastic breast parenchyma shows proliferative ﬁbrocystic changes.

Biopsy site changes present. The tumor does not involve the nipple, overlying skin, or underlying
chest wall. A seborrheic keratosis is identiﬁed in the skin. All surgical resection margins,
including deep margin, are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 2.0 cm, anterior-
superior margin).

B. Lymph node, right axillary, sentinel biopsy: One (of 1) axillary sentinel lymph node is
positive for metastatic carcinoma, the largest measuring 2.0 cm. Extranodal extension is present.

C. Breast, leﬁ, mastectomy: Inﬁltrating lobular carcinoma, Nottingham grade II (ofIII) [tubules
3/3, nuclei 2/3, mitoses 1/3; Nottingham score 6/9], and lobular carcinoma in situ, forming a 4.1
x 3.8 x 2.4 cm mass located in the upper subareolar aspect of the breast [AJCC, 7th ed., pT2].
Angiolymphatic invasion is absent. The non-neoplastic breast parenchyma shows proliferative
ﬁbrocystic changes. Biopsy site changes present. The tumor involves the nipple. The overlying
skin and underlying chest wall are uninvolved. All surgical resection margins, including deep
margin, are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 1.6 cm, anterior—superior margin).

D. Lymph node, leﬁ axillary, sentinel biopsy: One axillary sentinel lymph node is negative for
metastatic carcinoma. Blue dye is identiﬁed. Immunohistochemical cytokeratin stain was
performed on the parafﬁn embedded sentinel lymph node tissue and conﬁrms the H&E
impression.

E. Lymph node, left axillary #2, sentinel biopsy: One axillary sentinel lymph node is negative
for metastatic carcinoma. Blue dye is not identiﬁed. Immunohistochemical cytokeratin stain was
performed on the parafﬁn embedded sentinel lymph node tissue and conﬁrms the H&E
impression. [AJCC, 7th ed., pNO(i-)(sn)]

F. Lymph nodes, right axillary, dissection: Multiple (14) axillary lymph nodes are negative for
metastatic carcinoma.
