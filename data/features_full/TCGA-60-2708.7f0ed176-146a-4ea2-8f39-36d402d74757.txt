GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A, 4R LYMPI-I NODE

Received fresh for intra-operative consultation are two tan fragments of soft tissue each
measuring 0.30m. in greatest dimension. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section
and in one cassette labelled FSA after formalin ﬁxation.

 
 
 

 

B. 4L LYMPH NODE .
Received fresh for intra—operative consultation is one tan grey fragment of soft tissue measuring
0.9x0.5x0.3cm. The entire specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section and in one cassette
labelled FSB after formalin ﬁxation.
C. LEVEL 7 LYMPH NODE _
Received fresh for intra-operative consultation are two tan black fragments of soft tissue
measuring 0. 9x0. 4x0. 20m. and 0. 7x0. 4x0. 2cm. The entire specimen is entirely submitted for
frozen section and in one cassette labelled FSC after formalin ﬁxation.
FSA-FSC: Each portion contains portion of tan black to tan grey lymphoid tissue.
D. LEFT LOWER LOBE LUNG 7
Received fresh for intra-operative consultation is a 291gm. 16.0xl4.0x'6.50m. Iobectomy
specimen. The hilum shows a tan white ﬁrm mass protruding through the bronchus. The hilar
tissue is ﬁrmly adhesed to the mass. The pleura is purple grey, smooth. On section, there is a
6.5x6.5x5.Scm. ﬁrm, tan, solid to cystic, partiallynecrotic-mass with green mucus. The tumor is
located centrally and extends into the main stem bronchus. The adjacent lung parenchyma shows
impacted mucous and feel of honeycombing and consolidation. The lung parenchyma at the-base
is pink red and spongy. The pleura is marked by black ink at the mass. Representative tissue is
submitted in eleven cassettes as follows: ‘

E. ADDITIONAL BRONCHIAL MARGIN
Received fresh for intra~operative consultation are two tan fragments of bronchial tissue
measuring l.2x0.4x0.lcm. and l.0x0.3x0.1cm. A stitch on each fragment designates the true
margin. The margins are shaved from the pieces and submitted for frozen section.
Representative tissue is submitted in one cassette labeiled FSE after formalin ﬁxation.
F. ADDITIONAL BRONCHIAL MARGIN
Received fresh for intra-operative consultation is a 0.4x0.2x0.1cm. tan fragment of brouchial
tissue with a stitch indicating the true margin. The entire specimen is submitted for frozen
section (en face) and in one cassette labelled FSF after formalin ﬁxation.
G. LEFT MIDDLE LOBE
Received fresh is a 164gm l6.0x9.0x2.50m. lobe of lung. The hilum shows a 2.5crn. in length
portion of pulmonary artery. On serial sectioning, the parenchyma is pink red and spongy with
no discrete lesion. Multiple hilar lymph nodes are identiﬁed. Representative tissue is submitted
in ﬁve cassettes as follows:

G1: bronchial margin, en face and seven possible hilar lymph nodes

H. LEVEL V LYMPH NODE .
Received in formalin are three tan grey to black fragments of soft tissue measuring 0.2cm.,
0.40m, and 1.0x0.7x0.30m. The entire specimen is submitted in one cassette labelled H1.
1. LEVEL VII LYMPH NODE . ‘
Received in formalin are ﬁve fragments of tan grey black soft tissue ranging in size from 0.5cm
to 1. 7x1. 0x0. 5cm. On section, the cut surface of the largest lymph node is pink tan, grey black,-
soﬁ and homogenous. The entire specimen is submitted' in two cassettes as follows:

11: four lymph nodes

12: one lymph node, bisected
J. FINAL PNEUMONECTOMY BRONCHIAL MARGIN
Received in formalin is a 2.2xl .0x0.2cm. portion of bronchus with a stitch at the ﬁnal margin.
The bronchial mucosa is pink red and hemorrhagic. The bronchial margin measures 0.9cm. in
diameter. It is inked black. Representative tissueis submitted in one cassette labelled J 1 ‘
including the bronchial margin (en face) and random longitudinal sections of the bronchus.
K. LEVEL VI LYMPH NODE
Received in formalin are two tan grey black yellow fragments of soft tissue measuring
1.2x0. 6x0 Scm. and 1. 2x1 .0x0. 7cm. On section, the cut surface shows grey black focally pink,
homogenous soft parenchyma. The entire specimen is submitted" in one cassette (larger lymph
node inked black).

ADDENDUM:
In discussion wit—pecimen G which was received labeled “left

middle lobe” most likely represents the left upper lobe.

Additionally, the tumor present in the left lower lobe (specimen D), invades the left lower lobe
bronchus and NOT the main stem bronchus.
