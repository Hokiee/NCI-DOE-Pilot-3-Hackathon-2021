Final Diagnosis:

A. Prostate with bilateral lymph nodes, radical prostatectomy with lymphadenectomy: Prostatic adenocarcinorna (see
synoptic report below).

Procedure: Radical prostatectomy with Iymphadencctomy.
Histologic type: Acinar adeno :arcinoma.
Hist ologic grade:

Primary pattern: 4 Secondai'y pattern: 3 Tertiary pattern: 5

Total Gleason Score: 7; with minor pattern 5.
Tumor quantitation: Tumor i wolves the peripheral zone bilaterally in the lower third of the gland.
Extraprostatic extension: Pre nt, focally on right side lower third.
Margins: Surgical margins forFly positive on left side in apex (over a 1-mm contiguous length). Where ink touches
tumor, there is no capsule ident ﬁable (extraproetatic spread in the prostate apex is difﬁcult to deﬁne given the
anatomy of this region). ICE-1b V D g 5

Lymph nodes: Four lymph no es negative for metastatic carcinoma. 340 CE I 2 O] I ‘9
Additional pathologic findin : Multifocal high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia is present.

Ancillary studies: DNA ploid analysis is pending on block A3.

Pathologic staging: p’l‘3a.

Biorepository sample (if appl cable): Positive for tumor, greater than 90% of the sample contains carcinoma.
