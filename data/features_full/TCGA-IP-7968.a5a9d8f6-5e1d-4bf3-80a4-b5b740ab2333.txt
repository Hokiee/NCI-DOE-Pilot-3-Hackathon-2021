Gross Description:
Received are eight containers labeled with the patient's name.

Part A is received in formalin and is additionally labeled "left subcarinal."
The specimen consists of a portion of yellow-tan fatty tissue with dimensions of
4 x 3.1 x 2.6 cm. Inspection of the fatty tissue reveals multiple pink-tan
rubbery lymph nodes up to 1.4 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is
submitted as follows:

A1 One lymph node, bisected

A2-5 Multiple whole lymph nodes

Part B is received in formalin and is additionally labeled "2R." The specimen
consists of a portion of yellow-tan fatty tissue with dimensions of 2.1 x 1.3 x
0.9 cm. A search of the fatty tissue reveals two pink-tan rubbery lymph nodes,
up to 1 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is submitted as follows:

B1 Multiple whole lymph nodes

Part C is received fresh for intraoperative consultation and is additionally
labeled "esophageal margin." The specimen consists of a circular portion of
soft tissue with dimensions of 2 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm. The specimen is submitted for
frozen section diagnosis and is completely resubmitted in cassette C1.

Part D is received in formalin and is additionally labeled "high paratracheal
lymph node." The specimen consists of a portion of yellow-tan fatty tissue with
dimensions of 6.5 x 5.2 x 2.5 cm. A search of the fatty tissue reveals a large
lymph node with dimensions 4.5 x 3 x 2.5 cm. This node is grossly positive.
Multiple additional lymph nodes are found up to 2 cm. The specimen is submitted
as follows:

D1 Representative section grossly positive node

D2 One lymph node, bisected

D3-4 Multiple whole lymph nodes

Part E is received in formalin and is additionally labeled "lower
paraesophageal." The specimen consists of a portion of yellow-tan fatty tissue
with dimensions of 4 x 3.2 x 1.2 cm. A search of the fatty tissue reveals
multiple pink-tan rubbery lymph nodes up to 1.6 cm in greatest dimension. The
specimen is submitted as follows:

E1 One lymph node, bisected

E2 Multiple whole lymph nodes

Part F is received in formalin and is additionally labeled "anterior cervical
lymph node." The specimen consists of a portion of yellow-tan fatty tissue with
dimensions of 1 x 1 x 1.2 cm. Sectioning through the tissue reveals a single
pink-tan rubbery lymph node, 1 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is
submitted as follows:

F1 One lymph node, bisected

Part G is received in formalin and is additionally labeled "gallbladder." The
specimen consists of a previously opened gallbladder with dimensions of 12.2 x

7.5 x 4 cm. The gallbladder has been previously opened and the contents are in
the bottom of the specimen container. These consist of multiple yellow to
red-tan choleliths, measuring in aggregate 7 x 5.2 x 2 cm. These choleliths are
polyhedral and range from 0.5 to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. The external
surface of the gallbladder is white-tan, and firm throughout. The wall thickness
ranges from 0.3 to 0.6 cm and the thickest portions appear to have many layers
and are possibly calcified. The luminal surface is white-tan and trabeculated
with orange-yellow to white-tan debris adherent to the wall. Representative
sections of the thickest portion of the gallbladder wall are taken. The specimen
is submitted as follows:

G1 -2 Cystic duct margin and gallbladder wall

G3 Gallbladder wall, submitted for decalcification prior to processing

Part H is received in formalin and is additionally labeled "esophagus
gastrectomy." The specimen consists of a portion of esophagus and proximal
stomach measuring 13.5 x 11.2 x 4.5 cm. There is a moderate amount of attached
fat. The specimen has been previously inked in the deep surface of the esophagus
and has been opened. A portion of the specimen has been banked with the
Tissue Bank. The distal gastric margin is stapled. Also received with the
specimen is a clear plastic tube which is within the lumen of the proximal
esophagus. This tube is stapled to the mucosal lining of the esophagus. Further
opening of the specimen reveals a large ulcerated, polypoid mass extending into
the lumen. This mass is red-brown, and focally hemorrhagic and necrotic, with
dimensions of 8.2 x 4.6 x 4.2 cm. This mass is located 2.5 cm from the closest
esophageal edge and 4.5 cm from the distal gastric margin. The mass involves the
GE junction. The mass appears to abut the inked deep margin. A search of the
attached fat reveals multiple pink-tan, rubbery lymph nodes, up to 1.8 cm in
greatest dimension. The specimen is submitted as follows:

H1 -3 Gastric margin

H4-5 Mass to closest deep margin

H6-9 Additional sections of mass

H10-11 One esophageal lymph node, trisected

H12 One esophageal lymph node, trisected

H13 One esophageal lymph node, bisected

H14-15 Multiple whole esophageal lymph nodes

H16-17 Multiple whole gastric lymph nodes

H18 One gastric lymph node, bisected

Microscopic Description:
The final diagnosis of each specimen incorporates the microscopic examination
findings.
