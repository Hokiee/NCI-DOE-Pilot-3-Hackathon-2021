SPECIMEN
A. sigmoid colon
B. Right abdominal wall tumor
C. Omentum

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Left colon cancer.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. Received fresh, labeled "sigmoid colon", is a

previously unopened, 31 cm. segment of distal colon,
surfaced by smooth and glistening tan—pink serosa, with a copious
amount of attached mesocolon. The undesignated margins measure 3.8
and 10.2 cm. in circumference. On opening, there is a
circumferential, well—circumscribed, 5 x 4.5 cm., partially necrotic
tan—white tumor mass, located 10 cm. form the smaller circumference
margin. A portion of the tumor and a portion of normal mucosa are
submitted for tissue procurement, as requested. On sectioning, the
tumor has a maximal thickness of 2 cm., grossly extending through
the muscularis to within 0.8 cm. of the inked free radial serosal
surface. The remaining mucosa is unremarkable, glistening tan—pink,
with regular folds, and the wall averages 0.5 cm. in thickness.
Multiple, slightly rubbery tan~white to tan—pink tissues, in keeping
with lymph nodes, measuring up to 4.8 cm. in greatest dimension, are
recovered from the attached mesocolon. Representative sections are
submitted in fourteen blocks, as labeled. RS—l4

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Undesignated margins (smaller circumference
margin inked blue); 2,3 — tumor full thickness to inked free radial
serosal surface; 4 — central tumor; 5 s tumor to normal mucosa; 6 —
random normal mucosa; 7 — eight whole lymph nodes; 8,9 m six whole
lymph nodes per cassette; 10—12 — one representative section from
each of three grossly positive nodes (one node represented per
cassette): 13,14 - two representative sections from largest, grossly

GROSS DESCRIPTION
positive lymph node.

B. Received in formalin labeled ”right abdominal wall

tumor is a 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm yellow lobular fatty tissue
fragment which shows a 0.2 cm whitestan rubbery nodule on the
surface. @he specimen is bisected and entirely submitted in one
cassette. ASHl.

C. Received in formalin, labeled "omentum" are multiple

pieces of fat described below. The specimen is sectioned
to show a yellow lobular fatty cut surface grossly consistent with

 

omentum. The specimen shows a 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.1 cm. focus of white—tan
rubbery tissue which may be grossly consistent with fibrinous
exudate or possible adhesion tissue. The specimen is also further
palpated to identify a 2.2 cm. whitehpinkhtan rubbery nodule. No
other discrete gross lesions are identified. Representative sections
of the specimen are submitted in eight cassettes. RS—B

MICROSCO9IC DESCRIPTION

A—C. Microscopic examination reveals:
Histologic type: Invasive adenocarcinoma, Mucinous.
Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated.
Primary tumor (pT): Tumor invades through the muscularis propria
into the pericolonic fat (pTB).
Proximal margin: Negative for tumor.
Distal margin: Negative for tumor.
Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative for tumor.
Distance of tumor from closest margin: 10 cm. from one of the
undesignated mucosal resection margins
Vascular invasion: Lymphatic space invasion present. (Slide A5).
Regional lymph nodes (pN): Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in 7
of 20 lymph nodes (pN2). The largest metastasis measures 4.8 cm.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: Present.

Distant metastasis (pM): Metastatic tumor is present in the B

specimen in the right abdominal wall with an 0.2 cm. nodule within
that. Metastatic tumor is also present in the omentum with a 2.2
cm. nodule within the fat. {le}.

Other findings: Diverticulosis.

5x1, 3x2, 3260F.

DIAGNOSIS

A. Colon, sigmoid, segmental resection:
Invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated.
Invasive in to pericolonic fat (pTS).
Metastatic adenocarcinoma present in 7 of 20 pericolonic lymph
nodes (pNZ). Extranodal tumor present.
The resection margins are negative.
Diverticulosis also present.
B. Right abdominal wall tumor, biopsy:
Metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma.
C. Omentum, biopsy:
Metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma.
