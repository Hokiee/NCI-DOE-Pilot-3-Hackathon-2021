l: RIGHT ADNEXA

Labeled "right adnexa" and received in formalin is an ovary with
attached fallopian tube. The specimen weighs 13 grams. The ovary
measures 3.7 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm and has firm yellow focally hemorrhagic
mildly lobulated surface. Sectioning of the ovary reveals a corpus
luteum measuring up to 2.2 cm in greatest dimension and also one
smooth wall cyst filled with clear fluid and with a wall thickness up
to 0.1 cm. The fallopian tube has fimbria at one end and is 3.7 cm
long and has an average diameter of 0.7 cm. Attached to the
fallopian tubes there are three thin wall translucent fluid filled
cysts measuring from 0.1 to 0.2 cm in diameter. Sectioning of the
tube reveal a patent lumen measuring up to 0.1 cm in diameter.
Representative sections submitted.

B. Right fallopian tube and mesosalpinx — 4

2: LEFT ADNEXA

Labeled "left adnexa“ and received in formalin is an ovary with
attached fallopian tube. The specimen weighs 9.0 grams. The ovary
measures 3.0 x 1.7 x 1.2 cm, has pink-yellow lobulated smooth
surface. Section reveals approximately eight cystic spaces ranging
in size from 0.3 to 0.8 cm: The walls are smooth and have maximum
thickness of 0.1 cm. The attached fallopian tube measures 4.0 cm in
length and has a fimbriated end. The tube measures 0.5 cm in average
diameter with tan—pink serosa. Section of the fallopian

tube shows a lumen measuring up to 0.1 cm in diameter.
Representative sections.

Room for frozen section diagnosis and subsequently fixed in formalin
are two lymph nodes measuring 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm and 4.5 x 1.8 x 1.5

9: UTERUS

Labeled "uterus" and received in formalin is a 260 gram hysterectomy
specimen. The uterus is symmetric and measures 10.5 cm from fundus
to ectocervix, 8.0 cm cornu to cornu and 6.5 cm anterior to
posterior. The cervix is 4.0 cm long and has a maximum diameter of
8.5 cm. The cervix is largely replaced by a firm tan-red,
ulcerated, fungating mass. The barrel shaped mass measures 8.0 x
5.0 x 3.0 cm. The mass is 0.1 cm, 0.6 cm, 0.4cm, and 0.6 cm from the

deep cervical margins of the posterior, anterior, left, and right
respectiVely (deep margin being the external surface of the cervix).
A vaginal cuff surrounds the mass and measures 1.0 cm wide
posteriorly to 4.0 cm wide anteriorly. The tumor is therefore 1 cm
from the closest vaginal resection margin. .The mass involves the
whole endocervical canal and extends into the lower uterine
segment/isthmus. The bulk of the uterine corpus is grossly
uninvolved. The endometrial cavity measures 4.0 cm long and 3.7 cm
wide, and is covered by tan soft, smooth endometrium that measures
up to 0.5 cm in thickness. Section of the uterine corpus reveal
mildly trabecular myometrium and two intramural and one subserosal,
well circumscribed firm tan‘white whorled masses without grossly
evident hemorrhages or areas of necrosis. All resection margins are
inked blue.
