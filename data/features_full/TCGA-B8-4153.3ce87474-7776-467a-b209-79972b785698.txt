Surgical Pathology Report

Accession #:

Diagnosis:
Kidney, left, laparoscopic radical nephreotomy

Histologic tumor type/subtype: renal cell carcinoma, clear
cell type

Histologic grade (if applicable): Fuhrman grade 3 of 4
Tumor size (greatest dimension): 5 cm

Extent of tumor invasion:

Capsular invasion/perirenal adipose tissue: negative for
carcinoma

_5 fascia: negative for carcinoma

Renal vein: negative for carcinoma

Ureter: negative for carcinoma

Venous (large vessel): positive for renal cell carcinoma
(A8)

Lymphatic (small vessel): negative for carcinoma

Sinus adipose tissue: positive for renal cell carcinoma

Adjacent organs: negative for carcinoma

Histologic assessment of surgical margins:
Perirenal adipose tissue: negative for carcinoma
Gerota' s fascia: negative for carcinoma

Renal vein: negative for carcinoma

Renal artery: negative for carcinoma

Ureter: negative for carcinoma

Adrenal gland: Negative for carcinoma

 

Lymph nodes: none identified
Other significant findings: simple renal cyst

AJCC Staging:
pT3a
pNx
pMX

This staging information is based on information available
at the time of this report, and is subject to change
pending clinical review and additional information.

Clinical History:
The patient is who presents with left renal mass.

Gross Description:

Specimen fixation: Formalin

Type of specimen: Laparoscopic radical nephrectomy
Side of specimen: Left

Size and weight of specimen: 800 grams; overall 26 x 13 x
11.5 cm; kidney 11 x 8 x 6 cm; adrenal 4.5 x 1.5 cm

Orientation: The external surface of the specimen is inked
blue, the adrenal gland is dotted with yellow ink.

Presence/absence of adrenal gland: Present

Tumor description/site: The tumor involves the renal
cortex, medulla, and pelvis, with a pushing border into the
perirenal adipose tissue (there is no infiltrating tumor
beyond the capsule into the perirenal fat); the tumor has
an overall central location that does not favor either the
superior or inferior poles; the tumor is orange/yellow,
well—circumscribed, and firm to palpation; areas of
hemorrhage and necrosis are identified.

Tumor size: 5 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm.
Presence/absence of multicentricity: The tumor is unifocal

Confinement/non—confinement to the kidney: The tumor has a

 

pushing border but does not invade through the renal
capsule (the tumor is close to the blue inked surgical
margin of resection).

Extent of invasion:

Perirenal adipose tissue: Negative

Gerota' s fascia: Negative

Renal vein: Negative

Ureter: Negative

Other organs: The tumor does not involve the adrenal gland

Surgical margins:

Perirenal adipose tissue: Negative
Renal vein: Negative

Renal artery: Negative

Ureter: Negative

Description of kidney away from tumor: The remainder of the
normal kidney demonstrates a normal cortex to medulla ratio
and is unremarkable.

Lymph nodes (hilar): No hilar lymph nodes are appreciated.
Other significant findings: None

Tissue submitted for special investigations: Normal and
neoplastic tissue are submitted to tissue procurement for
special investigation.

Digital photograph taken: None taken
