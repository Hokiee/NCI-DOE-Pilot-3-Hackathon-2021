GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) OMENTUM - An irregular fragment of adipose tissue (30.0 x 15.0 x 1.5 cm). The specimen is serially sectioned and the cut
surface is white ﬁrm in about 90% of the specimen. Representative sections in cassettes A1-A3.

(B) UTERUS, TUBES AND OVARIES - An enlarged uterus (14.0 x 8.0 x 7.0 cm), the attached bilateral fallopian tubes (5.0 x 0.5 x
0.5 cm in average), the attached bilateral ovaries (1.3 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm in average). A tan soft multilobulated polypoid mass (9.0 x
5.0 x 5.0 cm) is attached to the left lateral wall of the endometrium and protruding into the endometrial cavity. The tumor is
superﬁcially located in the myometrium without obvious invasion. Tumor has a homogeneous tan appearance with no obvious
necrosis or calcification. The tumor focally involves the lower uterine segment at the anterior left lateral aspect. The remaining
endometrium, myometrium and serosa are unremarkable.

Two ﬁrm nodules (0.2 to 0.3 cm in greatest dimension) are present in the para-ovarian soft tissue of the left side. The
remaining bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries are grossly unremarkable.

SECTION CODE: 81. anterior cervix; 82, posterior cervix; B3, 84, left posterior wall with tumor, full section; 85, tumor
with endometrium and serosa, left posterior wall; 86, tumor at the lower uterine segment of the anterior left wall; 87-814, tumor
with different appearance; 815-817, tumor with adjacent endometrium; 818. anterior wall; 819, posterior wall; 820, right ovary,
bisected, entirely submitted; 821, right fallopian tube, representative sections; 822, left ovarv. bisected. entirely submitted; 822,
823, left fallopian tube; 824, two ﬁrm nodules at the para-ovarian soft tissue on left side. i
(C) LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES - Three lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 to 2.0 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm.
