3. LYMPH NODES. Paracaval

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

1. Received fresh OR labeled with the patients name. medical record number, and “right kidney and adrenal
gland” is a radical nephrectomy specimen measuring 19 x 16 x 9.5 cm overall. There is a tumor thrombus
protruding from the renal vein measuring 3 x 2 x 1 cm. The kidney is inked and bivalved to reveal a tumor
measuring 11.5 x 7.4 cm with friable, red/brown, variegated, cut surface. The tumor is replacing most of the
renal parenchyma. Fragments of tumor measuring 3.5 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm in aggregate were procured for

ab, approximately 6.5 x 5 x 2.4 cm tumor and tumor thrombi measuring 2 x 2 1 cm were procured for

Theprocurement was performed by on Received in Surgical
Pathology. the specimen is consistent with the above description. Grossly. the tumor is largely necrotic. and
does not invade through the Gerota’s fascia. but the renal capsule is difﬁcult to strip. Two hilar lymph nodes are
identiﬁed measuring up to 0.7 cm in largest dimension. The adrenal gland is identified measuring 7 x 4 x 0.3 cm.
Grossly, it is not involved by the tumor. Representative sections are submitted in white cassettes labeled
he to 10 for serial sectioning. The cassettes are summarized as follows:

1A: Artery and ureteral margins

18: Renal vein thrombus

1C: Tumor thrombus in renal vein

1D-1 I: Tumor with margins

1J—1 P: Representative sections from the tumor

10: Lymph node (2),

1R: Tumor with margin near the adrenal gland

1S. 1T, 1U: Representative sections from the adrenal gland .

Additional sections were later submitted in white cassettes labeled ‘ . f-lEE for serial sectioning. The

cassettes are summarized as follows:
1V-1Z:Tumor with margins.

1 AA: Proximal end of a possible ureter

iBB: Distal end of the possible ureter

1CC: Venous thrombi cross-section

1DD: A tubular structure near the ureter. proximal
' 1EE: A tubular structure near the ureter. distal

2. “lntraaortic caval nodes". The specimen consists of a yellow/brown ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 5 x 2.5 x

0.6 cm. The specimen is bisected. Three possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed with the largest one measuring 2.5

cm in largest dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted in white cassettes labeled .1 -- ‘;- "A-2D for
serial sectioning. The cassettes are summarized as follows:

2A: One lymph node
28: Onelymph node bisected
20 and 20: One. lymph node bisected

3. “Pericaval lymph node with stitch is cephalad". The specimen consists of two yellow/brown tissue fragments:
' One measures 7.5 x 4 x 1.5 cm. the other one measures 2 x 1 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is dissected and 17

possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed. The lymph 'nodes are entirely submitted in white cassettes labeled

3A—3H for serial sectioning. The cassettes are summarized as follows:

3A: Three lymph nodes

33: One lymph node

SC: Three lymph nodes

30: One lymph node

3E: Three lymph nodes

3F: One lymph node bisected
36: Three lymph nodes
