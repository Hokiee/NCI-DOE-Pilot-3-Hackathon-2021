Comment

Since the surgical margins are involved by tumor evaluation of the extent of extrathyroidal extension cannot be reliably
performed on this specimen. Therefore. intraoperative ﬁndings may alter the stage of the primary tumor.

Gross Description
1. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "right neck contents” consists of a piece of oriented ﬁbroadipose

tissue that measures 12.5 cm Si x 4.5 cm AP x 1.4 cm ML and contains multiple lymph nodes that range from 0.5 cm to
2.5 cm in maximum dimension.

Superior third portion of the specimen:

1A three lymph nodes bisected

13 one lymph node bisected

10 multiple lymph nodes

1D multiple lymph nodes

1E multiple lymph nodes

Mid third portion of the specimen

1F two lymph nodes

1G one lymph node bisected

1H multiple lymph nodes

inferior third portion of specimen .
1i one lymph node bisected

1J one lymph node bisected

1 K ' multiplelymph nodes

11. two lymph nodes

2. The specimen labeled with the patients name and as "right paratracheal nodes" consists of 3 gray-brown nodules that
measure from 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm to 1.7 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm received in 10% buffered formalin. The specimen is submitted in
toto as follows:

2A two lymph nodes

23 one lymph node bisected.

3. The specimen labeled with the patients name and as "total thyroid, stitch marks upper pole. left lobe fresh tumor
banking" consists of an oriented thyroid gland that weighs 28.0 g. The right lobe measures 5.0 cm SI x 2.9 cm ML x 2.2
cm AP. the left lobe measures 4.2 cm Si x 2.5 cm ML x 1.1 cm AP and the isthmus measures 3.2 cm Si x 1.1 cm ML x 0.5
cm AP. The external surfaces have ﬁbrous adhesions and are painted with silver nitrate. No parathyroid glands or no
lymph nodes are identiﬁed grossly. The upper to lower right lobe contains a well delineated partly calcified nodule that
measures 3.0 cm SI x 2.5 cm ML x 2.1 cm AP. The upper mid to lower left lobe contains a well delineated nodule that
measures 1.6 cm SI x 1.1 cm ML x 0.8 cm AP. The remainder of the thyroid tissue is unremarkable. Sections of right lobe
nodule and normal tissue are stored frozen. The remainder of the specimen is submitted as follows: '

3A-J right lobe. superior to inferior

3K-L isthmus

3M-Q left lobe. superior to inferior

Microscopic Description

One of the metastatic nodes exhibits focal tall cell change.
