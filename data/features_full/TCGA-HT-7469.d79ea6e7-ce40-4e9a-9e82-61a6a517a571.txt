Microscopic

Sections demonstrate a markedly hypercellular glial neoplasm. The tumor cells
in many areas have round, small nuclei with little atypia. In these areas, mitotic
figures are rare. In other areas, the nuclei are larger and more angular. Here up
to eight mitoses per 10 high power fields are seen. Blood vessels are prominent
and true microvascular proliferation is not seen. Several foci of nonpalisading
tumor necrosis are present. Overall, the tumor cells have few processes and
many have small perinuclear halos.

Addendum discussion:

The calculated MlB-1 labeling index is 16.1% consistent with a high grade
glioma.

Final Addendum Pathology Report

Insular Tumor, including area worrisome for high grade, biopsies and resection:
Anaplastic oligodendroglioma (WHO grade III)

MIB-1 labeling index = 16.1%
