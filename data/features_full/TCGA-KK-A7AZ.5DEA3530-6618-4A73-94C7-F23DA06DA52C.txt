DIAGNOSIS

(B) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESlCLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 7 (4+3). (SEE COMMENT)
TUMOR EXTENDING lNTO EXTRAPROSTATIC TISSUE.
Margins of resection free of tumor.
Right and left seminal vesicles, no tumor present.
Segments of right and left vasa deferentia, no tumor present.
PERINEURAL INVASION PRESENT.
No lymphovascular invasion identiﬁed.
PROSTATIC lNTRAEPlTHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGHGRADE.

comment;

The prostate gland contains two foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, one in the peripheral zone and one in the transition zone.

The dominant tumor focus is located in the right anterolateral, right lateral, right posterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior. and
left posterior peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 2.5 x 1.6 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in
the two cross sections of the prostate. extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. This tumor exhibits extensive
multifocal extraprostatic extension. Extraprostatic extension is present in the right anterolateral and right lateral surface of the
prostate and in the right superior neurovascular bundle region. Extraprostatic extension is present in multiple sections and the
added length of extraprostatic extension is 5.0 mm. The margins of resection are free of tumor. The second tumor focus is
located in the right and left transition zone. This tumor focus measures 1.6 x 0.5 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it
is present in the two cross sections of the prostate and focally in the apex and base regions. This tumor focus is of lower histologic
grade and confined to the prostate. All margins of resection are free of tumor.

GROSS, DESCRIPTION

(B) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESlCLES — A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (4.4 x 3.0 x 3.7 cm, 30 grams, post-ﬁxation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
right posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the left side. A nodule is palpated in the right base
region. Serial cross sections after ﬁxation demonstrate a ﬁrm area consistent with tumor in the right side of the two cross sections
of the prostate.

The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

SECTION CODE: B1-B4, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; 85-57,
left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; 88, 89. prostatic base right border; BIO-813,

base left posterior border; 822, 823, apex anterior; 824, 825, apex left; 826-829, apex posterior; B30, 831, apex right; 832,
detached portions of margin of resection according to specimen radiograph; 833-840, sections of the two cross sections of the
prostate according to specimen radiograph.

The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in
black. Blue ink (822 and 23) and orange ink (835, 36, 39 and 40) denote surfaces that do not represent a true margin of
resection.
