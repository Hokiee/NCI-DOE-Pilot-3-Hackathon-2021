2). The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "Right thyroid lobe. long stitch superior, short stitch isthmus". It consists of a
thyroid lobe measuring 5.3 x 3 x 1.7 cm and weighing 8 g. The surface is disrupted in the posterior superior aspect. The lobe is
inked black posterior and blue anterior. Serial sectioning reveals two lesions: 1.3 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm white solid nodule in superior/mid

lobe abutting posterior margin (N1) and 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm solid white nodule in lower lobe (N2). The specimen is entirely submitted
to include TPS from both nodules.

Summary of sections:
N1 - larger nodule
N2 - smaller nodule
RL - remaining lobe

3). The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "Left thyroid lobe, stitch marks superior pole". it consists of a thyroid lobe
measuring 4.3 x 2.8 x 1.4 cm and weighing 7.5 g. The lobe is inked black posterior and blue anterior. Serial sectioning reveals a
0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm white ﬁbrotic area abutting the posterior margin in the mid lobe. The remaining cut surface is unremarkable. The
specimen is entirely submitted.
