 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
PART 1: RIGHT KIDNEY AND PROXIMAL URET ER LAPAROSCOPIC NEPHRECTOMY â€”-

A RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL {CLEAR CELL AND FOCAL GRANULAR CELL] TYPE,
PREDOMINANTLY FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 214, WITH FOCAL AREAS OF FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRAI:
3M, 9 CM. CARCINOMA EPICENTER IS IN THE LOWER POLE OF THE RIGHT KIDNEY. FOCAL EXTRAREN
EXTENSION INTO RENAL SINUS ADIPOSE TISSUE IS IDENTIFIED (SLIDE 'II). MULTIPLE INTRARENAL
DEPOSITS OF CONVENTIONAL RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (0.1 CM -1 CM.) MOST LIKELY REPRESENTINI
INTRARENAL SATELLITE METASTASES {SLIDES 1F, 16). NO TUMOR THROMBUS IS IDENTIFIED IN LARI
RENAL VEINS. ALL SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE BENIGN. PATHOLOGIC STAGE: T3a. NX, M1
(see microscopic description, diagnosis comment and part 2).

B. NON~NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY WITH NO SIGNIFICANT HISTOLOGIC ABNORMALITY.

C. SEGMENT OF BENIGN URETER, RENAL ARTERY AND RENAL VEIN.

g
PART 2. RIGHT ADRENAL GLAND, ADRENALECTOMY -
METASTATIC RENAL CELL CARCINOMA WITH THE LARGEST METASTATIC DEPOSIT MEASURING 2. 5 CM.
METASTATIC CARCINOMA APPEARS CONFINED To THE ADRENAL GLAND. SURGICAL RESECTION MARGII

IS BENIGN.
