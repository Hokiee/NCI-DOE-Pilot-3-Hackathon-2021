CLINICAL DETAILS

1 - Massive invasive Ca Bladder. Radical cystectomy.

2 - T3 + bladder cancer. Radical/palliative cystectomy.

MACROSCOPY

1 - The specimen comprises bladder measuring 90 supero-inferiorly x 100
transversely x 45 mm anterior-posterior. This is accompanied by uterus, which
is 50 mm fundus to 0s, 45 mm transversely, 30 anterior-posterior. The leﬁ
fallopian tube is 65 mm long, 5 mm diameter. Leﬁ ovary is 15 x 12 x 5 mm.
Right fallopian tube is 70 mm long, 3 mm diameter. Right ovary 28 x 14 x 16 mm.
A triangular piece of vaginal mucosa also present 60 x 45 mm. On opening the
bladder, there is a widely inﬁltrating tumour on the posterior wall + extending
to the dome and the lateral walls, 65 mm supero-inferiorly x 38 mm transverse x
up to 30 mm in depth. The tumour is 30 mm from the urethral margin. The
tumour inﬁltrates into the anterior wall of the uterus. The right lateral wall
shows a diverticulum 25 mm in diameter.

2 - This is a ﬁrm piece of ﬁbrofatty tissue, 9 mm, maximum dimension.

3 - Mucosa tissue with suture toward one end, 20 x 10 x 6 mm.

4 - A segment of ureter 6 mm long and up to 3 mm diameter, with a suture at one
end.

5 - Segment of ureter, 10 mm long x 5 mm diameter, with suture at one end.
MICROSCOPY

1, 3 -5

This a poorly differentiated (Grade 3) transitional cell carcinoma with

extensive squamous differentiation and focal glandular differentiation with
signet ring forms.

There IS extensive squamous metaplasia of the surface mucosa. Tumour 15
identified arising from dysplastic epithelium. The macroscopic appearance of
tumour inﬁltration into the uterus (pT4) is conﬁrmed with tumour spread to the
outer half of the myometrium of the anterior wall. Vascular invasion is

present. No perineural' Invasion is identiﬁed. The tumour is present at the
serosal surface at the dome. The urethral and the vaginal resection margins are
morphologically normal and clear of tumour. The vaginal mucosa is uninvolved,
but tumour extends to within 5 mm. A diverticulum IS identiﬁed 1n the right
lateral wall. Two lymph nodes identiﬁed 1n the perivesical fat do not show

any evidence of metastatic deposit. The ovaries appear unremarkable.

2 - This shows ﬁbrofatty tissue inﬁltrated by a poorly differentiated

carcinoma with features similar to those seen in part 1.

SUMMARY: Radical cystectomy with uterus and both adnexa: Grade 3 transitional
cell carcinoma with squamous and grandular differentiation. pT4, pNo.
