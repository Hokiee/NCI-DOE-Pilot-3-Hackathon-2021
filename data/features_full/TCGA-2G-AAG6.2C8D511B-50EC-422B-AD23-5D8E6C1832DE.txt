Discrepancy between Pathology Report and Case Quality Control Form

 

3 Provide the reason for
the discrepancy
between the pathology
report and the TCGA
Case Quality Control
Form.

Due to the histological heterogeneous
constitution of non<seminomas, the
representation of the different
elements can and is in fact expected
to differ between the FFPE and frozen
samples of the same case.

However, the components are monoclonal
in origin.

Provide a reason describing why the diagnosis on the initial
pathology report for this case is not consistent with the
diagnosis selected on the TCGA Case Quality Control Form.
