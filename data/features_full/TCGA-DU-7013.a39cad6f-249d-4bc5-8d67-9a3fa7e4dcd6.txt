A,B. BRAIN, TEMPORAL LOBE, EXCISIONAL BIOPSIES: ANAPLASTIC
ASTROCYTOMA. NIB-l PROLIFERATION INDEX 12% TO 16%.

SEE MICROSCOPIC AND COMMENT.

Operation/Specimen:UPDATED REPORT—Brain. Left temporal lobe tumor
—FS.

Clinical History and Pre—Op Dx: man with history of
seizures I months ago. MRI shows slightly enhancing lesion in the
temporal lobe.

GROSS PATHOLOGY: A. Received fresh, three fragments, 1.3 cm across
in

aggregate. Semi—firm, grayishwbrown. In total #1-3.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION:

1. Brain, imprint: Scant atypical naked nuclei.
2. Brain, squash preparations: Glioma, C/W high histological grade

B.

SPECIMEN: Left temporal lobe tumor.

FIXATIVE: None.

GENERAL: Six fragments of brain parenchyma, 1.8 up to 3.5 cm. in
greatest dimension. There are areas of hemorrhagic and
gray soft material.

SECTIONS: X1—X3 — representative of each piece.

MICROSCOPIC: A,B. Portions of a glial neoplastic proliferation. The
neoplastic cells have anaplastic elongated nuclei disposed in a heavy
fibrillary background. There are occasional mitotic figures. There is
capillary—type microvasculature with interanastomosing vessels, and
focally there is microvascular cellular proliferation. There is no
necrosis.

SPECIAL STAINS: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP and MIB—l were
performed on sections from blocks #2 and x3.

The GFAP demonstrates the glial fibrillary background of the
tumor. With the MIBul labelling indices of 12% and 16% were
determined

in the more active areas.

 

COMMENT: The lesion is a glial neoplasm with heavy glial
fibrillogenesis. The tumor cells have nuclear anaplastic features,
mitotic figures are occasionally observed, and microvascular cellular
proliferation is present focally. Necrosis is absent. The neoplasm
is

a high histological grade glioma (WHO grade IV/IV), however devoid of
necrosis. The interanastomosing pattern of the microvasculature
suggests an oligodendroglial component.

ADDENDUM REPORT

B.
Tissue not previously submitted from this specimen is now submitted in

total, #x4—x9.

Microscopically, this tissue corresponds to brain diffusely and
extensively infiltrated by a neoplastic proliferation similar to that
one described above. In here, microvascular calcification and a
microvascular network of vessels is more prominent. In a couple of
microscopic areas there is tumor necrosis associated with
microvascular

cellular proliferation.

The presence of microscopic zones of necrosis would justify the
designation of this tumor as glioblastoma multiforme. Again, an
oligodendroglial component is probable in this tumor.
