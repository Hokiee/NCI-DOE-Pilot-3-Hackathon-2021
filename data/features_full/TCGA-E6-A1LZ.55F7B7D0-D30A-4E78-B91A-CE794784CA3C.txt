INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:
FSA Uterus, tubes and bilateral ovaries: Endometrial adenocarcinoma. high grade serous carcinoma
arising in an endometrial polyp. No myometrial invasion is identiﬁed.

By Dr, called to Dr. .
GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. UTERUS, TUBES AND OVARIES
Received fresh for frozen section and tissue procurement and labeled "uterus, tubes and ovaries" is a

120 gram uterus with attached bilateral adnexa and cervix measuring 9.5 x 5.7 x 4.2 cm. The serosa is

unremarkable. The exocervix is 4.2 x 3.5 x 0.9 cm and is smooth. The cervical os is slit-like. patent
and 0.7 cm. The anterior serosal surface is inked blue, posterior surface is inked black and the uterus
is bivalved. The endocervical canal is unremarkable. Within the superior portion of the endometrial
cavity there is an exophytic polypoid lesion measuring 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm and does not appear to invade
into the myometrium. Additional granular and slightly polypoid areas are seen. In the anterior left
portion of the endometrium is a granular area of white-tan discoloration. 1.7 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm. There is an
area of golden tan discoloration, 1.7 x 1 x 0.1 cm. within the anterior aspect of the endometrium. It

consists of a well circumscribed calciﬁed nodular ﬁrm pink-tan mass measuring 3.2 x 2.8 x 1.5 cm. This

nodule is submitted for decalciﬁcation. The endometrium is 0.2 cm with a myometrium of 2.1cm. The
left fallopian tube is 5.2 cm in length with a diameter of 0.7 cm. The ovary is 3.3 x 0.9 x 0.6 cm. The
serosa is unremarkable and on sectioning. no abnormalities are seen. The left fallopian tube is 5.5 cm
in length with a diameter of 0.7 cm. The ovary is 2.5 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm. The serosa is smooth and on
sectioning. no masses or lesions are found. Sections of endometrial mass are submitted for tissue
procurement and GOG 210 study. Photograph is taken. Representative sections are submitted as

follows:
FSA1 :

B. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE
Received in formalin and labeled with the patient name 'leﬂ pelvic lymph node" is an aggregate of
yellow-tan adipose tissue, 6.2 x 3.5 x 1.2 cm. Five possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging in size
from 1.4 to 3 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are bisected and have a uniform yellow-tan
coloration. The largest possible lymph node is hemorrhagic, yellow~tan. The specimen is submitted in

toto as follows:

C. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE

Received in formalin and labeled with the patient name "right pelvic lymph node” are pieces of yellow-
tan adipose tissue. in aggregate 5.5 x 4.9 x 1.3 cm. Multiple possible lymph nodes are found ranging in
size from 0.1 to 3.1 cm in greatest dimension. The larger lymph nodes are bisected and have a uniform
tan coloration throughout. The specimen is submitted' In toto as follows:

C1: six possible lymph nodes

CZ: four possible lymph nodes
C3-C4: one bisected lymph node each
CS-C6: one lymph node

C7-C10: remainder of soft tissue
D. LEFT PARAAORTIC LYMPH NODE
Received in formalin and labeled with the patient name "left paraaortic lymph node" is one piece of
yellow-tan adipose tissue. 3.5 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm. Four lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging in size from 0.5
to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is submitted in toto as follows:

D1: four possible lymph nodes

DZ: remainder of soft tissue

E. RIGHT PARAAORTIC LYMPH NODE

Received in formalin and labeled with the patient name "right paraaortic lymph node" is a piece of
yellow-tan adipose tissue with attached blood clot measuring 2.5 x 1.7 x 0.5 cm. No distinct lymph node
is identiﬁed. The specimen is submitted in toto in block E1.

F. OMENTUM

Received in formalin and labeled with the patient name "omentum" is a piece of yellow-tan omentum
measuring 45 x 11.5 x 0.5 cm. On sectioning. no masses, lesions or areas of discoloration are noted.
Representative sections are submitted in blocks F1-F3.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. UTERUS, RIGHT AND LEFT FALLOPIAN TUBES AND OVARIES, HYSTERECTOMY WITH
BILATERAL SALPINGO—OOPHORECTOMY:
- UTERINE SEROUS CARCINOMA FIGO GRADE 3. WITH FOCAL CLEAR CELL CHANGE
CONFINED 0 THE ENDOMETRIUM (STAGE IA)
-CALC|F|ED SUBSEROSAL LEIOMYOMA
- RIGHT AND LEFT FALLPIAN TUBES AND OVARIES WITH NO EVIDENCE OF CARCINOMA
- CERVIX AND ENDOCERVIX WITH NO EVIDENCE OF CARCINOMA.

NOTE: The entire endometrium. lower uterine segment, and endocervix were submitted for histological
examination. The vast majority of the endometrium was involved with carcinoma with only a few areas
of uninvolved endometrium present with cystic atrophy. The lower uterine segment was also extensively
involved, but there was no deﬁnitive involvement of the endocervix which as stated previously was
totally submitted for histological examination.
