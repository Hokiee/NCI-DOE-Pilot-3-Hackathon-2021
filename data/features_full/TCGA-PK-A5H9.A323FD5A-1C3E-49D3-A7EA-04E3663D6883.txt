Diagnosis

1. Angioinvasive low grade adrenal cortical carcinoma, 10.0 cm: Adrenal (side not speciﬁed) adrenalectomy specimen.
See Comment and Microscopic Description.

2. No pathological diagnosis: Gallbladder. cholecystectomy specimen.
3. No pathological diagnosis: Flbroadlpose tissue, (site listed as “surgical waste") excision.

4. Focal nodular hyperplasia; no evidence of metastatic disease; macrovesicular steatosis (10%): Liver (segment 5),
segmentectomy specimen. See Microscopic Description.

Comment
The mitotic activity is very low (2/50HPF); the presence of angioinvasion. atypical mitosis. increased p53 expression

(15%), paucity of clear cells and diffuse architecture are consistent with an angioinvasive low grade adrenal cortical-
carcinoma.

The adrenal tumor has been seen in consultation with and they agree with the interpretation
and diagnosis.

Gross Description
1. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "adrenal mass with adrenal gland". contains a tan fatty grossly

enlarged adrenal gland which is received fresh. The specimen weighs 290.9 g in the fresh state. The specimen has
overall measurements of 11.5 x 8.2 x 5.8 cm. The surrounding fat is removed and the adrenal gland weighs 156 9. At
specimen preparation. the specimen has not been painted prior to sectioning. Sectioning of the specimen reveals a
distorted tan-yellow adrenal gland measuring 10.0 x 7.0 x 5.2 cm. Adjacent to the adrenal gland is a solid and partially
cystic tan hemorrhagic mass which measures 10.0 x 5.7 x 5.2 cm. There is a tan-white ﬁbrous capsule over the surface of
the mass measuring 0.1 cm in thickness. Photographs are taken. Representative tissue is submitted frozen.
Representative tissue is submitted for electron microscopy.

1U- 1AL additional representative sections of the mass

2. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "gallbladder", contains a gallbladder that is unremarkable. It
measures 6.0 cm long. with an open circumference of 4.8 cm. and an average wall thickness of 0.2 cm. It contains green
bile, no gallstones are grossly identified. The duct is patent. The cystic duct lymph node is not grossly identiﬁed.

2A representative sections submitted

3. The specimen labeled with the patient‘s name and as "surgical waste", contains 1 piece of tissue in 10% buffered
formalin. The tissue consists of a fragment of adipose measuring 4.5 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm. No gross abnormalities are
identiﬁed.

3A -3B representative sections submitted

4. The specimen container is received labeled with the patient’s name and as “liver segment 5". The specimen consists of
a segment of liver, received fresh with a weight of 132.2 g. The capsule is pale tan and smooth except for two areas, a
linear area defect measuring 5-cm length which is consistent with cautery and a dark tan spot on the surface measuring
1.2 cm diameter which is adjacent to the tumor mass. The surgical excision margin is painted with green ink. The cut
surface demonstrates a single tan ﬁbrotic mass as follows:

Nodule #1. 1.8 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm: Distance from margin: 1.1cm

There is no large vessel invasion or extrahepatic extension. The hilar vessels and ducts, and the hepatic vein outflow
tracts cannot be identiﬁed. There is no gallbladder grossly identified.

Microscopic Description
1. The tumor is an encapsulated 10.0 cm neoplasm which arises from the adrenal (slide 1F). The tumor shows a paucity

of clear cells and diffuse architecture. The mitotic rate is low (2150 HPF) but atypical mitoses, including “tripolar ﬁgures"
are identiﬁed (slide 1E).There is no unequivocal evidence of capsular invasion. However, angioinvasion, with tumor cells
associated with thrombus inside vascular channels, is identiﬁed (slide 1AK). There is no necrosis, and no high grade
Fuhrrnan nuclei. The tumor appears to be completely excised.

Histopathological summary:

1. High nuclear grade (Fuhn'nan criteria): ABSENT

2. >5 mitoses per 50 HPF: ABSENT

3. Atypical mitotic. ﬁgures: PRESENT

4. <25-% of tumor cells are clear cells: PRESENT

5. Diffuse architecture: PRESENT

6. Necrosis: ABSENT

7. Venous Invasion: PRESENT (Tumor cells associated with thrombus; slide MK)

8. Sinusoidal Invasion: ABSENT

9. Capsular Invasion: ABSENT

10. lrnmunohistochemlstry: The tumor stains positive for SF—1, and AE1/AE3 cytokeratin. It shows variable positivity for
low molecular weight cytokeratin (CAM5.2), and p53 (up to 15% of tumor). The tumor is negative for EMA, chromogranin,
HEPAR—t, and vimentin. Beta catenin shows regional loss of membranous staining. The MlB—1 proliferation marker stains
5% of tumor cells. The overall morphological and immunohistochemical features are those of a low grade adrenal cortical
carcinoma.

4. The liver shows a solitary benign hepatocellular lesion composed of hepatocytes with normal N/C ratio, traversed with
ﬁbrous septa containing large vessels, mild lymphoid inﬁltrate and ductular reaction. The features are thoseof focal
nodular hyperplasia. The lesion is negative for SF-1. CK? stains the bile ductular reaction. 0034 shows patchy staining of
sinusoidal endothelial cells around ﬁbrous septa, consistent with focal nodular hyperplasia. There is no evidence of
metastatic disease. The background liver shows no ﬁbrosis (trichrome). There is mild macrovesicular steatosis (10%).
PASD shows no evidence of alpha-l anﬁtrypsin. globUles. Iron, staining is negative.

The liver was seen in consultation with (liver pathology), and she agrees with the interpretation and
diagnosis.
