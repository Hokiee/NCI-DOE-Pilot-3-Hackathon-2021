The lymph node findings were reviewed in this case per request from Dr.
Additional immunohistochemical studies were also performed to

evaluate the lymphocytic component of the staging nodes resected.

evaluated, demonstrate lymph node with reactive,

COMMENT:

Part 1 and 2: The lymphocyte atypia noted in these hyperplastic lymph
nodes is
likely reactive, however this component will be reviewed by our
Hematopathologist colleages. Their findings will be reported in an
addendum.
Cytokeratin AE1/3 stains are negative in several of these lymph nodes.
Part 2: A grocott is negative for fungi in this hyalinized nodule.

ulcerated

lesion present. The supraglottic lesion is located 0.3 cm from the
right

specimen‘ 5 pharyngeal margin, 0.4 cm from the left superior specimen‘

resection

margin. The lesion extends to within less than 0.1 cm of the hyoid
bed. The

lesion grossly involves the pyriform sinus on the right side and
extends into

the aryepiglottic fold. The lesion extends to the false cord on the
right

side and comes to within 0.1 cm of the true cord. The true cord on the
right

side is uninvolved by the lesion. The lesion grossly involves the
epiglottis

and crosses the midline. The true and false cords on the left side are
grossly uninvolved by the lesion. The lesion comes to within 1 cm of
the

false cord on the left side. The lesion extends to within 0.2 cm of the
thyroid cartilage. The thyroid cartilage is grossly uninvolved by the
lesion.

The lesion extends to within 1 cm of the inked anterior soft tissue.
The thyroid lobe measures 4.0 X 3.0 x 2.0 cm and weighs 10 g. There is
a 1.0
x 0.5 x 0.5 cm cystic lesion present in the superior aspect. The
lesion comes
within less than 0.1—cm of the capsular surface. The remainder of the
soft
tissue is tan-brown, soft to firm with multiple potential lymph nodes
present.

Digital images are taken. Tissue is pr0cured for the head and neck
spore
tissue bank (tumor and normal).

Microscopic examination substantiates the above diagnosis.

The following statement applies to all immunohistochemistry, Insitu
Hybridization Assays (ISH & FISH), Molecular Anatomic Pathology, and
Immunofluorescent Testing:
The testing was developed and its performance characteristics
determined bv
