I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSDRAL EXAMENATION OF
THE SLIDES (ANﬂ/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND TEA? I HAVE REVIEWED AND AP?ROVED
THIS REPORT.

 

1). The specimen is received ﬁresh,,1abeled "Right colon" and consists at a
segment of terminal ileum. ccoum, and ascending colon. The terminal ileum
measures 5.5 cm in length and 4.5 cm in circumference at the proximal
resected margin. The remaining colon measures l? in length with a
circumference of 5.4 cm at the distal resected margin. There is no attached
appendix identified. Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose
tissue spans the length of the specimen measuring up to 1.1 cm in thickness.
The specimen is opened to reveal a friable polypoid mass lesion measuring
6.0 cm in length and 10.0 cm in width. The mass is located in the ascending
colon, 16.3 cm from the proximal margin and 5.0 cm from the distal margin.
Sectioning shOWs the tumor invades the musculsris and abuts the underlying
adipose tissue. The depth of invasion is 1.9 cm grossly. There is a 1.5 x
0.6 x 0.5 cm gelatinous filled cyst cavity identified in the tumor. The
remaining mucosa is tan-brown with the normal folds. The iXeocecal valve is
grossly edematous. The attached adipose tissue is submitted for lymph node
dissections. Representati tions of the specimen are submitted for
pormanent sections and few
