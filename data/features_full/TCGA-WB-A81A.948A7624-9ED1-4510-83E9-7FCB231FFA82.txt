Clinical history Left pheochromocytoma

Macroscogz

The piece of adrenalectomy weights 299 after dissection of adipose tissue and measures 7x2.5X3 cm.
It is centred on a nodule measuring 3 cm along their longer axis, well limited, buff colour associated
with some hemorrhagic alterations. Peri-adrenal tumor has a micro-nodular appearance.

Microscogy

The histological aspect is a moncmorphic tumoral proliferation with trabecular architecture or nests
(zellballen). It is densely cellular and composed by cells with basophlllc cytoplasms, ﬁnely granular.
The nuclei, of medium size, are rounded, ﬁnely nucleoled and non hyperchromatlc. it is not observed
quota of fusiform cells. There is no evidence of mitotic ﬁgures. This tumor is well limited by a thin
discontinuous capsule. There is no evidence of inﬁltration of the capsule, of the pen-adrenal adipose
tissue, of vascular invasion or tumor necrosis. The periphery of adrenal presents a draft cortical
nodulation without hyperplasia of glomerulosa or medulla.

At the immunohistochemical study, the tumor cells are chromogranin positive. The sustentacular
network is well preserved, highlighted by the P8100.

CONCLUSION

Left adrenal pheochromocytoma, 3 cm long axis
PASS score = 4 (high cellularity 2 cellular monotony 2).
