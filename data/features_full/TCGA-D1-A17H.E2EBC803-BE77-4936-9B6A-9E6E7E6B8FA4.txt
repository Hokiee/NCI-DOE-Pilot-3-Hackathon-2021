1 Surgical Pathology

DIAGNOSIS:

A. Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy

and bilateral salpingo— oophorectomy: FIGO grade I (of
III)

endometrial adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, is
identified forming “

a mass (6. 6 x 6. 2 x 1.6 cm), circumferentially involving
the

endometrial cavity. The tumor invades 0.8 cm into the
myometrium

(total wall thickness, 1.4 cm). The tumor does not
involve the

endocervix. Lymphovascular space invasion is not
identified. The

margins are negative for tumor. The bilateral ovaries and
fallopian

tubes are unremarkable. [AJCCpTlcNOMO].

B. C. D. E. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, excision:
Multiple right

pelvic lymph nodes (3 external iliac, 4 internal iliac, 3
common

iliac, and 2 obturator) are negative for tumor.

F. G. H. I. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, excision: Multiple
left

pelvic lymph nodes (6 external iliac, 3 internal iliac, 3
common

iliac, and 4 obturator) are negative for tumor.

This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic

examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of
the
specimen(s).

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled "uterus, right and left ovaries
and

fallopian tubes" is a 105.0 gram uterus with attached
bilateral

tubes and ovaries and an unremarkable cervix. The uterine

smooth. There is a 6.6 x 6.2 x 1.6 cm mass from the fundus
to lower

uterine segment of the endometrial cavity with 1.4 cm
myometrial

thickness, 0.8 cm invasion into the myometrium” There is a
2.7 x 1.6

x 0.8 cm right ovary with a smooth outer surface and a
solid cut

surface with a 6.9 x 0.4 cm right fallopian tube. There
is a 2.7 x

1.4 x 0.7 cm left ovary with a smooth outer surface and a
solid cut

surface with a 8.1 x 0.4 cm left fallopian tube.
Representative

sections are submitted.

is a 2.5 x

2.0 x 0.5 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.
All

lymphatic tissue submitted.

is a 4.5 x

4.0 x 0.9 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.
All

lymphatic tissue submitted.

3.5 x 0.5

cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. All
lymphatic tissue

submitted.

a 1.8 x

1.2 x 0.9 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.
All

lymphatic tissue submitted.
