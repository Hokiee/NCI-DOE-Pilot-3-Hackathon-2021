with ovarian carcinoma.
Operative precede . xamination under anesthesia, adhesiolyeis,

The patient is a
tumor debulking, TAH/BSO and appendectom .

   

An intraoperative non—microscopic consultation was obtained and
interpreted as: "Received fresh in OR is a uterus attached to an
ovary. Opened laterally to show a generally soft, smooth
endometrial surface with a 1.5 cm sessile polyp on the posterior
surface. Tissue donated for GOG. Fixed in formalin. “ -

The second container is labeled "uterus, ovaries, cervax and
tubes” and contains a previously opened uterus with attached g
bilateral adnexa weighing 88.5 gm. The uterus measures 6.5 cm
superior to inferior by 4 cm anterior to posterior by 3.5 cm
cornu~toucornu. The cervix measures 2.7 x 3.7 x 2.7 cm and the os
measures 0.5 cm in diameter. The mucosa of the posterior
endocervical canal, measuring 2.2 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm, and a portion of
anterior endometrium measuring 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm, has been
removed prior to receipt. The cervix and endocervical canal are
otherwise grossly unremarkable. The endometrium shows a white,
firm, sessile polyp measuring 1.5 r 1.3 cm on the posterior wall.
In addition, there is a pedunculated polyp measuring 0.7 x Q.5 x
0.3 cm at the anterior right superior aspect of the endometrium.
The remainder of the endometrium measures 0.1 cm in thickness.

The myometrium is grossly unremarkable and measures 1.4 cm in
thickness. The anterior serosal surface of the uterus is
diffusely involved by firm, white tumor that focally appears to
invade the serosal surface of the myometrium. The anterior
serosal surface shows focal hemorrhage but no gross tumor.

 
   

The right fallopian tube measures 5.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in
di :ter. Anodule of tan- white tumor is present in the paratubal
soft tissueA in the proximal thi.rd.of the fallopian.tuhe. It
measures 1 1 cm in maximum di.ameter. The right ovary measures 2.7
x 1.. 4 x 1. 4 cm. Sections show a tan white nodule measuring 0.7 cm
in diameter that is grossly suspic:r.ous for tumor. The left
fal.lopjan tube measuies 5. 8 cm in length and B. 6 cm in a.~-_

grossly suspicious for involvement by tumor. Sections show gross
involvement by tan—white tumor extending to the surface. The
ovaries are submitted in their entirety. Labeled: OX1 - posterior
cervix; OX2 - anterior cervix; EMl and EM2 _ posterior endometrium

The third container is labeled "cul—de~sac nodule" and contains

multiple fragments of tan-white friable tissue measuring 3.0 x

The fourth container is labeled "appendix" and contains an
appendix measuring 7 cm in length and 0.6 cm in proximal diameter.

The distal tip of the appendix is expanded by tan~white tumor,
measuring 2.5 x 2.4 x 2.8 cm. The mid portion of the appendix

shows fibrous obliteration and a diameter of 0.2 cm over
approximately 1 cm of its length;

The fifth container is labeled "omentum" and contains a portion of
omentum measuring 23 x B x 4.5 cm. Tumor grossly involves the

great majority of the fibroadipose tissue with multiple nodules as

COMMENE

 

 

  
  

The omentum is diffusely replaced by poorly differentiated
papillary serous adenooarcinoma. Adenooaroinoma with identioa
histologio features is also present on the serosal surface of the
uterus, in peritubal soft tissue, in the oulnde-sao nodule, and
around the appendix} Histologically identical adenocaroinoma also

extensively involves the surfaces of the entirely submitted
ovaries. Carcinoma focally extends into the superficial cortex of
the ovaries and a single, 3 mm nodule of adenooarcinoma is present

within the parenohyma of one ovary. Because none of the
non—surface ovarian involvement measures more than 5 mm, according
to 9 criteria, this case should be considered a primary
