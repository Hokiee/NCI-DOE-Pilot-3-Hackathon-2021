COMMENT

Invasive ductal carcinoma is present in two different foci, the larger nodule measures 1.8 cm in greatest dimension and is located
In the left upper outer quadrant at 3-4 o'clock. The smaller nodule measures 0.5 cm in greatest dimension and is located in the
lower inner quadrant. Resection margins are negative for tumor.

Prognostic markers were performed on the patient’s core biopsy.
