Pertinent Clinical Information
History of left testicular mass.

Gross Description

Specimen Material: Left testicular mass.

Received fresh labeled "LEFT TESTICULAR MASS“ is a testis (46 grams, 4.5 x
4.0 x 3.0 cm) with attached spermatic cord (11.0 x 1.0 cm).

The tunica vaginalis and lower spermatic cord are inked blue, and the testis
is bisected to show two masses in the inferior pole. The larger mass (3.0 x
2.0 x 2.0 cm) is tan-white, friable, and focally hemorrhagic, with a bulging
cut surface. The other mass (1.7 x 1.1 x 0.7 cm) has a tan-yellow, focally
erythematous, solid cut surface. Both masses are well circumscribed and
noncapsulated, and both appear conﬁned to the testis. Both masses abut the
tunica albuginea. A third possible mass (0.7 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm) is identiﬁed
within the testicular parenchyma of the mid-superior pole. This third mass

is located 1.1 cm from the nearest tunica albuginea, 1.7 cm from the
epididymis and 12.0 cm from the spermatic cord margin (The largest mass is
located 14.0 cm from the margin. The other inferior pole mass is located
13.0 cm from the margin). The remaining testicular parenchyma displays two
foci of erythema in the superior pole which average 0.7 cm in greatest
dimension. No other lesions are seen.

Representative sections are submitted:

1 - spermatic cord margin

2 - mid sperrnatic cord

3 - lower spennatic cord

4-5 - larger inferior pole mass to tunica vaginalis
6 - smaller inferior pole mass to tunica albuginea
7 - mid—superior pole mass to tunica albuginea

8 - grossly uninvolved testis and epididymis

Additional sections: 9-13 - tumor
