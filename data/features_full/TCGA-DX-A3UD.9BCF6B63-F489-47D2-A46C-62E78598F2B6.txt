Gross Description:

1) The specimen is received fresh labeled “left radical nephrectomy (left
renal leiomyosarcoma)" and consists of a kidney with attached ureter. renal
vessels and perinephric Eat weighing 476.5 g in total. The kidney measures
12.7 x 6.5 x 3.7 cm. The attached ureter measures 2.3 cm in length and 0.3
cm in diameter. The attached renal vein measures 8.3 cm in length and 2.6
cm in diameter. The renal vein margin is grossly involved by tumor. Ureter
margin is grossly unremarkable. A portion of adrenal gland measuring 1.6 x
0.9 x 0.6 cm is identified. The renal vein is inked black and bivalved to
reveal a 8.5 x 4.3 x 3.5 cm multinodular firm tan mass filling and expanding
the renal vein. The mass is 2.5 cm from the renal hilum and 1.0 cm from the
adrenal gland. Sections through the kidney shows a cyst measuring 3 x 2.5 x
2.5 cm in the lower pelvis. The remainder of the kidney reveals a pink brown
parenchyma, with a well-defined cortico-medullary junction. The cortex
measures 0.9 cm and the calyces appear normal. A possible lymph node
measuring 0.9 cm is identified in the hilum. Representative sections are
submitted for TPS and for permanent sections. Photo is taken.

2). The specimen is received fresh. labeled, "left adrenal gland' and
consists of a 5.5 x 2.4 x 1.5 cm portion of red-pink to yellow-tan,
lobulated fibroadipose tissue with a staple line. Sectioning reveals a 24 x
2.8 x 0.9 cm triangular, yellow-orange adrenal with no gross lesions.
Representative sections are submitted in three cassettes.
