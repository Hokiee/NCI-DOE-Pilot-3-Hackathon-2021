-Additlonal comments: This is a typical papillary renal cell carcinoma with a papillary growth pattern
and stromal foam cells. Various cell types are present including chromophilic cells with eosinophilic
cytoplasm, oxyphilic cells, and occasional clear cells. The relatively large tumor cell size, nuclear atypia,
and pleomorphism indicate that this is a type 2 pap ry cancer, which in some studies has been an
adverse ﬁnding relative to type 1. The excision margi s free of tumor, although tumor approaches to

within 1 mm of the inked edge of the specimen (slide A1 .

Clinical History

The patient is a year-old female with a 5 cm, solid mass in the lateral portion of the right kidney and

a 9 cm mass in the lower portion of the left kidney. The patient now undergoes left partial
nephrectomy.

Gross Description

The specimen Is received fresh in one part, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and
”left renal mass fresh," and consists of an unoriented partial nephrectomy specimen measuring 17 x 7.5
x 14.5 cm and weighing 468 gm with associated perinephric fat. There is a yellow-red, nodular, friable
mass measuring 8.5 x 6.2 x 13.2 cm, completely ﬁlling and obliterating the inner portion of the kidney.
The mass is completely circumscribed by the renal capsule and abuts its surface in multiple areas, but
does not grossly extend through it. The mass abuts the resection margin (inked blue). The entire outer
portion of the specimen is inked in black. The mass was opened prior to receipt in Pathology, and a
piece of the tumor was sampled from the previously opened area for . In addition, an
opposite end was opened to sample for normal renal tissue, but none was taken, as It was a completely
obliteratlve tumor. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Cassettes A1-A2: Tumor with adjacent resection margin.

Cassettes A3-A6: Tumor and renal capsule.

Cassettes A7-A9: Tumor.

Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. Final diagnosis made by attending pathologist

following review of all pathology slides.
