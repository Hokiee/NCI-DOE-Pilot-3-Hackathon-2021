Gross Description: A. "Left pelvic node." 3.5 x 3.5 x 1.6 cm lymph node aggregate. There are multiple
lymph nodes up to 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm. B. "Right pelvic
nodes." A 4.0 x 3.5 x 1.4 cm lymph node aggregate. There are multiple lymph nodes up to 2.5 cm.

C. "Prostate." A 48 gram, 5.5 x 5.0 x 3.8 cm prostatectomy with attached seminal vesicles. The capsule is
intact. The prostate is inked as follows:

Anterior red, right side black and left side blue. The apex is shaved, cut perpendicularly and submitted in
C2 and C3. The bladder neck is shaved, cut perpendicularly and submitted in C4 and C5. The remaining
prostate is serially sectioned transversely revealing a tumor in the left postero—lateral mid prostate 1.3 x
0.9 x 0.9 cm. There is questionable tumor of the right posterolateral base 0.3 cm. The seminal vesicles
are unremarkable. Sampled —10 cassettes.

Microscopic Description: Gleason score: 4 + 3 = 7 with higher tertiary pattern
Higher tertiary pattern: Present (pattern 5, <5 %).
