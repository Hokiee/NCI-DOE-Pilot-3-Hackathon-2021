Gross Description: . ' . _
The speCimens are received in 5 containers, each 1abe1ed the patient's name and
medicai record number.

Part A. is further designated "1. Right peivic 1ymph nodes". It is a 4.5 by 2 x
2 centimeter aggregate of iobuiated yeiiow tan tissue. Dissection for 1ymp

nodes reveais muitipie 1ymph node candidates ranging from 0.8—4.5 cm in greatest
diameter. Specimen is entireiy submitted as foiiows:

A1 and A2: 2 1ymph node candidates each
A3 and A4: 1 1ymph node candidate, bisected
A5—A8: one 1ymph node candidate, sectioned

Part B. is further designated "2. Left peivic 1ymph nodes". Received fresh and
placed in formaiin is a 5 x 3 x 2 cm aggregate of iobuiated yeiiow—tan
fibroadipose tissue. Sectionin for 1ymph nodes reveais muiti 1e 1ymph node
candidates ranging from 0.6—3. cm in greatest diameter. The ymph nodes are
entireiy submitted as foiiows:

Bl: 3 1ymph node candidates

32: 4 1ymph node candidates

B3: 1 1ymph node candidate, sectioned

B4: One 1ymph node candidate, sectioned
85—36: One 1ymph node candidate, bisected
37-88: one 1ymph node candidate, bisected

Part C. is further designated "3. Left dista] ureter". Received fresh and piaced
in formaiin is an unoriented ortion of ureter which is 0.9 cm iong and 0.4 cm
in diameter. The speCimen is isected and entireiy submitted in C1.

Part D. is further desi nated "4. Biadder, prostate, semina] vesicies, vas
deferens".Received fres and piaced in formaiin is a 338.5 g, 18.9 x 9.1 x 3.0
cm cystoprostatectomy specimen consisting of a 9.5 x 8.5 x 3.3 cm biadder with
attached mesenteric fat and a 5.5 x 5.5 x 3.7 cm prostate. The right seminai
vesicies measure 3.5 x 1.1 x 1.0 cm and right vas deferens measures 8 cm. The
1eft seminai vesicies measures 3.5 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm and 1eft vas deferens measures
6 cm. The right ureterai stump measures 1.4 cm, the 1eft measures 2.3 cm, and
both demonstrate intact, patent iumens.

The right ha1f of the prostate and biadder is inked biue and the 1eft haif is

inked 1ack. The b1adder and prostate are opened anterioriy aiong the urethra.

The prostate is surrounded by a thin, intact membranous capsuie and sectioning

demonstrates rubbery, pink—tan, peri—urethra1 noduiarity with with a 0.8 cm area

of induration on the right side in the third and fourth siices from the apex.
Page 2

There is a 0.4 cm area of induration on the 1eft in the seventh siice from apex.
The 0 ened biadder reveais a 4.1 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm red—brown, hemorrhagic,

papii ary, friabie mass iocated in the right posterior waii extending iateraiiy.
On cut section, the mass extends into into the muscuiaris pro ria and into the
perivesicuiar fat. There is a 2.2 x 1.1 x 2 cm area of firm white—tan induration
the perivesicuiar fat from the posterior to the dome. It comes within 0.1 cm of
the inked margin. The mucosa surrounding the mass is wrinkied ink-tan and
grossiy unremarkabie with a uniform 0.7 cm wa11 thickness. Bi aterai ureterai
orifices, adjacent to the trigone, are identified and probe patent.

Representative sections are submitted as foiiows:

D1: Dista] prostatic urethrai margin (apex)

DZ: Right ureter resection margin

D3: Left ureter resection margin

D4-D5: Agica] prostate margin

06-09: B adder mass/Uiceration in posterior wa11

Dlo: Uninvoived biadder mucosa biadder dome

D11: Uninvoived biadder mucosa anterior wa11

Dlz: Uninvoived biadder mucosa 1eft

D13-D14: Right wa11, bisected

DlS: Trigone

016 —028: Representative right iobe of prostate from apex to base
DZ9-D36: Representative 1eft iobe of prostate submitted from apex to base
037: Right vas deferens and semina] vesicies

D38: Le t semina] vesicie and vas deferens

039—43: Remainder of 1arge poiypoid mass

Part E is further designated "5. Right dista1 ureter". Received fresh and p1aced
in formaiin is a 2.4 cm iong by 0.4 portion of ureter. There is a clear stitch
at one end which is not deSignated. The end opposite the stitch is inked biue.
Each end of the ureter is shaved and submitted in E1.
