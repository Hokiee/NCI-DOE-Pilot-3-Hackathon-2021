Clinical History

The patient is ai - man with prostatic adenocarcinoma. Biopsy reviewed here (

showed adenocarcinoma present in the left apex (Gleason grade 3+4), left mid (4+3), left base (3+3),
right apex (3+4) and right mid (3+3). He now undergoes robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy
with pelvic lymph node dissections.

Gross Description
The specimen is received in ﬁve parts, each labeled with the patient’s name and medical record number.
Parts A-E are received in formalin and part F is received fresh.

Part A, additionally labeled "anterior prostatic fat," consists of two pieces of irregular, unoriented, yellow
fibrofatty tissue (1.3 x 1.2 x 0.2 cm and 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm) without firm areas. The specimen is
entirely submitted in cassette A1. -

Part B, additionally labeled "anterior urethral margin,“ consists of and irregular, unoriented white-tan,

firm tissue fragment (0.8 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm). The specimen is inked blue, trisected and entirely submitted
in cassette Bl. .

Part C, additionally labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes," consists of an irregular, unoriented, yellow-tan
fibrofatty tissue (5 x 3 x 0.8 cm) that contains one pink-tan lymph node (4.1 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm). The
lymph node is trisected. The cut surface of the lymph node appears homogeneous, pink-tan and
smooth. The specimen is entirely submitted as follows:

Cassette C1: Lymph node.
Cassette C2: Lymph node and fibrofatty tissue.
Cassette C3: Fibrofatty tissue. ' _

Part D, additionally labeled "anterior bladder neck," consists of an irregular, unoriented, tan-brown, firm
tissue fragment (1.5 x 1 x 0.5 cm). The roughened surface is inked blue and the smooth surface Is
inked green. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in cassette Dl. -

Part E, additionally labeled "left pelvic lymph node,“ consists of multiple pieces of irregular, unoriented
yellow-tan fragmented fibrofatty tissue (5 x 4 x 0.8 cm in aggregate) that contain two uniform, pink—tan
lymph nodes (3.5 cm and 1 cm in greatest dimension respectively). The cut surface of the larger lymph
node appears homogeneous, tan-yellow and smooth. The specimen is entirely submitted as follows:
Cassettes E1-E2: Larger lymph node, serially sectioned.

Cassette 53: Intact smaller lymph node and fibrofatty tissue.

Cassettes E4-E5: Remaining fibrofatty tissue. .

Part F, additionally labeled ”prostate and seminal vesicles," consists of a radical prostatectomy specimen
(45 gm; 4 cm from apex to base it 4 cm in width x 3 cm from anterior to posterior).

GROSS PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: There are multiple tan, rubbery nodules (largest 1.1 x 1 x 0.8 cm)
located centrally. In slices 1-2, there is an irregular, white-tan, firm area (0.7 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm) in the left
anterior peripheral aspect that does not extend across the midline, located 0.1 cm from the led: lateral
margin. In slices 4-5, two irregular white-tan, firm areas are identiﬁed. The larger white-tan, firm area
(1.3 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm) is present in the right lateral peripheral aspect that does not extend across the
midline, and is 0.1 cm from the right posterior-lateral margin. The smaller white-tan firm area (1.1 x
0.5 x 0.3 cm) is present in the left posterior peripheral aspect that does not extend across the midline,
located 0.1 cm from the left posterior-lateral margin.

The anterior fibrous stroma is red-tan, roughened and is tightly suture closed. The remaining capsule is
intact. The remaining prostatic parenchyma ls tan. The seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundles (right 5 x
2.5 x 1 cm; left 4.5 x 2.5 x 0.8 cm) are soft, lobulated, red-tan without obvious lesion or mass. Some
of the prostate tissue is taken by the tissue core. The un-sectioned slices are embedded for research
purposes. The specimen is searched extensively for candidate lymph nodes and none are found.
