Gross Description:

Container labeled ”— prostate and pelvic lymph node
biopsy" is a previously inked previously partially sectioned
moderately distorted prostate gland with attached bilateral seminal
vesicles weighing as received 37 grams. The prostate gland on
reconstruction measures approximately 4.8 x 3.7 x 3,7 cm and has a
slightly lobulated focally shaggy outer surface. The urethra
appears to be compressed by the lateral lobes but is grossly patent.
The specimen is received after tissue harvest for genomic study.
Within the specimen container are two tissue cassettes labeled

." As previously sectioned there is

multi~nodular tan gray Eibrotic lateral lobes. In the mid to
proximal {vesical) region there is a poorly defined approximately
2.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm area of slightly indurated tan gray fibrosis
occupying the left lateral and left posterior lobe extending focally
to within 0.1 cm of the nearest outer surface margin. This is
poorly defined, however, the urethra appears to be diSplaced toward
the right lateral aspect in this distal area. This grossly appears
to focally extend to within 0.3 cm of the vesical {proximal) margin.

The seminal vesicles together are 5.2 x 2.0 x 1.1 cm. Each has a
lobulated gray tan outer surface with a multiscystic gray tan
fibrotic cut surface. No gross lesion is identified. Also received
in the same container is a 4.1 x 2.6 x 1.2 cm portion of tan yellow
fibroadipose tissue which on palpation and sectioning reveals a
single poorly defined 2.6 cm tan yellow nodule. Representative
