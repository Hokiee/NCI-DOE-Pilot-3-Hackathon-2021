Pathologic Staging (pTNM): pT1b Nx Mx
The pathologic stage assigned here should be regarded as provisional, as
it reflects only current pathologic data and does not incorporate full

knowledge of the patient’s clinical status and/or prior pathology.

I have personally reviewed all specimens and or slides, including the

listed special stains, and used them with my medical judgement to

determine the final diagnosis.

CLINICAL HISTORY:

The patient is a year-old male with right knee sarcoma.

GROSS:
One formalin-filled container is received labeled with the patient's

name, and medical record number.

The container is labeled "right lateral thigh mass." The specimen
consists ofan 8.3 x 4.2 x 3.6 cm, 70.0 gm mixed dark red and yellow—tan
soft tissue fragment. The attached ellipse of skin measuring 8.3 x 3.8
cm shows a 2.6 cm well-healed incision scar. The specimen is oriented
as follows: Long double stitch at 12:00 - proximal margin, single

stitch at 3:00 - anterior margin. The resection margins are inked as
follows: Anterior margin - orange, posterior margin - blue, deep margin
— black. Sectioning along the long axis of the specimen demonstrates a
3.9 x 3.0 x 2.7 cm, circumscribed pink-tan soft tissue mass with focal
area of organizing hemorrhage suggestive of previous biopsy site. The
tumor is 2.2 cm from the proximal resection margin, 2.1 cm from the
distal resection margin, 0.6 cm from the anterior margin, 0.3 cm from
the posterior margin, and 2.2 cm from the deep resection margin.
Representative tissue was procured for potential future studies.

Representative sections are submitted in twelve cassettes.

Summary of sections:

1 - proximal margin, perpendicular.
2 - distal margin, perpendicular.

3 - anterior margin, perpendicular.
4 - posterior margin, perpendicular.
5 - deep margin.

6 through 12 - tumor.

MICROSCOPIC:

Microscopic evaluation is performed.
