COMMENT

(B) Examination of an immunohistochemical study on paraffin sections with an anti-melanocytic cocktail (HMB45, anti-MART1 and
anti-tyrosinase) performed on section B5 shows the tumor cells to be positive, supporting the above diagnoses.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT SUPERFICIAL INGUINAL LYMPH NODES — An unoriented ellipse of skin with attached subcutaneous tissue
measuring 28 x 5.5 x 7.0 cm in thickness. A second separate portion of adipose tissue measures 8.0 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm.

The skin surface is free of lesions. The subcutaneous tissue contains a large distorted lymph node or matted lymph node
which are entirely replaced by gray-tan ﬂeshy tissue measuring overall 7.0 x 6.5 x 4.5 cm. No additional lesions are identiﬁed.
Portions of the lymph node tumor are submitted for research purposes. The tumor appears to extend within 0.2 cm of the closest
tissue edge.

INK CODE: Blue — peripheral and deep edges.

SECTION CODE: A1, A2, skin tips; A3-A4, tumor with nearest inked surface; A5-A8, additional sections of tumor; A9,
representative skin; A10 representative sections, smaller portion of tissue.

(B) LEFT ILIAC AND OBTURATOR NODES- The specimen consists of a portion of ﬁbroadipose tissue with lymph nodes, 12. 5 x
7 5 x 2. 5 cm. The specimen consists of numerous greater than ten possible lymph nodes with three very large lymph nodes,
largest lymph node #1 is 7.0 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. Large lymph node #2 is 6.0 x 5.0 x 2.0 cm and large lymph node #3 is 4.0 x 3.0 x 1.8
cm. The remainder of the lymph nodes range in size from 2.0 to 0.1 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are submitted
as follows.

SECTION CODE: B1, one lymph node bisected; B2, one possible lymph node; B3, four possible lymph nodes; 84-86,
one possible lymph node, one per cassette; 37-89, representative sections of grossly positive lymph node #1; 310-813,
representative sections of grossly positive lymph node #2; 314-316, representative sections of grossly positive lymph node #3.

(C) LEFT COMMON ILIAC NODES —- A portion of fibroadipose tissue (3.5 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm) which contains multiple candidate
lymph nodes (up to 1.5 cm in greatest extent). All lymph nodes are entirely submitted.
SECTION CODE: C1, three lymph nodes; C2, one lymph node bisected; 03, one lymph node bisected.
