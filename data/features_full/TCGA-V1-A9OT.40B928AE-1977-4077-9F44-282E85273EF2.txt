BzProstate gland + seminal vesicles (fresh)

Clinical History

The patient is a ear-old man who, per review of the electronic medical record was
diagnosed with Gleason = tatic adenocarcinoma of the right mid-gland and base with
perineural invasion He now undergoes a robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.

Gross Description

The specimen is received in two parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.
Part A is received in formalin. Part B is received fresh.

Part A, labeled “anterior prostatic fat," consists of multiple soft, irregular pieces of yellow, ﬁbrofatty
tissue (4.4 x 2.9 x 1.2 cm in aggregate). No masses or candidate lymph nodes are found. The
specimen is entirely submitted in cassette A1. ‘

Part 8, labeled "prostate gland and seminal vesicles,“ consists of a radical prostatectomy specimen (76
gm; 4 cm from apex to base it 5 cm In width x 4 cm from anterior to posterior).

GROSS PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: There are two nodules. Nodule 1 (1.5 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm) is ill defined,
rubbery and yellow. It is located in the right posterior gland (slices 4-10) and abuts the posterior
margin. Module 2 (0.8 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm) is ill deﬁned, rubbery and yellow. It is located in the left
posterior gland (slices 5-7) and is 0.3 cm from the posterior margin. The anterior ﬁbrous stroma is red,
roughened and is open. The remaining capsule is intact. The remaining prostatic parenchyma is tan.
The seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundles (right 3 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm; left 3 x 2 x 0.5 cm) are soft, lobulated
and without obvious lesion or mass. Some of the prostate is taken by the

Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. Final diagnosis made by attending pathologist following review of all
pathology slides. The attending pathologist has reviewed all dictations, including pro-sector work, and preliminary interpretations
performed by any resident involved in the case and performed all necessary edits before signing the final report.
