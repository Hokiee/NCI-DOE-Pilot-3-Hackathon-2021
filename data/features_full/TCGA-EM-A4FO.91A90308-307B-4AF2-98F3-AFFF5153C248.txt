Gross Descrig'on

The specimen labeled with the patients name and as “Thyroid: Total thyroid stitch marks upper pole left lobe, fresh for
tumor banking" consists of an oriented thyroidectomy specimen that weighs 15.5 g. The right lobe measures 3.6 cm Sl x
2.7 cm ML x 1.3 cm AP, the left lobe measures 4.0 cm Sl x 3.0 cm ML x 1.5 cm AP and the isthmus measures 2.0 cm SI x
2.1 cm ML x 0.5 cm AP. The external surfaces have ﬁbrous adhesions and are painted with silver nitrate. No parathyroid
glands or no lymph nodes are identiﬁed grossly. The lower left lobe contains a well delineated partly calciﬁed nodule that
measures 1.1 cm Si x 0.9 cm ML x 0.7 cm AP. The remainder of the thyroid tissue is grossly unremarkable. Sections of
left lobe nodule and normal tissue are stored frozen. The remainder of the specimen is submitted as follows:

1A—F right lobe, superior to interior

ie—H isthmus

1l-N left lobe, superior to interior

 

r—I-II—I—II
