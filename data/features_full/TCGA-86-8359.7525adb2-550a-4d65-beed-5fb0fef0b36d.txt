Case ID Gross Description

 

Lung of increased volume with free
lobar bronchus; the lower lobar
bronchus is free on the proximal
portion and obstructed in the distal
portion by a tumoral process which
occupies approximately 2 thirds of
the lower lobe; on section, a
tumoral structure of 12/10 cm; the
tumor is well-limited, white, with
small areas of necrosis and
hemorrhage, with mucous
secretions on surface.

 

 

 

 

Microscopic Description Diagnosis Details

 

TUMOR FRAGMENT:

Bronchopulmonary neoplasm of differentiated
muciparous adenocarcinoma type, formed of tubular-
papillary structures, covered by a layered cylindrical
epithelium, with moderate cellular pleomorphism and
rare mitoses. Some of the cells are vacuolated, with
intracellular necrotic content and inside the glandular
spaces. The tumoral stroma with fibrous structure and
numerous vessels with stasis and moderate diffuse
lymphocytic infiltrate.

PULMONARY PARENCHYMA:

Diffuse interstitial moderate fibrosis, stasis and
accumulations of macrophages in the alveoli. Small
hotbeds of emphysema with subpleural localization.
LYMPH NODE STATION VI:

Mediastinal tissue with lymph node with sinus
histiocytosis and stasis. Without neoplastic infiltrates.
LYMPH NODE STATION V:

Stasis, follicular hyperplasia and sinus histiocytosis with
numerous alveolar macrophages. Without neoplastic
infiltrates.

PHRENIC CHAIN LYMPH NODE:

Fibrosis and sinus histiocytosis. Without neoplastic
infiltrates.

TRIANGULAR LIGAMENT LYMPH NODE:

Reactive follicular hyperplasia and sinus histiocytosis,
with numerous alveolar macrophages.
PARAESOPHAGEAL LYMPH NODE:

Lymph node with metastasis of the muciparous tubular-
papillary adenocarcinoma.
