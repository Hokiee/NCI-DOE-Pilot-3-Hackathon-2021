E: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Bladder & prostate".
It consists of a urinary bladder with attached prostate, overall measuring 17 x
13.5 x 4.0 cm. The peritoneum measures 8 x 6.5 x 0.3 cm. The bladder measures 7 x
5 x 2 cm. The peritoneum is grossly unremarkable. The prostate measures 5 x 4.5 x
3.5 cm. The external surface is unremarkable and entirely inked black. The
bladder is longitudinally opened anterior to reveal multiple polypoid lesions on
the posterior wall. The largest polypoid mass measures 2.3 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm and is
located in the dome. Approximately 2.5 cm away from this lesion, another large
polypoid mass is also identified in the left posteiror wall about 1 cm above the
right ureterovesical junction. The second lesion measures 2.5 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm.
Multiple small polypoid lesions ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 cm is present as well in
the posterior wall. one polypoid lesion is 1.4 cm above the left ureterovesical
junction with the remaining polypoid lesions located on the right posterior
ureteral wall between the two large lesions. A ulcerated area is also identified
in the right posterior wall measuring 1.5 cm in greatest dimension and grossly
involves the right ureterovesical junction. This ulceration is 4 cm away from
apical margin. Cut sectioning of the tumor shows tan-pinkish and granular
appearance. The tumor appears confined to the bladder mucosa and does not
infiltrate into the bladder wall. The remaining urinary bladder mucosa shows
congestion. The right ureter measures 3 cm in length and 0.6 cm in circumference

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:

A—D: See final microscopic—diagnosis.

E: Sections of the urinary bladder show an invasive papillary transitional cell
carcinoma, high grade (4/4) . characterized by a papillary
architecture of enlarged atypical cells with correspondingly enlarge nuclei and
scant cytoplasm. The tumor involves the posterior wall of dome, left
ureterowesical junction. trigone and bladder neck. The tumor infiltrates through
the muscularis propria into the perivesical fat but does not involve the resection
margins. Perineural and lymphovascular invasion identified (E13,17). Also present
is urothelial carcinoma in situ involving the mucosa adjacent to the invasive
carcinoma.

Sections of the prostate show adenomatous hyperplasia with foci of high grade
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN II), however no prostatic adenocarcinoma
is identified. The prostatic urethra is unremarkable. No invasive papillary

tranSitional cell carcinoma is identified. The bilateral seminal vesicles show no
significant abnormalities.
