CLINICAL HISTORY:
year old female with breast cancer.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Ri \t breast biopsy". received fresh and fixed in formalin. An unoriented,
6.5 x 5.5 x 2.5 cm incisional breast biopsy received cross—sectioned. One
surface of the specimen has previously been inked black, and a frozen section
has been taken from this area. Grossly, the tumor is present at the ink.
Serial sectioning reveals an irregular, whitish, infiltrative tumor 3.5 x 1.7
x 2.1 cm in greatest dimension, with focal petechia hemorrhage. A 0.3 cm area
of yellowish gritty texture in the center of the tumor is suspicious of
calcification. There is no gross tumor necrosis. A separate, 0.3 cm well
defined, yellowish nodule is located approximately 0.5 cm from the main

tumor. The specimen is inked and serially sectioned every 0.5 cm.
Representative sections are submitted.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Al- remnants of AFl. 2.7 x 1.6 x 0.3 cm soft tissue fragment.
A2—A13- serial sections of the specimen every 0.5 cm, of which:
A7— tumor including the calcification,
AB- section adjacent to AFl,
A9— 0.3 cm nodule,
Al3—normal appearing breast.

B. "Right breast", received fresh and fixed in formalin. A modified right
mastectomy 21.1 x 15.2 x 3.5 cm, a skin ellipse 14.2 x 7.1 cm, and axillary
tail 7.5 x 6 x 2 cm. A fresh, horizontal 5 cm incision line is located
superior lateral to the nipple, 1.5 cm below the superior skin resection
margin. The skin surface is smooth with no discoloration, gross mass, or
nipple retraction. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a biopsy
cavity 6.5 x 5.5 x 2 cm, which corresponds to the size of the previous biopsy
specimen. The superior wall of the cavity appears to contain a 2.5 x 1.5 x 2

biopsy specimen. The residual tumor is located approximately 1.5 cm from the
closest deep resection margin, and over 4 cm from the superior margin. The
biopsy cavity is otherwise 3 cm from the inferior margin, 4.9 cm from the
superior margin, 1 cm from the deep margin, 4.5 cm from the medial margin, 2.5
cm from the lateral margin, and 1 cm from the skin. The deep resection margin
is inked in blue, superior margin in black, and inferior margin in red. The
axillary tail is dissected for lymph nodes. Multiple lymph node candidates are
found, the largest measuring 1.5 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm. Representative sections of
the breast and lymph nodes are submitted.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Bl- inner upper quadrant.

BZ~ inner lower quadrant.

83- outer upper quadrant.

B4— outer lower quadrant.

BS— nipple.

B6- skin with incision.

B7-BB— tumor in biopsy cavity and the closest deep resection margin.
89— biopsy cavity (superior wall).

810— biopsy cavity (inferior wall).
Bll—Bl7- axillary lymph node candidates.
Bl8— low axillary tail WWWWMWMW

ADDENDUM 1:

Tissue was sent to the _ for assay of the Estrogen
and Progesterone receptors. The Estrogen receptor activity was judged as
negative with an estimated fmol valve of O. The Progesterone receptor activity
was judged as negative with an estimated fmol of valve of O. The
proliferation index was estimated to be high with a PI of 70%. Please refer
to for a complete report.
