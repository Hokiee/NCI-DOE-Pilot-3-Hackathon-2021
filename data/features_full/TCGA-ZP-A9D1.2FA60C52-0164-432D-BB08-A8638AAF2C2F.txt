Gross:
A. The specimen is labeled "liver segment 4." Received in
and placed in formalin is a 50 gram, 6.4 x 5.6 x
3.5 cm, piece of liver. One surface is covered by a light
tan capsule. This surface has a raised nodular mass which
is located beneath the capsule and does not disrupt the
capsule. The roughened resection margins are inked black.
T18 specimen is serially sectioned. The cut surface of the
liver parenchyma is composed of small white-yellow nodules
interspersed by white fibrous bands. The mass which was
identified at the capsular surface measures 2.8 x 2.7 x 2.1
cm. The mass is well—circumscribed and has a lobular, light
tan cut surface. This mass measures 0.5 cm from the nearest
black inked margin. Tissue was taken for : tissue
bank. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Cassette Designation:

A1—2 Mass with closest margin

A3-5 Representative sections of mass

A6~7 Representative sections of liver
parenchyma

Microscopic:
A histological examination has been performed.

A. Sections show a liver parenchyma that exhibits areas of
_____ regenerative nodules with background cirrhotic liver that

surround multiple nodules of well differentiated
hepatocellular carcinoma. The tumor cells are characterized
by occasional pseudoglandular architecture and trabecular
formations with prominent vasculature. The tumor cells are
variably vacuolated and contain flocculent clear cytoplasm
with mildly pleomorphic ovoid nuclei and prominent nucleoli.
Occasional fibrous bands are admixed with the tumor cell
infiltrate.

A special stain for trichrome highlights the background
cirrhosis. A reticulin stain demonstrates hepatic cells
with increased thickening of cell layers. An
immunohistochemical stain for glypican-3 demonstrates
cytoplasmic positivity in the tumor cell population. The
controls are stained appropriately.
