DIAGNOSIS

(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 7 (4+3) WITH TERTIARY GLEASON GRADE 5
COMPONENT. (SEE COMMENT)
TUMOR INVADING INTRAPROSTATIC PORTION OF RIGHT SEMINAL VESICLE.
TUMOR INVADING FOCALLY RIGHT BLADDER NECK.
MARGINS OF RESECTION FREE OF TUMOR.
VASCULAR/LYMPHATIC INVASION PRESENT.
Left seminal vesicle and segments of vasa deferentia. no tumor present.
SEE PREVIOUS REPORT FOR DIAGNOSIS OF PELVIC LYMPH NODES.

COMMENT

The prostate gland contains a single focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor is located in the right anterolateral, right lateral,
right posterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior, left posterior, left posterolateral and left lateral peripheral zone. The tumor focus

measures 3.0 x 2. cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in three cross sections and extensively in the apex

and base regions. The tumor invades focally the right bladder neck. The tumor invades focally the intraprostatic portion of the right
seminal vesicle. The margins of resection are free of tumor.

Please refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and attached segments of right
and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (3.5 x 2.0 x 4.8 cm, 42 gm, postfixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the left
posterolateral aspects of the prostate appears more abundant than along the right side. A nodule is palpated on the right base
region. Blue ink is applied to surfaces of the prostate (anterior apex and under flap on left posterior surface) which do not represent
the true margin of resection.

SECTION CODE: (31-03, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C4-CS.
left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C7, C8, prostatic base right border; 09-011.

Specimen DatelTlme:

prostatic base right posterior border; C12-C19, prostatic base central portion; C20-C22, prostatic base left border; C23-025,
prostatic base left posterior border; C27-C29. apex anterior; C30, C31, apex left; C32, C33, apex posterior; 034, 035, apex right;
C36, CS7, detached portions from margin of resection according to specimen radiograph; C38-C49, sections of the three cross
sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.

The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked ink green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in
black. Blue ink (23- 29, 42, 43 and 46) and orange ink (C38, 41, 44- 47 and 49) denote surfaces that do not represent the true
margin of resection.
