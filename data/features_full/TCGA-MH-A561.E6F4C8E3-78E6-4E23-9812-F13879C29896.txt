*+* REFER TO BOTTOM OF REPORT *+*

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Renal Mass

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Renal Mass

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received fresh from the operating room for intraoperative

B. Received is a 10.9 gram, 4.1 x 2.8 x 2.5 cm, partial nephrectomy
specimen displaying a tan—brown, scabrous renal resection margin. The
capsule margin is tan—white and smooth with minimal attached fat. The
specimen is inked blue along the renal resection margin, black along
the capsular resection margin, and serially sectioned to reveal a 1.8
x 1.8 x 1.8 cm, tan—yellow, well—circumscribed mass that grossly
extends to the capsular surface. The mass is 0.2 cm from the renal
resection margin. The remaining cut surface is tan—brown and
unremarkable. No subsequent lesions are identified.

The specimen is submitted in its entirety sequentially in cassettes
Bl—B7. Please note that a representative portion of normal and tumor
is taken for tissue.
