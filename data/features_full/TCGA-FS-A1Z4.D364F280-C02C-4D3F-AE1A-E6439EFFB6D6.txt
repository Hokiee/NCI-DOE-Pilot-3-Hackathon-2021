The H&E stained slide at hand shows an epitheloid malignant tumor with sparse amount of
connective tissue. The tumor constitute approx. 85 percent of the tissue. The tumor cells
show round to oval nuclei with granular chromatine. Some apoptotic cells are present.
There is a high nucleo/cytoplasmatic ratio. The mitotic count is 12 mitoses per square
millimetre. The tumor cells have a middle sized eosinophilic cytoplasm. The tumor shows a
sheet and nest like growth pattern. Lymphocytic infiltrates compound approx. 10 percent of
the tissue cells. The tumor harbours approx. 20 percent of necrotic tissue.
