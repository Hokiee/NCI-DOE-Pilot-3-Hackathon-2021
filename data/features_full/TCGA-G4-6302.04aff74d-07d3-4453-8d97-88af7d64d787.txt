SPECIMENS:
A. RIGHT COLON TERMINAL ILLEUM

DIAGNOSIS:
RIGHT COLON AND TERMINAL ILEUM, HEMICOLECTOMY

- WELL DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE COLON (MUCINOUS
TYPE), TRANSMURALLY INVASIVE WITH EXTENSION INTO ADJACENT
SOFT TISSUES.

- TUBULOVILLOUS ADENOMA.

- FIFTEEN LYMPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/15).

- APPENDIX WITH NO SIGNIFICANT PATHOLOGIC ABNORMALITIES.

- TERMINAL ILEUM WITH NO SIGNIFICANT PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS.

- SURGICAL MARGINS OF EXCISION ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

COLORECTAL CANCER TEMPLATE

Specimen Type: Right hemicolectomy

Tumor Site: Cecum

Tumor Configuration: Exocytic

Tumor Size: 3.2x3.2x0.6

Histologic Type: Adenocarcinoma, mucinous type - sections demonstrate

infiltrating and dissecting pools of extracellular mucin,
with associated tumor epithelium, consistent with a
mucinous (colloid) carcinoma. Virtually all of the invasive
tumor shows mucinous morphology.

Histologic Grade: Well differentiated

Extent of Invasion: Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into
adjacent adipose tissue and focally extend to
within 1 mm. of the radial margins.

Margins: Negative
Venous/Lymphatic Invasion: Present
Perineural Invasion: Present

Additional Pathologic Findings: The invasive cancer appears to be arising in the
setting of a tubular villous adenoma

Extent of Resection: 0

Lymph Nodes: Negative: 0/15

Implants: Absent

EGFR Expression:

Pathologic Stage: T3 M0 MX

CLINICAL HISTORY:

None given
GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. RIGHT COLON TERMINAL ILEUM:

Specimen consists of a resected portion of terminal ileum and cecum measuring 15 cm. in length and
circumference from varying from 4 cm. to 6 cm. An irregular polypoid lesion measuring 3.2x3.2x0.6 cm.
is noted 6.5 cm. from the resected ileum margin and 7 cm. from the resected colonic margin. Appendix
is identified and measures 3.2 cm. in length and 0.5 cm. in width. Representative sections are
submitted as follows:

Cassette A1 : distal margin

Cassette A2: proximal margin

Cassette A3-A7: sections through the polypoid tumor mass

Cassette A8: random sections of the ileum

Cassette A9-A10: random sections of the cecum close to the polypoid lesion

Cassette A11 : terminal ileum
