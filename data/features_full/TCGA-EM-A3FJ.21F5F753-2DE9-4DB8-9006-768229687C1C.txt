5A frozen tissue resubmitted

the soft tissue range from 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm to 1 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm; one cystic nodule also identiﬁed in the soft tissue
measures 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm and contain yellow ﬂuid. The external surface is painted with silver nitrate. The upper pole of
the right lobe contains one well delineated solid nodule that measure 1 cm Si x 0.8 cm ML x 0.6 cm AP. The remainder of
the right thyroid tissue shows colloidal nodules: one adjacent to the right upper solid nodule measuring 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm
and one at the right lower pole measunng 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The remaining thyroid is grossly unremarkable. Sections of
nodule and normal tissue are stored frozen. The remainder of the specimen is submitted as follows:

6A-J right lobe, superior to inferior

6K isthmus
