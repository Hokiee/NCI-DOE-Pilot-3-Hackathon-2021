MOLECULAR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY TESTING:

 

l
I
l

Block D:

BRAF complex mutation IDENTIFIED (p.V600K, c.17986>A. c.1799T>A).

NOTE:
The quantity and quality of the Isolated DNA was acceptable for testing.

aAcKGROUND:

Mutations In the BRAF gene are found In ~50-60% oi melanomas with BRAF VGODE as the most common mutation type (90%)
followed by VBOOK. V6000. and VGOOR (1 .2).'Rarely. mutations are identiﬁed in other codons of the BRAF gene. including codon
601 (K601 E mutation) (3). Targeted therapy using selective BRAF inhibitors (Ire. PLX4032) may be effective in cases with BRAF
mutations (4-6). However. not all tumors reveal such correlation and. therefore, the results of mutational testing should be
Interpreted In the context of the histologic ﬁndings and the patient's clinical history.

BRAF MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS: \

For surgical specimens. manual microdissection was performed. Specimens with the minimum of 50% of tumor cells in e microdissection target are
accepted for the analysis. DNA was isolated using standard laboratory procedure. Optical density readings were obtained. For the detection of
mutation, DNA was ampliﬁed with primers flanking BRAF exon 15 sequence. The quality of ampliﬁed PCR product was evaluated by agemsa gel
electrophoresis. Then. bidirectional Sanger sequencing was performed using the BigDye Terminator Kit on ABI3130 (Applied Biosystems). The
known hotspots were analyzed for the presence of mutations with Mutation Surveyor V3.01 (SoftGenetics). The limit of detection ls approximately
20% of mutant alleles present in the background of normal DNA.
