FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
(A) Prostate and seminal vesicles, radical prostatectomy: Adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

TNM pathologic staging: pT3a, pNO.

Histologic type: Acinar.

Gleason grades: 4 + 3 = 7/10.

Percent Gleason grades 4 and 5: Approximately 75% Gleason pattern 4.

Tumor location: Left anterior and left posterior quadrants involved by tumor.

Maximal tumor diameter: 1.6 cm (tumor present in four consecutive 0.4 cm thick sections).
Vascular invasion: Not identiﬁed.

Extraprostatic extension: Present, extensive (several foci of extraprostatic extension identiﬁed in
left anterior and posterior quadrants).

Resection margins: Proximal basal margin focally positive for tumor (see part D below for ﬁnal
margin status). All remaining surgical margins negative for tumor.

Seminal vesicles: Negative for tumor.

Third Gleason pattern: Absent.

Tumor multicentricity: Present.

Premalignant changes: Focal high grade PIN is present.

Non-neoplastic changes: Nodular hyperplasia.

Lymph nodes: Eleven total lymph nodes (Parts B-C below), negative for metastatic carcinoma
(0/1 1).

Representative tumor block(s): A16.

Other ﬁndings or comments: Additional immunohistochemical analysis (p63, keratin 903
performed on block A5) shows an absence of basilar staining for both antibodies in the atypical
focus at the left prostatic base margin, consistent with invasive adenocarcinoma. See separately
submitted posterior bladder neck margin (Part D below) for ﬁnal margin status.

(B) Obturator lymph nodes, left, regional dissection: Six lymph nodes, negative for metastatic
carcinoma (0/6).

(C) Obturator lymph nodes, right, regional dissection: Five lymph nodes, negative for metastatic

carcinoma (0/5). LC@ .0 . 3

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

(A) The specimen is received fresh, labeled and prostate and consists of a 37 gram, 6.4 x

3.5 x 3.5 cm prostate with attached bilateral seminal vesicle and vas deferens. The Ieﬁ seminal vesicle is
2.2 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm; the right seminal vesicle is 2.2 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm; the bilateral vas deferens are disrupted
and measure approximately 0.8 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is inked as follows: right - blue, leﬁ - black,
posterior — green. The specimen is cut from apex to base into 7 slices to reveal a diffuse multinodular
bulging tan-pink cut surface. There is an approximate 1.2 x 1.0 cm ﬁrm area in the left posterior lobe.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

l-2. leﬁ apex perpendicularly sectioned

3-4. right apex perpendicularly sectioned

5-6. leﬁ base perpendicularly sectioned

7-9. right base perpendicularly sectioned

10-12. left anterior from apex to base

13-16. leﬁ posterior from apex to base

I7-19. right anterior from apex to base

20-23. right posterior ﬁ'om apex to base

24. leﬁ vas deferens and seminal vesicle

25. right vas deferens and seminal vesicle. . (25 cassettes) (Approximately 90% submitted)

(B) The specimen is received in formalin labeled and Ieﬁ Obturator iliac nodes and is a 3 x
3 x 3 cm of ﬁbrofatty tissue. Six lymph node candidates ranging from 0.2 to 2.3 cm in greatest dimension
are identiﬁed. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

1 three lymph node candidates intact

2 one lymph node candidate intact

3 one lymph node candidate bisected

4 one lymph node candidate bisected. . , :4 cassettes)

(C) The specimen is received in formalin labeled and right Obturator iliac nodes and is a 3 x
3 x 3 cm aggregate of ﬁbrofatty tissue in which ﬁve lymph node candidates ranging from 0.2 to 3.0 cm in
greatest dimension are identiﬁed. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

1 three lymph node candidates intact

2 one lymph node candidate bisected

3-4 one lymph node serially sectioned. (4 cassettes)

(D) The specimen is received in formalin labeled and posterior bladder neck margin and is
a 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm heavily cauterized tan tissue which is submitted in one cassette.
