GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1) SOURCE: Right Neck Level 2, 3

Received fresh, labeled "right neck level 2, 3," per requisition, is a 6.0

X 5.5 X 2.cm portion of partially circumscribed yellow-tan lobular adipose
tissue with a nodularity noted on palpation. The dissected lymph nodes are
submitted as follows:

Summary of sections: 1A, 9 lymph nodes, 9/1; 1B, 2 lymph nodes, each
bisected (l inked black), 4/1; 1C, 2 lymph nodes each bisected (l inked
black) 4/1; lD-lI, 1 lymph node, bisected, 2/1 each.

2) SOURCE: Left level 1B and perifascial node

Received fresh labeled "left level 1B and perifascial node", per
requisition, is a 5 X 4 X 1.6.cm portion of partially circumscribed
yellow-tan lobular adipose tissue with a nodularity noted on palpation.
Serial sectioning shows a few circumscribed lymph nodes and a gold-tan
trabecular cut surface consistent with a gland.

Summary of sections: 2A, 4 lymph nodes, 4/1; 2B, section of gland tissue,
2/1.

3) SOURCE: Left Neck level 2, 3

Received fresh, labeled "left neck level 2, 3" per requisition, is a 5 X 4

X 1.8 cm aggregate of partially circumscribed yellow-tan lobular adipose
tissue with a nodularity noted on palpation.

Summary of sections: 3A, 5 lymph nodes, 5/1; 3B, 6 lymph nodes, 6/1; 3C, 2
lymph nodes, each bisected, (l inked black), 4/1; 3D, 2 lymph nodes, each
bisected l inked black), 4/1; 3E, 4lymph nodes, 4/1; 3F-3G, 1 lymph node,
bisected, 2/1 each.

4) SOURCE: Neck dissection level 1A

Received fresh, labeled "neck dissection level 1A", per requisition, is a 4

X 3 X 1.2 cm portion of partially circumscribed, yellow-tan lobular adipose
tissue with a nodularity noted on palpation.
Summary of sections: 4A, four lymph nodes, 4/ 1.

5) SOURCE: Total glossectomy right level 1

Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and "total
glossectomy right level 1" is a 224 gram total glossectomy specimen
measuring 10.5 cm anterior to posterior by 9 cm from right to left by 6.2
cm from superior to inferior. There are no orientation instructions

received along with the specimen. The specimen consists of a grossly
identifiable tongue with a pink-tan, shaggy mucosal surface which measures
10.5 cm from anterior to posterior by 6.5 cm from right to left by
approximately 3.5 cm superior to inferior. There is a small amount of
adjacent pink-tan, shiny mucosa, which is consistent with the ﬂoor of the
mouth. The surface of the specimen opposite the mucosa is pink-red, shaggy,
and consistent with a surgical resection margin. Using anatomic landmarks
for orientation, the specimen has been inked in the following manner:
anterior is orange, posterior is black, right is red, left is yellow, and
inferior is green. The mucosal surface is notable for an ulcerated, friable
mass that is present on the right ﬂoor of mouth, extending to the lateral
aspect of the tongue and measures approximately 7.5 X 5.0 cm in area.
Grossly, the mass extends to within 1.0 cm of the right lateral margin and
1.5 cm of the anterior margin. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal
a cheesy, white-yellow mass extending approximately 4.0 cm deep to the
ulceration and grossly extending to within 0.7 cm of the inferior inked
margin, 0.3 cm of the right inked margin, 0.6 cm of the anterior inked
margin, 0.5 cm of the posterior inked margin, and appears widely free of
the left inked margin. Representative sections are submitted for
evaluation.

Summary of sections: 5A, left anterior mucosal margin and left anterior
deep, 3/1; 5B, left lateral mucosal margin and left lateral deep, 2/ 1; 5C,
left hypopharynx margin and left hypopharynx deep, 2/ 1; 5D, posterior
mucosal margin and posterior deep, 2/ 1; 5E, right hypopharynx margin and
hypopharynx deep, 2/ 1; SF, right lateral mucosal margin and right lateral
deep, 2/ 1; 5G-H, perpendicular sections of tumor approaching right lateral
mucosal margin, 1/1 each; 51-], tumor approaching right anterior mucosal
margin, 1/1 each; 5K, right anterior deep margin, 1/ 1; 5L, inferior margin,
1/ 1; 5M-N, representative sections of mass, 1/1 each; 50,right ﬂoor mass,
1/ 1; SP, normal appearing posterior tongue, 1/ 1; 5Q, normal appearing left
lateral tongue, 1/ 1; 5R, normal appearing anterior tongue, 1/ 1.
