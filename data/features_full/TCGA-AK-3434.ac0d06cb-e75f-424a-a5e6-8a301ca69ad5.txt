SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Clinical HistoryiDiagnosis: Right Renal Mass, Cholecystitis.

Source of Specimen(s):
A: Gallbladder
13: Right kidney

Gross Description:
Received in two parts.

Source of Tissue: 1. Labeled #1, "gallbladder"

Gross Description: Received fresh with patient identification is a 8.0 X

2.5 x 1.5 cm intact gallbladder having a tan to red-purple from smooth to
shaggy outer surface. On opening there is no bile present. No calculi

are grossly identified. The mucosa is green—tan and reticulated with the
wall averaging 0.2 cm in thickness. Representative sections are submitted
in one block.

Designation of Sections: Biock 1

Summary of Sections: undesignated—S

Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled #2, "right kidney"

Gross Description: Received fresh with patient identification is a 503
gram right nephrectomy having a moderate amount of attached perinephiic
fat. There is a 1.5 x 0.3 cm fragment of attached ureter having a iumen,
0.2 cm in greatest dimension which is probe patent to the renal hilum. The
kidney itself is 12.5 x 6.5 x 6.5 cm in greatest dimension. It is bivalved

to reveal a mass in the mid portion, 7.0 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm in greatest
dimension. The cut surfaces of the mass are golden—yellow—orange to
green—tan, smooth and nodular. The remaining renal parenchyma is
rednbrown, firm having a well—defined cortico»medullary junction.
Representative sections are submitted in six blocks.

Designation of Sections: 2A- ureter and vascular margins, 2B-2E- tumor,
213— random sections kidney

Summary of Sections: multiple

Note: Tissue is Submitted for Cytogenetic Studies.

CYTOGENETIC ANALYSIS REPORTS

DIAGNOSIS: Right Renal Mass

KARYOTYPE: Abnormal. karyotype: 42-44,XY,«6,-8[cp5]

RESULTS: The renal mass was sent to a commercial laboratory for
cytogenetic analysis. Only five metaphases were available for chromosome
count and analysis, and two of these metaphases were karyotyped by
G—banding. All ﬁve cells were abnormal with loss of chromosomes 6 and 8.
The karyotype description is a composite, listing only the consiStent

clonal changes. Loss of chromosomes 6 and 8 has been reported in a
variety of renal tumors including renal cell carcinoma and renal sarcoma.
