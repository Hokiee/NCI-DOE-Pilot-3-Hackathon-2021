BIRTHDATE: ADM DATE:
ACCESSION: DPER DATE: REG DOC:
PROCEDURE: IVERIFIED av: .

History of dysphagia and reflux, Bari‘un swallow that showed a

stricture, multiple biopsies taken showed invasive squamous carcinoma, poorly

differentiated. , PET scan showed hyper metabolic distal esophagus. No

evidence of frank metastasis. Clinical Diagnosis: Esophageal carcinoma.

Operative Procedure/Tissue Submitted: i‘ranshiatal esophagectomy, flexible

esophagoscopy, pyloromyotomy, jojunostomy. Small bowel nodule.
PROCEDURE: VERIFIED BY:

1. "Brutal! bouel nodule (frozen section).” Received fresh for frozen section is
a 1.0 cm soft pink tissue nodule.
1A. Frozen section control.

2. ”Distal esophagus and proximal stomach.” Received in formalin in a large
container is a 16.2 cm segment of distal esophagus and proximal stomach with
attached perigastric fat. There are staple lines at the proximal and distal
margin.

Arising in the distal esophageal mucosa is a 3.8 x 3.2 cm near circumferential
mess with ulceration. This firm area comes to within 0.5 cm of the
esophagogastric jmction. The cut surface through the centrally ulcerated mass
is gray-tan to white lAith a maximum thickness of 0.7 cm, penetrating to the
muscular wall and within 0.1 cm of the adventitia. No direct invasion to the
gastric mucosa is readily seen.

Lymph node candidates are retrieved from the perigastric fat up to 2.4 cm in
greatest dimension. The cut surface of the largest lymph node candidate is
pink-brown and partly hemorrhagic.

Ink Code:
Green in): is applied to the adventitia.
Black ink on the gastric seroea.

Cassette Summary:

ZA-C. Tumor with EB junction.

20. Uninvolved E6 junction. ,

2E. Eight whole lymph node candidates.

2F. Bisected lymph node candidate.

ZG. Bisected lymph node candidate.

fat retained.

5. ”Cervical esaphageal margin.” Received in formalin in a small container is
a 0.8 cm segment of esophagus that is stapled at one margin and opened at the
opposing margin. The adventitia and aubmucosa are focally hemorrhagic, and the
mucosa is unremarkable.

3A. Cervical esophageal margin.
