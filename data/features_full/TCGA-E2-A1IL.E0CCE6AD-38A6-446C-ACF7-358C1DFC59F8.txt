Part A, WLE Left breast. needle localization, gross examination: Tumor is 1 cm from posterior/inferior
margin

TPB, Sentinel node #1. biopsy: No tumor seen

TPC, Sentinel node #2, biopsy: No lymphoid tissue grossly identiﬁed, no lymphocytes or tumor seen
TPD, Sentinel node #3, biopsy: No tumor seen

TPE, Sentinel node #4. biopsy: No tumor seen

TPF. Sentinel node #5, biopsy: No tumor seen

Diagnoses called at ' (Part A) and .(Parts B-F) by Dr.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. WLE LEFT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "wide local excision left breast
needle localization" is an oriented. previously inked, 39-9, 25 x 5.2 x 2.7 cm needle localized
lumpectomy specimen accompanied by two radiographs. The single suture designates anterior,
double-lateral. lnk code: Anterior-yellow. posterior-black. medial-green. lateral-red, superior-blue,
inferior-orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 6 slices revealing a ﬁrm
tan mass with surgical clip (slice 3). 1.5 x 1 x 0.9 cm, located 1 cm from the nearest posterior/inferior
margin. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. The specimen is
representatively submitted:
A1 -A5: Medial margin, perpendicular sections, entirely submitted
A6: Mass. slice 2 with posterior and anterior margins
A7-A11: Slice 3 entirely submitted, A7-A8 demonstrating tumor (clip) and nearest posterior/inferior
margins
A12-A15: Slice 4 entirely submitted, A12 demonstrating mass
A16-A17: Slice 5. posterior/inferior, inferior/anterior, respectively
A18: Representative sections lateral margin
B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 LEFT AXlLLA
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "Sentinel lymph node number
one left axilla" is a beige tan lymph node measuring 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm. Touch preparation is performed.
Entirely submitted, B1.
C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 LEFT AXlLLA
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "Sentinel lymph node number
two left axilla" is a fragment of ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 2 x 2 x 0.8 cm. Touch preparation is
performed. Entirely submitted, C1.
D. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #3 LEFT AXlLLA
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "sentinel lymph node number 3
left axilla" is a portion of adipose tissue measuring 4 x 3 x 1 cm, demonstrating one lymph node
measuring 0.7-cm in greatest dimension. Touch preparation is performed. The entire lymph node is
submitted, D1.
E. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #4 LEFT AXlLLA
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "Sentinel lymph node number 4
left axilla" is a fragment of lymphoid tissue measuring 2 x 1 x 1 cm. Touch preparation is performed.
Entirely submitted, E1.
F. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #5 LEFT AXlLLA

TSS ID

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "Sentinel lymph node number 5
left axilla" is a tan lymph node measuring 1.2 x 1 x 0.6 cm. Touch preparation is performed. Entirely
submitted, F1.
