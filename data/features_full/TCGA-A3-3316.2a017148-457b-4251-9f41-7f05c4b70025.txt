Report : GROSS EXAMINATION.
The specimen is recaived in a container labeled with the
name of the patient and labeled as kidney, left. The
specimen consists of a kidney and attached perinephric fat
which measures en bloc 15 x 12 x 7.5 cm and weighs 605 g.
The ureter and vascular margins of resection are submitted
in block 1. The mid and lower portion of the kidney shows a
large golden yellow and brown mass measuring 9.0 x 8.5 X 7.0
cm. The mass grossly extends through the capsule to within
approximately 0.2 cm of the inked surgical margin. Sections
of the inked soft tissue margins are submitted in blocks
2—3. The mass grossly bulges against the renal vein and
renal pelvis but does not extend into either grossly.
Sections of the mass and adjacent renal vein are submitted
in blocks 4—5. A section of the mass and the adjacent
pelvis is submitted in block 6. Additional sections of the
mass are submitted in blocks 7—10. The pelvis and calices
are not grossly dilated. The cortex averages 0.5 cm. A
random section of kidney is submitted in block 11.
Sectioning through the attached fat shows a portion of
adrenal gland measurin 2.5 cm. Representative sections are
submitted in block Lab
