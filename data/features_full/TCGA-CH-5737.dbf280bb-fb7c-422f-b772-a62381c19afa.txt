DiagnoSIS -

l. Predominantly poorly differentiated adenooarcinoma of the prostate on both sides with
predominance in the peripheral zone and the transitional zone. Maximum tumor spread 2.4 cm.
Focaliy perineurai invasion. No identiﬁable extraprostatio tumor growth and no identiﬁable
invasion of the vessels. Tumor—free seminal vesicles.

2. Fatty tissue with ﬁve tumor-free lymph nodes.

3. Five tumor-free lymph nodes.

Remark

In summary, the tumor is classiﬁed as follows:

pTQc, pNO (0/8), L0, V0; Gleason 4+3 = 7 (approx. 60% Gleason 4).

In the region of the tissue defects, carcinoma cells extend reotolaterall)r on both sides to the
artefactual preparation margin (yellow labeling). The other preparation margins (green and blue
labeling) are tumor—free.
