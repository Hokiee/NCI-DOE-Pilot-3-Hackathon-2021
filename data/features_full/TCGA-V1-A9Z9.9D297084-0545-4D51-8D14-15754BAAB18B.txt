FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS 51.11: 591,131: MOS 0121 ”I

(9%) I [23/14

A. Anterior prostatic fat, excision: Benign ﬁbroadipose tissue, no prostate, no tumor.

B. Left anterior apex, biopsy: Benign skeletal muscle, fibroadipose tissue and nerves,
no prostate, no tumor.

C. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, dissection: No tumor in eighteen lymph nodes (0/18).
D. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, dissection: No tumor in eleven lymph nodes (0/11).

E. Prostate gland, bilateral seminal vesicles, radical prostatectomy:

1. Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 5+4: 9, conﬁned to prostate, with
lymphatic invasion, excised, see comment.

2. High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), extensive.

3. Right and left seminal vesicles without tumor.

Conner":

No extraprostatic tumor is seen by direct extension beyond the prostate, but a cluster of crowded cells
with amphophilic vacuolated cytoplasm and enlarged nuclei with prominent nucleoli is present within a
lymphovascular space Outside of the prostate gland (slide A22). Immunohistochemical stains were
performed to rule out benign periprostatic glands and these cells stain positively with prostate speciﬁc
antigen (PSA), without p63, ck903 or PAXZ staining, supporting that these are prostatic
adenocarcinoma in a vascular space. According to inquiry made to the UICC/AJCC TNM helpdesk for
tumor staging, this ﬁnding does not constitute true extraprostatic extension, and should best be
classiﬁed as lymphatic space invasion and denoted by L1 in the TNM stage report.

Synoptic Comment for Prostate Tumors
- Type of tumor: Small acinar adenocarcinoma.
- Location of tumor: Large left sided (posterior and anterior) mid gland tumor (4.8 cc, slides ES, E6,

E13, 614, E16-E18), microscopic tumors; right apex (slide E1), right posterior mid gland (slides E11 and
E12).

 

 

- Estimated volume of tumor: roughly 5 cc.

- Gleason score: 5+4 = 9.

- Estimated volume > Gleason pattern 3: 90%.

- Involvement of capsule: None.

- Extraprostatlc extension: None by direct tumor extension (see notes above).

- Margin status for tumor: Negative; tumor in extraprostatic lymphatics is 2 mm from left posterior
ink.

- Margin status for benign prostate glands: No benign glands at inked margins.
- High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN): Present, extensive.
- Tumor involvement of seminal vesicle: None.

- Perineural infiltration: None.

- Lymph node status: Negative; total number of nodes examined: 29.

However tumor is seen within lymphatic spaces outside of the prostate (slide E22).
- AJCC/UICC stage: pT2cNOL1.

Gross Description
The case is received in ﬁve parts, labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.

Part A is received in formalin and additionally labeled “anterior prostatic fat," and consists of several
unoriented fragments of soft, yellow, Iobulated tissue (4 x 2.8 x 1.4 cm In aggregate). No lymph nodes
are identiﬁed. The entire specimen is submitted in cassette A1.

Part B is received in formalin and additionally labeled “left anterior apex," and consists of a single

unoriented, ﬁrm, tan-brown tissue fragment (0.8 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm). The specimen is bisected and entirely
submitted in cassette 31.

Part C is received in formalin and additionally labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes," and consists of
multiple irregular, unoriented, yellow, lobulated tissue fragments (4 x 3.5 x 1.8 cm in aggregate). Ten
yellow, firm, ovoid to irregular lymph node candidates ranging in size from 0.5 to 2.2 cm are identified.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

C1: One lymph node, intact.
C2: One lymph node, bisected.
C3: Four lymph nodes, intact.
C4: Four lymph nodes, intact.

Part D is received in formalin and additionally labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes," and consists of multiple
irregular, unoriented, yellow, lobulated tissue fragments (4.4 x 4.4 x 2.8 cm in aggregate). Eight

yellow, firm, ovoid to irregular lymph node candidates ranging in size from 0.6 to 2.3 cm are identiﬁed.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

DI: One lymph node, bisected.
DZ: One lymph node, bisected.
DB: Three lymph nodes, intact.

D4: Three lymph nodes, intact.

.u.‘ a

Part E is received fresh and additionally labeled "prostate and seminal vesicles," and consists of a
prostate (39 gm; 2.9 cm apex to base x 4.4 cm width x 3.4 cm anterior to posterior) with attached
seminal vesicles/vas deferens bundles (right 4 x 2 x 0.7 cm and left 4.4 x 2.7 x 0.6 cm).

GROSS ABNORMALITIES: There is a suspicious yellow nodule in the left anterior/posterior quadrants (2
x 2 x 1.4 cm) that extends from apex to base, is present in slices 1-4, and is 0.2 cm from the capsule.
The anterior ﬁbrous stroma is red, roughened and open. The remaining capsule is intact. The
remaining prostatic parenchyma is ﬁrm and tan, and the seminal vesicles are soﬂ, gray and brown.
ORIENTED BY: Anatomic landmarks (seminal vesicles, urethra).

INKING: Anterior right - green, anterior left - blue, posterior - black.

POTENTIAL STUDIES: Tissue is recovered in the fresh state by the for
research purposes.

TOTAL NUMBER OF SLICES (not including apex and base margin slices): 6.

AVERAGE SLICE THICKNESS: 0.4 cm.

For properly consented patients, sections of the prostate not required by Pathology for diagnosis, and
not submitted as described above, have been submitted to the : for processing

and can also be made available.

The immunoperoxidase stainis) reported above were developed and their performance characteristics determined by the , -

, They have not been cleared or approved by the U. 5. Food and Drug Administration.
The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They
shoald not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certiﬁed under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments of 1988 ("CLIA") as qualiﬁed to perform high-complexity clinical testing.

Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. Final diagnosis made by attending pathologist following review of all

pathology slides. The attending pathologist has reviewed all dictations, including prosector work, and preliminary interpretations
performed by any resident involved in the case and performed all necessary edits before signing the ﬁnal report.
