Interpretation

 

NEGATIVE — No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected.

Results—Comments
Testing was done on blocks .. __ .__,

TEST DESCRIPTION: Bisulfite treatment of DNA followed by PCR amplification of
both methylated and unmethylated MGMT promoter sequences, with products
detected by gel electrophoresis.

INTRAwOPERATIVE CONSULTATION
A. Brain, left parietal tumor, excisional biopsy: malignant neoplasm, defer
further characterization to permanent sections.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A.
SPECIMEN: Left parietal tumor.

FIXATIVE: None.

GENERAL: A 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.7 cm. irregular pale tan tissue fragment submitted
for frozen section evaluation. Sectioned.

SECTIONS: Al—FS frozen section remnant; A2,A3 remainder for permanent
sections.

B.
SPECIMEN: Left parietal tumor.

FIXATIVE: None.

GENERAL: Received is a 1.5 x l x 0.8 cm gray—white rubbery tissue fragment.
SECTIONS: The specimen is sectioned and submitted entirely in cassette Bl.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Sections of specimens A and B show a histologically complex neoplasm
consisting of pleomorphic atypical cells. Many tumor cells are spindle—shaped
and arranged in streaming fascicles. Other areas show whorl formation.
Epithelioid tumor cells with moderately abundant cytoplasm are also present.
Mitotic figures are frequent. Both focal and geographic necrosis is present.
Immunostains performed on sections from block Bl reveal that many tumor cells
are vimentin immunopositive. Many areas of the tumor are GFAP immunopositive,
particularly islands of tumor cells which are less spindle—shaped. Focal ‘
pan—cytokeratin (CK) positivity, and patchy muscle—specific actin positivity
of tumor spindle cells is noted. The tumor is negative for CK7, CKZO, TTFl and
HMB45.
