CLINICAL HISTORY:

The patient is a -year—old man with prostate cancer. Operative

Procedure: Prostatectomy.

GROSS:
Six formalin-filled containers are received, each labeled with the

patient's name and medical record number.

A. The first container is labeled "A-anterior bladder neck
margin." The specimen consists of a 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm tissue fragment.

The specimen is previously frozen and entirely submitted in cassette

A1.

B. The second container Is labeled "B-prostate biopsy, left base ."

The specimen consists of a 0.7 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm tissue fragment. The
specimen is previously frozen and entirely submitted in cassette Bl.

C. The third container is labeled "C-left prostate apex." The
specimen consists of a 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. tissue fragment. The specimen
is previously frozen and entirely submitted in cassette C1.

D. The fourth container is labeled "D—right pelvic lymph node." The
specimen consists of a 5.3 x 3.0 x 1.7 cm fragment of fibroadipose
tissue.

Summary of Sections:

D1 - one possible lymph node.

D2 - two possible lymph nodes.

D3 - one possible lymph node.

E. The fifth container is labeled "E-left pelvic lymph nodes." The
specimen consists of three fibroadipose tissue fragment ranging in size
from 4.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm to 3.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm.

Summary of Sections:

E1 - one possible lymph node.

E2 - one possible lymph node.

E3 - one possible lymph node.

F. The sixth container is labeled "F—prostate and seminal vesicles.“
The specimen consists of a 44.1 gm prostate measuring 3.8 cm from
anterior to posterior, 4.1 cm from left to right and 3.2 cm from

inferior to superior. Attached to the prostate are a right seminal
vesicle measuring 5.0 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm, a right vas deferens measuring 6.2

x 0.5 cm, a left seminal vesicle measuring 4.8 x 1.6 x 0.5 cm and a left

vas deferens measuring 5.5 x 0.5 cm. The anterior midline is inked
blue. The surface is otherwise inked black. Serial sectioning reveals
yellow-tan nodular cut surfaces without distinct lesions.
Representative tissue was procured for potential future studies from
specimen F.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION:

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:

AFS1: Bladder neck, anterior margin, biopsy. "Negative for
malignancy."

BFSl: Prostate, left base, biopsy. "Negative for malignancy."

CF51: Prostate, left apex, biopsy. "Negative for malignancy."

MICROSCOPIC:

Microscopic examination is performed. Permanent sections confirm the

frozen section diagnosis.
