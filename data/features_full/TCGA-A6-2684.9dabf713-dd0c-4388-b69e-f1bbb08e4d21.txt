A. Apical node
B. Right hemicolectomy

CLINICAL NOTES

PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Adenocarcinoma of cecum.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

X

A. Received fresh labeled "apical node” is an ovoid, 1.0

0.6 x 0.5 cm. soft tan pink tissue which is bisected and
entirely submitted in one block. AS—l.

B. Received fresh labeled "right hemicolectomy" is a

previously unopened 28 cm. segment of proximal right colon
with attached 1? cm. of distal ileum surfaced by smooth to scabrous
tan—pink serosa with a moderate amount of attached mesocolon and
mesentery. An unremarkable 3.7 cm. appendix averaging 0.5 cm. in
diameter is present. The proximal and distal margins measure 3.9
and 6.1 cm. in Circumference respectively. On opening, there is a
5.3 x 2.0 cm. rubbery tanhpink—red lesion at the ileocecal valve.

portion of the lesion and a portion of normal are submitted for
tissue procurement as requested. On sectioning, the lesion has a
maximal thickness of 1.3 cm., grossly extending into the muscularis
to within 0.5 cm. of the clOSest ink-free radial serOsal surface.
The remaining ileal and colonic mucosa is unremarkable, glistening
tan—pink with regular folds and the walls average 0.5 cm. in
thickness. Multiple slightly rubbery pale tan tissues in keeping
with lymph nodes measuring up to 1.0 cm. in greatest dimension are
recovered from the attached mesocolon and mesentery.

Representative

sections are submitted in 12 blocks as labeled. RS—l2.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — proximal and distal margins; 2, 3 ~ tumor full

adjacent mucosa; 6 — random ileal and colonic mucosa; 7 — appendix;
8—10 H eight whole lymph nodes per cassette; 11 — seven whole lymph
nodes; bisected largest lymph node.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

A. The apical lymph node demonstrates one lymph node with
no evidence of metastatic disease.
B. The following template applies to the right
hemicolectomy:

Histologic type: Adenocaroinoma.

Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated.

Primary tumor (pT): 5.3 cm., extending into, but not through, the

muscularis propria {pT2).

Proximal margin: Negative.

Distal margin: Negative.

Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative.

Vascular invasion: Not identified.

Regional lymph nodes (pN): No evidence of metastasis in thirty—two

additional lymph nodes (pNO).

NonHlymph node pericolonic tumor: Not identified.

Distant metastasis (pM): Cannot be evaluated by this specimen

(pMX).

Other findings: The appendix is unremarkable.

DIAGNOSIS
A. Apical lymph node, resection:
No evidence of metastasis in one lymph node (0/1).
B. Right colon, hemicolectomy:

DIAGNOSIS
Adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, 5.3 cm., with
extension into, but not through, muscularis propria.
Surgical margins uninvolved.
Thirty-two lymph nodes with no evidence of metastatic
disease

(0/32).
Appendix with no pathologic abnormality.
