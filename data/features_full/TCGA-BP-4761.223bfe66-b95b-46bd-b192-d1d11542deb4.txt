 

Clinical Diagnosis & Historv:
Patient with 14 cm right renai mass.

8 ecimens Submitted:
1: SP:AodocavaInodes( '

2: SP: Right ktdney, adrenat and liver
3: SP: Retrocaval Iym h node I

4: SP: Gatibtadder

 

 

DIAG NOSIS:

1) LYMPH Noses. AORTOCAVAL; EXCISION:
- THIRTEEN BENIGN LYMPH NODES (one).

2) KIDNEY. ADRENAL GLAND. AND LIVER. RIGHT; RADICAL NE?HRECTOMY, ADRENALECTOMY AND PARTIAL
HEPATEOTOMY:

- RENAL CELL CARCINOMA. (CONVENTIONAL) CLEAR CELL TYPE. NUCLEAR GRADE IVIIV.

- THE TUMOR GREATEST DIAMETER IS 12.0 CM.

~ TUMOR EXTENDS THROUGH THE RENAL CAPSULE, INTO THE RENAL PELVIS, RENAL SINUS AND INTO
LYMF’HATICS AND VASCULAR SPACES. THERE ARE ADHESIONS BETWEEN TUMOR AND LIVER PARENCHYMA
BUT THE LIVER PARENCHYMA IS UNINVOLVED BY TUMOR.

- ALL SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR.

- THE NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY SHOWS FOCAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS. AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATION.

— THE ADRENAL GLAND IS NOT INVOLVED BY TUMOR.

3) LYMPH NODES, RETROCAVAL; EXCISION:
. TWO OUT OF THREE LYMPH NODES WITH METASTATIC RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (2J3).

4) GALLBLADDER; CHOLECYSTECTOMY:
- BENIGN GALLBLADDER.

2} The specimen is received fresh. labeled "Right kidney, adrenal and liver". It consists of a 1.160 gm, 17.0 x 12.0 x 8.0 cm
radical nephrectomy with attached 8.0 x 6.0 x 2.0 cm portion of liver. 5.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm adrenal giend. and 5.0 x 0.5 cm segment of
ureter. TPS and photographs are taken. The specimen is bivalved to reveal a 12.0 x 10.0 x 8.0 cm variegated. gray-white to red
mess with foci of hemorrhage and necrosis. A 6.0 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm portion of kidney remains uninvolved. The tumor is
circumscribed with a capsule ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 cm in thickness. it is adherent to but not inﬁltrating the attached segment of
liver parenchyma. A 3.0 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm polypoid mass is present within the renal attached and. present within the renal pelvis.
Representative sections of that are submitted. The cut surface of the tumor disptays a majority of gray-white fieshy area with
attached adjacent hemorrhagic cystic. more yeitow area. The renai vein is grossty uninvolved.

Summary of Sections:
M - vascular and ureteral margin
ADR - adrenal
TL ~ tumor to liver
HTA » hemorrhagic tumor area
GWTA -« grey white ﬁrm tumor area
TN — tumor normal
TP ~ tumor to pelvis
NK — normai kidney

' P - representative renal pelvis
PF — pelvic fat

3). ”the specimen is received fresh for frozen section tabeted. "Retrocevai Nodes". The specimen consists of three ﬁrm pink tan
ﬂeshy fatty lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 by 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. Noted within the largest lymph node is a 0.5 cm
necrotic nodule. Represented sectioning submitted.

Summary of sections:

F SCA -- frozen section controt.
FSC b -- frozen section control
FSCC -. irozen section control.

4}. The specimen ls received In formalin labeled. "Gallbladder‘. and consists of a clubvshaped gallbtadder measuring 0 x 2 x t
cm. The serosei surface is smooth. The cystic duct is identified and measures 0.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter. and on
opening Is grossly free of stones. On opening the gallbladder. is tilted with dark green viscid bile and multiple black. multifaceted
stones measuring 3 x 3 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. The mucosal surtaco is dark green and velvety and shows a few speckias of
choiestaroiosis. The wait of the gallbladder is uniform in thickness measuring 0.2 cm. Representative section is submitted.
