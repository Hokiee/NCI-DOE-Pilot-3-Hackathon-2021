CLINICAL HISTORY:
Right breast cancer.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. “Right breast": Received fresh is a 25 x 17 x 3.5 cm right breast and
axillary tail. Attached to the breast is an 18 x 9 cm ellipse of skin
containing the nipple. In the inner upper and inner lower quadrant there is
a 6 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm biopsy cavity. Surrounding the biopsy cavity is firm to
hard breast tissue. This tissue extends from the biopsy cavity from 1.0 x
2.5 cm in all directions. Tissue from this main tumor mass was submitted for
estrogen receptors labeled as "A". Approximately 5 cm lateral to the biopsy
cavity there is another nodule within the breast that measures approximately
3 cm in diameter. Tissue from this smaller mass was submitted for estrogen
receptors labeled as "B". Small amounts of firm breast tissue are palpated
between the main tumor mass in this second 3 cm tumor mass. It is difficult
to determine whether this second tumor mass is an isolated lesion or an
extension of the main tumor mass.

Block Summary:

A1: Section adjacent to biopsy cavity containing a deep margin which has been
inked blue.

A2: Section adjacent to biopsy site containing deep margin.

A3: Random section of tumor adjacent to biopsy site.

A4: Section of firm area between the biopsy cavity and the smaller mass
lateral to it.

A5: Section of the 3 cm in diameter mass lateral to the biopsy cavity.
A6: Upper outer quadrant.

A7: Lower inner quadrant.

A8: Skin beneath the biopsy cavity.

A9: Nipple.

A10: Lymph nodes from the proximal 1/3 of the axillary tail.

All: Lymph nodes from the mid 1/3 of the axillary tail.

A12: Lymph nodes from the distal 1/3 of the axillary tail.

 

DIAGNOSIS:
A. "RIGHT BREAST":

RIGHT BREAST STATUS POST BIOPSY FOR INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA WITH
EXTENSIVE RESIDUAL INVASIVE CARCINOMA EXTENDING INTO THE DEEP DERMIS
(BLOCK A8). HISTOLOGIC GRADE: III. NUCLEAR GRADE: III.

B. "LYMPH NODES":
LEVEL—I, NEGATIVE FOR CANCER, ONE EXAMINED.
LEVEL-II, LYMPH NODES POSITIVE FOR CANCER, SIX 0F NINE EXAMINED.
LEVEL‘III LYMPH NODES POSITIVE FOR CANCER, TWO OF FIVE EXAMINED.

ALL FINAL SURGICAL MARGINS NEGATIVE FOR CANCER.
