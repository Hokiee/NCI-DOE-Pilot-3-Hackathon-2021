MARGINS: TUMOR ZS FOCALLY CLOSE (<1 mm) TO THE INKED SOFT TISSUE

PANCREATIC PARENCHYMAL, DUODENAL AND COMMON BILE DUCT MARGINS
ARE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.

Note: Tumor extends into duodenal wall and infiltrates the
periampullary mucosa where it extends to the surface and becomes
ulcerated. Since the bulk of the tumor is located in the
pancreatic head/uncinate process, adenocarcinoma of pancreatic
origin is favored over a small bowel or ampullary primary.

Case Clinical Information
CARCINOMA OF PANCREAS

Gross Description

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"pancreatic duodenectomy" is a previously dissected specimen so
designated with the included loop of duodenum measuring 17 cm
along the greater curve. The proximal margin reveals a staple
closure and appears pylorus~sparing and demonstrates a
circumference of 4.5 cm. The proximal staple line is removed
and the Ereshly exposed surface is lightly inked blue. The
distal duodenum reveals a staple closure as well and a
Circumxerence oi 5 cm with the circumference measuring 4.5 cm at
Lhe level of the ampulla. The common duct has been previously
opened and measures 5.5 cm in length With a proximal
circumrerence of 2 cm diminishing to 0.8 cm at the ampulla. The
mucosa or the common duct is relatively smooth and yellow/tan.
Tie duodenum in Lhe area of the ampulla reveals a discrete area
of induration and effacement over an area measuring 2 x 1.5 cm

 

which corresponds to a relatively well—demarcated, firm and

yellow/tan mass occupying the head of the pancreas with the mass
measuring 3 x 3 x 3 cm.in greatest dimensions. The pancreatic
resection margin measures 3.3 x l.5 cm and has been previously
inked black. The pancreas itself measures overall 6 cm superior
to inferior x 3.5 cm right to left x 4.5 cm anterior to
posterior. Soft tissue inferior to the pancreas has been
previously inked black in a ragged area where there is a suture
designated as identifying a portion of superior mesenteric

vein. This area of tissue is indurated and continuous with the
previously described inferior pancreatic tumor. The tumor is
separated from the pancreatic resection margin by a minimum of 2
cm grossly normal pancreas. The section code is as follows:
Al=shave of pancreatic resection margin; A2=shave of distal
duodenal margin; A3=proximal duodenum parallel to the lumen,
posterior, with proximal aspect inked blue after removing staple
closure; A4=shave of proximal common duct resection margin;
A5—AlOasutured area indicating superior mesenteric vein remnant,
blocked out, serially sectioned perpendicular to surface and
totally submitted (note that vein is not recognized grossly);
All—A13=apparently ulcerated duodenum overlying pancreatic
tumor; Ald=duplicate cross—sections of proximal common duct not
to include resection margin; A15, A16=ampulla of Vater adjacent
to overlying tumor parallel to lumen of common duct; A17,
Al8xadditional sections of tumor not to include resection
margin; A19~A20 and A21—A22=two dominant lymph nodes serially
sectioned and totally submitted, two cassettes each; A23,
A24=two additional lymph nodes, serially sectioned and totally
submitted, separate cassettes; and A25—A28=additional potential
lymph nodes from periductal area.
