Specimens Ki ney, Right
Frozen Diagnosis
Report : GROSS EXAMINATION.

The specimen is received in a container labeled with the
name of the patient and labeled as kidney, right. The
specimen consists of a right kidney which measures en bloc
13 x 9.5 X 5.5 cm and weighs 312 g. There is a 3.0 cm
segment of ureter attached. Ureter and vascular margins are
sampled in block one. The ureter is opened. No tumor
within the ureter is grossly identified. The ureteropelvic
junction is sampled in block two. The kidney is bivalved.
On the anterior aspect of the kidney bulging beneath the
capsule is a tan partially cystic mass which measures 4.5 x
4.0 x 3.5 cm. An extension of the mass extends into the
renal vein. A cross section of the vein and tumor are
submitted in block three. The capsule at the area of tumor
is marked with ink and a representative section is submitted
in block four. The capsule strips with relative ease.

Tumor and adjacent normal appearing kidney tissue are
sampled in blocks 5 through 7. Tumor kidney and renal
vessel are sampled in block eight. The surface of the
kidney exhibit multiple fluid filled cystic structures which
measure up to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension and is sampled in
block nine. A section of normal appearing kidney is sampled
in block 10. The perinephric fat is examined for adrenal
tissue. Adrenal gland is not identified. Representative
sections are submitted.

DIAGNOSIS BASED ON GROSS AND MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

SPECIMEN TYPE: Radical nephrectomy.

LATERALITY: Right.

TUMOR SITE: Middle.

FOCALITY: Unifocal.

TUMOR SIZE (LARGEST TUMOR IF MULTIPLE}: 4.5 X 4 X 3.5 cm.
