MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

A—D: See final microscopic-diagnosis.

E: Sections show invasive urothelial carcinoma infiltrating through the muscularis
propria into the peritoneum surface with squamous differentiation, extensive
ulceration and necrosis. Neoplastic cells are characterized by pleomorphic nuclei
with high N/C ratio, vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli with moderate to
abundant clear cytoplasm. Mitotic figures are easily identified more than 20 per
10 high power fields. Squamous differentiation with intercellular bridge is
present. Surrounding the tumor is desmoplastic change with occasional
lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. A small focus of urothelial carcinoma in situ (flat
lesion) is noted. Adjacent urothelial mucosa shows chronic cystitis. Bilateral
ureter and vesical junction are uninvolved by tumor. Sections of the uterus
show benign cervical mucosa, atrophic endometrium with cystic atrophy and
