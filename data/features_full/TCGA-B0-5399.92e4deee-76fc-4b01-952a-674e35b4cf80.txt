ORV: '
Width 3 4 cm well circumscribed right lower pole kidney mass seen on CT.

  

   

 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

PARTS ONE AND TWO:

KIDNEY, RIGHT, PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMYu-w

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR CELL) TYPE

FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE IS 214.

THE GREATEST DIAMETER OF THE NEOPLASM IS 4.5 cm.

THE NEOPLASM IS CONF‘INED WITHIN THE RENAL CAPSULE.

NO ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

ALL FINAL. ASSESSED SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF NEOPLASM.
OLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT‘Ib NX NIX (SEE COMMENT AND SYNOPTIC).

COMMENT:

Carcinoma is presant at the specimen capsular resection margin (part nova). ilowovor, additional pericapsular soft tissue
(part one) is free of neoplasm. In additlon, the inked parenohymal resection margins examined in part one are free of
nonnlmﬁm. Therefore. the final surgical resection margins are interpreted as free of neoplasm.
