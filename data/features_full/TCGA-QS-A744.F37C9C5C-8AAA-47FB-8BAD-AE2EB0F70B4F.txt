GROSS DESCRIPTI :
The specimen is eceived in multiple parts.

A. This specimem in the fresh state for immediate gross evaluation is fragments of soft.
pink tumor measuring 3 x 1 x 1 cm. A representative fragment is removed by aseptic
technique and sub itted to according to their protocol.

Representative sections are submitted as blocks A1~A3.

B. This is fragments of pink tumor which in aggregate measure 4 x 3 x 2 cm. A
representative portion is removed by aseptic technique and submitted for tumor banking.
Representative sections are submitted as blocks 81-83.

C. This is one 3 mm fragment of pink tissue. totally submitted as block C1.

D. This is one 8 mm fragment of pink tissue, totally submitted as block D1.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: (Continued) ,
E. This is 1 mL of hemorrhagic material without grossly recognizable tissue fragments.
totally submitted as block E1.

F. This specimen is brought by to the laboratory for immediate gross
evaluation. The specimen is dissected and reviewed with and consists of a
uterus and cervix with attached bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes. The right fallopian
tube appears unremarkable and measures 8 x 0.4 cm. The right ovary is wrinkled and tan and
measures 3 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. The left fallopian tube is unremarkable and measures 8 x 0.5
cm. The left ovary is wrinkled and tan and measures 3.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm. The uterus weighs
579 grams and with the cervix measures 12 x 9 x 11 cm. Much of the weight and volume of
the uterus consists of a densely calcified leiomyoma which measures 7 cm. The cervix
measures 4 x 4 x 4 cm and is completely replaced by irregular. firm. tan and red tumor.
Likewise. the endometrial cavity and myometrium are subtotally replaced by an invasive, tan
tumor which in the fundus measures 8.5 x 6 x 6 cm. Maximum depth of myometrial invasion is
3 cm with a myometrial wall thickness of 3.5 cm. A vaginal cuff margin of 0.5 cm surrounds
the tumor in the cervix. I have applied blue ink to the deep paracervical margins. The
following sections are submitted:

Block F1 — right tube and ovary

Block F2 — left tube and ovary

Blocks F3,F4 _ posterior vaginal cuff. blue ink on deep margin
Blocks F5.F6 — anterior vaginal cuff. blue ink on deep margin
Block F? — endocervix with tumor

Block FB—Flz - endomyometrium

Block F13 — leiomyoma

Block F14 — uterine serosa

The uterine cavity measures 7 x 4.5 x 0.5 cm. The uterine serosa is intact and not
penetrated by tumor.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
A. IMMEDIATE GROSS EVALUATION. VAGINAL MASS #1:
— MALIGNANT TUMOR. PROCESSED FOR ANALYSIS

B. IMMEDIATE GROSS EVALUATION. VAGINAL MASS #2:
— MALIGNANT TUMOR. PROCESSED FOR TUMOR BANKING

F. IMMEDIATE GROSS EVALUATION. UTERUS, BILATERAL OVARIES AND FALLOPIAN TUBES:
— EXTENSIVE MALIGNANT TUMOR CONSISTENT WITH CARCINOMA OE ENDOMETRIAL ORIGIN
