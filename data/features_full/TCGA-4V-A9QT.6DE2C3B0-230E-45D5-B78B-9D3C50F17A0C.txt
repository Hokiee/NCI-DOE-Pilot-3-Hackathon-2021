Nature of sampling : Thymectomy

 

Macroscopic examination : Ii I

1 - Thymectomy:

The piece weighs 189 g thymectomy fresh and addressed oriented . it measures
12 cm x 14 cm x 5 cm. The limits of resection are marked in ink green machine.

In the presence of a nodule 8 cm x 7 cm x 5 cm , located on the lower horn section
right, although limited by an individual capsule. Tumor parenchyma is marked by
rearrangements necrotic and hemorrhagic .

Histopathological examination :
The general architecture is lobulated tumor. separated by septa. The tumor consists
essentially of lymphocytes to small type lymphocytes. The presence of numerous

macrophages gives the tumor a starry sky aspect. Differentiation medullary zones are
numerous.

Epithelial tumor cells are small virtually devoid of atypia characterized by a pale
nucleus with a small nucleolus. They are poorly visible, scattered and isolated within
the lymphocyte quota. Perivascular spaces are rare.

The tumor appears well limited by the often thin capsule.

The limits of surgical resection marked in ink green are not invaded.

The samples taken at the normal thymus adjacent to the tumor ( F and G ) are
characterized by thymic involution parenchyma partially fat . this fabric
adipose tumor perished contains several nodules Bi thymoma .

lmmunohistochemical study :

- Epithelial Cells :

positive and diffuse CK19 , CK18 and CK7 low of
absence of labeling with the CK20 . CD 5 and CD20
— Lymphocytes: T CD1A immature , CD5 . CD99

Conclusion :

Thymoma subtype Bi, measuring 8 cm by 7 cm .

Tumor with minimal infiltration.

Complete resection .

Modiﬁed Masaoka stage ll classiﬁcation.
