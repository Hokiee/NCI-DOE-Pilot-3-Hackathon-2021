Sections demonstrate an invasive endometrioid adenocarcinoma compoased of
pleomorphic, atypical cells with increased nuclear: cytoplasmic ratio, prominent nucleoli
and a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Numerous mitotic features are
identified. Architecturally, the neoplasm contains foci with a solid growth pattern in >5%
of the tumor. The malignant glands appear crowded and demonstrate irregular
contours. Maximal depth of invasion is 1.1cm in total thickness of 1.8cm, best
appreciated on frozen section material. Endocervical stromal invasion is seen.
Parametrial tissue does not appear involved. The myometrium demonstrates multiple
