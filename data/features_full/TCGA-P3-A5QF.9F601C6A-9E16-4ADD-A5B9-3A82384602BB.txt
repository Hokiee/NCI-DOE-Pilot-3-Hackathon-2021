COLLECTED: RECEIVED: 94,) 4/1 211.3
CLINICAL DATA: Per Mindscape: Oral cancer.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: A) Received fresh for frozen section consultation labeled " " and
designated "deep margin" is a 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm tan-pink soft tissue fragment. The specimen is
entirely submitted for frozen section consultation and now is resubmitted as AID lF S. B)
Received fresh for frozen section consultation labeled " " and designated "lateral margin" is a
0.7 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm tan—pink mucosa soft tissue fragment. The specimen is inked blue and entirely
submitted for frozen section consultation, and is resubmitted as B1C1FS. C) Received fresh for
frozen section consultation labeled " " and designated "anterior margin" is a 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm
mucosa soft tissue fragment. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section consultation
and is resubmitted as BlClFS. D) Received fresh for frozen section consultation labeled " " and
designated "posterior margin" is a 0.4 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm tan-pink mucosa soft tissue fragment. The
specimen is inked blue and entirely submitted for frozen section consultation, and is resubmitted
as AlDlFS. E) Received fresh for frozen section consultation labeled " " and designated
"medial margin" is a 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.1 cm tan-pink mucosa soft tissue fragment. The specimen is
entirely submitted for frozen section consultation and is resubmitted as E1 FS ('2). F) Received
fresh, labeled "maxilla, rightl', is a right composite resection specimen comprising posterior
maxillaand palatal resection. The specimen is 6.7 cm from anterior to posterior, 4.3 cm from
medial to lateral, and 3.5 cm from superior to inferior. The anterior mucosal surface has two
teeth with silver metal ﬁllings; one is 0.8 cm in greatest dimension, and the other is 1.3 cm in
greatest dimension. A 2.7 x 1.4' cm depressed, indurated lesion is immediately posterior to the
teeth. The lesion has a central 2.2 x 0.6 cm defect consistent with excision of tumor for research.
The edge of the lesion is tan-white, dusky, and edematous, and it has a rolled edge. The lesion
extends 0.3 cm from the nearest lateral mucosal margin, 0. 5 cm from the nearest posterior
mucosal margin, and 1.1 cm from the nearest medial mucosal margin. The anterior mucosal
margin is 1. 8 cm from the lesion. The remainder of the mucosal surface rs tan-pink, smooth and
glistening The underlying soft tissue margins consist of tan-yellow, lobulated adipose tissue and
maroon-brown possible muscle. No deﬁnite tumor is identiﬁed at the soﬁ tissue surface. The
medial- superior aspect of the specimen has a 3.3 x 1.0 cm mucosal surface consistent with sinus
cavity; the sinus mucosa is tan-pink, smooth and glistening with areas that are red-brown,
roughened, and focally hemorrhagic. The specimen is inked as follows: anterior = red, medial
anterior = black, medial posterior = green, superior = yellow, lateral = orange and posterior =
blue. The specimen is serially sectioned from anterior to posterior to reveal a 5.2 x 4.1 x 3.5 cm,
tan-white, poly-lobulated, ﬁrm mass which immediately underlies the previously described
mucosal lesion. The mass appears to abut the posterior, superior, lateral, and medial soft tissue
margins. The mass abuts the posterior aspect of the most posterior tooth, and it does not appear
to extend any farther anteriorly. Representative sections are submitted as follows: F1 - medial
sinus soft tissue margin; F2, F3 - posterior soft tissue margins, perpendicular; F4-F6 - composite
cross section of mid posterior plane of the specimen; F7 - anterior bone margin, en face (decal);
F8-F10 - composite cross section of mid anterior plane of the specimen (decal). G) Received
fresh for frozen section consultation labeled " new deep margin" is a 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm red-
brown soft tissue fragment. The specimen was entirely submitted for frozen section consultation
and is resubmitted as GlF S. H) Designated "Right maxilla tumor and all ﬁrst 5 margins and
normal tongue tissue to research": No tissue received. Tissue submitted for research in OR per

designation on pathology requisition form received in pathology, not examined in Pathology. 1)
Received unﬁxed labeled " new deep margin #2" is 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm tan-white to maroon-
brown soft tissue fragment entirely submitted as 11. J) Received unﬁxed labeled " level I, II, 111
nodes" is an 11.2 x 5 x 2.5 cm tan-pink ﬁbrofatty soft tissue segment. Specimen is oriented as
follows: one suture level 1, two sutures level II, and three sutures level III. Multiple lymph node
candidates are identiﬁed in each level. Level I contains a grossly positive 2.6 x 1.7 x 2.3 cm tan-
white lymph node as well as a 3.7 x 2.6 x 1.4 cm fragment of tan-white, lobulated tissue
consistent with possible salivary gland. Level 11 contains two grossly positive lymph nodes, the
larger is 3.7 x 2.3 x 2.2 cm and the smaller is 2.2 x 1.4 x 0.9 cm. No grossly positive lymph
nodes are identiﬁed within level III. Representative sections are submitted as follows: J l -
representative section of grossly positive level I lymph node; J2 - one candidate lymph node
bisected; J3 - four intact candidate lymph nodes (J 1—J 3 are level 1); J4 - representative section of
level I possible salivary gland tissue; J5, J6 - cross-section of larger grossly involved level II
lymph node; J7 — representative cross-section of smaller grossly involved level II lymph node; J 8
- one level II candidate lymph node bisected; J9 - four intact level 11 candidate lymph nodes; J 10
— three level III intact candidate lymph nodes. K) Received in formalin labeled " level V lymph
nodes" is a 3.2 x 1.9 x 1.8 cm tan-pink ﬁbrofatty soft tissue segment. Multiple candidate lymph
nodes ranging from 0.3 to 1.2 cm are identiﬁed. Representative sections are submitted as
follows: Kl - six intact candidate lymph nodes; K2 - six intact candidate lymph nodes; K3 - two
candidate lymph nodes, one intact uninked and one bisected and inked black; K4 - three intact
candidate lymph nodes. L) Received in formalin labeled " level IV lymph nodes" is a 2.2 x 2 x
0.6 cm tan-yellow, ﬁbrofatty soft tissue segment. Multiple tan-pink, otherwise unremarkable
lymph node candidates are identiﬁed. No gross metastases are identiﬁed. Representative sections
are submitted as follows: Ll - two intact candidate lymph nodes; L2 - four intact candidate l
lymph nodes.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: AFS) Deep margin, biopsy: Invasive carcinoma
Margins- Lateral, anterior, posterior, respectively, biopsies: No in

situ or invasive carcinoma . Medial margin, biopsy: No evidence of malignancy
New deep margin: Positive for invasive carcinoma

 

 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

A—G) Deep, lateral, anterior, posterior, and media margins, respectively, biopsies; Oral cavity,
right maxilla, excision; new deep margin, biopsy: Invasive squamous carcinoma, moderately
differentiated, with the following features:

I. Carcinoma size: 6.7 cm in greatest dimension.
2. Margins of resection:
a. Lateral, posterior and superior margins of specimen F are involved by invasive carcinoma.

b. Separately submitted lateral, anterior, posterior and medial margins (B-E) are negative for in
situ or invasive carcinoma.

c. Deep margin and new deep margin, specimens A and G, are both positive for involvement by
carcinoma.

 

 

 

3. High grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (so-called carcinoma in situ) component is 3159
present, best seen in block F5, above invasive carcinoma. No high grade intraepithelial neoplasla
is present in the epithelium at the margins.

4. Carcinoma undermines and erodes into respiratory mucosa of maxillary sinus.

5. Extensive lymphovascular invasion is present, including invasion of large veins (see block
F3).

6. Perineural invasion: Not identiﬁed.
7. Carcinoma invades into edge of a minor salivary gland (block F6).

8. The carcinoma has numerous apoptotic cells with vacuolar degeneration. Neoplastic cells are
negative for mucin by mucicarmine stain (blocks F 2, F8); with an appropriately positive control.

9. Organizing thrombi in many small veins.
10. Carcinoma invades bone of maxilla, and it is present in the bone at the anterior margin (F7).
11. Minimal pathologic stage, incorporating parts J —L: pT3 N2b MX (AJ CC 6th edition, 2002)

H) No tissue examined in Pathology; see Gross Description, above, submitted in OR for
research.

J) Lymph node, level I, II, and III, excision: Metastatic squamous carcinoma involving 3 of 17
lymph nodes, including 1 of 6 level I lymph nodes, 2 of 8 level 11 lymph nodes, and 0 of 3 level
III lymph nodes, with the following additional features:

1. Size of largest focus of metastatic carcinoma: 3.7 cm in greatest dimension (gross
measurement of positive level II node).

2. Extracapsular soft tissue invasion: Present.
3. Salivary gland, negativefor involvement by carcinoma.

K) Lymph node, level V, excision: Metastatic squamous carcinoma involving 1 of 20 lymph
nodes.

1. Size of largest focus of metastatic carcinoma: 0.4 cm in greatest dimension.

2. Extracapsular angiolymphatic invasion is present. No deﬁnite extracapsular soft tissue
invasion is seen.

L) Lymph node, level V, excision: 4 lymph nodes with no metastatic carcinoma identiﬁed.

Procedures used to establish the diagnosis: F Mucicarmine stain
