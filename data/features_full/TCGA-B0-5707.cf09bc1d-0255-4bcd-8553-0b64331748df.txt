SPECIAL PROCEDURE REPORT
MOLECULAR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY FLUORESCENCE IN SITU HYBRIDlZATIDN ANALYSIS
kComment:

Molecular fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis demonstrates presence of trieomy of chromosomes 7 and 17
in both the papillary as well as the clear cell areas of this morphologically complex renal cell carcinoma. in addition, the
papillary areas also Show fool with totrasomy of chromosome 1?.

This molecular phenotype is moot consistent with a papillary renal cell caroinoma.

Specimen type; Renal tumor.

Interpretation guidelines: . . . . ‘
Chromosomal losses are considered oigniﬂcant if present in greater than 30% of cells. The loss is indeterminate rf present In 20,
30% of cases. The loss is considered edifactual if seen in less than 20% of cases.

Chromosomal gains are considered signiﬁcant if present in greater than 20% of cells. The gain is considered ariifactual if seen in
less than 20% of cases.

Probes used1CEP1(1911.1q11.1).CEP?(7pi‘l.1q11.1),CEP17(17p11.1q11.1).

At least 25 cells are analyzed. The signal distribution for targeted fool of renal carcinoma is recorded If the test results are not
consistent with the clinical ﬁndings. and/or diagnostic, a consultation between pathologist and treating physician is warranted.

This test was develo ed and its performance characteristics determined by the Univereity of Pittsburgh. {Department of Pathology.

. RENAL CELL. CARCINOMA (3.4 CM), FURHMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3 I 4.
THE TUMOR SHOWS BOTH PAPILLARY AND CLESAR CELL FEATURES (see comment).

THE MARGINS 0F RESECTION ARE FREE OF TUMOR.
THE URETERAL AND VASCULAR MARGINS OF RESECTION ARE UNREMARKABLE.

THE TUMOR SHOWS PROMINENT NECRO$IS.
THE SURROUNDING NON-NEOF’LA8TIC KIDNEY IS ESSENTIALLY UNREMARKABLE (one comment).
It TNM STAGE: Tta. Nx, Mx.
COMMENT: ‘
The renal cell carcinoma shows prominent necrosis. In addition. the tumor has a mixed morphology with papillary and
clear cell features. The exact characterization of this lesion will be performed after molecular testing has been
accomplished. The results of the molecular tests, as well as their interpretation, will be reported in an addendum.

:onnnnn

The non—neoplastic renal parenohyma distant from the tumor is unremarkable. However. the peritumoral renal

parenchyma shows prominent glomerular sclerosis and focal areas of interstitial inﬂammation. Clinical and serologlc
correlation is suggested.
