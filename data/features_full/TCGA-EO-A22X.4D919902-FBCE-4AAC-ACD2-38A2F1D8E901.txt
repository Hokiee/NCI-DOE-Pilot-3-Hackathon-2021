Gross Description

1. The specimen is labeled with the patient's name and as "hysterectomy 880". It consists of a
uterus with bilateral adnexa weighing 221g. The uterus measures 9.28l x 6.6ML x 4.1 AP cm and
the cervix measures 3.1 cm in diameter. The slit as measures 0.3cm long. The right fallopian tube
measures 6x0.7 cm and the right ovary is not well defined. The left fallopian tube measures
6x0.8cm and the left ovary 3.1x2.4x1.60m.

The serosal surface of the uterus shows hemorrhagic adhesions.A tumor is present
predominantly in the left fundus extending into the myometrium. There are central areas of
necrosis. It is forming a mass and measures 2.1 SI x 3.3 ML x 3.8 AP cm. The posterior lower
endomyometrium shows a friable papillary lesion measuring 2.8 SI x 1.4 ML x 1.3 APcm. Grossly
the lesion does not reach the lower uterine segment. A large intramural ﬁbroid with whorllike
appearance also identiﬁed measuring 3.5 cm in diameter. The exocervix is smooth and shows
nabothian cysts. The right fallopian tube shows hemorrhagic adhesions on the outer surface but
is patent on sectioning. The right fallopian tube is ill-defined but the area is somewhat
hemorrhagic with membraneous tissue. The left fallopian tube also shows hemorrhagic
adhesions on the surface and patent on sectioning. Hemorrhagic adhesions identified on the tan—
white surface of the left ovary. Translucent follicular cyst also seen at the surface. On sectioning
corpus luteum is identiﬁed measuring 0.6 cm in diameter.
