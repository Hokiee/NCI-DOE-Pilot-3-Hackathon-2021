SPEClMEN TYPE: Adrenal

CUNICAL NOTES:

Flight adrenal. yo male, law months H/O fevers, weightless. R) adrenal

mass on CT '> malignant cells on FNAB ?type. NOT lymphoma of melanoma. B/H
hep Owe. Rheumatic heart disease. ?primary adrenal tumour. ?metastasis.

MACROSCOPIC: :

"Right adrenal gland“. The specimen consists of adrenal gland and surrounding
adipose tissue which is haemorrhagic in§nature. The specimen measures 80 x 65
x 60mm and weighs approximately 1259’. The surrounding adipose tissue is
markedly congested and haemorrhagic. On sectioning, at least 70 to 80% oi the
adrenal gland has been replaced by tumour. it has a heterogeneous appearance
with solid white areas, fibrous bands, and a large area of haemorrhage. in a

few areas, the tumour appears to be abutting the resection margin.

Blocks 1 to 4 - contain a representative section through the adrenal and

adrenal mass, the slice has been sectioned into four pieces

Blocks 5 to 7 - contain representative tissue of tumour in areas where it

appears to abut the surrounding resection margins (blocks 6 and 7 contains
areas of haemorrhage) 5

(A small amount at tissue has been taken tor EM).

MICROSCOPIC:

Sections show adrenal tissue which has been largely replaced by a neoplastic
infiltrate consisting of solid sheets of highiy pieomorphic cells. most of

which contain abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. The nuclei are enlarged,
vesicular and have prominent nucleoli. Mitotic figures are numerous and
include a conspicuous number of atypicat forms. The tumour has an iniiitrative
border and is seen invading both residuai, cortical and medullary tissue. No
penetration of the adrenal capsule is however evident. Many areas of necrosis
and haemorrhage are present. No vasouiar space permeation is seen.

The following immunohistochemicai stains were pedomed:

8100: Occasional scattered cells staining positive, possibly representing
origin from the residual adrenal medulla.

Chromogranin: Tumour cells negative. Positive staining of residual cells of
medullary origin.

HMB45: Negative.

CKT: Negative.

CKZO: Negative.

Cam52: Occasional scattered cells with pleomorphio characteristics show weak
positive staining.

as foilows:

”Whilst there are features suggestive of an adrenal cortical carcinoma, the
standard oi preservation is too poor tor firm diagnosis.

Pleomorphic tumour ceiis are in close apposition with their neighbours and,
where plasma membranes are preserved, lack interceiiular junctions. Patches of
cytoplasm in some oelis are occupied by what is probably altered smooth
surfaced endoplasmic reticulum. However, although mitochondria are irequently
numerous, they are too autolysed to determine whether the tubular or
tubuiovesicuiar cristae typical oi adrenal cortical cells and their tumours are
present. Rough surfaced endoplasmic reticulum tends to occur in long: strands,
rather than in the short stacked cisternae. that characteriees adrenal conical
cells. Lipid droplets. though present, are not particularly numerous.

There are no features (such as melanoecrnes, secretory grannies, tonofibriie,
iumen ionnation or microviili) that would suggest metastatic tumour“.

Reported by:

COMMENT: The overall appearances/findings are considered most consistent with
those of a primary adrenal cortical carcinoma.
