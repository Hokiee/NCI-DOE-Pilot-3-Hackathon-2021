Right and left seminal vesicles, no tumor present.
Segments of right and left vasa deferentia, no tumor present.

COMMENT

The prostate gland contains a single focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor is located in the transition zone and occupies
practically the entire anterior half of the prostate. The tumor focus measures 3.5 x 1.5 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension,
and it is present in the two cross sections of the prostate, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. Focal extension of
tumor (less than 1.0 mm) to the left apical margin cannot be excluded.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (4.5 x 4.5 x 3.9 cm, 42 grams, post ﬁxation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
right and left posterolateral aspects of the prostate appears symmetrical. A nodule is palpated on the left anterior surface of the
prostate. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate a firm area consistent with tumor in the anterior portion of the prostate of
both cross sections. The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

SECTION CODE: C1-03, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens; C4-CG, left seminal vesicle and
segment of left vas deferens; C7, 08, prostatic base, right border; 09, C10, prostatic base, right posterior border; C11-C18.
prostatic base, central portion; C19. prostatic base, left border; 020, prostatic base, left posterior border; 021, C22, apex anterior;
C23-025, apex left; 026-C29, apex posterior; C30, CS1, apex right; C32-C41, sections of the two cross sections of the prostate
according to specimen radiograph.

The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in
black. Blue ink (021 and C22) denotes surfaces that do not representative the true margin of resection.
