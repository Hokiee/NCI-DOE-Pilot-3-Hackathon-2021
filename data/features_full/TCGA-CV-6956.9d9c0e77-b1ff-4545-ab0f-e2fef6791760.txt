FLOOR OF MOUTH, TONGUE, MANDIBLE:
INVASIVE MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA
INVOLVING FLOOR OF MOUTH, ANTERIOR TONGUE, MENTAL SOFT TISSUE,
AND MANDIBLE. (SEE COMMENT)

(P) ANTERIOR MANDIBLE:

Diagnosis pending deca1cification.
(Q) SOFT TISSUE, ALVEOLAR CANAL:

Periphera1 nerve with fragments of bone, no tumor present.
(R) TEETH:

Eight teeth.

COMMENT: A1though an inked resection margin at the anterior f1oor of mouth
is invo1ved by carCinoma, the 1ocat10n corresponds to that of the "anterior

menta1 margin

(negative by frozen section specimen L), and therefore does

not represent_a true mar in. The tumor approaches a right f1oor of mouth
margin. The right and 1e t posterior base of tongue margins are invo1ved by

moderate dysp1asia. The tumor demonstrates vascu

_ _ ar_and perineura1 invasion.
A supp1ementa1 report describing the mandibu1ar resection margins

This revised report is issued to show the correct site designation
