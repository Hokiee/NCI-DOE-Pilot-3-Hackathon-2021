Gross Description;

The specimens are received in fifteen containers of formalin, each
labelled with the patient’s name. The first container is labeled
"FS." It contains a fragment of tan—white, soft tissue measuring
2.0 x 1.1 x 0.2 cm.

The second container is labeled "right adnexa, X1." It contains a
fragment of tanwwhite/light blue soft tissue measuring 13.0 x 10.0
x 7.0 cm. Two previously opened cysts are present measuring 8.0
and 5.0 cm in diameter, respectively. A tan—white tubular
structure measuring 6.0 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter is
attached and opens into the smaller cyst. There are papillary and
solid growths on both cysts walls. The area of solid growth
brings these two cysts together. The solid mass is not well
defined measuring 4.9 cm in greatest dimension. The cut surfaces
are tan-white, soft, showing areas of hemorrhage and necrosis.
Labeled X1 to X6 H tumor (X3, X4 and X5, X6 are in continuation);
X7, X8 - fallopian tube.

The third container is labeled "left adnexa.” It contains a
fragment of tan—yellow, soft tissue measuring 5.8 x 3.8 x 1.8 cm.
An ovary is covered by fibrofatty tissue and measures 2.3 x 1.4 x
1.4 cm in greatest dimensions. The surface of the ovary is smooth
and cut surface shows no involvement by tumor. The fallopian tube
measures 6.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in average diameter.

Sections show luminal space lined by light yellow epithelial
tissue. The fallopian tube is not involved by tumor either.

greatest dimension are bisected. The l m h nodes are bisected
and half of each are submitted. *

The seventh container is labeled "left obturator lymph node." It
contains a fragment of yellow fibrofatty tissue measuring 5.0 x
2.0 x 0.8 cm. Two lymph nodes measuring 1.1 and 4.5 cm in

greatest dimension are bisected. are bisected
and half of each are submitted.

The eighth container is labeled "left pelvic sidewall." It
contains a fragment of tan—white to black, soft tissue, measuring
1.5 x 1.1 x 0.4 cm.

The ninth container is labeled “anterior cul—de-sac." It contains

a fra ment of tan—white, soft, tissue, measuring 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.3
cm. iillllllllllllll

The tenth container is labeled "right pelvic sidewall." It

contains a fra ment of ten, soft, tissue, measuring 1.2 x 0.6 x
0.3 cm. h

The eleventh container is labeled "posterior cul—de—sac." It
contains a fragment of tan to black, soft, tissue, measuring 0.4 X
0.3 x 0.3 cm.

The twelfth container is labeled "left gutter." It contains a
fragment of tan-white to light blue, soft tissue, measuring 0.9 x

0.5 x 0.4 cm.

The thirteenth container is labeled “right gutter.“ It contains a

fraiment of tani soft tissue, measuring 1.1 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm.

The fourteenth container is labeled "omentum." It contains a
fragment of yellow, fatty tissue, measuring 25.0 x 15.0 x 1.2 cm
in greatest dimension. Serial sections show an area of fibrosis
measuring 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm. A cyst is found in this area of
fibrosis showing hemorrhage and myxoid degeneration measuring 0.6

WE the omentum is grossly unremarkable.

The fifteenth container is labeled "right para~aortic lymph

node." It contains two fragments of tan-yellow—black, fibrofatty
tissue measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm in aggregate. One lymph node
measuring 1.0 cm in greatest dimension is dissected. The lymph
node is bisected and half of it is submitted along with a hematoma

m in greatest dimension. “
