Comments
lmmunohistochemical stains were performed at laboratories with appropriate controls. The tumor cells are
positive for CEA(p) and CD10 with a canalicular pattern. The findings support the above diagnosis.

Gross Description
Two specimens are received. each of which is received labeled with the patients name and medical record number.

Part one is received in formalin labeled "segment six lesion". and consists of a 1.600 gram. 19.5 x 15.0 x 10.5 cm
unoriented, large, irregular, distorted. predominantly encapsulated mass with a focal probable research incision. The
outer surface of the mass is gray-red to brown to yellow and is diffusely shaggy with numerous adhesions. A focal
brown—yellow. irregular. and somewhat hemorrhagic margin of resection is identified. The noted areas of yellow.
somewhat nodularity foci on the outer surface are present at the margin of resection. The margin of resection is
inked black. Sectioning reveals the mass to be completely involved by a dusky red—tan to green. necrotic. soft to
rubbery mass that extends to the inked margin of resection. as well as the surrounding capsule. There is a very
minimal amount of uninvolved appearing liver parenchyma adjacent to the edge of the margin at one end.
Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1A—1D — mass to inked margin; 1E—1F - mass to surrounding
capsule; iG—i H — random mass.

Part two is received in formalin labeled "left lateral segment nodule". and consists of a 0,6 x 0 d v 0 7* cm Hnnriented,
red—gray to white. rubbery nodule that is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette 2A.
