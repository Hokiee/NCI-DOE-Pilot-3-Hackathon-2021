LEFl' INGUINAL LYMPH NODE: v Elsi/H

Multiples tissue fragments, which measure 3,4 x 2,8 x 0,6 cm.

INGUINAL LEFT LYMPH NODE (EXCISION):
- DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA

The sections correspond to a lymph node which shows a complete deletion
of the architecture by a vaguely nodular proliferation with extensively
diffuse areas. The tumor is composed of a monotonous proliferation of
atypical large cells of centroblastic type with mitotic and apoptotic figures.
The inmunohistochemistry study has shown positivity of atypical large cells
for CD20, CD79a, CD10, bcl-6 and bcI-2, and negativity for MUM1. Stains
for follicular dendritic cells (CD21, CD35) highlight the diffuse growth of the
neoplasia. There is a moderate expansion of T cells positive for CD3 and
CD5. The Ki67 proliferation index is higher than 80%.

FISH: A rearrangement of the MYC gene has been found.
