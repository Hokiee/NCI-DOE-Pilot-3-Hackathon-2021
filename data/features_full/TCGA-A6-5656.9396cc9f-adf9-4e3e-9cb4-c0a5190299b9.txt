Sigmoid colon

CLINICAL NOTES

PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Sigmoid colon cancer

GROSS DESCRIPTION

The

Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin is a

partially opened colon which is 24 cm long. One end of
the specimen is stapled and inked blue; the opposite end of the
specimen is opened and is inked black. No orientation of the
specimen is given. No retroperitoneal reflection is grossly
identified. There is a suture on the surface of the serosa. The
serosa is pink—tan smooth glistening and the remainder of the
specimen is partially covered with abundant yellow lobular fat.

suture is located 7.5 cm from the black inked end. The specimen is
opened to show pink—tan smooth glistening mucosa with normal to
abundant folds having an average circumference of 4.5 cm and

showing

multiple diverticula present. There is also a 2.7 x 2.2 x 0.4 cm
tumor which is located 7.5 cm from the black inked end. This is in
the same area as the suture. The cut surface of the tumor shows
minimal invasion into the muscularis propria showing no discrete
invasion into the fat. No other discrete gross lesions are
identified in the mucosa. No submucosal aphthoses or perforation
are grossly identified. Lymph nodes are grossly identified in the
fat. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as
follows: Block 1 — representative luminal margins; Blocks 2—4 —
representative sections of tumor to normal and tumor to fat; Block

— representative section of diverticula; Block A6 — nine possible

lymph nodes; Block A7 — two possible lymph nodes; Block A8 — nine
sible lymph nodes; Block A9 — four possible lymph nodes. RS—9.
