Pathological diagnosis: Testicular Seminoma

Description: A testicle with tumor, size 8527.5 cm, with 9 cm long funiculus was received.
We see on the cut that the whole testicle is imbued with tumor and on the capsule we see 6.5
cm long surgical cut with sutures. On the cut, the tumor is white, soft and partially necrotic.
Histologically, the tumor is made of solid seats and tumor cell traces with round and oval
bright nuclei with pronounced smaller nuclei with medium abundant bright and pink
cytoplasm. Within the tumor, using high microscope magniﬁcation, we can see 3-4 mitoses.
Surrounding tumor seats we ﬁnd connecting tissue containing meager to medium abundant
lymphocyte inﬁltrate.

The tumor is present in lumens of two blood vessels within funiculus next to the testicle, but it
is not present at funiculus plane resection.

The tumor does not inﬁltrate testicular capsule.
