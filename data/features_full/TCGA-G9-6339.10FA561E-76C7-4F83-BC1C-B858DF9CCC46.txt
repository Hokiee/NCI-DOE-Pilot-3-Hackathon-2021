GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES:
Received fresh labeled with the patient name labeled "lymph node right pelvic“ is a portion of red-yellow
adipose tissue measuring 6 x 3 x 1 cm. Multiple possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed measuring 1.2 x
0.7 x 0.3 cm. 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm. 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.5, and 1.5 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. All four possible lymph nodes
are bisected. Touch prep performed. All four lymph nodes are submitted for frozen section in cassette
FSA1 and FSA2.
8. LEFT PELVlC LYMPH NODES:
Received fresh labeled with the patient's name designated "B - left pelvic lymph node" is a portion of
red-yellow adipose tissue measuring 2.9 x 2 x 1.5 cm. Two possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed
measuring 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm, and 4 x 1 x 0.5 cm. Both lymph nodes are serially sectioned. Touch prep
performed. Both lymph nodes are entirely submitted for frozen section in cassette F381 and F882.
C. PROSTATE:
Received fresh labeled with patient name designated "0 —- prostate" is a resected prostate gland
weighing 34 grams and measuring 4 cm. from right to left. 3.5 cm. from anterior to posterior, and 2.2
cm. from apex to base. The external capsule is smooth, red and Intact. The specimen is inked as
follows: apex-red. anterior-orange. base-blue. posterior-black, right-green. left-yellow. The apex and
base are disassembled from the specimen to yield a new weight of 18 grams. The specimen is serially
sectioned from apex to base. Cut section shows ﬁrm tan ﬁbrous parenchyma with no obvious lesions or
nodules. The right and left seminal vesicle measure 1.5 x 1.4 x 0.6 cm. and 1.3 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm.
respectively. Both are bisected to show beige’tan tissue. The right and left vas measure 1.5 cm. in
length by 0.5 cm. in diameter and 2 cm. in length by 0.5 cm. in diameter respectively. Both are serially
sectioned to show ﬁrm tan tube structure. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue
procurement. The remainder is entirely submitted for microscopic evaluation. Cassettes are submitted
as follows;

01-02: right apex

(33: left apex

C4: level 1 capsule right side
