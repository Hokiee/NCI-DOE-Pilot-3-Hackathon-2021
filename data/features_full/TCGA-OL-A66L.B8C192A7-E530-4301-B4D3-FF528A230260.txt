Effective ' this Checklist utilizes the 7th edition TNM staging

system for breast of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AICC) and the

international Union Against Cancer (UICC).

Clinical History:

The patient is a ~year~old female with right breast lump undergoing right
breast lumpectomy, right axillary s—node biopsy. On _ bilateral

diagnostic mammography/R UTS-Right revealed a 1.7 cm area of architectural
distortion in the mid posterior depth in the right breast with no associated
calcifications. Breast MRI on showed a right breast unifocal suspicious
abnormality at 5 o'clock that measures 19 x 19 x 14 mm. On right UTS core
biopsy at 5 o'clock revealed IDC, with tubular-Iobular features, Grade 1 with

associated microcalcifications.

Specimens Received:
A: Right axillary sentinel node #1
B: Right axillary sentinel node #2

C: Right breast lumpectomy; lumpectomy

Gross Description:
The specimens are received in three containers each labeled with the patient‘s

name and medical record number.

A. The first container is additionally identified as, ‘right axillary s-node
—1‘. Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis is one lymph node measuring 2.0
x 1.6 x 0.5 cm, which is bisected for frozen and diagnosed as, ‘one lymph node,

no tumor present,‘ per Dr. Specimen is entirely submitted in A1 FS.

B. The second container is additionally identified as, 'right axillary s—node
-2‘. Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis is one lymph node measuring
1.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm that is frozen and read as, ‘one lymph node, no tumor

present,‘ per Dr. I The specimen is entirely submitted in Bl FS.

C. The third container is additionally identified as, ‘right breast

lumpectomy'. Received fresh is a 92.6 gm lumpectomy specimen measuring 9.6 cm
from medial to lateral, 7.7 cm from superior to inferior and 2.7 cm from

anterior to posterior. A double short suture designates superior, and a double

long suture designates lateral. No single short stitch is found although the
container label states that there is a single short stitch at the anterior

aspect; however there is a portion of skin that designates the anterior aspect

that measures 7.5 x 1.5 cm.

The margins are inked as follows:

anterior- black
posterior . red
superior - blue

inferior - green

medial - yellow

lateral — violet

The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 17 slices. There

is a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm firm, white, stellate mass, with a central dark

gray-brown area, located in slices 8 through 10 in the anterior/central aspect

of the specimen. It is located 1.0 cm from the black margin, 22 cm from the red
margin, 2.0 cm from the blue margin and 2.0 cm from the green margin. A metallic
clip is identified in slice #10, adjacent to the mass. Superior to the mass and

in slices 6 through 11 is a brownish focus consistent with hemorrhage measuring
up to 1.0 x 1.0 cm, most prominent in slice 11. Representative sections are

submitted as follows:

C1: Entire medial margin, serially sectioned

CZ-C3: Entire lateral margin, serially sectioned

C4-C8: Slice #9 including lesion

C9»C14 Slice #10 including lesion

C1S-C18: Slice #8 with some tissue removed for banking

C19-C22: Slice #7

C23-C27: Slice 3:11, with hemorrhagic lesion most prominent in C26
C28-C29: Slice #3, including skin in C29

C30-C33: Slice #15

Tissue fixed for at least 6 hours in 10% NSF and no more than 72 hours.
