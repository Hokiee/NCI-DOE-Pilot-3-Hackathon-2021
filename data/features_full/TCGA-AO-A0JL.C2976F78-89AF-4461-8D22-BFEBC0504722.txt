*/o female with left breast mass.
breast. Core biopsiea IDC and DCIS.

Mann» showed 2 lesions in UOQ left
Proceeding to HRH.

Specimens Submitted:

1: SP: Left breast with level 1 and low level 2 axillary contents
2: SP: Additional level 2 left axillary contents

3: SP: Left level 2 and level 3 axillary contents .

DIAGNOSIS:

1) BREAST WITH LEVEL I AND LOW LEVEL II AXILLARY CONTENTS, LEFT;
MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY AND AXILLARY LYMPH NODE DISSECTION:

— TWO SEPARATE TUMOR NODULES: ONE IS LOCATED IN THE UPPER OUTER
QUADRANT AND SHOWS AN INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, POORLY DIFFERENTIATED
(HISTOLOGIC GRADE III/III, NUCLEAR GRADE III/III), MEASURING 3.9 CM IN
LARGEST DIMENSION GROSSLY.

THE SECOND IS LOCATED IN THE UPPER AND LOWER OUTER QUADRANTS AT 3:00 AND IS

- THE DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS) IS OF THE SOLID AND CRIBRIFORK TYPES
WITH HIGH NUCLEAR GRADE, EXTENSIVE NECROSIS AND FOCALLY INVOLVES A LARGE
LACTIFEROUS DUCT OF THE NIPPLE.
- CALCIFICATIONS ARE PRESENT IN THE IN SITU AND INVASIVE CARCINOMA, AND IN
BENIGN BREAST PARENCH'YMA.

~ VASCULAR INVASION IS PRESENT.

- NO INVOLVEMENT OF THE SURGICAL MARGINS BY EITHER INVASIVE OR IN SITU
CARCINOMA IS IDENTIFIED.

- NO SKIN INVOLVEMENT BY CARCINOMA IS IDENTIFIED.
- THE REMAINING BREAST TISSUE SHOWS PREVIOUS BIOPSY SITE AND MILD
FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES.
- THE LYMPH NODE STATUS IS AS FOLLOWS (EXPRESSED AS THE NUMBER OF POSITIVE
LYMPH NODES IN RELATION TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF Lmﬂ NODES EXAMINE):
THERE IS EXTRANODAL TUMOR EXTENSION (>2 MK) .

- RESULTS OF IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINS ARE AS FOLLOWS:

ER: 0% NUCLEAR STAINING
PR: 0% NUCLEAR STAINING

HER-Z/NEU (HERCEPTEST) : NEGATIVE (STAINING INTENSITY 01' 1+)

Gross Description:

1) The specimen is received fresh labeled, "Left breast with level 1 and
low level 2 axillary contents, stitch marks axillary contents" and consists
of a breast with attached axillary tail. The breast measures 37.0 x 26.0 x
6.7 cm with overlying skin ellipse measuring 36.5 x 18.0 cm. Situated on
the skin surface is an everted nipple measuring 1.4 x 1.2 x 0.1 cm and
areola measuring 4.8 x 4.5 cm. The skin shows no visible scars. A suture
demarcates the axillary tail which measures 11.0 x 4.0 x 3.5 cm. The
posterior surface of the breast is inked black and the specimen is serially
sectioned to reveal a white tan firm ill-defined mass in the upper outer
quadrant measuring 3.9 x 3.7 x 3.3 cm, located 1.5 from the deep margin.
There is a biopsy site identified in the lower outer quadrant, corresponding
to the three o'clock position, measuring 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. The remaining
breast tissue shows predominantly yellow lobulated adipose tissue admixed
with white-tan fibrous soft tissue with no other gross identifiable lesions.
The axillary tissue is dissected to reveal several grossly positive lymph
nodes, measuring up to 4.5 cm. Representative sections of the mastectomy
specimen and all identified axillary lymph nodes are submitted (the large
grossly positive lymph nodes are representatively submitted). Tissue is
taken for TPS.

Summary of sections:

N - nipple

NB - nipple base
5 - skin

D - deep margin
T - tumor

2) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled I‘additional level 2
left axillary contents" and consists of an axillary dissection measuring 7 x
4.5 x 0.8 cm. The specimen consists of soft yellow-tan lobulated tissue
with several pink-tan lymph nodes identified on cut section ranging from 0.2
cm to 1.3 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is submitted for lymph
node digest dissection.

Summary of sections:
LN - lymph nodes

3) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left level 2 and level
3 axillary contents" and consists of an unoriented axillary dissection
measuring 7.5 x 4.7 x 1.8 cm. The specimen consists of yellow tan lobulated
tissue, which on sectioning reveals several pink- tan lymph nodes ranging
from 0.2 cm to 2.3 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is submitted for
lymph node dissection.
