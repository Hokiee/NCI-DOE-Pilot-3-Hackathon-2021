GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. PROSTATE
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "prostate" is a 34 g resected prostate gland
measuring 3.5 cm from right lateral to left lateral, 3.3 cm from apex to base, and 3.2 cm from anterior to
posterior. The capsule is smooth, red, and intact. Ink code: Anterior-orange, apex-red, base-blue, right
lateral-green, left lateral-yellow, posterior-black. After removal of apex and base, the prostate weighs 20
g and has a nodular tan parenchyma. The right seminal vesicle is 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm and the left is 2.5 x
1.6 x 0.7 cm; they consist of cystic tan tissue. The right vas deferens is 4.1 x 0.7 cm and the left is 3.8 x
0.4 cm; they consist of tubular tan tissue. Tissue is procured (12 g); submitted entirely:
A1 -A2: perpendicular sections of apex
A3: level 1, right side
A4: level 1, left side
A5: level 2, right lateral capsule
A6: level 2, posterior capsule
A7: level 2, left lateral capsule
A8: level 2, anterior capsule
A9: level 3, right anterior
A10: level 3, right posterior

A11: level 3, left anterior

A12: level 3, left posterior

A13-A14: perpendicular sections of right mid base
A15: perpendicular section of left mid base

A16-A17: perpendicular sections of right lateral base
A18â€”A19: perpendicular sections of left lateral base
A20: perpendicular sections of right posterior base

A21 : perpendicular sections of left posterior base

A22: perpendicular section of right urethral orifice margin
