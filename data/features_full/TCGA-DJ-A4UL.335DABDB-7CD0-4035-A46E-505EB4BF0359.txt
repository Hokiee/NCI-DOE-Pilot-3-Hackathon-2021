Gross Description:

 

1. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled "tissue of cn'cold cartilage". and consists of a fragment
of tan-pink soft tissue measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section.

Summary of sections:
FSC - frozen section control

 

2. The specimen Is received fresh, labeled “Pro-tracheal lymph node" and consists of a ﬁrm tan lymph node measuring 0.3 x 0.2 x
0.1 cm. The lymph node is entirely Submitted.

 

Summary of sections:
LN - lymph node

 

3. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Delphian lymph node" and consists of a possible lymph node measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x
0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
PLN - possible lymph node

4. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Pyramidal lobe' and consists of an irregular fragment of soft tissue measuring 1.3 x
0.5 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U - undesignated

5. The specimen Is received fresh, labeled "total thyroidectomy stitch marks left lobe of thyroid". and consists of a thyroid
weighing 16.4 g. The right lobe measures 4.2 x 3.2 x 1.1 cm, the left lobe measures 4.1 x 3.3 x 1.1 cm and the isthmus measures
1.4 x 0.5 cm. The external surface is covered by a thin fibrous capsule. The posterior surface of the specimen is inked black,
and the anterior is inked blue. Sectioning reveals a 1.1 x 0.? x 0.6 cm nodule that is tan white and weil-clrcumscribed.— The
nodule is located in the left Inferior lobe. Sections through the remaining tissue reveals an additional tan white wall circumscribed
nodule that is located in the right upper pole and measures 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. The remaining thyroid parenchyma is red brown
and beefy. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for TF'S. The remaining tissua is serially sectioned and
entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:

NL - nodule left. entirely submitted

NR - nodule right, entirely submitted

Rt. - right lobe

LL - left lobe
is - Isthmus
