Organ Or Tissue
Omentum
Uterus cervix bilateral adnexa

Gross Description
The specimen is received in two parts each labeled with the patient's name.

Part A designated "omentum" was received for frozen section. The specimen consists of a segment
of pink red and yellow omental tissue measuring 41.0 x 13.5 x 3.0 cm in greatest dimensions. The
specimen reveals multiple areas of tumor deposits and thickening. Representative sections are
submitted as follows:

'uterus, cervix, bilateral adnexa” was received for intraoperative consult. The
specimen consists of a uterus with attached cervix with attached adnexa. The specimen weighs 211
grams. The uterus measures 10.3 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm. The serosal surface is pink-red. hemorrhagic with
possible adhesions in the lower segment. The ectocervix is pink tan. hemorrhagic, and measures 2.5
x 3.5 cm with a 0.8 cm slit-like as. The endocervical canal is pink red with a distinct herringbone
appearance and measures 3.0 x 0.8 cm.

The endometrial cavity is distorted by the presence of an intramural fibroid in the posterior part and
measures approximately 4.0 x 2.5 cm. An exophytic pink tan friable lesion occupies the fundal and
upper part of the uterine cavity. The lesion measures approximately 4.0 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm and appears to
extend to the middle part of the cavity. The lower uterine segment and cervix are grossly free of
tumor. No myometrial invasion is appreciated by gross examination.

The left adnexa is comprised of a segment of grossly dilated fallopian tube with attached ﬁmbria
measuring 5.0 cm in length and varying in diameter from 0.5 to 1.5 cm. The pale-yellow. pink and
focally hemorrhagic ovary measures 1.4 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm. The lateral pole of the ovary reveals a red
purple mass of tumor attachment measuring 4.5 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm.

The right adnexa is comprised of a segment of fallopian tube with attached fimbria measuring 5.0 cm
