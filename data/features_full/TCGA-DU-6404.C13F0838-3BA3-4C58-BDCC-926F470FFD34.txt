UPDATED REPORT — SEE ADDENDUM REPORT, ADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS.

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:

A—C. BRAIN, SITE NOT SPECIFIED, EXCISION: OLIGODENDROGLIOMA /dA—'0"5 jiéﬂMVMMAVLC2
WITH ATYPICAL FEATURES. f
SEE COMMENT. Jagoded/MWI M05 7459/3
ADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS:

MIB—l PROLIFERATION INDEX: 7%. Sﬁp: W1), N05 07"9
Operation/Specimen: UPDATED REPORT — Brain.

Clinical History and Pre—Op Dx: year old woman with diagnosis of g
oligodendroglioma with anaplastic features in P94
Currently, recurrence.

GROSS PATHOLOGY:

A. Received fresh, one fragment, 1.2 cm across in largest dimension.

Semi—firm, grayish tan. In total #1—2.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, smears: Glioma (consistent with
oligodendroglioma).

B. Received fresh, one fragment, 0.8 cm across. Semi—firm, tannishbrown.

In total #3.

C.

SPECIMEN: #1 brain tumor.

FIXATIVE: None.

GENERAL: A 15 x 12 x 3 mm. portion of soft pink—tan tissue.

SECTIONS: 4C — submitted in toto.

D.

SPECIMEN: #2 brain tumor.

FIXATIVE: None.

GENERAL: A 7 x 5 x 2 mm. portion of soft pink—tan tissue.

SECTIONS: 5D — submitted in toto.

E.

SPECIMEN: #3 brain tumor.

FIXATIVE: None.

GENERAL: A 1.7 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm. fragment of soft, pink-tan tissue.

SECTIONS: 6E — submitted in toto.

COMMENT: The neoplasm throughout has an overall morphology of
oligodendroglioma with classical "chicken-wire" microvasculature,
somewhat uniform cellularity, extensive microvascular calcification,
and diffuse infiltration of the gray matter. However, focally the
neoplasm appears fibrillary and somewhat astrocytic. In addition,
mitotic figures are occasionally found, but microvascular cellular

proliferation is absent, and there are no areas of necrosis. Special
stains are being requested to better characterize the neoplasm, and an
addendum report will follow.

ADDENDUM REPORT

SPECIAL STAINS: Bielschowsky stain was performed on section from block
#4.

The stain demonstrates various densities of axons throughout the tumor.
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP, p53,
synaptophysin, and MIB—l were performed on sections from block #4.

The GFAP depicts reactive astrocytosis throughout the zones of the
brain parenchyma infiltrated by the tumor. In these zones there is
background synaptophysin immunoreactivity, and rarely a ganglion cell
has perikaryal positivity (interpreted as entrapped native neurons).
Where there is solid tumor, there is no synaptophysin or GFAP reaction,
and with the MIB-l a proliferation index of 7% is determined. The
diagnosis remains as above.

MICROSCOPIC: 6 blocks, 6 slides, 1 special stain, 4 immunoperoxidase
stains.
