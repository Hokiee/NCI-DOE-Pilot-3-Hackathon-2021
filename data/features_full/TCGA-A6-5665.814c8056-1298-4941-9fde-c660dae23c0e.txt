SPECIMEN
Right colon

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Right colon cancer

GROSS DESCRIPTION
Received fresh, labeled "right colon" is a previously
unopened, 23 cm. segment of proximal right colon with

attached 8 cm. of distal ileum surfaced by smooth to scabrous
tan—pink serosa with a moderate amount of attached mesocolon,
mesentery and unremarkable omentum. On opening, there is a
well—circumscribed, 6.5 x 4.4 cm. centrally necrotic white pink—red
tumor mass 3 cm. distal to the ileocecal valve. On sectioning, the
lesion has a maximal thickness of 1.2 cm., grossly extending into
the muscularis to within 0.4 cm. of the inked free radial serosal
surface. Two additional mucosal polyps averaging 0.5 cm. are
present within the colon, 7.5 cm. proximal and 9 cm. distal to the
tumor. The remaining colonic mucosa is unremarkable, glistening
tan—pink with regular folds and the wall averages 0.4 cm in
thickness. The ileal mucosa is unremarkable glistening tan pink

with
regular folds and the wall averages 0.4 cm. in thickness. The
appendix is not present. A portion of tumor and a portion of

normal
mucosa are submitted for tissue procurement as requested. Several
soft tan—pink tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to
0.9 cm. in greatest dimension are recovered from the attached
mesocolon and mesentery. Representative sections are submitted in
12 blocks as labeled. RS—12.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Proximal and distal margins; 2, 3 — tumor full

thickness to inked free radial serosal surface; 4 — central tumor;
5

— tumor to normal mucosa; 6 — colonic polyp; 7 — ICV; 8 — random

colon and ileum; 9—11 — six ole lymph nodes per cassette; 12 —

five whole lymph nodes.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma
Histologic grade: Moderately to poorly differentiated

Primary tumor (pT): Tumor invades through the muscularis propria
focally into the pericolonic fat (pT3)
Proximal margin: Negative for tumor

Distal margin: Negative for tumor
Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative for tumor

 

Distance of tumor from closest margin: 11 cm. from proximal margin
(ileum)
Vascular invasion: Lymphatic space invasion is identified, best
seen in slide 4, no venous or arterial space invasion is identified

Regional lymph nodes (pN): 25 lymph nodes are dissected from the
specimen, they were all negative for metastatic tumor (pN0)
Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: Not identified
Distant metastasis (pM): Cannot evaluate pr
Other findings: Approximately 30% of the tumor has mucinous
differentiation and is seen in blocks 4 and 5. The most deeply

invasive portion of the tumor is not mucinous and is poorly
differentiated and seen in blocks 2 and 3. The ileocecal valve is
unremarkable. No appendix is identified. An additional tubular
adenoma is noted in block 6.

5x1, 3260F

DIAGNOSIS
A. Colon, right, segmental resection:
Invasive adenocarcinoma, moderately to poorly differentiated,
invasive into pericolonic fat (pT3)
Lymphovascular space invasion present.
25 lymph nodes are negative for metastatic tumor (pN0).
Additional adenomatous polyp.
