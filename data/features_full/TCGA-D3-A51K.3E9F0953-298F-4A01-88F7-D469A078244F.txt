******* MODIFIED REPORT - REVIEW ADDENDUM SECTION *******
DIAGNOSIS

(A) LEFT GREAT TOE, AMPUTATION:
SKIN AND SUBCUTIS WITH FOCAL MELANOMA IN SITU AND SCAR WITH HEALING PRIOR SURGICAL
PROCEDURE SITE.
Skin and soft tissue margins are free of melanoma. Multiple step sections examined.
Additional decalcified sections, including proximal bone margin, are pending; please see addendum report.
(B) LEFT SUPERFICIAL INGUINAL LYMPH NODES, DISSECTION:
METASTATIC MELANOMA INVOLVING THREE OF FIFTEEN LYMPH NODES (3/15).
LARGEST TUMOR DEPOSIT: 70 X 30 MM (PER GROSS DESCRIPTION).
TUMOR LOCATION: SUBCAPSULAR AND INTRAPARENCHYMAL.
Extracapsular extension is present.
(C) LEFT ILIAC AND OBTURATOR LYMPH NODES, DISSECTION:
Twelve nodes, metastatic melanoma is not identified (0/12).
(D) LEFT MEDIAL THIGH, SKIN PUNCH:
Exogenous dark pigment involving dermis consistent with tattoo pigment.
Melanoma is not identified. Multiple levels examined.

COMMENT

In part (B), immunohistochemical studies reveal that the tumor cells are reactive with pan melanocytic cocktail, supporting the
above diagnosis. ”A, a -3

GROSS: DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT GREAT TOE — A 4.6 x 3.6 x 2.4 cm great toe amputation of the left side. There is a 2 cm in length portion of
disarticulated bone protruding from the soft tissue margin. There is an intact nail present. On the lateral aspect of the specimen is
a 1.4 x 1 cm ill—defined hypopigmented area which lies 1.5 cm from the lateral soft tissue and skin margin. This area is serially
sectioned to reveal tan pink firm scar tissue; no lesion is identified. The soft margin and bone grossly appears uninvolved. The
remaining specimen is sent to the bone lab for further processing and decalcification.

INK CODE: Blue —- medial soft tissue margin; orange — lateral soft tissue margin.

SECTION CODE: A1, medial dorsal soft tissue and skin margin; A2, plantar medial skin and soft tissue margin; A3,
lateral plantar skin and soft tissue; A4, lateral dorsal skin and soft tissue margin; A5, A6, entire skin with scar area; A7, subcutis
tissue underlying medial scar.

A8, proximal bone margin submitted an face for decalcification; A9, A10, representative sections through scar area to
phalange bone submitted for decalcification.

(B) LEFT SUPERFICIAL INGUINAL LYMPH NODES, TIL PROTOCOL, PAN MEL STAIN - Consists of portion of yellow-red
fibroadipose tissue (23 x 11 x 3.5 cm). The specimen is surfaced by a portion of unoriented skin (8 x 2.5 cm). Sectioning reveals
a dark-brown black grossly positive lymph node (7 x 3 x 3 cm) with an anthracotic friable ﬂeshy cut surface. Approximately 80% of
the positive lymph node is submitted to the protocol. Fourteen additional possible lymph nodes are identified ranging in size
from 0.3 to 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. All possible lymph nodes are submitted entirely.

SECTION CODE: B1, B2, representative of grossly positive lymph node; 83, representative skin; B4, three possible
lymph nodes; 85, one possible lymph node, bisected; 86, three possible lymph nodes; B7, one possible lymph node, bisected; B8,
one possible lymph node, bisected; BQ, one possible lymph node; B10, one possible lymph node, bisected; B11, one possible
lymph node, bisected; B12-813, one possible lymph node, serially sectioned; B14-B18, one possible lymph node, serially
sectioned.

(C) LEFT ILIAC AND OBTURATOR LYMPH NODES — Received is one segment of brown—red fibroadipose tissue (8 x 6 x 2 cm).
Within this is Identified multiple potential lymph nodes, ranging in size from 0.6 — 4 x 1 x 1 cm. Sectioning through the largest
lymph nodes reveals homogenous white—tan smooth cut surfaces. The specimen is representatively submitted, with lymph nodes
entirely submitted.

SECTION CODE: C1, 02, largest lymph node, bisected and quartered; CB, one lymph node, four pieces; C4, one lymph
node, four pieces; 05, one lymph node, bisected; 06, one lymph node, bisected; C7, two lymph nodes, uncut; C8, two lymph
nodes, uncut; 09, two lymph nodes, uncut; C10, two lymph nodes, uncut

(D) LEFT MEDIAL THIGH PUNCH BIOPSY - Received is one 3 mm punch biopsy of skin with underlying soft tissue (0.5 cm
depth of excision). Along the tan hair bearing skin surface is a 0.2 x 0.2 cm surface area of discoloration. The resection edge is

entirely inked and specimen is submitted in D1.
