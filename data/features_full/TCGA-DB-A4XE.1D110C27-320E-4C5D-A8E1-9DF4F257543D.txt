Final Diagnosis:
AvC Brain, left temporal mass #1, #2 and anterior, biopsies and CUSA: Anaplastic oligoastroeytom-a, astrocytic
dominant (WHO grade III)

lmmunohistochemical stains were perfonned on pamfﬁn—embedded tissue using antibodies to p53 and MIB-I P33
is positive in tumor cells. MIB-l labeling index is moderate. The ﬁndings support the above diagnosis.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies for 1‘919q deletion have been ordered on parafﬁn sections and
will be performed by the
