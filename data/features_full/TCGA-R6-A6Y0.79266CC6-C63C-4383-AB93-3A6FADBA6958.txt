ADDENDUM
This modiﬁed report is being issued to report the results of HER—Zineu FISH

Addendum completed by

SPECIMEN SOURCE

Distal esophagus

SUMMARY:

Tissue section of the adenocarcinoma was evaluated for HER-2/neu gene ampliﬁcation by interphase ﬂuorescence in situ
hybridization technique using the HER-Zineu ( HER-2lneu CEP17

Slide adequacy is satisfactory. Sixty tumor nuclei were counted and showed an average of 1.90 copies of HER-2/neu gene per
nucleus and an average of 1.40 copies of CEP17 per nucleus.

Negative and positive controls (established by with this batch are appropriate.

Two representative images have been archived.

INTERPRETATION

The tumor cells demonstrated no ampliﬁcation of the HER-2/neu gene copy levels (HER-2Ineu: CEP17 signal ratio: 1.36)

The following guideline has been established for HER-2/neu testing:
Normal HER-Z/neu levels: < 1.80; equivocal HER-Z/neu levels: 1.80 — 2. 20; ampliﬁed HER-2/neu levels: > 2.20
(Ref: Arch Patholo Lab Med. 2007; 131 :18-43)

NOTES

The HER-Zlneu probe is speciﬁc for the HER-2/neu gene Locus (17q 11.2—q12) and the CEP 17 DNA probe is speciﬁc for the
alpha satellite DNA sequence at the centromeric region of Chromosome 17 (17 p11.1 -q11.2).

This test has been cleared and approved for speciﬁc uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Its system is operating within
the performance specifications stated in the product insert.
