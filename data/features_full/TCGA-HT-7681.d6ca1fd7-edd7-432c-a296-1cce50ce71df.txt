Microscopic

Sections demonstrate a glioma with biphenotypical features including both
astrocytic and oligodendroglial components. The oligodendroglial component
demonstrates individual tumor cells with round nuclei and prominent perinuclear
halo formation. They are embedded in a fibrillary background containing thin
branching vessels and microcystic change. Numerous microgemistocytes are
interspersed throughout the tumor. The astrocytic component consists of
neoplastic glial cells with oval nuclei and prominent fibrillary processes. The
tumor cells diffusely infiltrate the adjacent brain parenchyma. Overall, the
cytologic atypia is mild to moderate. Neither necrosis nor microvascular
proliferation is seen. Only a rare mitotic figure is identified. These histologic
features are consistent with an oligoastrocytoma

Addendum
A MlB-1 labeling index ranges up to 2.4% consistent with a low grade glioma
Diagnosis

Oligoastrocytoma, low grade II
