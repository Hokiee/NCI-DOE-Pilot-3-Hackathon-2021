GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. RIGHT COLON, TERMINAL ILEUM

Received fresh for tissue procurement is a segment of terminal ileum with attached right colon. The
terminal ileum is 4 cm in length and 4 cm in circumference and is grossly unremarkable. A segment of
the right colon is 25 cm in length and 9.5 cm in maximum circumference. The serosal surface is tan-
pink, smooth and grossly unremarkable. The attached appendix is 7 cm in length and 0.4 cm in
diameter and shows unremarkable external and cut surfaces. The specimen is opened and shows a
4.2 x 3 x 0.6 cm tumor mass with central ulceration located at the mid portion of the right colon at 8 cm
from the closest (distal margin) and 12.5 cm from the ileo-cecal valve. This lesion involves the portion
of the colon which is not covered with serosa. It invades through the muscularis into the subserosa. A
second polypoid lesion is identified in the area corresponding to the base of the appendix. This lesion
measures 2.5 x 2.3 x 0.7 cm. Sectioning shows the lesion to be confined to the mucosa without definite
evidence of invasion. The remainder of the colon shows an unremarkable tan pink mucosa.
Throughout the pericolic adipose tissue, multiple presumptive lymph nodes are identified ranging
between 0.3 and 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. All the lymph nodes and representative sections of the
specimen are submitted as follows:

A1: appendix
A2: proximal margin
A3: distal margin
A4-7: sections of tumor
A8-12: sections of cecal polypoid mass in the area of the appendiceal orifice
A13: uninvolved colon proximal to the tumor
A14: uninvolved colon distal to the tumor
A15-16: lymph node underlying the tumor
A17-18: lymph node from the ileocecal artery region
Tissue procurement was performed on the specimen. Gross photographs are taken of the specimen.
