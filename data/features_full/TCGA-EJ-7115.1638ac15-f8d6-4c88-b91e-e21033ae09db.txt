PART 3:
PROSTATE AND BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES, RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY —

A. INVASIVE POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA. GLEASON SCORE 4 + 3 = 7.
B. THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT LOBES AND HAS A GREATEST NODULAR DIAMETER
OF 0.5 cm.
0. THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES LESS THAN 5% OF THE EXAMINED PROSTATE VOLUME.
D. THE CARCINOMA SHOWS ESTABLISHED EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION.
E. THE EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IS SEEN IN THE RIGHT POSTERIOR REGION CLOSE TO THE RIGHT SEMINAL
VESICLE (SLIDE 3A).
F. BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA.
G. ALL EXAMINED SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA.
I-I. EXTENSIVE PERINEURAL INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.
I. No ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION Is IDENTIFIED.
J. EXTENSIVE HIGH GRADE PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA IS IDENTIFIED.
K. PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT3a ND Mx.
