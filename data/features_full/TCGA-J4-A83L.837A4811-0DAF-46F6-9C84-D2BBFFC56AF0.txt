PROSTATE CANCER

Gross Description

A. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"left obturator lymph node—PS" are two gray/tan fibrofatty
frozen section tissue fragments. The larger measures 1.7 x 0.6
cm; the smaller, 1.3 x 1 cm. Entirely submitted in A1.

3. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"left obturator lymph node-NFS" is a yellow tibrofatty tissue

fragment measuring 3.5 x 2.5 cm. The fat is trimmed. No
probable lymph nodes are grossly identified. The specimen is
submitted complete in 31-33.

C. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"right obturator lymph node-F5" is a gray/tan frozen section
tissue fragment measuring 1.5 x 1 cm in greater dimensions.
Entirely submitted in C1.

D. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"right obturator lymph node-HES" is a yellow fibrofatty tissue
fragment measuring 2 x 2 cm. No lymph nodes are grossly
identified. Entirely submitted in BI, 02.

E. Received in formalin labeled "prostate, seminal vesicle and
vas deferens“ is a radical prostatectomy specimen which includes
a 73 gram prostate gland with attached seminal vesicle and vas
deferens. The prostate gland measures 5.5 x 4.5 x 4 cm and has
a shaggy capsule that is disrupted at the bladder resection
margin and has been previously inked black on the left and blue
on the right. The right seminal vesicle measures 2 x 1.5 cm.
The right vas measures 2.5 x 0.5 cm. The left seminal vesicle
measures 2.5 x 1.5 cm. The left vas measures 2.5 x 0.5 cm.
The inferior prostate is sectioned transversely, removed from
the rest of the specimen and sectioned from anterior to
posterior following the plane of the urethra. The remaining
gland is serially sectioned transversely and shows a firm,
focally nodular parenchyma. The seminal vesicles and vans
deferentia show no abnormalities. Representative sections
submitted as follows: inferior prostate demonstrating apical
margin submitted entirely anterior to posterior in 81—26;
bladder resection margin, shaved and serially sectioned in E7,
38; complete section of mid gland anterior in E9, 210; posterior
in E11, E12; complete section of upper third of gland, anterior
in E13, 314; posterior in 315, 216; remainder of the posterior
gland entirely Submitted in E17-322; right seminal vesicle and

vas deferens in E23; and left seminal vesicle and vas deferens
in 324.
