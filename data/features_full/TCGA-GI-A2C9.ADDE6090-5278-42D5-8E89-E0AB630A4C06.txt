Note:
lnfiltrating ductal carcinoma is high grade and morphologically identical to
that seen in a recent previous biopsy( ). The studies for steroid

receptors and HER-2/Neu overexpression were performed on the original biopsy and
will not be repeated, unless otherwise requested.

Gross Description:
Three specimen are received fresh and labeled with the patient's name, "

A. Part A labeled “right breast partial mastectomy, black-cephalad,
purple-medial, blue-lateral, brown-caudad". The specimen consists of a 409
gram, red-yellow fibrofatty (14.0x 13.0 x 6.0 cm.). The sutures are present as
indicated. There is a palpable protruding mass in the posterior aspect of the
specimen and scant skeletal muscle fibers. The mass protrudes 5 cm. beyond the
remaining soft tissue plane. It is within 3.0 cm. from the caudal, 4.5 cm. to

the lateral, 5.5 cm. from the medial and 7.0 cm. from the cephalad borders. The
soft tissue and surrounding adipose tissue are inked black around the lesion.
The lesion is mobile beneath the adipose tissue. On serial sectioning, there is

a 6.0 x 4.0 x 3.8 cm. mass. It has fairly well circumscribed borders and a
modeled grainy cut surface. The cut surface is yellow-pink, modeled, red-white
and has a central area of calcification. There is a ﬂeshy pink-red region

towards the cephalad portion of the tumor. It is within 0.4 cm. from the

closest soft tissue margin and is slightly adherent to the portion of skeletal
muscle present. The remaining parenchyma is predominantly yellow and lobular
with white-pink fibrous streaks. No additional lesions are identified.

Sections are submitted as follows: "A1-2" soft tissue and tumor; "A3-7"
representative sections of tumor, lateral, central, cephalad, caudal, central
respectively; "A8" representative section of uninvolved parenchyma.

B. Part B is designated "lymph node axillary tissue" and consists of a
red-yellow lobular portion of fibrofatty tissue, 6.5 x 5.5 x 1.6 cm. Three
possible lymph nodes are identified. They are entirely submitted in "B1 and
"82" ("81" two lymph node, "BZ" one lymph node).

C. Part C is designated "sentinel node" and consists of an 8.0 x 2.5 x 1.3 cm.
portion of yellow-red fibrofatty tissue. Three lymph node candidates are
identified. They are bisected and entirely submitted in "Cl-3“.

Gross Description:
Received are two fixative filled containers labeled with the patient's name and
medical record number.

Part A is additionally labeled "level 3 lymph nodes." The specimen consists of
three fragments of yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue ranging from 1.1 to 2.2 cm in

greatest dimension. Six lymph node candidates are identified, ranging from 0.3
to 1.4 cm.

A1 four lymph nodes entirely submitted;

A2 two lymph nodes entirely submitted.

Part B is additionally labeled "right radical mastectomy.“
Specimen type: Radical mastectomy.
Specimen dimensions: 21.2 x 20.5 x 4.1 cm with a 6.5 x 5.4 x 1.7 cm portion of
rib and chest wall.
Skin: A 20.6 x 10.2 cm ellipse of skin including the nipple is present. No
scar is identified, however, there is significant puckering of the skin inferior
to the nipple.
Location of lesion: The location is central.
Estimated size of lesion: The lesion is approximately 4.8 x 2.9 x 2.9 cm. (for
final size, see Microscopic Description)
