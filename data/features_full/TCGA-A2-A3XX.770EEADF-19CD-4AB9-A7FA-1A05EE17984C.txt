GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A: Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name,‘ (d
designated "Sentinel Node #1 with markings; suture mar s ottest point at
1152 hours" is a 2.5 x 2.5 x 0.7 cm irregular portion of soft tissue.
Sectioning reveals a 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm pink-tan lymph node with.attached
adipose tissue. The specimen is entirely submitted as follows:

Cassette Summary: Al- sentinel lymph node; A2— adipose tissue.

**At the time of submission the specimen will have been in formalin for

B: Received fresh, labeled With the patient's name, and
designated "Left Breast Tissue, long-lateral, short—superior 1 pm" is a

468 gm left mastectomy specimen oriented with a short stitch at the
superior aspect and long stitch at the lateral aspect. The specimen
measures 20.0 cm from superior to inferior by 18.0 cm from medial to
lateral by 3.0 cm from anterior to posterior. The darkly pigmented skin
ellipse measures 9.5 x 3.5 cm and displays a 1.5 cm centrally located,
everted nipple free of discharge. The deep margin is inked in black, and
the left outer quadrant superficial margin is inked in green. Serial
sectioning reveals a well—circumscribed 2.2 x 2.0 X 1.8 cm mass in the
lower outer quadrant located 0.3 cm from the superficial margin and 0.7 cm
from the deep margin. The cut surface is firm gritty pink—red and focally
congested. The remainder of the specimen is composed of evenly
distributed pink-tan fibrous tissue admixed adipose tissue. No additional
lesions are identified. No lymph nodes are identified within the specimen.
