Histologic grade: poorly differentiated /Cb-a-3

Tumor focality: Unifocal

amammupguhwmuaaLAmulwx 9mab
Tumor size: 3.1 x 2.2 x 1.9 cm Slﬁ= Mil/OWVINUS 6/0.?

Extent of invasion:

~ Tonsil invasion: present /an>
— Skeletal muscle invasion: present, focal (BlO)

— Venous invasion: present (82)

- Lymphatic invasion: not identified

— Perineural invasion: Not identified

— Bone invasion: none for evaluation

HR HPV: outside report: PCR screening positive for HPV16.
- 916 by IHC: positive
— HR HPV by ISH: positive

Surgical margins:

— Deep margin focally positive (B3), possibly superseded by
specimen A

- 9-12 o' clock (presumed superior—lateral) margin focally
positive (B3)

- Other margins not involved:

— Carcinoma extends to <1 mm from the 6 o' clock (inferior)
margin (82)

- Carcinoma extends to <1 mm from 12 to 3 o' clock (presumed
superior—medial) margin (B4)

— Carcinoma extends to 1 mm from 3 to 6 o’ clock (presumed
inferior- -medial) margin (BlO)

— Carcinoma extends to 8 mm from 6 to 9 o' clock (presumed
inferior— lateral) margin (B9)

Lymph nodes: See specimens C, D, and E

AJCC Pathologic Stage (Tonsil, oropharynx): pT2 pN2b pr (stage
revised, see Amendment Comment below)

NOTE: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information
available at the time of this report, and is subject to change
pending clinical review and additional information.

C: Lymph nodes, right cervical level 4, regional dissection
No metastatic carcinoma identified (0/12)

D: Lymph nodes, right cervical level 2, regional dissection
Metastatic basaloid squamous carcinoma (1/12), 1.5 cm
diameter, without extracapsular extension

E: Lymph nods, right cervical level 3, regional dissection
— Metastatic basaloid squamous carcinoma (1/15), 0.5 cm
diameter, without intact capsule for evaluation

Comment:

Amendment Comment:

Following case finalization, it was brought to our attention
that there are different node staging systems for different
pharyngeal sites. For oropharynx, metastasis to multiple
ipsilateral nodes <6 cm in diameter is staged as N2b,

rather than as N1. The AJCC pathologic stage is revised, as
above.

Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis:
Frozen section was requested by Dr. in

FSAl: Deep margin, biOpsy
— No tumor seen

Drs.
Frozen Section Pathologist:, MD, PhD
Clinical History:
~year-old male with likely HPV+ tonsillar squamous cell

carcinoma.

Gross Description:
Specimen A is received is fresh for frozen section in one

o

appropriately labeled container additionally labeled "deep
margin, biopsy." It holds three brown/tan soft tissue fragments,
1.5 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm in aggregate which are serially cauterized.
The entire specimen is submitted in block FSAl,

Specimen B is additionally labeled "right pharyngectomy, long
stitch = soft palate, short stitch = tongue base". The container
holds a single irregularly shaped pink/tan soft tissue fragment
with a single long stitch attached. A short stitch is present
detached inside the container. The specimen measures 5.4 x 3 cm
with a maximum thickness of 2 cm, and has an apex at the long
stitch and a broad base at the opposite end. The mucosal surface
shows a white/tan firm irregular mass which on sectioning
appears invasive and has a slightly mucoid cut surface. The mass
measures 2.2 x 3.1 cm across the surface of the specimen by 1.9
cm in depth. The deep margin is irregular, cauterized
fibromuscular tissue. The peripheral margin closest to the long
stitch is inked green and the peripheral margin of the opposite
half is inked blue. The deep margin is inked black. The mass
focally abuts the black inked deep margin and comes within 1 mm
of both blue and green inked peripheral margins. It is 0.6 cm
from the margin marked by the long stitch (soft palate margin)
and appears to abut the opposite end of the Specimen. The long
stitch is designated 12 o'clock. The tumor is slightly off
center in the 12—3—6 o' clock half of the specimen.

Block Summary:

B1 — Perpendicular sections to the soft palate margin (long
stitch)

B2 — Perpendicular sections to the 6 o' clock end (broad base)
B3 — Perpendicular sections to 9 to 12 o' clock

B4 — Perpendicular sections to 12 to 3 o' clock

B5-B6 ~ Perpendicular sections to 6 to 9 o' clock

B7—B8 — Perpendicular sections to 3 to 6 o' clock

B9 - Perpendicular to 6 to 9 o' clock

BlO — Perpendicular to 3 to 6 o‘ clock (B9—B10 single cross
sections through tumor bisected)

Specimen C is additionally labeled "right level 4" and holds a
5.5 x 3 x 0.7 cm fragment of lobulated fibroadipose tissue. The
specimen is palpated for lymph nodes.

Block Summary:

C1-C3 - Multiple lymph node candidates each cassette

C4—C5 — Additional fat for non—palpable lymph nodes

Specimen D is additionally labeled "right level 2" and holds a
4.5 x 2 x 1 cm fibroadipose soft tissue fragment. The specimen

is dissected for lymph nodes.

Block Summary:

D1—D2 — One 2.5 cm lymph node, bisected

D3 — One lymph node candidate, bisected

D4 - One lymph node candidate

D5—D7 — Multiple lymph node candidates, each cassette,

Specimen E is additionally labeled "right level 3" and holds a
4.5 x 3 x 1 cm fibroadipose soft tissue fragment. The specimen
is dissected for lymph nodes.

Block Summary:

E1—E3 — Multiple lymph nodes, each cassette

E4—E7 — Additional soft tissue for lymph nodes

Tissue remains in formalin.
