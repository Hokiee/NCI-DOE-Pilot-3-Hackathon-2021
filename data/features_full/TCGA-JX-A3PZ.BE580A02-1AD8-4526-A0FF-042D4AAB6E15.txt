A 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm‘nodulo is present at the 12 o'clock position,
possibly representing direct extension ﬁrom the main tumor mass at
6 o'clock. The tumor does not grossly invade the cervical ntroma,
the generous 1.0 to 1.5 cm rim or vaginal cuff preoent on the
posterior portion 0: the specimen, or the 1.5 to 2.0 cm rim of
vaginal cuff present on the anterior half of the specimen. The
3.0 x ago X 1.0 cm and 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm swaths of paracervical
nott tissue on the right and lott sides or the specimen,
respectively, are similarly uninvolved by tumor. The uterine
fundus has a length of 5.5 cm. a maximal width of 4.0 cm, and a
;g_ maximal dimension or 2.4 cm. It is covered by glistening tan

I The myomotrium ranges in.thioknsss from 1.0 cm at the level or
lower uterine sogmont to 1.3 cm at the level of mid funduo. It is
rodsbrown and firm and displays no lesions. The ondomotrium
displays uniform thickness of 0.2 cm. It is composed of the usual

Hiatologic sections of the cervical tumor show that it is-oompnned
of large nests of moderately differentiated squamous cell
carcinoma with focal koratinization. In some areas the neoplastic
M. squamous cells display prominent cytoplasmic clearing, a feature
”ii which was appreciated on-this patient’s prior biopsy

TV The growth pattern of the tumor is almost enriroly oxophytic, a
feature which makes measurement of the depth of invnmion
difficult. However. the lesion clearly invades the onrvical
stroma. The point of deepest invasion occuro at the posterior

:.1 cervix (6:00 o'clock). Where the tumor invades to a depth of 5 mm

éﬁﬁﬁ present on the posterior cervical wall at this point and tho

 

 

sorosal surface of'the cervix thorsfors reprenontn the margin of
resection. Thus. the most deeply invasive tumor is 15 mm from the
deep surgical roooction_margin. Prominent vascular spore invasion
is seen. No tumor is identified in the utorino corpus, the vagina,
or the paramotrial tissues. similarly. no tumor is identified in
the 22 regional lymph nodes examined, including two norametrial
