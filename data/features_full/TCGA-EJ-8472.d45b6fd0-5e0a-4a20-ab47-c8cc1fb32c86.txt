   

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
PART 1: LYMPH NODES. RIGHT PEL , . - -
NO EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASIA IN FOUR (4) LYMPH NODES EXAMINED.

PART 2: LYMPH NODES, LEFT PELVIC, EXCISION -
NO EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASIA IN EIGHT (8) LYMPH NODES EXAMINED.

PART 3: PROSTATE AND BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES. RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY ——

A'. INVASIVE POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 4 + 4 = 8 WITH TERTIARY
GLEASON PATTERN 3.

B. THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT LOBES AND HAS A GREATEST NODULAR
DIAMETER OF 2.1 CM.

THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES 15% OF THE EXAMINED PROSTATE VOLUME.

THE CARCINOMA SHOWS ESTABLISHED EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION.

THE EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IS SEEN IN THE POSTERIOR RIGHT BASE AND RIGHT MID REGIONS
(SLIDES 3AA. 3BB, 3CC and 3DD). _

BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA BUT THERE IS TUMOR PRESENT IN THE SOFT
TISSUE SURROUNDING THE SEMINAL VESICLES. .

TUMOR FOCALLY EXTENDS TO AN INKED SURGICAL MARGIN IN THE REGION OF POSTERIOR RIGHT MID
(SLIDE 333).

ALL OTHER EXAMINED SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA.

EXTENSIVE PERINEURAL INVASION IS IDENTIFIED. ’

FOCAL ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

HIGH-GRADE'PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA IS IDENTIFIED.

PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT3a N0 MX.

TNM HISTOLOGIC GRADE = G4.

BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA.
