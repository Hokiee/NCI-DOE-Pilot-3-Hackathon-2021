GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in three parts. Each part is labeled with patient‘s name.

Parts A and B are received fresh and placed in formalin for fixation.

A. Part 1 labeled "right parametrium“ is a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm portion of yellow.
lobulated adipose. The portion of fat is bisected and entirely submitted cassette A1.

B. Part 2 labeled "left parametrium“ is a 1.5 x 0.9 x 0,8 cm portion of yellow. lobulated
adipose with scant fibroconnective tissue. The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted
cassette Bi.

C. Part 3, ”uterus. tubes and ovaries“. received fresh for gross evaluation and tissue
banking is a 315 gram. 11.0 x 8.5 x 6.5 cm uterus. The uterus is received with attached
bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries and weighed with the tubes and ovaries removed. The
uterus is mildly distorted with multiple subserosal nodules. The ectocervix is pink~tan to
white with a 1.0 cm 0s. The uterus is bivalved to have a polypoid appearing endometrium in
the fundus. This area ranges up to 4.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm and is more thickened in the

posterior fundus. The myometrium underlying this area ranges up to 3.0 cm. The polypoid
lesion focally dips down into the myometrium for 0.5 cm involving approximately 20% of the
myometrium. The myometrium has numerous. intramural. submucosal and subserosal nodules. A
separate 1.2 cm polyp is identified on the posterior endometrium. The endometrium averages
0.1 to 0.2 cm in the normal appearing regions. The leiomyomata range up to 4.5 cm with the
largest leiomyoma being subserosal. No areas of hemorrhage. calcification or necrosis are
identified. The right fallopian tube is fimbriated and is 6.0 x 0.8 cm. The right ovary is
1.8 x 1.7 x 0.8 cm. The ovary has superficial adhesions. The ovary is bisected to have an
unremarkable yellow—tan to white. fibrous stroma. The left fallopian tube is fimbriated and
is 6.5 x 0.9 cm. The left ovary is 1.9 X 1.5 X 0.9 cm. The ovary is bisected to have a
dense. yellow—tan. fibrous stroma. Representative sections are sampled as labeled:

 

C1 — section of anterior cervix to include endocervical polyp

C2 a posterior cervix

C3—4 — one posterior fundus full cross section to include area where tumor appears
to dip into myometrium

C5—6 - one full thickness posterior fundic cross section

C7—8 — one posterior fundus full thickness cross section

C9—11~ additional sections of irregular. posterior endometrium to myometrium

C12 ~ additional sections of posterior endometrium to myometrium to include
separate polyp

C13 ~ anterior polypoid appearing tumor mass to myometrium

C14-15— sections of subserosal nodules

C16 ~ sections of anterior. normal appearing endometrium to myometrium sampled

C17 w right fallopian tube and ovary sampled

C18 — right fallopian tube attachment at uterus

C19 — left fallopian tube and ovary sampled

C20 — left fallopian tube attachment to uterus submitted

There are 3 additional parts on this case. parts 4. 5 and 6. Each part is received in
formalin. labeled with the patient's name.

D. Part 4 is labeled "right pelvic lymph node" is a 5.0 x 4.5 X 2.0 cm aggregate of
yellow. lobulated adipose tissue. The adipose is trimmed to have a 2.2 x 1.8 x 0.4 cm
nodular fatty lymph node. The fat is trimmed. The node is bisected and entirely submitted
cassettes D1~D2.

E. Part 5 is labeled “left pelvic lymph node" is a 4.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm aggregate of yellow.
lobulated adipose. The adipose is trimmed to have multiple fragmented lymph nodes. The
lymphoid tissue range from a 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm fragment to a linear 2.4 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm
lymph node. The four larger lymph nodes are each bisected and the nodes are entirely
submitted as labeled cassettes:

E1 — smallest lymphoid fragment and one bisected lymph node
E2 ~ one bisected lymph node
E3 ~ one bisected lymph node
E4 — one bisected lymph node

F. Part 6 is labeled “upper vagina“ are multiple erythematous tissue biopsied. The
specimen container contents are filtered and aggregate to 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm. The tissues
are submitted in toto cassette F1.
