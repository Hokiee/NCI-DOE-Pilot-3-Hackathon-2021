Gross Description-

1) The specimen is received fresh, labeled 'Retroperitoneal sarcoma, 2nd
and 3rd portion of duodenum and right colon“. It consists of a segment of
duodenum, 2nd and 3rd portions, measuring 15 cm in length. Both margins are
stapled. The proximal margin measures 5 cm in circumference. The distal
margin measures 6 cm in circumference. Between the 2nd and 3rd portions of
the duodenum at the superior margin, a small fragment of pancreatic tissue
is recognized, measuring 2 x l x 0.5 cm. Attached to the duodenal wall,
covered by the duodenal serosa on the superior aspect of the 3rd portion of
the duodenum, there is a multinodular, rubbery tumor, measuring 4 x 3 x 2.5
cm. The tumor has an attached 0.5 cm pedicle to the duodenal wall and is
located 2 cm from the distal duodenal margin. The second multinodular tumor
covered on the anterior aspect by the peritoneum and located 5 cm from the
distal surgical margin is seen. This tumor is composed of multiple nodules,
ranging in size from 1 to 3.5 cm in diameter. 0n the right side, 5 cm from
the duodenal angle, there is a segment of ascending colon and terminal
ileum. The terminal ileum measures 2.5 cm in length. The proximal surgical
margin measures 4 cm in circumference. The ascending colon measures 15 cm
in length. The distal surgical margin measures 9 cm in circumference. The
appendix is not identified. The pericolic fat measures up to 5 cm in width.
The surgical margin is inked: superior—blue, deep-black, inferior-red,
lateral-green. The duodenum is opened, revealing an unremarkable duodenal
mucosa. The colon is opened to reveal unremarkable tan-pink mucosa. Serial
sectioning of the specimen shows that the nodules adjacent to the distal
duodenum have a tan-pink appearance. The nodules located retroperitoneal
show a variegated appearance. Some have a white—yellow appearance. They
measure from 1.0 x 0.3 cm in diameter and are located 0.1 cm from the deep
margin. One of the nodules located 3 cm from the deep margin showed a
tan-pink appearance with hemorrhagic areas. This nodule measures 3.5 cm and
has a soft consistency. Sections are taken to * Photographs are taken.

Summary of Sections:

DPM — Duodenal proximal margin
DDM - Duodenal distal margin
TD - Tumor at the distal margin
RT - Retroperitoneal tumor

In - Inner margin

CM - Colonic margin

D - Duodenum

C - Colon

CNL - Pericolic lymph node

2) The specimen is received fresh, labeled I‘Subcutaneous Eat“. It
consists of multiple irregular pieces of fatty tissue, measuring 3 x 3 x
0.25 cm. The specimen is submitted for apresentative sections are
submitted for permanent sections.

#3). Specimen received in formalin labeled 'Proximal small bowel'. It
consists of a single fragment of small bowel with attached scanty amount of
mesenteric adipose tissue. The bowel measures 5 cm length and 3.5 cm in
greatest diameter. The serosa is ten and smooth. Upon opening the
intestinal wall measures 0.5 cm in thickness. The mucosa is tan and
unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted.

#4). specimen received formalin labeled "Gallbladder". It consists of an a
club-shaped gallbladder measuring 10 x 3 x 2.5 cm. The serosa is tan and
smooth. Upon opening the lumen contains green bile. No calculi were
identified. The wall measures 0.2 cm in thickness. The mucosa is velvety
and grossly unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted.

Cassette summary:

U-undesignated.

#5). Specimen received in formalin labeled “Superior mesenteric vein nodule
'. It consists of a nodular fibromembranous tissue measuring 1 x 1 x 0.6

cm. The nodule was bisected and entirely submitted.
