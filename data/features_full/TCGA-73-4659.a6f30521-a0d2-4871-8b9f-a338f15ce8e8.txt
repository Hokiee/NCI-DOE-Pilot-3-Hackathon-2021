. AL:
Received fresh for frozen section is a iymph node measuring 0.7 cm. The specimen is submitted

in toto for frozen section and resubmitted in cassette Bl.

C. 4R RIGHT DISTAL PARATRACHEAL:
Received fresh is a lymph node measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned

and a touch preparation is made. The specimen is submitted in toto for frozen section and
resubmitted in cassette C1.

D. SUPERIOR SEGMENT RIGHT UPPER LOBE:
Received in formalin are multiple pieces of lung which are 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm. in aggregate. The

specimen is submitted in toto in cassette Dl.

E. 6TH RIB:
Received in formalin is a segment of rib measuring 1.9 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is grossly

unremarkable, and no sections are submitted.

F. RIGHT LUNG:
Received fresh is a right lung with a 9.0 x 5.0 x 2.0 cm right middle lobe, and a 7.5 x 7.0 x 3.0

cm right lower lobe, and a 14.5 x 8.5 x 6.5 cm right upper lobe. There is a 9.0 x 6.0 x 3.0 cm.
tumor extending from the upper lobe into the lower lobe. The tumor is peripherally located, is
1.5 cm. from the bronchial margin, 0.1 cm from superior pleural surface, and 0.1 cm away from
lateral pleural surface. A second 1.5 cm. in diameter nodule is present in the center of the lower
lobe. The bronchial margin is shaved and submitted for frozen section and resubmitted in

cassette Fl.

Cassette F12: bronchus and adjacent iymph node from the upper lobe
Cassette F13: multiple lymph nodes near the bronchus near the upper lobe
Cassette F14: multiple lymph nodes near the bronchus around the lower lobe
Cassette F15: representative sections from the bronchus ‘
Cassette F16: uninvolved upper lobe

Cassette F17: uninvolved middle lobe

G. 10R LYMPH NODE:
Received in formalin is a piece of yellow-tan lymph node measuring 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm. The

specimen is submitted in toto in cassette Gl.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. LYMPH NODE, SUBCARINAL—LEVEL 7, EXCISION:
- NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED IN ONE LYMPH NODE (0/1).

B. LYMPH NODE, RIGHT DISTAL PARATRACHEAL-4R, EXCISION:
- NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED IN ONE LYMPH NODE (0/1).

C. LYMPI-l NODE, RIGHT DISTAL PARATRACHEAL—4R, EXCISION:
— METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE LYMPH NODE (l/ 1).

D. LUNG, RIGHT UPPER LOBE SUPERIOR SEGMENT, BIOPSY:
— POSITIVE FOR ADENOCARCINOMA, SEE PART F BELOW.

s. BONE, 6"“ R113, SEGMENTAL RESECTION:
-» NO GROSS HISTOPATHOLOGICAL ABNORMALITIES (GROSS ONLY).

F. LUNG, RIGHT, PNEUMONECTOMY:
~ ADENOCARCINOMA, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED WITH FOCAL

POORLY DIFFERENTIATED AREAS, SEE COMMENT AND SEE TEMPLATE.
- 9.0 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION.
- SPANNIN G BOTH THE UPPER AND LOWER LOBES.
- THE PLEURAL SURFACE IS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

- THE BRONCHIAL MARGIN IS NEGATIVE FOR INVASIVE CARCINOMA.

— THE RESPIRATORY MUCOSA AT THE BRONCHIAL MARGIN
F OCALLY CONTAINS MILD TO MODERATE DYSPLASIA.
- 1.5 CM FROM THE BRONCHIAL MARGIN.
- ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IS PRESENT.
- ADENOCARCINOMA IN SITU INVOLVES THE RESPIRATORY MUCOSA

WITHIN THE TUMOR MASS.
~ METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA TO TWO OF TWELVE PERIBRONCHIAL

LYMPI-I NODES (2/12).
, PERIBRONCHIAL LYMPH NODES CONTAINING CALCIFIED AND

HYALINIZED GRANULOMAS.
— THE NON-NEOPLASTIC LUNG CONTAINS EMPHYSEMATOUS CHANGES.

G. LYMPH NODE, 10R, EXCISION:
- NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED IN ONE LYMPH NODE (0/ 1).

 

 

 

COMMENT: The adenocarcinoma is predominantly moderately differentiated, however, it
contains areas where the tumor forms solid sheets of cells rather than forming glands in these
areas contain some Signet ring cells. These areas are poorly differentiated. Some of these
Signet ring cells are present in the metastasis in part C. Two tumor nodules were identiﬁed
grossly, the smaller 1.5 cm nodule was an old hyalinized granuloma.
