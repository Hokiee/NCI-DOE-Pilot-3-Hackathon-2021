year—old with adrenal cancer presenting on dith fever, headache,
tinnitus and left sided flank pain. CI scan revealed a 15.8 x 16.1 cm adrenal
mass with fatty inflannmtion and borderline enlarged periaortic and paracaval
lymphadenopathy. Clinical Diagnosis: Adrenal cancer. Operative Procedure: Left
adrenalectomy, possible distal pancreatectomy/splenectomy for left
nephrectomy.

i. Labeled with patient's name and hospital registration number. Received in
an extra large container. A 58 x 28 x 14 cm left adrenalectomy, splenectomy,
distal pancreatectomy and nephrectomy specimen consisting of a 16 x i3 cm
spleen and 8 cm portion of pancreas and a 9 cm kidney. Inked blue. There is a
16 x 15 x 14.5 cm solid tabulated well-circumscribed orange—yellow adrenal
mass with focal areas of necrosis (approximately 40—50% necrosis). The mass is
2.5 cm from the kidney, 4.5 cm from the spleen and is separated from the

pancreas by a facial plane. Neither the spleen nor the kidney nor the pancreas
appear to be grossly involved by neoplasm. Splenic vessels are not grossly
involved. Renal vessel is not grossly involved by tumor. The splenic
parenchyma is ten, beefy red and grossly unremarkable with a smooth capsule.
No abnormalities are seen within the pancreas or spleen.

1. Adrenal gland, spleen, distal pancreatectomy and nephrectomy, composite
resection: Adrenal cortical carcinoma, oncocytic type, with minimal capsular
invasion, 16 cm in greatest dimension, low-grade by mitotic activity. No
vascular invasion identified. Resection margins negative. Unremarkable
pancreas, spleen and kidney. See COMMENT.

COMMENT:

This cortical neoplasm does show significant areas of necrosis, and this
raises the possibility, however unlikely, that the necrotic neoplasm
represents high~grade carcinoma.
