ption
fresh for tissue procurement labeled "right upper lobe" is
5 x 4.5 cm lobectomy specimen with attached 1 cm in length,

1.2 x 0.9 cm in diameter bronchial stump. The pleura is smooth to

scaberous ta

n red~gray with an indurated focus along the medial aspect.

The pleura is inked black and the specimen is sectioned. On
sectioning, there is a 3.9 x 3.5 x 3.2 cm rubbery tan—white tumor mass
which extends to within 0.3 cm of the inked pleural surface. A portion
of tumor and a portion of normal parenchyma are submitted for tissue
procurement as requested. The remaining parenchyma is spongiform
tan—pink-red without additional mass lesion or abnormality. Two soft
gray—black tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 0.8 cm
are recovered from the hilum. RS 12

Summary: 1 - bronchial stump margin, 2 — vascular margins, 3 — hilar
lymph nodes, 4 through 6 — tumor to inked pleural surface, 7 through 9
~ tumor to adjacent parenchyma, 10 through 12 — random

B. Received fresh labeled "portion of lower lobe" is a wedge—shaped,
5.4 x 2.7 x 1.3 cm soft portion of lung tissue with a single staple
line along one aspect. The staple line is removed and the underlying
surface is inked blue. The pleura is slightly scaberous tan—pink. On
sectioning, the parenchyma is spongiform tan red without apparent mass
lesion or abnormality. A56

C. Received in formalin labeled “level X lymph node" is a 2.1 x l.7 x
0.7 cm rubbery tan—gray-pink tissue which is bisected and entirely
submitted in one block.

D. Received in formalin labeled "R. 4 lymph node" are 2 slightly
fragmented rubbery tan—gray—pink tissues averaging 1 cm in greatest
dimension. A81

E. Received in formalin labeled "level VII lymph node“ are 4 slightly
rubbery tan-pink to gray-black tissues ranging from 0.4—0.9 cm in
greatest dimension. ASl
