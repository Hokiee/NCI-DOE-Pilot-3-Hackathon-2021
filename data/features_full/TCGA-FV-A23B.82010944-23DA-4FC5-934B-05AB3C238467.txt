(Parts A and B are received in the same container). .

A/APC & B. The specimen consists of one portion of roughly ovoid, tan-brown
hepatic tisSue. The deep surface reveals a portion of loosely attached.
irregular hepatic tissue. The larger portion is part A, and the smaller
portion on the deep surface is part B. Part B is sutured to part A by two
blue sutures. The entire specimen measures 9.3 x 8.0 x 3.5 cm and weighs 121
grams. The attached part B portion measures 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm. The capsular
surface is smooth and tan-brown. The deep surfaces of part A and part B are
inked black. and the specimen is serially sectioned. aThe sections show tuna
Well—defined, tan-brown nodules. measuring.2.2 x 2x0 x 1.8 cm and 4.5 x 3:4 x
23.0 cm. The smaller nodule is composed of lobulated, tan-white to tan-brown
tissue with focal hemorrhage. The larger nodule is composed of tan-white,
firm tissue with focal hemorrhage. The smaller nodule is 0.2 cm from the
surgical resection surface, and the larger nodule is 0.4 cm from the surgical
resection surface. The two nodules are 0.8 cm away from each other. Both
nodules bulge over the capsular surface. The sections away from the nodule
reveal lobulated, tan-brown. coarse hepatic parenchyma. The section away from
the two nodules is not normal homogeneous liver tissue. However, no discrete
fibrotic nodules can be identified. The part B portion is close to the deep
surface of the larger nodule. and the sections show the same lobulated,
tan-brown coarse parenchyma. Representative sections are submitted in
fourteen cassettes as follows: cassette A1 - smaller nodule. with deep
margin: cassettes A2 through A4 - smaller nodule; cassette A5 - larger nodule.
with deep margin: cassettes A6 through A8 - sections of the larger nodule:

cassettes A9 and A10 — sections away from the two nodules from part A;
cassettes 81 through B4 - entire B portion.

==== MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: ===-=--=---==~

A/APC & B. Sections of part A are examined on ten slides. A1 through A10.
Sections of part B represents section examined on four slides BI and 32.
Multiple sections of the liver show a background of cirrhosis characterized by
anastomosing bands of fibrous tissue with regenerating nodules. Tissue shows
two separateandules of hepatocellular carcinoma. There are areas with
trabecular pattern. as well as glandular and small cell pattern. Also present
are congested blood vessels. The tumors are subcapsular. The overall
sections of the margin on slides Bl through 84 show no tumor.
