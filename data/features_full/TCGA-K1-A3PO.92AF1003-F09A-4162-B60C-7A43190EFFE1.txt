COMMENT:

The tumor is composed of monomorphic spindle cells with ooelnophlllc cytoplasm . cigar-shaped nuclei and stippled
chromatin. perlnuclear vacuoloo. The spindle cello are arranged In both a vague otoritorm pattern and In short bundles.
Mitosee are rare and difﬁcult to ﬁnd. There Is no necmlo. Cello are mingled with lyphocytoe. There are many areas
of myxotd change . Despite the relatively bland appearance tumor Intimate. in between nonnal smooth muscle

urothelium but does not disrupt it.

The tumor cells resemble smooth muscle cells. and tho InltIal Mops“ I) had ruvoelod strong
lmmunoposmvlty for deemln and actin and ckit and CD“ were negative. Whether the tumor Is primary in the urlnary
bladder or pelvic soft tissue may be a moot point, however the striking lnflltratlve pattern and myxold changes support
the diagnosis of a Ieiomyoearcoma.

Additional lmmunohiotochomlcai mine have been ordered and will be roportod in an addendum.
Addendum

lmmunostaine reveal the tumor is immunopositlve for Desmin and AMA and demonstrates less than 5% positivity with I087,
marker proliferation. The cytokeratln AE1I3 and 8-100 were negative. The positive. negative and internal controls are
appropriate. This supports the above diagnosis. u
