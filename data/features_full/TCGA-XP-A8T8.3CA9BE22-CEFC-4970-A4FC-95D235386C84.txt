ANATOMOPATHO LOGIC RESULT

MACROSCOPY

Received 3 vials, identified as follows:

- Vial 1 (Esophagus): Received in formalin, surgical specimen represented by the esophagus
and proximal stomach, previously opened at its greatest diameter, weighing 79 grams. The
esophagus measures 11.5 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm while the stomach measures 7.5 cm in length and 3.1
cm in diameter, lying stapled at its distal end. The outer surface of the esophagus is grayish and
rough without drilling or infiltration areas. lts wall is whitish and shows thickening in its middle
third, where is observed infiltrating and ulcerated mucosal lesion with 2.1 cm in length. The
lesion is 4.1 cm distant from closer surgical margin (distal). The stomach segment displays
brown and smooth serous. To the cuts, the mucosa is brown and wrinkled, without macroscopic
lesions. The dissection of the fat adjacent to the viscera shows nodular, gray and fibroelastic
structures, with higher measures ranging from 0.3 to 0.9 cm.

— Vial 2 (Lymph node): nodular, gray and fibroelastic structure, with smooth outer surface and
absence of macroscopic lesion to the cuts, measuring 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm.

- Vial 3 (Liver): brown tissue fragment, hardened and rectangular, measuring 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm.

MICROSCOPY
