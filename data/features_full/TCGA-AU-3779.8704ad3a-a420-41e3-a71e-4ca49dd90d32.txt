A. COLON, SIGMOID, RECTUM (RESECTION):
~ INFILTRATING WELL DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA ARISING IN A

TUBULOVILLOUS ADENOMA (4 CM)
H TUMOR IS LOCATED IN THE SIGMOID, AND EXTENDS THROUGH MUSCULARIS

PROPRIA TO SURROUNDING PERICOLONIC ADIPOSE TISSUE.

ﬂ TUMOR IS 3 CM FROM CLOSEST (OPENED) MUCOSAL MARGIN OF RESECTION,
EXTENDS T0 0.6 CM FROM CLOSEST SEROSAL (ANTI-MESENTERIC) SURFACE
AND THE MESENTERIC RADIAL MARGIN IS 3.5 CM.

~ SMOOTH MUSCLE PROLIFERATION IDENTIFIED IN SEROSAL ADHESIONS
CONSISTENT WITH PARTIAL MYOMECTOMY AS DESCRIBED INTRA—

OPERATIVELY.
— ADDITIONAL FINDINGS ARE NOTED IN NON-NEOPLASTIC MUCOSA INCLUDING

DIVERTICULAR DISEASE WITH RUPTURED DIVERTICULITIS AND
ASSOCIATED SOFT TISSUE INFLAMMATION AND FIBROSIS, AS WELL AS
INCIDENTAL HYPERPLASTIC POLYP (0.1 CM).

— ALL SURGICAL MARGINS AND TWENTY-ONE REGIONAL LYMPH NODES,

NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE: pT3 NO MX
