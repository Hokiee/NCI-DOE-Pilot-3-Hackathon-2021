INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
FSlA: BRAIN, LEFT PARIETAL LOBE (BIOPSY, FSlA): GLIOBLASTOMA

MULTIFORME.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
Three specimens are received labeled with the patient’s name and

hospital number.

1. “Left parietal brain lesion" is received unfixed for
intraoperative consultation with frozen section and is a 1.2 X
1.0 X 0.3 cm portion of mucoid, focally hemorrhagic tissue
Cytologic scrape and squash preparations are made, and a portion
of the specimen is submitted for frozen section. The remainder
of the cryoblock is submitted in cassette "FSlA" and the
remainder of the specimen is submitted in cassette ”1B".

2. "Left parietal brain lesion - permanent" is received in
formalin and is multiple fragments of cerebral cortex admixed
with mucoid, hemorrhagic tissue, 4.0 X 4.0 X 0.3 cm in
aggregate, submitted in toto in cassettes "2A" and “2B".

3. “Dura” is a portion of tan, glistening dura mater, 2.5 X 2.5
X 0.1 cm, with no mass lesion identified. The specimen is

GROSS DESCRIPTION (continued):

serially sectioned and submitted in toto in cassettes "3A" and
"3B" .

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: ’
Sections show an abnormal population of pleomorphic, poorly

differentiated cells arranged in broad sheets and fascicles within
the brain parenchyma. The malignant cells are characterized by
pleomorphic, anaplastic nuclei with dense, hyperchromatic chromatin
and occasionally discernable nucleoli and variable amounts of
eosinophilic, often spindled cytoplasm. Many bizarre forms are
present which appear as giant, multinucleated cells. In cytologic
preparations, scattered cells show poorly- formed cells processes.
Numerous abnormal mitotic figures are present. Although broad
areas of necrosis are seen, significant endothelial changes are not
identified. Many malignant cells display eosinophilic
proteinaceous cytoplasmic globules. Brown pigment deposition is
also present. Spec1al stains are performed which show the

following:

Prussian blue iron stain Positive in brown pigment

Fontana—Masson melanin stain Negative

GFAP Focally positive in neoplastic
cells

AEl-AEB cytokeratin stain Negative

Mela-A Negative

HMS—45 Negative

3-100 Focally positive in neoplastic
cells

Focally positive

Desmin
Neurofilament Focally positive
Synaptophysin Negative

The pathologist has reviewed and interpreted the case with the
fellow/resident.

DIAGNOSIS

BRAIN, LEFT PARIETAL LESION (BIOPSY, FSlA): POORLY DIFFERENTIATED
MALIGNANT NEOPLASM (SEE COMMENT).

BRAIN, LEFT PARIETAL LESION (BIOPSY): POORLY DIFFERENTIATED
MALIGNANT NEOPLASM.

DURA (BIOPSY): DURA WITH ATTACHED POORLY DIFFERENTIATED MALIGNANT
NEOPLASM.

COMMENT:

Most areas of this malignant tumor show no evidence of
differentiation in immunoperoxidase stains. Melanocytic
differentiation is seen in one of three melanoma stains (HMS—45).
Rare focal positive staining is also seen for GFAP,neurofilament
and desmin. These findings, taken together with the somewhat
glial appearance of this tumor, saggest that this may be a
primitive neuroectodermal tumor or glioblastoma with divergent
differentiation. A malignant melanoma, either primary or
metastatic, can not be ruled out. ‘
