GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1) SOURCE: Nerve, Right Mental Margin

Received fresh for frozen section labeled "right mental nerve margin" are
fragments of soft tissue measuring 0.3 x 0.4 cm in aggregate. The specimen
is entirely submitted for frozen section.

Summary of sections: 1AFSC, 2/1.

2) SOURCE: Right Anterior Gingiva Margin

Received fresh labeled "right anterior gingiva margin" is a strip of
pink-tan soft tissue measuring 0.9 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is entirely
submitted for frozen section.

Summary of sections: 2AFSC, 1/ 1.

3) SOURCE: Right Buccal Margin

Received fresh labeled "right buccal margin" is a pink-tan strip of soft
tissue measuring 7.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted for
frozen section.

Summary of sections: 3AFSC, 1/ 1.

4) SOURCE: Palate, Right Margin

Received fresh labeled "right palate margin" is a pink-tan strip of soft
tissue measuring 4.8 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted for
frozen section.

Summary of sections: 4AFSC, 1/ 1.

5) SOURCE: Pharynx, Right Margin

Received fresh labeled "right pharyngeal margin" is a strip of pink-tan
soft tissue measuring 4.1 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely
submitted for frozen section.

Summary of sections: 5AFSC, 1/ 1.

6) SOURCE: Mouth, Right Floor Of, Margin

Received fresh labeled "right ﬂoor of mouth margin" is a strip of pink-tan
soft tissue measuring 3.9 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted
entirely for frozen section.

Summary of sections: 6AFSC, 1/ 1.

7) SOURCE: Tongue, Right Margin

Received fresh labeled "right tongue margin" are fragments of pink-tan soft
tissue measuring from 0.4 to 3.1 cm.

Summary of sections: 7AFSC, 3/ 1; 7BFSC, 3/ 1.

8) SOURCE: Right Mandibular Gingival

Received fresh labeled "right mandibular gingival cancer-stitch=anterior
(perm)" is an oriented piece of oral mucosa with a central mass. The

specimen is oriented with a stitch at the anterior side so it is inked in

the following fashion: anterior-orange, posterior-black, inferior-green,
superior-gingival mucosa itself, medial-red, lateral-blue. The specimen
measures 5.5 x 3.5 x 2.2 cm. There is a discrete fungating mass in the

center of the specimen that measures 3.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is
sectioned from anterior to posterior. Deep to the mass the tissue is soft

and light tan. In the middle of the lesion there is a nodule that is white

and measures 0.3 cm in circumference. This ill-defined mass does not have a
clear border but does not appear to be involving the inferior margin

grossly. The specimen is sectioned from anterior to posterior and submitted
in its entirety.

Summary of sections: 8A, anterior end, 2/ 1; 8B-8C, normal mucosa, 1/1 each;
8D-8L, mass, 1/1 each; 8M-8N, normal mucosa, 1/1 each; 80, posterior end,
1/ 1.

9) SOURCE: Right Submandibular Gland

Received fresh labeled "right submandibular gland" is an unoriented tan
salivary gland measuring 4.5 x 2.6 x 1.1 cm. There are no masses visible
externally. The exterior is inked. The specimen is sectioned to reveal
homogenous tan parenchyma without any masses or lesions. Representative
sections are submitted.

Summary of sections: 9A-9C, 1/1 each.
