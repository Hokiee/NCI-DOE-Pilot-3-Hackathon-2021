Diagnosis: c73'ﬁ
A: Thyroid, total thyroidectomy Cati>éﬂh4J/53

Tumor histologic type: papillary thyroid carcinoma, multifocal

Tumor size: there are 2 nodules of carcinoma, right upper pole
2.5 cm in greatest dimension, right lower pole 1.7 cm in
greatest dimension

Tumor focality & laterality: multifocal, both tumors are in the
right thyroid

Tumor capsule: not present
Extent of invasion:

Capsular Invasion: not identified
Lymphovascular invasion: not identified
Blood vascular invasion: not identified
Extra thyroidal extension: not identified

Surgical margins: surgical margins free of tumor

Status of thyroid gland away from tumor: multinodular goiter
with extensive fibrosis and calcifciation

Lymph nodes: none present in specimen

Other significant findings: one parathyroid gland is present
(block Al), without pathologic abnormality

AJCC Pathologic TNM Stage: pT2 pNx

NOTE: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information
available at the time of this report, and is subject to change
pending clinical review and additional information.

Clinical History:
-year—old with thyroid cancer.

Gross Description:

Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally
labeled "total thyroid, stitch left superior pole"

Specimen fixation: formalin
Type of specimen: total thyroidectomy

Size and weight of specimen: 35.4 gm, 6.5 x 2.8 x 2.5 cm right
lobe, 6.3 x 3.0 x 1.3 cm left lobe and isthmus

Orientation: Suture: left superior pole
Inking: anterior=b1ue, posterior=black, isthmus=yellow

Tumor location: right superior pole and right inferior pole
Focality: multifocal
Dominant tumor: present, right superior pole

Tumor description: The tumors are well circumscribed, solid,
fleshy, friable and pink/tan nodules.

Tumor size: The dominate tumor nodule in the right upper pole is
2.5 x 2.2 x 2.1 cm, and in the right lower pole is 1.7 x 1.3 x
1.0 cm.

Confinement / non-confinement: appears confined
Distance of tumor to capsule/inked surgical margins: Each tumor
nodule is within 0.1 cm of the blue inked anterior margin, and

0.1 cm of the black inked posterior margin.

Appearance of thyroid gland away from tumor: dark red/brown and
homogeneous

Other findings: Adjacent to the smaller nodule in the right
lower lobe is a 3.1 x 1.9 x 1.7 cm variegated fibrotic nodule
which is well circumscribed and has a dark red/brown colloid cut
surface. It is located 0.5 cm inferior to the dominate nodule
and 0.2 cm from the smaller nodule.

Parathyroids: not grossly seen

Lymph nodes: n/a

Tissue submitted for special investigations: tumor and normal
are given to Tissue Procurement

Digital photograph taken: no

Block Summary: (Inking: anterior=blue, posterior=black,
isthmus=yellow)

Al—A3 — representative sections from left lobe, superior towards
inferior, respectively (A3 contains small nodule in left lower

lobe)

A4—A6 — dominate nodule, right upper lobe
A7—A8 — smaller nodule, right lower lobe

A9—A10 - nodule with fibrous capsule, right lower lobe
