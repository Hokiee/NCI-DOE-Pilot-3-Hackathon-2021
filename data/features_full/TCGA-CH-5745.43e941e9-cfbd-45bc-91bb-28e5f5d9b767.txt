Diagnosis

1. Predominantly poorly differentiated bilateral multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate with
growth extending across the organ (Gleason 446:7, Gleason 4: 70%). Max. tumor diameter

1.6 cm. Tumor inﬁltration of periprostatie fatty tissue in the right rectolateral region (invasion
front 1 mm, 0.2 mm max. depth) and the right anterior region (invasion front 2 mm, max.

0.1 mm depth). Extensive multifocal tumor involvement of perineural sheaths.

Tumor—free surgical preparation margins.

 

In addition, foci of a prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (high-grade PIN) and signs of '
myoglandular prostatie hyperpiasia. Focal metaplastie squamous epithelium of the
prostatic urethra.

Tumor-free, regular seminal vesicles and seminal ducts.

2. Right obdurator fossa lymph nodes: two tumor-free lymph nodes (00).

3. Left obdnrator fossa lymph nodes: three minor—free lymph nodes (0/3).

Summary tumor classification:
pT3a, max. tumor diameter 16 mm, Gleason 4+3=7 (Gleason 4: 70%), pNO (0/5), R0.

Remark
The Gleason 4 portion and the periprostatic fatty tissue invasion were already seen in the prior
punch biopsy.

Tumor tissue was identified in the region of the yellow—labeled artefactual preparation margins
(apex and anterior right). However, the blue and green—labeled surgical preparation margins are
tumor-free, so the tumor can be assumed to have been completely excised.

Follow-up report

Microscopy
Immunohistoiogy: CD31, D240, 2 blocks

Communicated tumor classification:
p’I‘3a, maximum tumor diameter 16 mm, Gleason 4+3=7 (Gleason 4: 70%), pNG (05), R0.

lmmunohistochemieal investigation of two representative tumor blocks showed no evidence of
tumorous vessel invasion.

Summary tumor classiﬁcation:
pT3a, maximum tumor diameter 16 mm, Gleason 4+3:7 (Gleason 4: 70%), LO/VO, pNO (ll/'5),
R0.
