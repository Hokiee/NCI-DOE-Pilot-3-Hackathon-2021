Microscopic

The neoplastic cells demonstrate variably strong GFAP positivity. The granular
cytoplasm is also reactive, although often weaker than in other areas. The
granules are positive for both PAS and PAS with diastase consistent with
lysosommal origin, as was expected in agranular astrocytoma. Numerous MlB-1
reactive cells are present and a labeling index of 33% is calculated

Diagnosis

Granular cell subtype
