I

- Lymphovascular space invasion is present

Comment:
lthough the gross description mentions Mass A and Mass B, histologic sections of intervening tissue shows patchy
involvement by ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive ductal carcinoma. Mass A and Mass B are therefore regarded as a
single mass with 3 largest measurement of 3.7 cm (stage pT2). Multiple additional smaller foci of invasive carcinoma are
present, which are greater than grossly distinct from the large mass, including one nodule of invasive carcinoma
identiﬁed in a separate (lower outer) quadrant (multifocal and multicentric disease).

  

Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis:
A frozen section was requested by Dr.

FSA1: Sentinel lymph node #1, right axilla, sentinel node biopsy
- Positive for metastatic carcinoma.

Frozen Section Pathologist:

Clinical History:
with right breast IDC, well differentiated, undergoing lumpectomy with axillary node dissection.

Gross Description:
Received are six appropriately labeled containers.

Igontainer A is additionally labeled "right sentinel node #1." It holds a 6 x 3 x 1.4 cm fragment of red/tan fibrofatty tissue
containing a 5 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm lymph node candidate from which two representative sections are frozen as FSA1. The
remaining lymph node tissue is submitted in blocks A1-A4. Fat remains in formalin.

Container B is additionally labeled "right axillary palpable node." It holds a 4.5 x 4.0 x 1.2 cm red/tan fibrofatty tissue
fragment containing three lymph node candidates measuring 3.5 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm, 0.6 cm and 0.4 cm. The two smaller
lymph node candidates are submitted in block Bl. The largest lymph node candidate is sectioned and submitted in
blocks 32 and B3. Fat remains in formalin.

Container C is additionally labeled "right posterior margin, clip posterior." It holds a 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm markedly
cauterized fragment of yellow/gray fibromuscular tissue and fat. There is a clip present on one surface which is
inked blue and the opposite surface is inked black. The specimen is sectioned and entirely submitted in blocks C1-C2,
Container D is additionally labeled "right total mastectomy, stitch marks axillary tail."

Specimen fixation: formalin

Time in fixative: 9 hours

 
 

ype of mastectomy: total mastectomy

Weight of specimen: 900 grams

Size of specimen: 26.6 x 21.2 x 6.3 cm

 

Orientation of specimen: Anterior=blue, posterior=black, axillary tail=yellow
Skin ellipse dimensions: 22.6 x 9.1 cm

Nipple/areola: 1.7/5.0 cm

Axillary tail: submitted separately

Biopsy site: not identified

Discrete Mass(es): present

Number of discrete masses: two (designated A and B)

Size of mass (es)/biopsy site: Mass A: 1.8 x 1.3 x 1.1 cm
Mass B: 1.1 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm

Location of mass(es): Mass A: upper outer quadrant
( l “55"” _.,,—.~_.__ ,1. "“"

Mass B: The mass is located 1.8 cm posterior and inferior to the lateral edge of Mass A. (3

Distance of mass/biopsy site from surgical margin: Mass A: The mass is located 3.3 cm from the black inked deep margin,
1.5 cm from the closest blue inked soft tissue margin, 11 cm from the medial margin, and 10 cm from the lateral margin.

Mass B: The mass is located 0.8 cm from the black inked posterior margin, 4 cm from the closest blue
inked anterior margin.

Gross involvement of skin or fascia/muscle by tumor: absent

Description of remaining breast: composed of dense and nodular white/tan fibroconnective tissue encompassing the
mass; this is most prominent in the central/subareolar portion of the breast where there is dense blue dye staining

The breast tissue between Mass A and Mass B is firm and hemorrhagic with fat necrosis. Sections are
taken of the intervening parenchyma (D3 and D4). If Mass A and Mass B are contiguous, the overall measurements of
the lesion would be 3.7 x 3.1 x 3.0 cm.

Other remarkable features: There is a small amount of soft tissue hemorrhage and fat necrosis along the superior lateral
edge of the mass. Multiple 0.3 0.4 cm ﬁrm nodules are identified radiating from the main mass towards the
medial aspect of the breast. These are extensively sampled.
