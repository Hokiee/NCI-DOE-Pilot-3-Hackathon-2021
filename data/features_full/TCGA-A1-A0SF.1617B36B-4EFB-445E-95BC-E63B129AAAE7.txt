Pagetoid spread of carcinoma is seen in benign ducts adjacent to the tumor. No such spread is seen away
from the tumor.

Atypical lobular hyperplasia is present in the contralateral (right) breast.

An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as for HER2 was performed
on block C3.

The test for estrogen receptors is positve. There is moderate nuclear staining in >95% of tumor cells.
Internal positive control is positive.

The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is moderate to strong nuclear staining in 90% of
tumor cells. Internal positive control is positive.

Result of HER2/ neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2/neu oncoprotein over—expression.

An immunohistochemical assay was performed using the CBII monoclonal antibody to HER2/neu
oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3 (HER2 test interpreted by
Dr.

Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or I are considered negative for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein.

Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered borderline. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with staining
intensity scores of 2 do not show gene ampliﬁcation. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore submitted for
FISH testing. The results of the FISH. test are issued directly from the molecular cytogeneties laboratory.

 

Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotcin. Tumors in this
category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemicel and FISH testing, and almost always show gene
ampliﬁcation.

year-old woman with left breast cancer. She undergoes bilateral mastectomies.

The specimen is received in ten parts, each labeled with the patient's name and unit number. Parts A
through I are received fresh. and Part J is received in formalin.

PartA, add1t1onally labeled '1

consists of one pink, unoriented,

ﬁbroadipose tissue fragment measuring 1.5 x 0. 8 x 0 8 cm. The entire specimen is frozen for frozen
section diagnosis 1, and subsequently submitted in cassette A1.

Part B, additionally labeled

consists of one pink-red, unoriented,

ﬁbroadipose tissue fragment measuring 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm. The entire specimen is frozen for frozen
section diagnosis 2, and subsequently submitted in cassette Bl.

Part C is additionally labeled "

It consists of a mastectomy specimen, measuring

15. 8 cm from superior to inferior, 15.6 cm from medial to lateral, and 8. 2 cm from anterior to posterior
The specimen weighs 442.5 gm. In the lateral aspect of the specimen is a Spiculated, ﬁrm, tan mass,
measuring 2.4 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm. This mass is 2.0 cm from the deep margin, 5.5 cm from the superior
margin, >6 cm from the inferior margin, 2.8 cm from the lateral margin, and >6 cm from the medial
margin. In the anterior-inferior portion of the breast, there are dilated ducts, ﬁlled with cheesy material.
This area is 0.2 cm from the deep margin. The remainder of the breast parenchyma is unremarkable. Two
pieces of tumor are banked, one for tissue banking and one for the epithelial cell study. Representative
sections are submitted as follows:

it consists of a mastectomy specimen, measuring

18.2 cm from superior to inferior, 16.2 cm from medial to lateral, and 4.8 cm from anterior to posterior.
The specimen weighs 688 gm. A short stitch is designated by the surgeon as superior, and a long stitch is
designated by the surgeon as lateral. In the inferior-medial portion of the specimen is a fragment of skin,
measuring 7.5 x 4.9 cm. It is white and unremarkable. There is a nipple, measuring 1.3 x 1.5 x 1.6 cm.
The specimen is notable for dilated ducts with a viscous, yellow-tan material within them. This material
extends into one of the nipple ducts. No masses are noted, nor are any areas suspicious for DCIS
appreciated. The anterior-superior portion of the specimen is inked blue, the anterior-inferior portion of
the specimen is inked green, and the posterior aspect of the specimen is inked black. Multiple sections of
unremarkable breast parenchyma are taken for two studies, including a high-risk study and an epithelial
cell study. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
