Gross Description:

A. Part A lung, right upper lobe. Initially received in a fresh state for frozen section analysis is a 155 gram
lobe of lung, 17.0 x 11.7 x 3.2 cm. The pleura is glistening light tan to deep purple-red with moderate
anthracotic pigmentation. The bronchial margin extends up to 0.6 cm, and 2.3 cm in diameter, closed by
numerous surgical staples which is now removed to demonstrate bronchial pathways grossly free of tumor
involvement. Anteriorly the pleura demonstrates a dimpled appearance and upon sectioning reveals a

well circumscribed, irregular dense light gray tumor mass, 2.3 x 2.1 x 1.9 cm, grossly approaching within
3.7 cm of the bronchial margin. The bronchial margin is trimmed and submitted for frozen section

analysis, with residual frozen tissue submitted in A1 for permanent sections. Examination of the adjacent
lobar tracts do not demonstrate gross tumor involvement. Sectioning through the remainder of the lobe
demonstrates consolidated, "wet" pink and gray-red lung parenchyma, without additional discrete

nodularity. No grossly distinct lymph node tissue appreciated. Representative sections are submitted for
microscopic evaluation.

Cassette summary: A1) bronchial margin, frozen section. A2-A4) tumor mass anterior pleura represented,
ﬁve pieces, A5) pulmonary vascular margins trimmed and submitted, A6) representation of grossly

uninvolved lung-

B. Part B designated N10R. Received in formalin is light pink to speckled gray anthracotic lymph node
candidate, 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted intact in B1 .-

C. Part C designated N10R #2. Received in formalin is a light pink to speckled gray anthracotic lymph
node candidate fragment, 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. The fragment is submitted in its entirety, intact in C1 .-

 

D. Part D designated N10R #3. Received in formalin is a light pink to speckled gray anthracotic lymph
node candidate. 0.7 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. The lymph node is submitted intact in D1. -

 

E. Part E designated N1 1 R. Received in formalin is a light pink to speckled gray anthracotic lymph node
candidate, 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is bisected and submitted in E1.

 

 

FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

F. Part F designated N4R. Received in formalin are multiple lobular and tattered fragments of light pink to
speckled gray anthracotic lymph node tissue, measuring in aggregate of 2.3 x 2.0 x 0.4 cm. Examination

reveals up to ﬁve lymph node candidates ranging from 0.3 - 0.6 cm. Entirely submitted for microscopic
evaluation.

Cassette summary: F1) three tattered lymph node candidates/fragments, F2) two lymph node
candidates/fragments.-

G. Part G designated N7. Received in formalin are two light pink to speckled gray anthracotic lymph node

candidates/fragments, 0.5 and 1.1 cm each. Tissue is entirely submitted for microscopic evaluation in G1
and G2, one bisected node each. -

 

Microscopic Description:

A. Sections demonstrate lung tissue, containing an inﬁltrating neoplasm, composed of large polygonal
cells with clear, amphophilic, to eosinophilic cytoplasm, large vesicular nuclei, with prominent nucleoli.
Individual cell necrosis is present. Rare atypical mitoses are seen. Neutrophils are present in intimate
association with tumor cells in some areas. Immunohistochemlcal studies are performed on the tumor. The
neoplastic cells show strong and diffuse positivity for CKT, and Moo-31. ER shows focal weak nuclear
staining. Rare cells show positive staining for mammoglobin and Napsin—A. Rare tumor cells are positive
for TTF-1. CK20, CK5/6. p63. S100, Melan-A, GCDFP-15, and villin immunostains are negative. D2-40
and 0031 conﬁrm the presence of extensive lymphovascular invasion. All staining controls are
appropriately reactive. The pattern of immunoreactivity is most compatible with adenocarcinoma. Focal
TTF-1 staining suggests primary lung origin.

B. Sections demonstrate one benign lymph node with anthracotic pigment laden macrophages. negative
for metastasis.

C. Sections demonstrate one benign lymph node with anthracotic pigment laden macrophages, negative
for metastasis.

D. Sections demonstrate one benign lymph node with anthracotic pigment laden macrophages, negative
for metastasis.

E. Sections demonstrate one benign lymph node with anthracotic pigment laden macrophages, negative
for metastasis.

F. Sections demonstrate lymphoid tissue, with anthracotic pigment laden macrophages, negative for
metastatic carcinoma.

G. Sections demonstrate lymphoid tissue, with anthracotic pigment laden macrophages, negative for
metastatic carcinoma.
