Malignant neoplasm corpus uteri, 182.0.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Uterus, cervix, right and left ovary and tubes (AF1)". Received fresh for
frozen section is a 734 gram, 10.5 x 13.5 x 14.5 cm hysterectomy specimen with
bilateral attached fallopian tubes and ovaries. The serosal surface is
discolored white and has pale plaque-like lesions that are focally
hemorrhagic. Sectioning reveals an endometrial cavity that is grossly
distorted by an infiltrating white mass with irregular borders that extends
through the full thickness of the myometrium to the serosal surface. This mass
measures approximately 10 x 7 x 4 cm. A representative section from the serosa
is frozen as AFl and the frozen section remnant is transferred to block Al.
The tumor extends to within 1 cm of the lower uterine segment but does not
appear to involve the lower uterine segment or the cervix. There are two
intramural leiomyomas (up to 2 cm). The tumor displays an endophytic growth
but protrudes into the uterine cavity (1 x l x 1 cm) and has areas of focal
necrosis (up to 1 cm). The left fallopian tube (5 x 1 cm) contains a
pedunculated paratubal cyst. The left ovary (3 x 3 x 2 cm) also contains a
cyst (1 x 1 x 1 cm) that extrudes watery material upon sectioning. The right
fallopian tube (6 x 1 cm) has focal hemorrhagic adhesions. The right ovary
(1.5 x 1 x 0.5 cm) also has focal hemorrhagic adhesions and is otherwise
unremarkable.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

. . Al- frozen section remnant.

' A2- anterior cervix.
A3— anterior lower uterine segment.
A4- posterior cervix.
AS- posterior lower uterine segment.
A6- tumor with exophytic growth.
A7- tumor with necrosis.
A8— tumor with serosa (inked blue, region of frozen section).
A9- full thickness anterior endomyometrium with tumor.
Alo- full thickness posterior endomyometrium with myometrium with tumor.
All- leiomyoma.
A12- right fallopian tube and ovary.
A13— left fallopian tube and ovary.
A14- tumor with questionable calcifications, not grossly visible.

 

B. "Left gutter biopsy (BF1)", received fresh and fixed in formalin is a 1.5 x
0.5 x 0.3 cm fragment of tissue that is bisected and submitted in its entirety
in block Bl.

C. "Left pelvic lymph node (CF1)", received fresh and fixed in formalin is an
8 x 3 x 2 cm aggregate of fibrofatty tissue. This aggregate contains one lymph
node measuring 4 x 3 x 2 cm that on cut section is replaced by a white
necrotic mass. A representative section is submitted in block C1. Additional
lymph node candidate is submitted as follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY:
c2— three lymph node candidates, one bisected, inked blue.
,., C3- four lymph node candidates (up to 1 cm).
. C4- four lymph node candidates ( up to 1 cm).

D. "Right pelvic lymph node". Received fresh and fixed in formalin. Received

rage 4 01 J

fiesh and fixed in formalin ig a 2 x 2 x 1 cm aggregate of fibrofatty tissue
that contains a 2 x 2 x 1 cm lymph node candidate that on cut section is
infiltrated with white necrotic mass. Representative section in block Dl.

Additional lymph node candidates are submitted as follows: . ;

D2— three lymph node candidates.
D3- two lymph node candidates.
D4— two lymph node candidates.

E. "Omentum". Received fresh and fixed in formalin is a 17 x 2 x 1 cm piece of
omentum. Sectioning reveals focal hemorrhage but no mass lesions.
Representative sections are submitted in blocks El-EZ.

F. "sigmoid mesenteric biopsy". Received fresh and fixed in formalin is a 1 x
0.2 x 0.3 cm piece of mesentery that is bisected and submitted entirely in
block Fl.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
A. "Uterus, cervix, right and left ovary": AFl (representative serosal surface
with gross tumor)- poorly differentiated carcinoma involving serosal surface

(Dr.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE: '
PROCEDURE: Hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, bilateral lymph node
dissection, omentectomy, biopsy.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 6th Edition): pT3a le pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

COMMENT:

The tumor is very poorly differentiated, with a completely solid, sheet-like
growth pattern and no significant glandular, papillary, or squamous
diffexentiation- Because it 5119315.PE£29.?i-§}9..,.Qi§f.9£¢9F.i€Ei-QEI it is
classified as an undifferentiated carcinoma.‘
