DIAGNOSIS

(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA; GLEASON SCORE 9 (4+5). (SEE COMMENT).
EXTENSIVE MULTIFOCAL EXTRAPROSTATIC EXTENSION PRESENT.
CARCINOMA INVOLVING RIGHT SEMINAL VESICLE.
Margins of resection free of tumor.
Left seminal vesicle and segments of vasa deferentia. no tumor present.
PERINEURAL AND LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION PRESENT.

COMMENT

The prostate gland contains two foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, one in the peripheral zone and one in the transition zone. The
dominant tumor focus is located in the left anterolateral, left anterior, mid-anterior, right anterior, right anterolateral. right lateral,
right posterolateral, right posterior, mid-posterior, left posterior and left posterolateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures
3.0 x 2.5 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the three cross-sections of the prostate and extensively in
the apex and base. This tumor focus exhibits extensive multifocal extraprostatic extension. Extraprostatic extension is present in
the posterior apex, right posterolateral surface of the prostate, right superior neurovascular bundle region and in the base in the
region anterior to the seminal vesicles. The tumor invades the right seminal vesicle including intra and extraprostatic portions.
The margins of resection are free of tumor. The second tumor is located in the left transition zone. This tumor focus measures
0.6 x 0.5 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in two cross-sections. This tumor focus is of lower histologic
grade and conﬁned to the prostate. All margins of resection are free of tumor.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) PROSTATE. SEMINAL VESICLES — A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and attached
segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (6.5 x 4.0 x 6.0 cm, 58.0 grams, post-ﬁxation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
right posterolateral aspect of the prostate is abundant and more extensive than along the left side. A nodule is palpated on the right
side of the prostate. Serial cross-sections demonstrate an area of tumor involving the right lateral, right posterolateral peripheral
zone with extension into extraprostatic tissue involving the three cross-sections of the prostate.

. The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.
Also included In the container is a detached fragment of tissue measuring 2.2 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm.
SECTION CODE: A1, detached fragment of tissue; A2-A5, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base
towards the tip; A6—A8, left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; A9—A10, prostatic base,
right border; A11-A19, prostatic base, right posterior border; A20-A27, prostatic base, central portion; A28-A29,
prostatic base, left border; A30-A33, prostatic base, left posterior border; A34-A36, apex anterior; A37—A39, apex left; A40-A44,

apex posterior; A45-A47, apex right; A48, detached portions of margin of resection according to the specimen radiograph;
A49-A62, sections of the three cross-sections of the prostate according to the specimen radiograph.

The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red. right surface in yellow and posterior surface in
black. Orange ink (A51, 58, 61 and 62) denotes surfaces that do not represent the true margin of resection.
