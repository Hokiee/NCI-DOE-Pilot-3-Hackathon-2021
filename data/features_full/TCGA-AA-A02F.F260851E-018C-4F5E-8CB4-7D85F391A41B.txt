Diagnosis:

The material in I is a partial resection of small intestine with reactive lesions,

The material in II is a preparation of the rectosigmoid colon (in clinical terms attributable
to the rectum or the sigmoid colon) with a poorly differentiated carcinoma in the area of the
rectosigmoid junction (G3), with inﬁltration of blood and lymph vessels (Ll, V1) and a
lymph node metastasis (le).

Locally, the lesion was completely removed.

The distance from the mesorectal fascia was at least 1 cm.

The overall clinical ﬁndings and the topography should serve to determine whether this is a
rectal carcinoma in the narrower sense of the term or a carcinoma of the sigmoid colon.
