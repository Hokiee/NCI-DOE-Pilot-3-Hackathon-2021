A. Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and "right kidney mass" is a 2.8 x 2.2 x 2.1 cm partial nephrectomy specimen.
The parenchymal resection margin is pink—black. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 2.6 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm white—tan soft
well-circumscribed mass. Grossly the mass is less than 1 mm from the inked resection margin. Grossly the uninvolved renal
parenchyma is tan—brown and unremarkable. Representative section of the mass to the resection margin are submitted in

cassette A1 FS. A piece of the tumor is submitted to tissue bank. The remainder of the specimen is entirely submitted in
cassettes A2-A6.

WW
A1 FS, kidney, "right kidney mass":
Papillary renal cell carcinoma; the parenchymal resection margin is negative (less than 0.5 mm from the tumor).
