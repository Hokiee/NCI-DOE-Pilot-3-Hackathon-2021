2) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled
"Non—sentinel Right Axilla'. It consists of a 1.8 Cm lymph node, sectioned
and entirely submitted.

Summary of Sections:
FSCA - frozen section control A
FSCB - frozen section control B

3) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Left Breast Segmental
Resection (short stitch superior, long stitch lateral)". It consists ot a
4.5 x 3.8 x 0.9 cm irregular fragment 0: fibroadipose tissue oriented with a
long suture for the lateal and a short suture for the superior aspect. The
specimen is inked with standard colors: anterior - yellow, posterior -
black, inferior - red and superior - blue. Serial sections reveal a mostly
fibrous appearance on cut surface with focal adipose areas. No gross
identifiable mass is seen. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely
submitted.

Summary of Sections:

LM - lateral margin

MM - medial margin

S serial sections from the lateral to medial aspect

areola. The ellipse of skin measures 8.5 x 6 cm with a centrally located
1.5 x 0.6 cm unremarkable nipple. In the same container, multiple fragments
of adipos tissue are labeled "Go With Breast“, measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 0.5

firm. fleshy. tan mess with relatively well—circumscribed borders, located
centrally, retroareolar, on the upper inner and lower inner quadrants, and
is located at 2.3 on from the deep margin. The uninvolved breast parenchyma
is yellow, lobular, mostly with focal areas o£ iibrosis. Representative
sections are submitted. The axillary tail is dissected and several possible
lymph nodes are submitted. A representative section is submitted for TPS.
