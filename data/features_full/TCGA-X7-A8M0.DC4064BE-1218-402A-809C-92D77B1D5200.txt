Gross Description:

The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "A. thymus"

and consists of an 18.5 x 10.0 x 4.0 cm portion of lobulated tan-yellow fatty
tissue, partially surfaced by mediastinal pleura. Present within the fat is a

3.0 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm firm, tan white well circumscribed mass. The cut surface of
the mass shows a tan-white fibrous capsule that ranges from 0.2 to 0.6 cm thick.
The center of the mass is tan-pink and soft with scattered hemorrhagic focl.
The mass abuts both the mediastinal pleura, as well as the inked soft tissue
margin. Scattered around the mass are multiple soft pink fragments of
questionable thymic tissue. One area of the mass appears to be infiltrating
into the adjacent soft tissue. Examination of the attached fat reveals a

tan-yellow lobulated cut surface. No additional masses are noted. Three lymph
nodes are identified.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:
1 mass to inked soft tissue margin;
2 mass to mediastinal pleura;
3 area mass infiltration into adjacent soft tissue;
4-5 additional mass;
6 questionable thymus tissue;
7 two whole lymph nodes;
8 one lymph node bisected.
9-14 additional tumor
