pNO I

Clinical History:
—year—old male with prostate cancer.

Gross Description:
Received are three appropriately labeled containers.

Container A is additionally labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes."
It consists of a 3.5 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm aggregate of fibrofatty soft
tissue fragments. Two lymph node candidates are identified
ranging in size from 1.0 cm to 1.5 cm in greatest

dimension.

Block summary:
A1,A2 — each contain one lymph node candidate, bisected
A3 - remaining fat,

Container B is additionally labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes."
It consists of a 3.0 x 3.0 x 1.2 cm aggregate of fibrofatty
adipose tissue. Six lymph node candidates are identified ranging
in size from 0.5 to 1.7 cm in greatest dimension.

Block summary:

Bl — one lymph node candidate, bisected
82 — two lymph node candidates

B3 — three lymph node candidates

B4 — remaining fat,
