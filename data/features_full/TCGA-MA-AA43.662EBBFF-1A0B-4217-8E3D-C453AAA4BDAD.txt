ADDENDUM- IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY

Interpretation

Immunohistochemical stains with appropriate controls were performed on block
A1 and A3. The poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma is positive for P63
and CK5/6(squamous markers). The adenocarcinoma is positive for CEA,
negative for ER and vimentin. Both tumors are strongly positive for P16.

The immuno— staining results support the original diagnosis: invasive
cervical adenocarcinoma and poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma.
