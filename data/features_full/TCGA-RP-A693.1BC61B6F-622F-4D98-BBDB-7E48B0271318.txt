Microscopic Description: 91A) 6/17} I 3

Sections demonstrate sheets and lobules of poorly differentiated epithelioid to spindled malignat cells.
These cells contain markedly atypical pleomorphic muclei and abundant eosinoplilic cytoplasm. Patchy
brown pigment deposition is epitheliomatous pattern. Scattered mitotic figures as well as foci of
necrosis and hemorrhage are noted. The tumor shows an expansive interface with the surrounding brain
parenchyma, which appears reactive. There is marked cautery artifact, precluding optimal evaluation.
