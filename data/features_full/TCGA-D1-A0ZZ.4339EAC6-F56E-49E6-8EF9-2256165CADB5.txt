DIAGNOSIS:
A. Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy: Endometrial
adenocarcinoma, mixed
dfendometriOid aha serous types, FIGO grade 3 (of 3) is
idenEified
within a polypoid mass in the posterior wall (1.2 x 0.6 x
0.6 cm).
The tumor invades 0.2 cm into the myometrium (total
myometrial

thickness, 1.8 cm). Multiple (2) sessile lesions on the
anterior

(1.9 cm in greatest dimension) and lateral (0.5 cm in
greatest

dimension) walls also show a mixed endometrioid and
serous

adenocarcinoma (FIGO grade 3 of 3), superficially invading
the

myometrium to a depth of 0.1 cm. A benign endometrial
polyp is

present. The tumors do not involve the endocervix. The
margins

are negative for tumor. The bilateral ovaries and
fallopian tubes

are unremarkable.

B. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(14) right
pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

C. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(12) left

pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

D. Lymph nodes, right para—aortic, biopsy: Multiple (5)
right
para- -aortic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

E. Gonadal vessels, right, excision: Negative for tumor.
F. Omentum, omentectomy: Benign adipose tissue.

G. Lymph node, left para—aortic lymph nodes, biopsy:
Multiple (6)
left para— aortic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

H. Gonadal vessels, left, excision: Negative for tumor.

This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic

examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation
of the

specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent
sections are

reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive
changes

identified on permanent section review will be reflected
in a

revised report.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled "uterus and bilateral
tubes/ovaries" is

an 80.0 gram uterus with attached bilateral tubes and
ovaries and

cervix. The uterine serosa is smooth. There is a 4.2 x
3.2 x 3.0

cm polypoid mass in the fundus of the endometrial cavity
which does

not grossly appear to invade into the myometrium. There
are no

leiomyomas. There is a 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm right ovary
with a smooth

outer surface and a solid cut surface with a 5.0 x 0.3 cm
right

fallopian tube. There is a (1.0x 0.6 x 0.5 cm) left ovary
with a

smooth outer surface and a solid cut surface with a 4.5 x
0.4 cm

left fallopian tube. Representative sections submitted.
Grossed by

B. Received fresh labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes" is a
9.0 x 6.0

x 1.3 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. All
lymphatic

tissue submitted.

C. Received fresh labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes" is a
9.0 x 4.0

x 1.0 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. All
lymphatic

tissue submitted.

D. Received fresh labeled "right para—aortic lymph nodes"
is a 3.0
x 2.0 x 1.5 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.

All
lymphatic tissue submitted.

E. Received fresh labeled "right gonadal vessel" is a 6.2
cm in
length by 0.4 cm in diameter portion of unremarkable blood

vessel.
A representative section is submitted.

F. Received fresh labeled "omentum" is a 27.0 x 14.0 x
1.4 cm

portion of omentum. No masses are identified grossly. A
lymph node

is identified. Representative sections are submitted.
Grossed by

G. Received fresh labeled "left para-aortic lymph nodes"
is a 4.1 x

4.0 x 1.2 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.
All

lymphatic tissue submitted.

H. Received fresh labeled "left gonadal vessels" is a 5.0
cm in

length by 1.3 cm in diameter portion of unremarkable blood
vessel.

A representative section is submitted.
