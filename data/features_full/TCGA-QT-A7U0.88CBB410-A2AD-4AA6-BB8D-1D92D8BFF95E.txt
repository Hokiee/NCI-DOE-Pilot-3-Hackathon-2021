Diagnosis: @Dy/ 4?

A: Retroperitoneal mass and right adrenal gland, resection
- Extra-adrenal sympathetic paraganglioma, maximum tumor size

3.3 cm, margins negative (See Comment).
— Benign adrenal gland.

Comment:

Special stains support the diagnosis. The neoplasm demonstrates
diffuse strong positivity for synaptophysin and chromogranin. S-
100 highlights an intact sustentacular cell network.

Clinical History:

The patient is a -year—old man with retroperitoneal
paraganglioma just caudal to the right adrenal gland.

Gross Description:

Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally
labeled "right

adrenal paraganglioma" is a 25 gram 6.4 x 5.7 x 2.2 cm overall
fragment of

un—oriented yellow/tan fibrofatty tissue is inked and sectioned
to reveal a 3.3

x 2.9 x 1.7 cm solid yellow/brown circumscribed nodule adjacent
to a 4.7 x 3.4 x

1.2 cm fragment of focally disrupted adrenal gland. The nodule
appears to abut

the adrenal gland but not arise from or invade into it.
Representative

sections are submitted in blocks Al—A6, tissue remains in
formalin.

Light Microscopy:
Light microscopic examination is performed by Dr.

Sections reveal a bland cellular neoplasm arising in the soft
tissue adjacent to the adrenal gland. The tumor is distinct and
separate from the adrenal gland. The tumor demonstrates a
histologic pattern typical of paraganglioma with a zellballen
morphology. Histologic features are low grade and do not
indicate definite malignant features.
