RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR CELL TYPE), FUHRMAN'S NUCLEAR GRADE 4.
TUMOR INVOLVING RENAL VEIN.
TUMOR MEASURES 6.0 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND - A left kidney (12.0 x 6.0 x 6.0 cm), a portion of left renal vein (4.0 cm in length),
portion of ureter (1 1 .0 cm in length), and portion of renal artery (1.0 cm in length). Also, received is a separate fragment of
ﬁbroadipose tissue (9.0 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm) that contains the adrenal gland (4.0 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm).

In the upper pole of the kidney is a Iobular bright-yellow mass (6.0 x 3.5 x 4.0 cm). The mass appears to be completely
surrounded by kidney parenchyma. It does not involve the perinephric adipose tissue. The tumor does extend into the renal sinus
and involves the renal vein within the hilum of the kidney. The tumor within the renal vein is located at 2.0 cm from the renal vein
margin. A portion of the tumor appears to be ﬁrm and white.

The uninvolved renal parenchyma, adrenal gland and the perinephric adipose tissue appear unremarkable.

A portion of tumor and normal kidney is submitted to the Tissue Bank. A portion of the tumor including the right fibrous
area is submitted for
