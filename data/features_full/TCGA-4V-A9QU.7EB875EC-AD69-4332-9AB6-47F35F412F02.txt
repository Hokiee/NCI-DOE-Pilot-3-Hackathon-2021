1A to 1| ) Tumour:

Microscopic examination :

The tumor has a lobulated appearance , separated by thick pads fibrosis. These
a biphasic tumor with epithelial quota fusiform aspect, together

in beamlets , in nests , sometimes in rosettes , surrounded by a second contingent fact
relatively regular lymphocytes. The tumor is poorly defined . lt infiltrates
several points the tumor capsule and has a few small nodules scattered

the single fat. In contrast, section slices labeled with ink

go into healthy tissue. Some tracks appear richer in cells

epithelial cells, with a smaller contingent lymphocytic yet always

present. Presence also some areas with clear perivascular spaces

(16 block).

After immunohistochemistry , epithelial cells express cytokeratin

KL1 and AE1/AE3 . Epithelial cells also express CD20. However, they

express neither the CD5 or CD117 . Accompanying lymphocytes express CBS and

CDla .

11 , 1K ) adjacent parenchyma thymic :

The adjacent parenchyma thymic involution has a fat marked .

2) innominate vein :
The samples examined correspond to large vascular structures lined with a

muscular wall and surrounded by fatty tissue. Presence also two small

lymph nodes.

Conclusion :

Thymoma 4 cm in diameter, in type AB , with minimal invasion of the capsule.
