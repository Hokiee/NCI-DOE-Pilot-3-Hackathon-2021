Gross Description
A. The specimen is received fresh labeled "right hemicolectomy" and consists of a right colon
received stapled at both ends. The specimen consists of a 4.0 cm in length, 3.5 cm in circumference
segment of small bowel continuous with a 14.0 cm in iength, 7.5 cm in circumference segment of
targe bowel, and an attached 5.0 cm in length. 0.4 cm in diameter vermiform appendix. in the
ascending colon is a 4.0 x 3.5 x 2.2 cm pedunculated polypoid mass. The mass is 3.7 cm from the
ileocecal valve. 8.5 cm from the distal margin. The mass extends approximately 0.2 cm in the
submucosa but does not extend through the bowel wall. The mass is 6.5 cm from the radial soft
tissue margin. The mass does not involve the surrounding serose. There are 2 additionai
broad-based, sessile polypoid tesions, which are 0.3 and 0.9 cm in greatest dimension. The
remaining mucosa has normat tan folds. The wall averages 0.3 cm in thickness. There is an
abundant amount of surrounding adipose tissue. The proximal margin is sectioned tangentially, frozen
and entirely submitted in FSA'L The distal margin is sectioned tangentiatly, frozen and entirely
submitted in FSA2. Additional representative sections are submitted as follows:
