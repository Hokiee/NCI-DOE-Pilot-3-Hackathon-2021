ReceIVed _ It”: ‘3’" ﬁnLd @Mrm] 6/4141,

SPECIMEN TYPE: Adrenal 90/3 1/55/13

CLINICAL NOTES:
Non-functional left adrenal tumour.

MACROSCOPlCz

“Left adrenal gland". The specimen consists of an adrenal gland, 504 g and 110
x 1 it) x 85 mm. The adrenal gland is largely replawd by a 100mm tumour. The
tumour is multlnodular and has a variable cut surface with solid tan iobules,
yellow/orange areas, and areas of haemorrhage. cystic change and necrosis. The
tumour appears at least partially encapsulated and there Is no macroscopic
evidence oi' invasion. A small amount of uninvolved adrenal is identiﬁed at the
eeriphery oi the tumour.

Ai/Az- Tumour with adjacent uninvolved adrenal gland.

r13 - A6: Central tumour.

A7 - A10: Tumour with overlying capsule.

MlCHOSCOPiC:

The left adrenal tumour is an adrenal cortical carcinoma (Weiss criteria). The
tumour is composed of polygonal cells showing a predominantly diffuse,
sheeHike growth pattern with areas of myxoid degeneration which are divided
in areas by fibrous septa. The cells have abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm with
a few scattered clear cells present. The nuclei are enlarged and pleomorphic
with coarse chromatin and prominent nucleoli. Mitoses are readily identiﬁed

(1 3/50hpf}, including atypical forms, and there are broad areas of necrosis and
haemorrhage. No vascular invasion is identiﬁed. While the tumour does extend
to the adrenal capsule it appears to be confined to the adrenal gland and local
excision is complete.

immunohisiochemisiry shows positive staining for inhibin, calretinin and Melon
A and negative staining for chromogranin.

The morphological ieatures and immunohistochemical profile are in keeping with
an adrenal cortical carcinoma.

SUMMARY:
Left adrenal gland: Adrenal cortical carcinomma.
STAGE: ll (pT2 NX MX). (AJCC Staging}7m Edition)

ADDlTlONAL REPORT

The tumour has a Weiss score of 5.
