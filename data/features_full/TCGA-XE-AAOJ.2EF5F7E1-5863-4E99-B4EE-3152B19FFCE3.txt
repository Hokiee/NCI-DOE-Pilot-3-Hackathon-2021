1. MIXED GERM CELL TUMOR, UNIFOCAL (LARGEST FRAGMENT 9 CM). 50%
YOLK SAC, 40 % IMMATURE AND MATURE TERATOMA, 10% SEMINOMA,
left testis and spermatic cord, left radical orchiectomy (see
note) ‘

Note: Because of the fragmentation of the specimen, evaluation of
margins cannot be ascertained. The seminoma component is c-kit and PLAP
positive and CAM.5.2 keratin stain negative. The yolk sac tumor is
keratin and AFP strongly positive. CD30_is non—contributory. These
findings support the above diagnosis.

Acct#:

One specimen received, fixed in formalin, labeled with the
patient's name, medical record number, and "left testis and
spermatic cord." It consists of a fragmented specimen consisting
of the spermatic cord, epididymis, fragments of testis
parenchyma. Because this specimen is received fragmented. the
exterior is not inked. The entire specimen weighs 150 gm. The
spermatic cord is'8 cm in length x 1.3 cm in diameter. The,
epididymis is 3.5 x 2 x 0.5 cm. The main specimen measures 9 x
6.5 x 3 cm in aggregate and is white—pink soft tissue with focal
areas of cystic spaces.

SUMMARY OF CASSETTES:
1. Spermatic cord margin.
2.7 Tumor. '
8. Dense fibrous tissue.
9. epididymis
10-11 Additional sections of spermatic cord R11.
