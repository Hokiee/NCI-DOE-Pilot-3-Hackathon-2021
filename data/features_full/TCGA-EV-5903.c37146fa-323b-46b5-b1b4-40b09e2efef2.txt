B. KIDNEY - 2. Left renal mass.

     

   

CLINICAL INFORMATION
Left renal mass. History: Livertransplant

GROSS DESCRIPTION
The specimen is received in two parts, both labeled with the patient‘s name

Part A is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis additionally labeled “base of left renal mass” and
consists of a 0.4 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm ink-tan tissue fragment, Which is submitted entirely -. The
remainder of the tissuei is submitted in cassette (A1).

Frozen section diagnosis:
FSA1 — Base of renal mass — “Renal tubules with fibrosis. No evidence of carcinoma.”

Part B is also received fresh additionally labeled “renal mass (left)" and consists Of a 39 gm, 7 x 4.5 x 3.5
cm portion of kidney with a 4.5 x 3.2 cm oval resection plane. Within the tissue a well-demarcated tan
pale 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm mass is seen. A thin layer of fat covers most of the specimen, except for a 1.5 cm
area. The renal resection margin is inked red. The remainder of the surface including the fat is inked in
black. The cut surface of the tumor is uniformly tan-white and friable. It is well-demarcated from the red-
tan renal parenchyma. The tumor comes to within 0.5 cm of the resection plane. Representative
sections are submitted in cassettes (B1)-(B5). Gross photos obtained.

SLIDE KEY
B1 — tumor nearest to resection margin
B2-BS — additional representative sections, perpendicular to resection plane.

Aiiroximateli 50% of tumor Is submitted.

 

 

 

Multiple H&E-stained slides are examined. Sections show a well-circumscribed papillary renal cell
carcinoma with prominent aggregates of foamy histiocytes and cholesterol clefting. The individual cells
have well-defined cell borders with pale to eosinophilic cytoplasm and somewhat enlarged nuclei with
small nucleoli. The tumor comes to within 0.4 cm of the resection margin. Fuhrman nuclear grade is 2.
