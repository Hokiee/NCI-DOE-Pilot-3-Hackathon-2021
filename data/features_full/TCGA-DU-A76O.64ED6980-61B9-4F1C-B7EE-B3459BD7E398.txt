Clinical History

'-old man has past history of left leg amputation for cartilaginous tumor (Ollier's disease), and
has several
intra axial, intracranial tumors consistent with low histological grade gliomas. Patient experiences
medically
intractable complex partial epilepsy.
Operative Diagnoses
Medically intractable complex partial epilepsy
Operation I Specimen
A: Para sagittal, biopsy
B: Inferior parietal, biopsy
Pathologic Diagnosis
A. Brain, parasagittal, excision:
1. Low histological grade glioma, consistent with diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade 2).
2. lDH1-R132H mutation: Positive.
3. MlB-1 proliferation index: > 9%.
4. 1p, 19q LOH: Negative.
5. MGMT: Low positive.
B. Brain, inferior parietal, excision:
1. Neoplastic glial inﬁltrate, sparse.
2. Architectural features: Uncertain.
See Microscopy Description and Comment.
Comment
Part A.
This specimen is portions of cerebrum that are moderately inﬁltrated by a glial neOpiastic proliferation that
has a
mixed oligo astrocytic phenotype, with uniform round/ovoid nuclei frequently surrounded by halos.
However, the
neoplastic cells are devoid of the 1p, 19q deletion characteristic of oligodendrogliomas. Mitotic ﬁgures are
found with
great difﬁculty, and there is not microvascular proliferation or tumor necrosis. The MiB-1 proliferation
index is greater
than 9% (as normal native cells are entered in the total nuclear count; the index is probably no more than
15%).
The ﬁndings are interpreted as those of a low histological grade glial neoplasm that has molecular
features of
astrocytoma. The elevated cycling activity may portend a heightened aggressive potential.
Part B.
Surgical Pathology
Page 2 of 4
This specimen is three small fragments of cerebral cortex in which, because of the small size and
orientation of the
fragments, it is difficult to evaluate the cortical architectural features. Furthermore, the iDHi stain
demonstrates a

somewhat sparse sprinkling of the cortex by neoplastic glial cells, which interferes even more with @
evaluation of the
distribution of normal cells. There is not obvious architectural distortion, dysmorphic neuronal element, or
balloon
cells.
The ﬁndings are interpreted as a glial neoplasm sparsely inﬁltrating the cerebral cortex; and non
conclusive of cortical
dysplasia
The features in both specimens may be correlated with clinical, imaging, eiectrophysiological, and
operative ﬁndings
for their interpretation and patient's follow up.

Loss of Heterozygosity 1p, 19q Assay (LOH)
Date Ordered: Date Reported:
Interpretation
NEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm to and chromosome arm 19q is NOT detected.
Informative loci are: D1 S1 592, D1 8552, D198412, 0198606, 01981182 and PLA2G4C
Results-Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor parafﬁn block (A1). DNA extracted from a
corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)/ Tumor DNA
pairs using 3
markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1p are 018548, D1 S1592, and 018552 (with 018468,

D181612, and (3
018496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are 0198219, 0198412, and PLA2G4C (with ‘
01 98606 and '~
01981182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a
minisatellite (26
nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and
ease of
interpretation. The backup markers are used if the ﬁrst line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or
othenrvise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical ﬁnding in oligodendrogliomas with 1p and 19q deletion.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand-alone diagnostic
test. This test
was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLlA ’ 88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for speciﬁc uses by the US. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in the context of established
procedures
and/or diagnostic criteria.
TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in the sample may preclude the
detection of
allelic loss.

MGMT Promoter Methylation
Date Ordered: Date Reported:
Interpretation
LOW POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected.
Results-Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor parafﬁn block ‘ (A1)
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulﬁte
treatment of ,
DNA followed by real—time PCR ampliﬁcation of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic
test. This test
was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLlA ’88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for speciﬁc uses by the US. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are

Microscopic Description
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:
Part A: The GFAP demonstrates a rather delicate glioﬁbrillary background. The tumor cells are heavily
and
uniformly reactive with lDH1. With the MIB-1 there is a proliferation index of more than 9%, since the
normal native
nuclei are included in the total cell count.
Surgical Pathology

Page 4 of 4
Part B: The lDH1 evinces a sparse sprinkling of positive glial neoplastic nuclei sprinkled throughout the
cerebral
cortex. The GFAP demonstrates absence of reactive astrocytes. The CD163 depicts slight dendritic
microglial
unrest, probably associated with previous mechanical manipulation. The NeuN and NFP highlight a thin,
tangentionally sectioned cerebral cortex that overall has reasonable well preserved layering, without overt
disorganization or dysmorphism.
