FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Diagnosis:

A. LEFT PARATRACHEAL TISSUE, BIOPSY:
- METASTATIC PAPlLLARY THYROID CARCINOMA IN LYMPH NODE.
- The metastatic focus measures 0.2 cm in diameter, and comprises
approximately 10% of the lymph node tissue volume.

  

B. CENTRAL LYMPH NODE, BIOPSY:
- METASTATIC PAPlLLARY THYROID CARCINOMA IN LYMPH NODE.
- The metastatlc focus measures approximately 0.5 cm in diameter
and comprises approximately 90% of the lymph node tissue volume.

C. THYROID. THYROIDECTOMY:
- MULTIFOCAL PAPlLLARY THYROID CARCINOMA, INVOLVING LEFT
AND RIGHT LOBES.
— The largest tumor nodule (inferior aspect of right lobe) measures
1.7 cm in diameter.
- Tumor extends to Inked and cauterized surfaces of the resected
thyroid gland (at the inferior aspects of left and right lobes).
- PARATHYROID ADENOMA, AT LEAST 0.9 CM IN DIAMETER, ADJACENT
TO INFERIOR POLE OF RIGHT THYROID LOBE.
- CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC THYROIDITIS.
— SMALL BENIGN LYMPH NODE ADJACENT TO THYROID.

COMMENT: Three tumor nodules are grossly identiﬁed, the largest of which is
identiﬁed in the lower pole of the right thyroid lobe (1.7 cm in diameter). Two
additional tumor nodules are identiﬁed in the left lobe, a 0.4 cm nodule in the upper
portion, and a 1.1 cm more inferiorly. Carcinoma extends to the cauterized and inked
margins in the inferior portions of both left and right thyroid lobes.

Source of Specimen;
A. Left tracheal tissue

B. Lymph node;Central node
C. Thyroid;Total thyroid

Clinical Wotan/Operative Dx:
Thyroid cancer

lntraoperative Diagnosis:

A. Left paratracheal tissue: Lymphoid tissue. (Dr. . The intraoperative interpretationts) was/were
performed and rendered at .

Gross Description:
A. The specimen is labeled left paratracheal tissue and is received without ﬁxative. It consists of a 0.2 x

0.2 x 0.2 cm fragment of yellow-tan tissue which weighs 0.0263 grams. It is entirely submitted for frozen
section as FSA. The tissue remaining from frozen section is submitted for permanent section in cassette
A1. I

B. The specimen is labeled central node and is received in formalin. it consists of two fragments of
ﬁbrofatty appearing tissue. The larger fragment measures 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm and the smaller fragment is
ﬁrm and pale tan, 0.6 cm in maximum dimension. The larger fragment appears to consist of ﬁbrofatty
tissue. it is inked blue. Both specimens are serially sectioned and all tissue is Submitted in cassette Bt.

C. The specimen is labeled total thyroid and is received without ﬁxative. it consists of a total

thyroidectomy specimen weighing 10 grams. A long black silk stitch marks the right lobe of the thyroid and
a white medium stitch marks an area of possible parathyroid adenoma according to the surgeon. The right
thyroid lobe measures 3.3 cm from superior to interior, 2.5 cm from medial to lateral, and 0.8 cm from
anterior to posterior. The left thyroid lobe measures 3.1 cm from superior to interior. 2.4 cm from medial to
lateral, and 1.1 cm from anteriorto posterior. There is very little if any recognizable isthmic tissue. The
anterior surface of the right thyroid lobe is inked blue, the anterior surface of the ten thyroid lobe is inked
green and the posterior surfaces are inked black. There is no grossly identiﬁable parathyroid tissue. Serial
sections of the right thyroid lobe reveal an inferior ill-deﬁned area of firm tan-white discoloration which is

1.5 cm in maximum dimension. Sections of the left thyroid lobe reveal a 0.4 cm focus of ﬁrm tan-white
tissue in the superior pole, as well as a relatively well-circumscribed, tan-white mass in the central inferior
portion of the left thyroid lobe measuring 1.1 cm in maximum dimension. Representative sections of the
Ieit inferior thyroid mass are submitted for research purposes. The specimen is entirely submitted. Section
summary: Ci-C4) right thyroid lobe from superior to inferior, CS) superior ieii thyroid lobe with small
nodule, 06-09) left thyroid lobe from superior to inferior.

A. Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic ﬁndings are reﬂected in the diagnosis
rendered.

B. Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic ﬁndings are reﬂected in the diagnosis
