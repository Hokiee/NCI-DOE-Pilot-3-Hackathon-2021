TISSUE DESCRIPTION:

A1 B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 BB B9 810 B11 B12 C1
Tissue from liver (segments V and VI——810 grams, 14.0 x 13.5 x
7.8 cm with gallbladder--8.8 x 2.2 X 1.3 cm), appendix (3.8 x
0.6 x 0.5 cm), retrocholedochal lymph node (2.0 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm)

DIAGNOSIS:

Liver, segments V and VI and gallbladder, resection: Grade 3
(of 4) hepatocellular/carcinoma forming a 13.2 x 11.0 x 7.8 cm
lobulated mass. Margins of resection are free by at least 0.7
cm. The gallbladder shows no diagnostic abnormality.

Appendix, appendectomy: Fibrous obliteration of the tip.

Lymph node, retrocholedochal, excision: One retrocholedochal
lymph node, negative for tumor.
