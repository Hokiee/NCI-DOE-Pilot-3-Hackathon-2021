Surgery Date: Ill lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
DIAGNOSIS:
Liver, right lobe and segment 1, partial hepatectomy: Grade 3 (of 4)

cholangiocarcinoma forming a circumscribed mass (3.6 x 2.9 x 2.8 cm) within
the region of the caudate lobe. Surgical margins are negative (by 0.2 cm).
Liver, segment 3, No.2, excision: Bile duct adenoma.

Liver, segment 3, biopsy : Benign liver parenchyma, negative for tumor.
Liver, segment 4, biopsy: Benign liver and foci of hemosiderin—laden
macrophages. No evidence of neoplasm.

Lymph nodes, hepatic artery, excision: Non-necrotizing granulomatous
inflammation. Negative for tumor.

Gallbladder, cholecystectomy: Benign gallbladder mucosa with
cholesterolosis. No stones are identified. No cystic duct lymph node
identified.

Sections of the non—neoplastic liver show prominent non—necrotizing
granulomatous infiltrates within portal areas and the lobular parenchyma.

There is no apparent fibrosis or ductopenia, and in general the
granulomatous infiltrates do not appear to be directed at bile ducts. This
likely represents a granulomatous reaction to the patient's neoplasm.
However, obtaining an AMA would be helpful to exclude PBC. In addition,
there is granulomatous inflammation within the hilar lymph nodes. GMS and
AR stains are negative.

Additional clinical correlation needed to exclude other granulomatous

processes, such as sarcoidosis.
