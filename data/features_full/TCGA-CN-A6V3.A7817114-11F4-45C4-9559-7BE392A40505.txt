By Pathologist:

My signature is attestation that I have personally reviewed the
submitted

material(s) and the final diagnosis reflects that evaluation.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

Specimen is received unfixed in six parts.

Part 1 is labeled with patient's name, initials XX and "tongue base
biopsy".

It consists of a 1.5 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm tan—red soft tissue evaluated
intraoperatively. The remainder of the specimen is submitted labeled
lAFS.

Formalin exposure time: 34 hours

Part 2 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and "right
levels 2

thru 4". It consists of a 13.0 x 4.5 x 1.0 cm portion of soft, yellow-
red,

hemorrhagic and focally cauterized fibroadipose tissue exhibiting one
bulging

nodule (5.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm) present within level II. The cut surface is
firm,

tan—white, lobular and solid.

The specimen is divided into levels 2 thru 4. In addition to the
dominant

level II nodule, multiple soft to moderately firm, tan—gray to pink—red
lymph

nodes ranging 0.3 to 2.0 cm in greatest dimension are identified on
dissection.

Representative dominant level II nodule submitted to the

Ink Code:

Green- external surface of suspicious nodule

Section code:

ZA-C- level II, dominate nodule, representative sections

2D-F- lymph nodes, level II

2G- level III lymph node, (1 bisected)

2H-J- level III lymph nodes

2K- level IV lymph nodes

Formalin exposure time: 30 hours

Part 3 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and "left neck
dissection levels 2 thru 4". It consists of an unoriented 8.0 x 3.7 x
0.9 cm

portion of yellow and lobular fibroadipose tissue and red—brown muscle.
The

specimen is arbitrarily divided into segments A, B and C. Multiple tan—
pink to

gray, soft lymph nodes ranging 0.3 to 2.3 cm in greatest dimension are
identified on dissection.

Section code:

3A-B— lymph nodes, segment A

3C- lymph nodes, segment B ,

3D—E— lymph nodes, segment C (each one bisected)

3F- lymph nodes, segment C

Formalin exposure time: 30 hours

Part 4 labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and "right base of
tongue

margin". It consists of a 3.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm tan-red soft tissue
evaluated

intraoperatively. The remaining tissue is submitted labeled 4AFS.
Formalin exposure time: 30 hours

Part 5 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and "total
larynx". It

consists of a total laryngectomy 9.7 x 7.2 x 4.5 cm, 4.6 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm
attached hyoid bone, three tracheal rings and a moderate amount of
anterior

soft tissue and muscle.

There is a 4.5 x 2.3 x 1.8 cm (depth), well-defined, moderately firm,

tan-white, focally hemorrhagic, exophytic supraglottic lesion involving
the

right aspect of epiglottis, base of the epiglottis, right false vocal
cord and

anterior commissure. The ventricle is compressed but grossly the right
true

vocal cord is uninvolved. On cross~section the lesion penetrates
through the

epiglottis invading the para epiglottic fat, coming to within 0.8 cm of
the

base of tongue mucosal resection margin, 1.0 cm from the anterior soft
tissue

margin, 0.3 cm from the right aryepiglottic mucosal margin and 4.0 cm
from the

third tracheal ring margin. The left false and true vocal cords are
smooth,

soft, pliable and grossly uninvolved.

The remaining laryngeal mucosa is smooth, tan—pink-red and mildly
edematous in

the glottic region. The thyroid cartilage is unremarkable.

Digital images are taken. The right supraglottic lesion is procured
for the

clinical tissue bank.

Ink code:

Black- anterior soft tissue surgical resection

Yellow— soft tissue underlying hyoid bone

Green— base of tongue mucosal margin

Red- banked area

Section code:

SAFS— radial mid line base of tongue, frozen section

5B—tracheal ring margin

5C— right aryepiglottic mucosal margin, shave

50— base of tongue '

5E— anterior soft tissue margin, shave

5F- left aryepiglottic mucosal margin, shave

5G— supraglottic lesion in relation to tip of epiglottis

5HDR- lesion in relation to anterior commissure

5I—5L-lesion in relation to right false cord, ventricle and true vocal
cord

(midline to lateral)

5M— left false and true vocal cords, uninvolved

Formalin exposure time: 30 hours

Part 6 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and "right
pyriform".

It consists of a 1.8 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm smooth, pink—gray, soft mucosa and
underlying soft tissue entirely submitted labeled 6A.

Formalin exposure time: 30 hours

MICROSCOPIC:

Microscopic examination substantiates the above diagnosis.

The following statement applies to all immunohistochemistry, Insitu
Hybridization Assays (ISH & FISH), Molecular Anatomic Pathology, and
Immunofluorescent Testing:
The testing was developed and its performance characteristics
determined by _
the as required by
the CLIA
‘88 regulations. The testing has not been cleared or approved for the
specific use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA has
determined such approval is not necessary for clinical use. Tissue
fixation
ranges from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 84 hours.
This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments of 1988 ("CLIA") as qualified to perform high-complexity
clinical
testing. Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA, ASR‘s used in this
laboratory
have been established and verified for accuracy and precision.
Additional
information about this type of test is available upon request.
