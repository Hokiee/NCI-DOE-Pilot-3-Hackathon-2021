GROSS DESCRIPTTON:
A. APlCAL TISSUE
Received in formalin Is an unoriented tan pink soft tissue fragment 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm. Toto A1.

3. PROSTATE

Received fresh labeled with the patient identiﬁcation and designated as "Part B. Prostate"' Is a 479
resected prostate 5.0 cm from right to left, 4 2 cm from anterior to posterior. and 3.0 cm from apex to
base. with attached right and left seminal vesicles and vas deferens. The capsule is ten pink smooth
and intact. The specimen is inked as follows: Anterior-Orange, Posterior-Black, Apex—Red, Base-Blue,
Right-Green, Left-Yellow. After removal of the apex and base. the remaining prostate weight is 239.
The specimen is serially sectioned from apex to base to reveal ﬁrm tan ﬁbrous parenchyma. No
obvious lesions or nodules are grossly identiﬁed. The attached right and left seminal vesicles are 4.0 x
2.5 x 2.0 cm and 5.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm, respectively, are sectioned to beige tan cystic tissue with no gross
evidence of tumor involvement. The attached right and ten segments of vas deferens are 6.0 x 0.4 cm
and 1.0 x 0.5 cm. respectively, are sectioned to reveal firm tan tubular structure with no gross evidence
of tumor involvement. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement (Levels 1 and Ill).
The remainder of the specimen is submitted as follows:

B1: right apex

82-33: left apex

INTERPRETATION: The stroma surrounding the glands in the left seminal vesicle demonstrate apple
green birefringence on the Congo red stain. This is characteristic of amyloid. Clinical correlation is
recommended.
