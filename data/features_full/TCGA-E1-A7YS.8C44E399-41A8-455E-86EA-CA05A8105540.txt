CLINICAL HISTORY:

Brain neoplasm frontal. MRI findings: A heterogeneous enhancing mass is seen
centered in the left frontal lobe which measures approximately 6.8 x 4.4 cm.
This is not significantly changed compared to prior outside MRI. There is
again significant mass effect with effacement of sulci and herniation of the
left frontal hemisphere across the midline. There is surrounding Tl
hypodensity which likely represents vasogenic edema. Central areas of low Tl
signal intensity likely represent necrosis.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Brain tissue (AF1)". Received fresh for frozen section is a 1.8 x 0.5 x
0.3 cm aggregate of soft brown-tan tissue is partially frozen as
representative AEl and the frozen section remnant is submitted in block A1.

Additional representative sections submitted in block A2 and the remainder is
retained in formalin.

B. "Brainktissue (BF1)". Received fresh for frozen section is a 4.3 x 3.8 x
1.9 cm aggregate of soft gray—tan tissue that was partially frozen as
representative BFl and the frozen section remnant is submitted in B1.
Additional representative sections are submitted in blocks B2m5.

C. {Brain tissue-routine". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 4.6 x

2.1 x 2.1 cm portion of scabrous gray—tan tissue with embedded blood clot.
Representative sections blocks 01—3.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:

A. "Brain tissue":AFl-glioma, probable oligodendroglioma.
B. "Brain tissue":BFl—high grade glioma, probable oligo (Dr.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

Microscopic examination shows brain infiltrated by an oligodendrOglial

neoplasm characterized by hypercellularity, minigemistocytes, mitotic figures,
microvascular changes and necrosis.
