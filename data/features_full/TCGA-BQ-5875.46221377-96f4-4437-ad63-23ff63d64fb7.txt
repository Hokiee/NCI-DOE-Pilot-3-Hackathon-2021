1) The specimen is receiver! fresh for frozen section diagnosis, labeled, "Left kidney". it consists of e 1190 grams
nephreclomy specirnenf 23.0 x 13.0 x 9.0 cm) with attached segment of ureter (1.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter), and
segment of renal vein (3.0 cm in length and 9.3 cm in diametep. The perirenal fat is minimal. The specimen is inked and on cut
section it reveals the kidney to be replaced almost entirely by multiple nodules of tan-yellow, partially cystic. hemorrhagic tumor
occupying the whole kidney. measuring approximately 13.0 x 9.0 x 6.0 cm. The tumor grossly abuts the adrenal gland (6.0 x
2.0 x 1.5 cm}. The tumor grossly appears to be confined to the renal capsule. The tumor surlace show line papillary fronts.
TPS is submitted. Photographs taken. Representative sections are submitted.

2). The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation labeled. "Left tube and ovary" and consists a
segment of fallopian tube with limbriatad end measuring 4.8 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter. The serosa is
tan—pink, smooth and unremarkable. The fallopian tube is serially cross~sectioned to reveal unremarkable cut surface
with a 0.1 cm lumen. There are numerous parafubal cysts identified ranging in size from 0.1 to 0.8 cm in greatest
dimension. The attached ovary is tan—willie. smooth and firm. Cot surface is unremarkable and except for
numerous corpora albicantia. Representative sections are submitted for frozen and permanent sections.

3). The specimen is received in fresh for frozen section consultation labeled, "Right tube and ovary" and consists a
segment of fallopian tube with fimbrleted and measuring 6.5 cm in length by a 0.4 cm in diameter. The serosa is
tan—pink and smooth with some minute paralubal cysts each measuring less than 0.1 cm in diameter. The fallopian
tube is serially cross-sectioned to reveal unremarkable cut surface with a 0.1 cm lumen. "the attached ovary
measures 2 x 2 x 1.5 cm. External surface is tan-white with a l x 0.8 x 0.3 cm cyst. The external surface is inked in
blue. Cut surface is light tan, unremarkable. Corporal albicentia are identiﬁed. Representative sections are submitted
for frozen and permanent sections.

4) The specimen is received fresh, labeled, “Spleen". it consists of e 120 grams spleen (11.0 x 7.0 x 5.0 cm). The hilum
reveals no lymph nodes. The capsule appears to be partially eroded with hemorrhagic surfaceit. Cut sections reveal a 4.5 cm i
triangular nferction. The remaining spleen parenchyma appears unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted.
