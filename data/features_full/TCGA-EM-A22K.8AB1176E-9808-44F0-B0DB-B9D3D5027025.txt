Gross Description
1. The specimen labeled with the patient‘s name and as "Thyroid: Total, stitch-left upper lobe, level 6
neck" consists of a thyroid gland with attached partial neck dissection that weighs 12.8 g. The right lobe
measures 3.6 cm SI x 1.8 cm ML x 1.0 cm AP, the left lobe measures 3.0 cm Si x 1.0 cm ML x 0.9 cm AP
and the isthmus measures 2.5 cm Si x 0.9 cm ML x 0.6 cm AP. The neck dissection measures 3.5 cm SI
x 1.5 cm ML x 0.6 cm AP. No parathyroid glands are identiﬁed grossly. The external surface is painted
with silver nitrate. The right lobe contains 2 delineated nodules that measure 0.6 cm in diameter and 0.7
cm Si x 0.9 cm ML x 0.6 cm AP. The left lobe contains one delineated nodule that measures 1.1 cm Sl x
0.8 cm ML x 0.5 cm AP. Adherent to the lateral aspect of the left lobe is a second nodule that measures
2.2 cm Si x 1.0 cm ML x 0.5 cm AP. This nodule is partially calciﬁed. The remainder of the thyroid tissue
is pale red-brown. The neck dissection contains 4 lymph nodes that range in size from 0.3 to 1.5 cm.
Sections of all 4 nodules and normal tissue are stored frozen. Representative sections of the remainder of
the specimen are submitted as follows, thyroid in toto (except calciﬁed portion of laterally adherent
nodule):
1A-D right lobe, superior to inferior
1E-F isthmus
1G-J left lobe, superior to inferior
1K 3 lymph node
1L 1 lymph node, bisected

2. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as “?metastatic papillary Ca ?Lt parathyroid"
consists of 2 fragments of tissue that weigh 0.116 g and measure 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm and 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4
cm. it is frozen for intraoperative consultation.

2A frozen section block resubmitted

3. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "Contents LT neck level 2—5", consists of an
unoriented piece of ﬁbrofatty tissue that measures 13 x 5 x 1.5 cm. Within the specimen are multiple
probable lymph nodes that range in size from 0.2 to 3.2 cm. Several of the larger lymph nodes grossly
appear to be involved by tumor. Representative sections:

3A-J multiple lymph nodes, per block

3J-M one lymph node bisected, per block

3N-P representative slice of each of the 3 largest lymph nodes, 1 per block
