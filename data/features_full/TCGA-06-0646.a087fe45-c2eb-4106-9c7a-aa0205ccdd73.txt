Surgical Pathology Report

 

mitt} recent onset seizure has a 3.0 cm. mass in the right
mi e empora o e, with recently developed enhancement, absent edema, and
some satellite lesions.

OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
Not Given

Operation/Specimen: A: Brain, temporal lobe, lobectomy
B: Brain, right temporal tumor, excision biopsy

C: Brain, right temporal tumorexcision biopsy

D: Brain, posterior resection margin excision biopsy

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:

A. Brain, temporal lobe, lobectomy: No diagnostic features.

B. Brain, right temporal, biopsy: Glioblastoma.

C. Brain, right temporal, excision: Glioblastoma.

D. Brain, posterior resection margin, excision: Cerebral cortex and white
matter, free of neoplasm.

See Comment.

COMMENT
Part A is portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter, in which

there are focal areas of recent edema. There is no neoplasia.

Parts B and C are portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter
infiltrated and extensively effaced by a glial neoplastic proliferation with
nuclear anaplasia, mitotic figures, microvascular cellular proliferation, and
necrosis, some with pseudopalisading, i.e. a glioblastoma.

Part D is small fragments of unremarkable cerebral cortex and adjacent white
matter devoid of neoplasm.

Special stains results will be reported as an addendum.

NEGATIVE — No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected.

ResultsHComments
Testing was done on paraffin block

TEST DESCRIPTION: Bisulfite treatment of DNA followed by PCR amplification of
both methylated and unmethylated MGMT promoter sequences, with products
detected by gel electrophoresis.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a

stand-alone diagnostic test. This its performance
characteristics de 'ned by the laboratory as
required by CLIA ' egulations. It as not een c eared or approved for

specific uses by the 6.8. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.

Interpretation

Brain, lmmunohistochemistry: MIB-l proliferation index 14%.
See Results and Comment (below).

ResultSHComments

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates gliofibrillogenesis by the
neoplastic cells, and frequent gemistocytes. Only about 3% of the neoplastic
nuclei express the p53 mutant protein. With the MIB-l there is a
proliferation index of about 14% throughout the tumor.

Comment: The immunophenotype is consistent with a glioblastoma. The
diagnosis remains unchanged.

 

 

INTRA-OPERATIVE CONSULTATION

features.
