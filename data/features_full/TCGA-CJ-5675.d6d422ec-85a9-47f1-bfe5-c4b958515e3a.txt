 

DIAGNOSIS
(A) RIGHT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND:

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (10.0 CM MAXIMUM DIMENSION), CONVENTIONAL TYPE

(70% CLEAR
CELLS, 30% EOSINOPHILIC CELLS), FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3,
CONFINED TO THE KIDNEY.
(SEE COMMENT).
Margins of resection free of tumor.
Adrenal gland, no tumor present.
(B) GONADAL VEIN RIGHT:
Blood vessels and Ô¨Åbroadipose tissue, no tumor present.

COMMENT

The renal cell carcinoma in the right kidney appears to be confined to
the kidney and does not invade into the perinephric adipose tissue or
the renal vein. The tumor pushes against the renal sinus but there is
no unequivocal invasion into the renal sinus adipose tissue. Multiple
additional deeper sections were also examined.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) RIGHT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND - A radical nephrectomy specimen
(23.0 x 14.0 x 9.5 cm) with a kidney (14.0 x 9.0 x 9.0 cm) and adrenal
gland (6.0 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm).

The kidney reveals a 10.0 x 8.5 x 8.5 cm tumor within the upper pole.
The tumor is close to the Gerota's fascia and perinephric fat in focal
areas (0.6 cm nearest). The tumor is also close to the pelvicalyceal
system and the renal sinus. The renal vein and ureter are unremarkable.
The tumor reveals overall pale yellow lobular surface with focal areas
of hemorrhage, and myxoid degeneration centrally. The rest of the
kidney and adrenal gland is unremarkable.

Tumor is submitted for the vaccine protocol.

INK CODE: Black - Gerota's fascia.

SECTION CODE: A1-A3, tumor closest to Gerota's fascia; A4-A9, tumor
close to the renal sinus; A10-A14, different areas of the tumor; A15,
representative sections of the adrenal gland; A16, representative
section from kidney; A17, renal vein and ureter.

(B) GONADAL VEIN RIGHT - A single unoriented fragment of tissue
measuring approximately 10.0 x 3.0 x 0.3 cm. The vein is identified and
shows no evidence of tumor thrombi or other abnormalities. The
surrounding soft tissue shows focal hemorrhage but othenNise
unremarkable.

SECTION CODE: B1-B3, representative sections. -

CLINICAL HISTORY

Right renal mass.
