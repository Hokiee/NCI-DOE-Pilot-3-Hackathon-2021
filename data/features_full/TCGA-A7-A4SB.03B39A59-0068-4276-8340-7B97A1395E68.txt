Final Surgical Pathology Report

 

Procedure:

Diagnosis
A. Right axillary sentinel node, excisional biopsy:

1 of 2 lymph nodes positive for micrometastatic lobular carcinoma

(0.95mm)

B. Right breast excisional biopsy:

Invasive lobular carcinoma, grade 2, tumor size 5.3 cm

Invasive carcinoma is present at posterior and inferior/medial margins

and less than 1 mm from the anterior margin.
Suspicious for lymphatic space invasion

Microscopic Description:
Microscopic examination performed.

A. Microscopic examination of the sentinel lymph nodes involve the
evaluation of 6 HaE-stained sections through the smaller lymph node and

12 H&E—stained sections through the larger lymph node.

Multiple

cytokeratin stains were also evaluated including 1 cytokeratin stain

from each tissue block.

Micrometastatic tumor was identified by pancytokeratin AEl/AE3
immunohistochemical stain of block A2. A total of 69 cells. The
largest cluster measures 0.98 mm by ocular micrometer measurement

Invasive Carcinoma:
Histologic type: Invasive lobular
Histologic grade: 2

Nuclear score: 2
Mitotic score: 1

Specimen margins: Invasive lobular carcinoma is identified at
inked at the posterior margin (B7) and the inferior margin, medial
aspect (810). Invasive lobular carcinoma is less than 1 mm from the
resection margin designated anterior. And 2 mm from the resection

margin designated superior.

Vessel invasion: Focal areas suspicious for lymphovascular

space invasion are identified in B 10
Calcification: Not identified

Ductal carcinoma in situ: None

Description of non—tumorous breast: Dense fibrosis

Comments: Core biopsy site changes are identified. The core biopsy

site changes are directly at the posterior margin.

Prognostic markers: Performed on the prior core biopsy

A. Right axillary sentinel node
B. Breast biopsy

Clinical Information
Right breast cancer, year—old white female with breast cancer

Gross Description

A. Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled "right
axillary sentinel node" is a 4.5 x 4.0 x 2.2 cm aggregate of yellow
lobular fatty tissue fragment which are palpated to identify 2 possible
lymph nodes measuring 3.7 cm and 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. The
lymph nodes are sectioned and entirely submitted as follows: 1 ~ 2 -
smaller lymph node bisected, 3 — 6 — larger lymph node sectioned. The
remainder of the fat is retained and the lymph nodes are entirely
submitted.

B. Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled "breast
biopsy" in a Transpec container is a 12 x 8 x 4 cm yellow lobular fatty
tissue fragment. The specimen is received in pathology at and
fixed in formalin at The specimen has 4 inserted needle
localization wires. The specimen has a long suture designating anterior
and a short suture designating superior. The specimen is inked as
follows: Anterior red, superior blue, posterior black, inferior green,
lateral orange and medial yellow. The specimen is sectioned to show a
5.3 x 4.0 x 1.7 cm white—tan ill circumscribed firm lesion which may
grossly involve the inferior posterior margin. The remainder of the cut
surface is predominantly fatty with scanty fibrous tissue present.
There is a 1.4 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm white—tan ill circumscribed firm nodule
adjacent and possibly involving the anterior margin this is grossly
contiguous with the previously described larger lesion. No other
discrete gross lesions are identified. Representative portions of
tumor and normal breast tissue are submitted for tissue procurement as
requested. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as
follows: 1 — cruciate medial margin, 2 — cruciate lateral margin, 3 — 4
— full thickness composite of anterior lesion to posterior margin, 5 ~
representative superior margin, 6 — 10 — representative section of
tumor with additional margins.
