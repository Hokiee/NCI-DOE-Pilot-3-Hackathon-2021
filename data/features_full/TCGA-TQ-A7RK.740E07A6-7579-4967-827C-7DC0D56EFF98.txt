Nature of material: Brain Sh WW)WWHOS
Received on: W Q7). b
(9%, AM My 1. ,
Macroscopy: JIM/3
Received in formalin, a portion of irregular brain that weighs 24.0 9 an measures 4.5 X
3.5 X 2.0 cm. is lined by smooth, delicate and translucent leptomeninges, under which it
is possible to recognize two broad gyri. To cuts, there is loss of distinction between
cortex and subcortical white matter due to irregular lesion, ill-defined, localized
predominantly in the white matter, composed of brown tissue, something ﬁrm, with
multiple small cavities, sometimes blackened, giving a spongy.

Microscopy:

Histological sections stained with H & E show inﬁltrative glial neoplasm, moderately
cellular, affecting the cortex and white matter, and composed of a mixed population of
glial cells. Most of these have round nuclei, dispersed chromatin and occasional
perinuclear halos and is located in the middle of areas with loose fibrillar matrix, forming
microcysts. Occasionally, we can observe some cells with eosinophilic and dense
cytoplasm, with eccentric nuclei ("minigemistocysts"). Another type of cell is
characterized by possessing more elongated nuclei with irregular outlines and dense
chromatin arranged in a dense ﬁbrillar matrix. it is not observed mitotic figures,
microvascular proliferation or necrosis areas. lt was performed immunohistochemistry
that revealed strong positivity in neoplasia for anti-GFAP and focal positivity for 8100
protein. A semi-quantitative assessment of proliferation index with MlB-1 antibody was
positive in less than 1% of neoplastic nuclei.

Diagnosis:
Excision product of lesion on left frontal lobe: - Oligoastrocitoma, grade ll - WHO
classiﬁcation 2007.
