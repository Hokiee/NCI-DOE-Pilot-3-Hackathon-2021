GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT SUPERFICIAL FEMORAL LYMPH NODES - A 21.0 x 14.0 x 14.0 x 1.4 cm fatty tissue. There is a 5.5 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm
firm nodule and a smaller firm nodule, 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm. Both nodules have a ﬂeshy pink to gray-tan cut surfaces. Tissue from
the nodules is submitted for tissue bank. Specimen is dissected for lymph nodes and multiple lymph nodes are found ranging in
size from 2.5 x 0.7 x 0.5 to 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm and are entirely submitted.

SECTION CODE: A1, representative section from the largest nodule grossly involved by tumor; A2, representative
section from the second largest nodule grossly involved by tumor; A3, one possible lymph node; A4, one possible lymph node; A5.
one possible lymph node; A6. one possible lymph node; A7, one possible lymph node; A8, A9, one possible lymph node; A10, two
possible lymph nodes; A11, two possible lymph nodes; A12, one possible lymph node; A13, two possible lymph nodes; A14, four
possible lymph nodes; A15. six possible lymph nodes; A16, two possible lymph nodes; A17, one possible lymph node; A18, two
possible lymph nodes.

(B) LEFT INGUINAL CANAL LIPOMA - A 2.5 x 2.5 x 0.8 cm fatty tissue with a partially hemorrhagic cut surface, entirely
submitted in cassettes B1-B4. .

(C) LEFT ILIAC LYMPH NODES - Multiple fragments of fatty tissue measuring in aggregate 7.5 x 5.0 x 1.5 cm. Dissection reveals
multiple possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.8 up to 3.8 cm in their greatest dimension. Possible lymph nodes are entirely
submitted in cassettes.

SECTION CODE: C1, one sectioned possible lymph node; C2, one sectioned possible lymph node; C3, C4, one
sectioned possible lymph node; CS, C6, one sectioned possible lymph node; C7-C9, one sectioned possible lymph node.

(D) LEFT OBTURATOR LYMPH NODES - A single fragment of a fatty tissue measuring 5.5 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm. Dissection reveals
two possible lymph nodes ranging from 1.8 up to 2.9 cm in their greatest dimension. Possible lymph nodes are entirely submitted
in cassettes,

SECTION CODE: D1 and DZ, one sectioned possible lymph node; 03-05, one sectioned possible lymph node.
(E) WLE MELANOMA LEFT HEEL - A portion of white-tan skin and underlying ﬁbroadipose tissue, 5.5 x 4.5 x 1.8 cm with short
stitch at proximal margin and long stitch at anterior margin. A well circumscribed raised white-tan tumor, 2.5 x 1.7 x 0.6 cm is
identiﬁed on the skin surface and the lesion is 2.0 cm to the closest anterior margin. The anterior margin inked blue, posterior
margin inked orange. The specimen serially sectioned from proximal to distal. Cut surface reveals the tumor invades into the
deep soft tissue, 0.7 cm in maximal depth. The tumor is 0.5 cm to the closest deep margin.

SECTION CODE: E1, shaved proximal margin, ink side up; E2, shaved distal margin. ink side up: E3. shaved anterior
margin, ink side up; E4, shaved posterior margin, ink side up; E5, E6, tumor with closest deep margin.
(F) NEW DEEP MARGIN - A piece of ﬁbroadipose tissue, 2.0 v 1 2 x 0.5 cm with stitch at true margin. The true margin inked blue.
The specimen serially sectioned and entirely submitted in F
(G) ADDITIONAL LATERAL SKIN - A strip of a grossly unremarkable tan skin and underlying tissue measuring 15.0 x 1.0 x 1.5
cm. Cut surface of the soft tissue is unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes G1 and GZ.

(H) ADDITIONAL ILIAC NODE - A single possible lymph node measuring 0.8 cm in its greatest dimension. Blsected and entirely
submitted in cassette H.
