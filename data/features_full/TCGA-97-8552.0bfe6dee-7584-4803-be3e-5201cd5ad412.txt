CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
never-smoker with a 1.5 cm LLL nodule.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in saline, in five parts, each labeled with
the patient's name.

1. Part one is labeled 'basilar segment left lower lobe, stitch

marks tumor'. It consists of a segmentectomy specimen of the lung
measuring 15 x 10 x 4 cm. The staple line measures 8 cm in length
which is shaved and the parenchyma around is inked black. The
specimen is received precut and the precut area is marked with a
stitch which reveals a gray-pink slightly firm nodule measuring 1.5
x 1.2 cm. The nodule is located subpleural and 3 cm from the hilum.
The pleura is gray-pink, glistening and lightly mottled with fine
black streaks. The remainder of the parenchyma is pink-red, blotchy
and crepitant. Representative sections are submitted.

2. Part two is labeled 'level 11 lymph node left'. It consists of
one anthracotic lymph node measuring 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm. Entire
lymph node is submitted in one cassette.

3. Part three is labeled 'level 5 lymph node left'. It consists of
one anthracotic lymph node measuring 1 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. Entire lymph
node is submitted in one cassette.

4. Part four is labeled 'level 6 lymph node left'. It consists of
one lymph node measuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. Entire lymph node is
submitted in one cassette.

5. Part five is labeled 'level 7 lymph node'. It consists of one
anthracotic lymph node measuring 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. Entire lymph
node is submitted in one cassette.

MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY

KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS

 

RESULTS: Wild-type gene

INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13
of the KRAS gene.

COMMENT:

Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor
prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly
associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.

This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of

the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated

for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in
fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In
particular the test performance has been established in samples of
colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor
these mutations, although several other tissues are also known to
harbor KRAS mutations (e. g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,
appendix, etc.).

Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide
additional information regarding this patient's probability of
response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if

clinically indicated. See references.

METHOD/LIMITAT IONS:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY

EGFR Mutation Analysis

Body Site: Left lower lobe of lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: Positive for the E746_A750de15 mutation in Exon 19.

INTERPRETATION: Deletion mutations in exon 19, mostly involving the
LREA motif, are reported to correlate with responsiveness to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitor in patients with non-small-cell lung

carcinoma.

COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 80% tumor
cellularity upon pathologist review.

E746_A750de15 corresponds to 2236_2250de115.

A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was
identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
significance.

Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential
responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (T KI)
therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a
sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.

This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell

lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change
during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this
result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation

in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.

This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.

METHOD/LIMITATION:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is

selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified

and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by

bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.
