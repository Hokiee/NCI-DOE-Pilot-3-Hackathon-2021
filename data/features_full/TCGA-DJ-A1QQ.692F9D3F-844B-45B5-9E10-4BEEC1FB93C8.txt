Gross Description:

1). The specimen ls received fresh. labeled " thyroidectomy' and consists of a markedly disrupted, unorlented thyroid weighing 16
g. The presumed right lobe measures 4.5 x 2.3 x 1.1 cm cm , the presumed left lobe measures 3.8 x 2.5 x 1.6 cm and the isthmus
measures 2.2 x 1.8 x 0.7 cm. The external surface ls covered by a thin ﬁbrous capsule and scant skeletal muscle. There are
several lymph nodes identiﬁed measuring up to 0.6 x 0.5 cm in greatest dimensions. which are entirely submitted. The specimen
shows several previously incised areas. The first Inclsed area is at a uniloculated cystic nodule involving the medial left lobe and
left lateral isthmus. The nodule measures 3.0 x 2.2 x 2.0 cm. The Inner surface shows a friable brown-tan papillary excrescence
measuring 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. An additional previously Inclsed area on the right lobe reveals a 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.9 cm ill defined. firm,
white-tan nodule which abuts the capsular surface. A sample of this area ls given to TPS. The outer surface of the specimen is
inked black. On cut section of the left lobe. there Is an ill-deﬁned. firm: white-tan nodule measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm which abuts

the capsular surface. Sections through the remaining tissue reveal red tan and beefy appearance. Specimen is entirely
submitted.
