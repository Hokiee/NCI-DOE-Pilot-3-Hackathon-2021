rinai surgical Pathology Report

Procedure: q 5’ 63‘4, I
Diagnosis " ’1
A. Lung, right upper lobe, excision — EMD

Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, 3.3 cm in greatest dimension,
without definite pleural invasion (pT2a, see microscopic description).
Bronchial and vascular resection margins negative for tumor.

Hilar lymph nodes negative for tumor.

B—F. Lymph nodes, level 11, 4R, level 8, level 7, and 2R, excisions —
Negative for tumor.

Microscopic Description:
The following template summarizes the findings in this case:

Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma, comprising the mass lesion in part A.
There may be a minor component of squamous cell carcinoma also present,
but it is not a significant component of the tumor.

Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated

Primary tumor (pT): pT2a. The tumor is 3.3 cm in greatest dimension,
without definite pleural invasion. An elastic stain is examined on
block A5 to aid in assessment.

Margins of resection: Negative for tumor

Direct extension of tumor: Not definitively identified

Vascular invasion: Favor lymphatic invasion present focally.

Regional lymph nodes (pN): pNO. The hilar lymph nodes in part A, as
well as the separately submitted lymph nodes in parts B—F, are negative
for tumor.

Distant metastasis (pM): Not applicable

Other findings: There are some inflammatory changes within the
carcinoma.

Clinical Information
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Lung mass

Intraoperative Consultation
A. Adenocarcinoma.

Gross Description

A. Received fresh in a container labeled "right upper lobe" is a 182 g,
16 x 9.8 x 3.5 cm, lobectomy specimen. The bronchial stump is 1 cm
long , and 1.4 x 0.7 cm in cross—section. The bronchial stump and
vessels at the margin are grossly unremarkable. Several staple lines
are present along the medial aspect of the specimen. The pleura is
generally tan-pink-purple. There is an area of pleural retraction,
which is inked, with a palpable underlying mass lesion. On sectioning

this area, there is a circumscribed 3.3 x 3 x 2.5 cm rubbery tan‘white
mass, subjacent to the pleural retraction. The mass extends very
peripherally, but there is no definite pleural invasion grossly. The
mass is not near the margin. The lung away from the mass is spongy and
tan—red, without additional focal lesion. There are a few soft
gray~black hilar lymph nodes present, up to 1 cm greatest dimension.
Tissue is taken for tissue procurement per the clinical request.

RS—lO.

BLOCK SUMMARY: Al — bronchial margin; A2 — vascular margins; AFSl,A3—A6
— tumor, including relation to pleural surface and to uninvolved lung;
A7,A8 — lung away from tumor: A9 — three hilar lymph nodes.

B. Received fresh in a container labeled "level 11" are two soft
tan—pink to gray—black lymph nodes, averaging 0.6 cm in greatest
dimension. AS-l.

C. Received fresh in a container labeled "4R node" are three soft
tan-pink to gray~black lymph nodes, ranging from 0.4 cm to 1.1 cm in
greatest dimension. AS—l.

D. Received fresh in a container labeled "level 8" are three soft
tan—pink to gray—black lymph nodes, ranging from.0.5 cm to 1 cm in
greatest dimension. As—l.

E. Received fresh in a container labeled "level 7“ is a desiccated 0.2
cm in greatest dimension gray-black tissue fragment. AS—l.

F. Received fresh in a container labeled "2R" are two soft
tan—pink—yellow lymph nodes, 0.2 cm and 0.9 cm in greatest dimension.
AS—l.
