My signature is attestation that I have personally reviewed the
submitted
material(s) and the final diagnosis reflects that evaluation.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in nine parts.
Part 1 is received labeled with the patient' s name, initials xxx and
"left
larynx biopsy." The specimen is composed of tissue fragments with
overall
dimensions of 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm and is entirely submitted in cassette
1AFS.
Part 2 is received labeled with the patient' s name, initials xxx, MRN,
and
"left neck dissection, level 2." It is a 12.0 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm
yellow—grey—brown tissue with palpable nodularities. The dimension of
the
largest possible lymph node is 2.0 cm and possible lymph nodes are
submitted
in cassettes 2A—2E (2C and 2E represent bisected lymph nodes).
Part 3 is labeled with the patient' s name, initials xxx, MRN and "left
neck
level 3." It is a 4.0 x 2.0 x 0.7 cm soft, fatty tissue. The dimension
of the
largest possible lymph node is 2.0 cm and possible lymph nodes are
submitted
in cassettes 3A and 3B (3A represents the bisected lymph node).
Part 4 is labeled with the patient' s name, initials xxx, MRN and "left
neck
level 4." It is a 4.0 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm tissue. Possible lymph nodes are
submitted in cassettes 4A and 4B (4B represents the bisected lymph
node).
Part 5 is labeled with the patient' s name, initials xxx, MRN and
"right neck
dissection." It is a 4.0 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm tissue. Possible lymph nodes
are
submitted in cassettes 5A and 5B.
Part 6 is labeled with the patient' s name, initials xxx, MRN and "left
pharyngeal margin." It is a 5.0 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm mucosal tissue and is
entirely
submitted in cassette 6AFS.
Part 7 is labeled with the patient' s name, initials xxx, MRN and
"right
pharyngeal margin." It is a 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm tissue and is entirely
submitted in cassette 7AFS.
Part 8 is labeled with the patient' s name, initials xxx, MRN and "post
cricoid margin." It is a 1.0 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm tissue and is entirely
submitted

sette 8AFS.

is labeled with the patient' s name, initials, xxx, MRN and
"total
laryngectomy and left thyroid lobectomy". It consists of a 9.0 x 8.0 x
5.5 cm
total laryngectomy specimen with a 4.5 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm, 9 gram left
thyroid

lobectomy. On serial sections is a transglottic located tumor of 3.7 x
2.5 x

1.5 cm located mainly on the left side and extending to the right side
as

well. It has an irregular surface. It is 2.5 cm from the inferior
margin and

4.0 cm from the superior margin. On serial sections of the left
thyroid lobe

are 0.1 cm tan—white areas with no obvious tumor involvement. A portion
of

tumor and normal mucosa were banked.

Black = all margins
Blue = soft tissue after hyoid bone removal (not a margin)

Red = banked area.

9H and 9I tumor samples from left side in relation to epiglottis
9J and 9K tumor samples from superior to inferior on the right side
9L anterior verlying tumor.
