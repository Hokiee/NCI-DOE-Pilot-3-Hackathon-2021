{A} TOTAL LARYNGEAL PHARYNGECTOMY {CHECK ALL MARGINS) -— A total faryngopharyngectomy specimen (9 x 7.5 x 5,5
cm total), including attached unremarkable nyold cartrlege. thyroid cartilage, larynx with unremarkable mucosal surface including
the supraglattis, glottis. and subglnms and inferiorly connected with segment of trachea and proximal esophagus (4 cm in length),
Unremarkabie thyroid gland including the right (5 x 2 x 1 5), left lobe ( 4 x 3 x 1.3 cm} and isthmus, anterior so?! IISSUB Including
ekeletal muscle (65 x £35 x 15 cm).

Located In ihe posterior pharyngeal wail. :nvolwng lire left pirir‘orm sinus soft tissue= is a large Irregular firm tumor mass (7

 

x 6.6 x 2 cm) with mucosal surface ulceration and necrosis. Tumor measures 1.4 cm from the closest posterior esophageal wall
resection margin, 03 cm from the closest right superior pharyngeal mucosa edge. abutting but not involving the posterior soft
tissue margin. Tumor extends into the posterior portion of the left piriform sinus soft tissue. 2 cm from the closest pinform mucosal
edge. Tumor is not grossly involving the thyroid cartilage. Bone has submitted to hone lab for further decalcilication assessment.

The epiglottis has very local mucosal erosaon. No tumor extends into the glottis, including the vocal cord. All the right and
left lateral mucosal. esophageal mucosa and base of the tongue mucosa are taken for frozen section evaluation. Representative
sections of tumor submitted subsequently.

The thyroid cartilage is sectioned to reveal a grossly unremarkable cut surface. Representative sections of the left thyroid
cartilage are submitted in A23 and A24 after decalciﬁcation.
