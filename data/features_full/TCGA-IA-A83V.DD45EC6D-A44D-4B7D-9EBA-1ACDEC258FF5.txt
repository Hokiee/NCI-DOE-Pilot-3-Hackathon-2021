Comment: The tumor is present as a 5.0 cm mass arising within the
lower portion of the left kidney. The tumor extends beyond the
normal renal parenchyma into the perirenal adipose tissue. No
extension into renal sinus is seen. The ureteral and renal vascular
margins of excision are negative for neoplasm. No involvement of the
left adrenal gland is seen.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received is a specimen labeled "left kidney and left adrenal
gland". The specimen consists of a left kidney containing a mass and
is surrounded by an irregular envelope of fibroadipose tissue. The
neoplasm does not appear to extend into the perirenal fat. The
specimen weighs 344.50 grams after removing perirenal fat. The
specimen is sectioned from superior to inferior. A mass involves the
lower portion of the kidney. On section the tumorous mass is
roughly spherical and measures 5 x 5 x 4 cm. It is composed of
yellow tissue with foci of hemorrhage and softening. The tumor does
not invade the pelvocalyceal system or the renal sinus. The tumor is
sharply demarcated from the renal parenchyma which appears
essentially unremarkable. Satellite nodules of tumor are not
present in the renal tissue. Dissection of the renal veins
particularly those draining the area of the mass does not show
intravascular presence of the neoplasm. The adrenal gland is present
and measures 5 x 4 x 0.4 cm and weighs 11.31 grams. It is not
involved by the mass. A 5 cm segment of ureter is present and is
essentially unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted in
formalin with the following designations: #1 ureter and vessels; #2
pelvis; #3 sinus; #4 - #6 tumor in respect to the capsule; #7 tumor;
#8 perirenal fat; #9 adrenal gland.
