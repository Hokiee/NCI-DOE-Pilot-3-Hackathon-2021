- GIioblastoma multiforme, WHO grade IV

COMMENT:

A high percentage of tumor cells (greater than 20%) immunostaining for MGMT has been reported to be
associated with a reiatively diminished response to Hence,
the 90% result in this case suggests the possibility of a relatively diminished response to _

 

was si nificantl correlated with a clinical response of glioblastomas to EGF R kinase inhibitors
Hence the preserved expression of PTEN in this case, when com me
with EGFvaII mutation, permits a possibiiity of this tumor being responsive to EGFR—kinase inhibitors.

Recent studies have shown that co-expression of EGFRvItl and PTEN as detected by immunostainini

Retained expression of PTEN was found to be associated with a more favorable prognosis in patients
with high grade gliomas

 

subclasses of high-grade glioma predict prognosis, delineate a pattern of disease progression, and
resemble stages in neurogenesis. Cancer Celt. —

Recent studies indicated an adverse prognostic significance of increased expression of Iarninin beta 1
and decreased expression of Iaminin beta 2 predicting a worse survival of patients with gliomas.
Association between laminin-B and gliat tumor grade, recurrence, and patient survival.

   

Accordingly. elevated expression of beta 1 and suppressed expression of beta 2 in this tumor predict
more aggressive behavior.

Presence of activated (phosphoryiated) p42144 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (pMAPK) often is
indicative of an upreguiation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. It has been shown to be associated
with a relative resistance to radiation therapy in gliobtastoma multiforme

Correspondingly, a high percentage of tumor cetls immunoreactive to pMAPK antibody in this case may
predict a relative resistance to radiation therapy.

The use of these tests in guiding therapy has iimitations. Review of the relevant literature and clinical
correlation is advised. These test results do not obligate or preclude use of the relevant therapeutic
agents.

FLUORESCENCE lN SITU HYBRIDIZATION (FISH) for EGFR in BRAIN

 

 

Tissue Block: K7

RESULTS: NORMAL EGFR & chromosome 7 signal pattern

Number of cells evaluated: 40

INTERPRETATION:

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (F iSH) analysis on a brain tumor sample from this patient with Abbott
Molecular probes specific for the centromere of chromosome 7 (control probe) and the short arm (EGFR-
7p12) of chromosome 7 was performed. The control sample gave expected results.

These studies did not detect any aberrant signal patterns of EGFR in the 40 nuclei examined, with an
EGFR gene to Cep 7 signal ratio of 10.

NOTE: /

1. Samples are considered positive in brain if the EGFR to CEP 7 signal ratio is 2 2.0 in 2 10% of ‘
analyzed cells or tumors with four or more copies of the EGFR gene in 2 40% of the cells (high

polysomy).
2. Samples are considered inconclusive, requiring consult with the pathologist, in brain it the EGFR to

CEP 7 signal ratio is 2 2.0 in <10% of analyzed cells or when four or more copies of the EGFR gene in <
40% of the cells.
