, Final Diagnosis

  

east, left, wide local excision No. l: [nﬁltLatingguctaleachingrnm Nottingham grade II (of III) [tubules 3/3, nuclei 2/3, mitoses
1/3; Nottingham score 6/9], forming a mass (1.5 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm) [AJCC pTlc]. Ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate nuclear
grade, solid type comprises approximately 5-25% of the tumor volume. Angiolymphatic invasion is absent. The non-neoplastic
breast parenchyma shows proliferative ﬁbrocystic changes. Biopsy site changes are present. The nipple is unremarkable. All
surgical resection margins, after a single re-excision of the anterior margin and a single re-excision of the inferior margin, are

negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 0.5 cm, anterior inferior margin).

Sentinel lymph nodes; left axillary Nos. 1, 2, and 3; sentinel biopsy: Multiple (4) left axillary sentinel lymph nodes are negative
for metastatic carcinoma [AJCC pNO (i-) (sn)]. Immunohistochemical cytokeratin stain was performed on the parafﬁn embedded
sentinel lymph node tissue and conﬁrms the H&E impression. Blue dye is identiﬁed in lymph nodes Nos. 1 and 3. Blue dye is
not present in lymph node No. 2.

Lymph node, left axillary, biopsy: A single left axillary lymph node is negative for tumor.

Breast, left, excisional biopsy: Fibroadenoma and previous biopsy site changes. Fibrocystic changes are present. Lateral biopsy
margins are negative for tumor.
