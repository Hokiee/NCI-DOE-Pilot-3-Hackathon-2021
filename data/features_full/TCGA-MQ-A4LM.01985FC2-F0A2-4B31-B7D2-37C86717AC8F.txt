NOTE: Histologic examination of the submitted pericardium, pleura,.and
diaphragm show the mixed phase malignant mesothelioma of epithelioid and
spindle cells components interspersed by collagenous and fibrous stroma. There
is moderate nuclear atypia and scattered mitotic figures along with a few
atypical mitoses. The tumor infiltrates into the adjacent adipose tissue and
focal lymphoid infiltration. In the specimen labeled (diaphragm) the tumor is
adherent to skeletal muscle fibers.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled anterior thoracoscopy site. The specimen consists
of a piece of adipose tissue measuring 4.4 x 2.2 x 0.8 cm, partially covered by
an ellipse of white-tan skin measuring 3.6 x 1.4 cm. A longitudinal scar is
noted in the middle of the skin measuring 2 cm in length. The cut surfaces
show the specimen to be composed of 95% of adipose tissue and 5% fibrous
tissue. The representative sections are submitted in two cassettes.
8. Received fresh labeled pericardium. The specimen consists of a p‘ece of
pericardium and attached adipose tissue. The pericardium measures ?.5 x 5 cm
and is pink-tan, and the adipose tissue measures 5.5 x 5 x 1.5 cm. Numerous
tan, rubbery nodules are attached both to the surface of the pericardium and
the attached adipose tissue, the largest, which is attached to the pericardium
measures 1.1 cm in maximal dimension. The representative sections are

a“; submitted in four cassettes.

C.

D. Received fresh labeled level 4. The specimen consists of multiple pieces of
tan to red soft tissue ranging in size from 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm to 2.5 x 1 x 0.5
. The specimen is submitted in toto in two cassettes.

E. Received fresh labeled level 10. The specimen consists of a dark red to
dark gray lymph node measuring 2 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm. The lymph node is
multisected- The cut surfaces showed dark gray, anthracotic surfaces. The
specimen is submitted in toto in three cassettes.

F. Received fresh labeled level 7. The specimen consists of mutiple pieces of
dark red anthracotic tissue compatible with lymphoid tissue and ranging in size
from 1.7 x 1 x 0.5 cm to 3 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto
in five cassettes.

G. Received fresh labeled level 9. The specimen consists of a piece of ten to
dark red soft tissue measuring 1.5 x l x 0.4 cm. The specimen is submitted in
toto in one cassette.

H. Received fresh labeled phrenic nerve. The specimen consists of an elongated
piece of tan to yellow soft tissue measuring 5.1 cm in length and ranging from
0.2 to 0.5 cm in thickness. The specimen is serially sectioned and the

representative sections are submitted in two cassettes.

I. Received fresh labeled visceral pleura. The specimen consists of multiple
pieces of pink—tan serosal tissue compatible with pleura which are smooth and
shiny on one surface and roughened on the other surface. They range in size
from 1.8 x 0.9 cm through 11 x 5.7 cm and measure less than 0.2 cm in
thickness.

J. Received fresh labeled pleura. The specimen consists of a flat, pink-tan
fibromembranous tissue compatible with pleura which measures 33 x 25 cm on its
surface and ranges from 0.1 to 1 cm in thickness. Multiple nodularities are
noted in different areas of the specimen and range in size from 0.3 cm to 3.5 x
2.3 cm. A large plaque like, appearance of ten to yellow thickening is also
noted in one area and measures 6.5 x 5.5 cm. Areas of attached adipose tissue
are also noted and measures 9 x 5 x 2.3 cm. The cut surfaces of the Plaque in
the nodular areas show rubbery, homogenous tan tissue. The representative
sections are submitted in eight cassettes. The specimen also includes another
piece of adipose tissue which is partly covered by serosal tissue.
Representative sections including sections of a nodular area and a lymph node
are submitted in cassettes #9 and #10.

K. Received fresh labeled posterior thoracoscopy site. The specimen consists
of an ellipss.o£ skin with underlying subcutaneous and adipose tissue. The
skin ellipse is white-tan.and measures 4.7 x 3 cm and the underlying tissue has
a depth oﬁ 4 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned. The cut surfaces show,

. 75% adipose tissue and 25% fibrous tissue, the fibrous tissue is mainly
localized to the central area of the specimen and ellipse stellate shaped
fashion. The representative sections are submitted in two cassettes.

L. Received fresh labeled diaphragm. The specimen consists of a portion of
diaphragm measuring 25 x 13 cm on its surface and ranging in thickness from 0.5
to 0.8 cm. lhe thicker areas are located.in the middle of the specimen and
comprise a firm, tan plaque in this area. This plaque is noted especially on
the-pleural surface and measures 10.5 x 6.5 cm. The peritoneal surface is
partly covered by serosa in an area measuring 15 x 10 cm and no significant
abnormality is noted on this surface. Other nodular areas are noted in the
periphery of the pleural surface and range from 0.5 to 1.7 cm in their maximum
dimensions. The cut surfaces show part of the plaque-like area to be composed
of dense fibrous tissue compatible with the membranous portion of the
diaphragm, however. in some areas, there is ten rubbery thickening overlying
the fibrous tissue. These thickenings are similar to the nodularities in the
previous portions. The representative sections are submitted in six
cassEttEs.
