(A) RIGHT ADRENAL SPARING RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY:

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CLEAR CELL TYPE, FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3 (7.0

CM IN DIAMETER).
TUMOR EXTENDS TO ADIPOSE TISSUE OF THE RENAL SINUS.
Margins of resection free of tumor.
(3) REGIONAL LYMPH NODE:
One lymph node, no tumor present (011).
(C) ADDITIONAL REGIONAL LYMPH NODE:
One lymph node, negative for tumor (011).

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) RIGHT ADRENAL SPARING RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY - A kidney with
surrounding perinephric fat measuring overall 19.0 x 11.0 x 5.5 cm. Cut
section reveals a yellow variegated, well-circumscribed mass in the
lower pole of the kidney measuring 7.0 x 6.0 x 5.0 cm. The tumor
appears to infiltrate focally into the renal sinus and pushes into the
perinephric fat. The uninvolved renai parenchyma appears unremarkable.
The renal vein and ureter margins are negative for gross tumor. One
possible lymph node is identified adjacent to the renal hilum (0.5 x 0.4

x 0.3 cm). No adrenal gland is identified.

SECTION CODE: A1, renal vein margin, ureter margin and one
possible lymph node; A2, tumor to perinephric fat; A3 and A4, tumor to
renal sinus; A5-A6, tumor to renal parenchyma; A7-A8, tumor; A9,
uninvoived renal parenchyma.

(B) REGIONAL LYMPH NODE â€” A single lymph node measures 4.0 x 2.0 x 0.8
cm. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in B1433.

(C) ADDITIONAL REGIONAL LYMPH NODE - A single lymph node measures 2.0 x
1.0 x 0.6 cm. The s ecimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted
in 01 through 02. _
