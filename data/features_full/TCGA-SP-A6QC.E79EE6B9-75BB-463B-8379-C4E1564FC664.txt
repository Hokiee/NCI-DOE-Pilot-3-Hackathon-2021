Diagnosis

Adrenal, Left Adrenalectomy;

-PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA (See comment and microscopic description)
Cornment

immunohistochemical stains (Synaptophysin, chromogranin, $100) will be performed and a supplementary report will be
issued when these are complete.

Electronically veriﬁed by:

 

Clinical History
Pheochr-omocytoma

Gross Description
The specimen container labeled with the patient’s name and as "left resection", contains a tan tumor mass with ﬁbrous

adhesion on the capsular surface as well as some adipose tissue received in 10% buffered formalin. The specimen
weighs 95.0 grams and is painted with silver nitratelt measures 6.0 x 6.0 x 3.0 cm. The capsular surface of the tumor
mass is composed of yellow adrenal tissue. The cut surface and content of the mass is solid and rubbery as well as dark
brown. There are diffuse cystic Spaces in the specimen ranging in size from 0.1 cm in diameter up to 1.0 cm in diameter.
One piece of tumor and one piece of adrenal gland are taken for tissue banking.

1A -H representative sections.

Microscopic Description

Sections show a tumor composed of iarge polygonal cells arranged in nests and trabeculae. in areas, these structures
are separated by ﬁbrovascular septa, forming a Zellballen pattern. In other areas, there is marked sinusoidal dilation.
within the septa. The cells exhibit predominantly a granular basophilic cytoplasm. with oval and round nuclei, containing
vesicular chromatin and small nucleoli. in one area, marked nuclear pleomorphism is seen, including nuclear gigantism.

Foot of hyaline globules, and melanin pigment within the cytoplasm are seen in some cells. There are areas of
hemorrhage in the specimen. The tumor is present at the painted margins. There is no evidence of lymphovascular
invasion. The above morphologic and histologic features are that of a pheochromocytoma.

Addendum Comment

Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumor is strongly synaptophysin and chromogranin positive. There is $100
positivity primarily in the intervening sustentacular cells within the tumor. The above lmmunohistochemical stains are
consistent with the diagnosis of a pheochromocytoma.
