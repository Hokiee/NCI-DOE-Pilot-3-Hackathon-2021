DIAGNOSIS:

1] LUNG, LEFT UPPER DORE: BIOPSY!
- NGN-SMALB CELL CARCINOMA-

23 LYMPH NUDE, LEVEL XI: BIOPSY:
- TWO BENIGN LYHPH NOD23 (0(2).

— SQUAMOUB CELL CARCINOMA. WI?“ FOCAL PSEUDOVASCULAR CHANGES, OF LEFT
UPPER L033, HOURLY DIFFERENTIATED.

- THE TUMOR MEASURES 3.4 x 3.0 X 2.3.

— EXTENSIVE VASCULAR INVASION IS PRESENT.

— PERIRBURAL INVASION IS PRESENT.

~ THE BRONCHIAD MARGIN IS FREE OF THEOR-

- THE PLEURA IS FREE OF TUMOR.

- NO 1" SITE CARCINOMA IS IDENTIFIED.

u THE HON~NEOPLASTIC LUNG SHOWS THE FOLLOWING nBNORMALITYtIES):
EMPRYSEMATOUS CHANGES, RESPIRRTORY BRONCHIOLITIS. RARE SHALL NON-NEGROTIZING
INTRAPULMONARY GRANULOHAS.

- THE LYEPK “ODE STATUS IS AS FOhLOWS (EXPRESSED as THE NUMBER OF METASEATIC
NOD33 IN RELATIOH TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOBBS EXAMINED): PERIBRONCHIAL:
4f6.

m EXTRANODAL KXTENSION IS PRESENT.- HETASTATIC CRRCIROHA Is ALSO IDENTIYIBD
IN RN INTRAPULMONRRY LYHPH NUDE, WHICH 13 MORE THAN 3 CM FROM THE MAIN
TUMOR.

NOTE: IMMUHOSThINS SHOW THAT THE TUMOR CEELS ARE POSITIVE POE 6K7 AND
