1)Speclmen received fresh, labeled "protracheal tissue" and consists of tan-pink tissue fragment measuring 0.6x0.4x0.2 cm.
Entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis.

Summary of sections:
FSC- frozen section control

2. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "total thyroid" and consists of a thyroid weighing 27.5 g. The right lobe measures 6.2 x
2x 2 cm. the left lobe measures 5.5x 2.2 x 2.1 cm and the isthmus measures 1.5 x 1 x 0.5 cm. The external surface is covered by a
thin ﬁbrous capsule. The posterior surface of the specimen is inked black. and the anterior is inked purple. Sectioning reveals a
homogeneous tan nodule (1.8 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm) located in the left lobe. There is a second nodule 1.1 cm In diameter located adjacent
to the first nodule, The right lower lobe has a 2 x 1.5 cm nodule with a heterogeneous tan and white cut surface. Se 'ons through
the remaining tissue reveal red—brown unremarkable cut surface. The remaining thyroid parenchyma is red tan and eefy.
Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for TPS. The remaining tissue is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.
