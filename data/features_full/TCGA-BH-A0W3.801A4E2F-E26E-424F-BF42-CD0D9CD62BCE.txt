INTERPRETATION
nuc ish(D1721.ERBBZ)x2~6[80]

NO ampliﬁcation of the HER-ZINEU gene was seen by inlerphase FISH analysis.
RESULTS:

Fluorescence In situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed on a formalin-fixed Block 18 (Left segmental mastectomy 10:00)
using the DNA probe for the HER-2/NEU gene ’ An adequate number of invasive tumor cells were
present and evaluated by four Independent observers. The mile or HtR-Z/NEU signals (ERBBZ) to chromosome 17 centromere
signals I was determined to be 1.12. A ratio of greater than 2.2 is considered to be ampliﬁed with ratios of 1.80 to 2.20 in
the equivocal range; therefore. this specimen Is not ampliﬁed. The average number of HER-ZINEU signals per cell was 1._1_0_.
The average number of signals for the chromosome 17 centromere was 231- Many of the cells exhibited 3 or more signals for
both the HER-ZINEU gene and for the chromosome 17 centromere. This may be indicative of either polyploldy or anouploidy
tor chromosome 17. Concurrent positive and negative control specimens showed the expected results.

This FISH test is performed using a modiﬁcation of the Vysis FDA approved Petthsion HER-2 DNA Probe Kl! (1:2 LSI HER-Zlneu
I new 7 probe : T-denhyb-Z buffer). This FISH test was developed and Its performance determined by the

Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA ‘88. this laboratory has established and vennea the tests
