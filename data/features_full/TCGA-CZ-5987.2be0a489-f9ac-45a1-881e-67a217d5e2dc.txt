PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:

 

A. SPECIMEN DESIGNATED "RIGHT KIDNEY":

/ RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, clear cell type (5.5 cm), Fuhrman nuclear grade
II IV.
No capsular or perirenal soft tissue invasion present.

The tumor invades the renal vein and is present at
the renal vein margin.
The renal artery, ureter, and Gerota's fascia resection
margins are negative for tumor.
AJCC Classification (6th Edition): T3b Nx Mx.
Adrenal gland with no significant pathologic change.
The non—neoplastic kidney will be evaluated by Renal Pathology, and the

findings will be reported in an addendum.

CLINICAL DATA:

History: with renal tumor.
Operation: Right radical nephrectomy.
Operative Findings: Not given.

Clinical Diagnosis: Right renal cancer.

TISSUE SUBMITTED:
m. new <_>-
GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and unit
number, and consists of a 1347—gram, 28.0 x 13.0 x 8.0 cm right nephrectomy
specimen, partially surfaced by freely-mobile, smooth, tan/white Gerota‘s
fascia (20.5 x 14.0 cm, inked black), and with abundant attached perirenal
adipose tissue (soft tissue margin inked blue). The right kidney (13.5 x 6.5 x
5.9 cm) demonstrates a well-circumscribed, seemingly encapsulated, 5.5 x 4.5 x
4.0 cm, yellow/orange, lobulated, multifocally hemorrhagic, solid tumor in the
upper pole, which abuts and expands but does not grossly appear to invade the
renal capsule. The tumor grossly invades multiple branches of the renal vein,
including the main vessel, and is present at the renal vein margin. The
closest Gerota's fascia is within 0.3 cm; the closest blue-inked soft tissue

, margin is within 2.5 cm. There are no grossly apparent satellite nodules noted
upon sectioning the remaining renal parenchyma. The corticomedullary junction
is distinct. The renal pelvis is lined by hemorrhagic, otherwise unremarkable
urothelium. 0.3 cm of grossly involved renal vein (diameter 1.8 cm) extends
from the renal hilum along with 0.3 cm of renal artery (diameter of 0.3 cm),
and 3 cm of right ureter (diameter is 0.6 cm). Separately received with the
specimen is a questionably complete, 5.9 x 1.9 x 0.4 cm, disrupted adrenal
gland. In addition, there are multiple fragments of smooth, nodular tumor and
clotted blood received in the specimen container (aggregating 6.5 x 6.5 x 3.0
cm). Representative tumor has been Submitted to the tissue bank.
Representative tumor is submitted for cytogenetics studies and held for
possible electron microscopy studies. Representative normal cortex has been
submitted to the tissue bank, EM, and IF. Representative normal medulla has
been submitted to the tissue bank. The specimen has been photographed.

ADDENDUM TO REPORT RENAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION OF KIDNEY PARENCHYMA:

RIGHT KIDNEY, NEPHRECTOMY:

ARTERIAL AND ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS, MODERATE TO SEVERE, VASOCONSTRICTION, AND
JUXTAGLOMERULAR CELL HYPERPLASIA (See NOTE)

MILD TO MODERATE CHRONIC CHANGES OF THE KIDNEY PARENCHYMA, INCLUDING:

- FOCAL GLOBAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS, MILD, PREDOMINANTLY SUBCAPSULAR,
AND MOST LIKELY SECONDARY TO VASCULAR DISEASE (3.1% OF GLOMERULI);

- TUBULAR ATROPHY AND INTERSTITIAL FIBROSIS, MODERATE (20% OF
PARENCHYMA), WITH SUBCAPSULAR FIBROSIS

NOTE:
Chronic changes: Moderately advanced chronic changes are present, including

global glomerulosclerosis affecting 3.1% of glomeruli, tubular atrophy and
interstitial fibrosis affecting 20% of the cortical parenchyma, and a mild
degree of vascular scarring, including subcapsular fibrosis. Because these
changes are a result of functional adaptations to nephron loss from any
glomerular, tubular, interstitial, vascular, or mass-replacing process, a
similar degree of chronic damage would be expected in the contralateral kidney.
In this case the vascular changes are significant, with arterial and arteriolar

sclerosis, moderate to severe.
The kidney parenchyma has been reviewed by _.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
Light Microscopy: Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin—embedded tissue (block

A7) were evaluated using H&E, PAS, silver methenamine, and AFOG
(trichrome) stains.

The sample consists of cortex and medulla. There are 224 glomeruli present, of
which 7 (3.1%) are globally sclerosed, and 1 show segmental glomerulosclerosis.
rThe remaining glomeruli show mild expansion of the mesangial areas. There are
,no discernible craters or double contours of the glomerular capillary wall
basement membranes. There is juxtaglomerular cell hyperplasia. Several distal
tubules contain PAS-positive hyaline casts. The interstitium contains a mild
mononuclear cell inflammatory infiltrate in areas of tubular atrophy.
Approximately 20% of the cortical parenchyma shows tubular atrophy and
rinterstitial fibrosis with subcapsular fibrosis mild. Arteries and arterioles
exhibit moderate to severe degree of sclerosis.

INTERPRETATION:
Eight of 10 metaphases contained clonal aberrations described above including

loss of the short arm of chromosome 3, which is a characteristic finding in
renal Cell carcinoma, clear cell type.

COMMENTS:
Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the

standard methods employed. Chromosome analysis was performed at a level of 400
bands or greater.
