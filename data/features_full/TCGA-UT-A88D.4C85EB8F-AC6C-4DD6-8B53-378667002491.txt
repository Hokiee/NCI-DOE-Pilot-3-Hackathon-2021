HiSTOPATHOLOGY REPORT :
CLINICAL Morse:
Probable masotheiioma

MACROSCOPIC:

'Parielal pleura‘. The specimen consists of live irregular pink membranous pieces of tissue measuring between 3mm and
18x10x3mm in maximal dimension. each bearing lirm thickened white nodules measuring between 2mm and 5mm In
maximal dimension. All embedded. (Block A and B - 4p each. C — 3p). A PAS diapase has been requested In each block.

MiCROSCOPlC:

Sections of pleura including pleural adipose tissue contain a malignant inﬁltrate. The malignant are arranged in cohesive
aggregates with tubulopapillary clefls and mlcropapiilary areas. The epilhellold cells have large irregular nuclei with
prominent nucleoli and a variable amount of eoslnophilic to clear cytoplasm. There is a background ﬁbrous stroma. The
malignant cells inﬁltrate between islands of fat cells. Areas of fat necrosis are also present. No intrecytoplasmlc mucin is
seen on PAS diastase stain.

lmmunohlstochemlcal stains show that the malignant cells are positive for CK516 and HBMEl, and negative for “l'i'Fl,
M0031 and monoclonal CEA. The histological features and immunohistochemlcal proﬁle is compatible with malignant
mesothelioma of epithelloid type.

DIAGNOSIS:

PARIETAL PLEURA - MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA, EPiTHELlOlD SUBTYPE
