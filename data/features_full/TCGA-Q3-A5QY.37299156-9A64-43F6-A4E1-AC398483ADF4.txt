1. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name and "Whipple," is a 250 g specimen
consisting of duodenum (21 cm in length by 7 cm in circumference by 0.6 cm in wall
thickness) and pancreatic head (8 x 5 x 4 cm). There is a firm, tan—white poorly
circumscribed tumor mass in the head of the pancreas (2.7 x 2.2 x 2.0 cm) which appears to
be centered around the pancreatic duct, constricting it. The bile duct is patent and 0.4
cm in diameter. The tumor is 0.5 cm from the ampulla of Vater and does not grossly
involve the duodenal muscularis or mucosa. The tumor is 1.4 cm rrom the distal pancreatic
resection margin, which is grossly free of tumor. The lateral margins are composed of
golden adipose tissue ranging in thickness from 0.5—2.5 cm and are grossly tree of tumor
the remainder of the pancreatic parenchyma is firm and nodular. The cystic duct remnant
is 2 cm in length by 0.8 cm in diameter. The duodenal mucosa is tan to slightly dusky
with appropriate folding. Seven lymph nodes are present adjacent to the pancreas (l
superior, 6 inferior), the largest measuring 0.7 cm.
