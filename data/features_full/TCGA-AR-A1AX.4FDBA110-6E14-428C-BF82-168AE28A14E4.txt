Final Diagnosis

Breasti/left, wide local excision: Inﬁltrggggguctalga‘rgingma, Nottingham grade II (of III)
[tubules 373, nuclei 2/3, mitoses Z/E'Noningham score 7/9], forming a mass (1.9 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm)
[AJCC pTlc]. Ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate nuclear grade, comprises approximately 5-
25% of tumor volume (including the ductal carcinoma in situ, the tumor is 2.1 cm, in greatest
dimension). Angiolymphatic invasion is absent. The non-neoplastic breast parenchyma shows
proliferative fibrocystic changes. All surgical resection margins, including the separately
submitted re—excision of the medial margin, are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin,
0.5 cm, deep and inferior margin).

Lymph nodes, left axillary sentinel, excision: Multiple (8) leﬁ axillary sentinel lymph nodes are
negative for metastatic carcinoma [AJCC pNO (i-) t J].

Immunohistochemical cytokeratin stain was performed on the parafﬁn embedded sentinel lymph
node tissue and conﬁrms the H&E impression.
