SPECIMENtS):
A. CLUSTER OF SENTINEL NODES RIGHT BREAST
B. RIGHT BREAST MASS

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. CLUSTER OF SENTINEL NODES RIGHT BREAST
Received fresh are four tan pink lymph nodes ranging from 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.3cm to 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.6cm. A touch prep is
taken. Toto A1.
B. RIGHT BREAST MASS
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and ”right breast mass" is a previously inked 239, 7.5 x 5 x
2cm needle localized lumpectomy with radiograph. Ink code: anterior-yellow, posterior-black, superior-blue, inferior-
orange, medial-green. lateral-red. Specimen is serially sectioned from superior to inferior into 7 slices revealing a 1.5
x 1.5 x 1cm tan white ﬁrm well circumscribed mass, 0.1cm from the closest posterior margin in slices 4-5. A portion
of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representatively submitted:
B1: superior margin slice 1
82: slice 2
33-84: slice 3
85-86: slice 4 with mass in B6
37-89: slice 5 with mass in 88
810-812: slice 6
313-815: inferior margin slice 7
