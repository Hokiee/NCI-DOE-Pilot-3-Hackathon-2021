identified. ‘

Sections of the anterior cul—de—sac nodule also Show papillary serous adenocarcinoma.

Sections of the specimens submitted as “right adnexa“ and 'left adnexa" show extensive
Papillary Serous adenocarcinoma involving fibrovascular tissue and adipose tissue..At

both sites, extensive lymphvascular space invasion by tumor is present. Consistent with

the lack of ovarian parenchyma on gross examination, microscopic examination of these
extensively sampled specimens also shows no evidence of ovarian parenchyma. We do note that
a short segment of fallopian tube is present in the section from the specimen labelled "left
adnexa', with surface involvement by papillary serous adenocarcinoma. Sections of the "left
adnexa' also show an organizing thrombus in a medium sized vein.

Based on the extensive_involvement of the omentum, and the small size and lack of ovarian

A: ANTERIOR CUL DE SAC NODULE
B: RIGHT ADNEXR

D: OM'ENTUM

Gross Description The specimens are received in four formalin—filled containers, each
labeled with the patient‘s name. The first is additionally labeled “#1, anterior cul de

sac nodule" and contains two gray—tan tissues with attached mature adipose tissue measuring
3.5 X 2.3 x 0.5 and 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. The tan—gray surfaces show multinodular, finely
granular areaS: Also received in the container is a white unlabeled cassette which holds two
fragments of tan—gray tissue with attached mature adipose tissue measuring 2.5 x 0.7 x 0.3
and 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The contents of this caSSette are labeled A1 — FSl. Sections from
each fragment are submitted in cassettes A2—A3.

The second container is labeled "#2, right adnexa“ and'contains a fragment of tubular
structure measuring 2.5 x 1.5 cm with an attached, irregular, tan—gray tissue fragment with
areas of papillary projection, covered by finely granular tissue measuring 3 x 3 x 2 cm.
Also received is another fragment of irregular, tanugray tissue with papillary projections,
measuring 2 x 1 x 1 cm. No normal ovarian parenchyma is identified in serial sections.

Sectioning through adjacent tissue reveals gray~white 'l — ' in continuity with
the putative tubular structure and attached idealism.

The third container is labeled “#3, left adnexa' and contains a single fragment of
irregular, tan—hemorrhagic tissue measuring 4 x 4 x 2 cm. The surface contains multiple
papillary projections lined by finely granular areas. Serial sections Show no evidence

of ovarian parenchyma, but do show a tube—like tissue at the surface, measuring 2.5 cm in

length with 0.5 cm diameter. Labeled C1 — presumed tube; €2—C4 — tissue with micropapillary
projections.

The fourth container is labeled “#4, omentum' and holds two fragments of irregular tissue
measuring 18 x 8 x 4 cm and 8 x 4 x 3 cm. The specimens are virtually replaced by tumor, and
their outer surfaces are irregular, with areas of polypoid and micropapillary projections
throughout. Serial sections show massive areas of gravahite, homogeneous tumor admixed
with focal areas of fat and hemorrhage. The largest tumor nodules measure well over 3 cm in
greatest dimension.

Synopsis SYNOPTIC REPORTING FORM 1. A neoplasm is PRESEN
2. The HISTOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS is: Serous adenocarcinoma

3. The LOCATION(S) OF THE PRIMARY TUMOR{S) is/are: Primary peritoneal

4. The NUCLEAR (BRODERS') GRADE of the tumor is: ezuo3 (Moderately—to-poorly
differentiated)

5. Tumor involvement of the pelvic peritoneum is PRESENT.
6. Primary involvement of the omentum is PRESENT.

7. Regional lymph node metastases CANNOT BE EVALUATED.
