ADDENDA:

1p and 19q FISH studies were performed on cells within parafﬁn sections from tumor. Two hybridizations were
performed: one with a 19q probeicontrol 19p pair and one with a 1p probe/control lq pair. The 19q and 1p probes
mapped to the regions that are commonly deleted in gliomas. The 19q to 19p probe ratio was 1.02. The 1p to lg
probe ratio was 0.87. For both probes, the normal ratio is approximately 1. Any ratio less than 0.80 is consistent
with deletion of the chromosomal region of interest.

 

there was no evidence of deletion of 1p or 19q. However, approximately 70% of the cells had 3-4 copies of the 1p,
lq, 19p, and 19q probes. Similar results have been observed in other glioma specimens with gain of chromosomes
1 and 19. The results may also be consistent with tumor tetraploidy or aneuploidy.
