Gross Description:

1). The specimen is received fresh labeled, "Bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, pen-vesicle lymph node". It consists of a bladder
with attached prostate and adnexa measuring 19.0 cm from superior to inferior, 11.0 cm laterally and 5.0 cm from anterior to
posterior. The anterior aspect of the bladder is inked blue and the posterior black. The prostatic urethral margin is shaved and
submitted. The bladder is opened along the anterior midline to reveal hemorrhagic, ulcerated, indurated. necrotic tumor measuring
5.0 x 4.8 x 1.8 cm which is grossly situated within the left and right posterior walls. The tumor grossly involves both the left and
right ureteral oriﬁces. Both ureters are probed patent measuring up to 0.2 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion is sectioned to
reveal white-pink cut surface with invades the underlying fat. Possible extension to the inked fat is grossly identiﬁed. The remaining
bladder mucosa Is pink-tan with the normal folds. Two ovoid lesions measuring 0.6 x 0.4 cm are identified at the dome and right
posterior wall. Discrete perivesical lymph nodes are grossly not identiﬁed. The prostate is serially sectioned to reveal white-tan
prostatic parenchyma with multiple yellow foci and white fluid filled cysts identiﬁed. A gold thread-like material is identified within
the prostate. Representative sections are submitted sections from each prostatic quadrant and transition zone. TPS is submitted,
gross photograph taken.

Summary of sections:
UTHM — urethral margin
RUM - right ureter margin
LUM - left ureter margin

2). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Right distal pelvic lymph nodes" and consists of three pink tan ﬁrm , fatty lymph
nodes ranging from 1.5 to 3.2 cm in greatest dimension. All identiﬁed lymph nodes are submitted.

Summary of sections:

3). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left distal pelvic lymph nodes" and consists of a portion of yellow tan adipose
tissue measuring 4 x 1 x 1 cm. No palpable lymph node is identiﬁed. Entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U - undesignated

4) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "right distal ureter- unclipped end is margin“ and consists of a gray-tan segment of
ureter measuring 0.7 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter. A clip is present at one end which is inked black. The opposite end,
identified as the margin, is inked blue. The specimen is serially sectioned and totally submitted.

5) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "left distal ureter- unclipped end is margin“ and consists of a gray-tan segment of
ureter measuring 2.3 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter. A clip is present at one end which is inked black. The opposite end,
identified as the margin, is Inked blue. The specimen is serially sectioned and totally submitted.
