A. BRAIN, SITE NOT SPECIFIED, BIOPSY: INFILTRATING GLIOMA.

B,C. BRAIN, SITE NOT SPECIFIED, BIOPSIES: ASTROCYTOMA WITH
ATYPICAL FEATURES.

D. BRAIN, SITE NOT SPECIFIED, EXCISION:
WHO @Eﬁﬁ” ‘iifﬁiﬁ
MIB—l PROLIFERATION INDEX: 23%.

 

SEE MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION AND COMMENT.

Operation/Specimen: Craniotomy, brain.

Clinical History and Pace—Op Dx: — with large,

diffusely infiltrating mass.
GROSS PATHOLOGY:

SPECIMEN A: Received fresh, 1 fragment, 0.4 cm across, semi—firm,
tannish/white in toto #1.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, site not specified: Atypical
glial proliferation.

SPECIMEN B: Received fresh, 1 fragment, 0.8 cm across, semiFEirm,
tannish/brown in toto #2.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, smears: Astrocytoma, C/W high
histological grade.

SPECIMEN C: Received fresh, 0.7 cm across, semi—firm tannish—brown.
In toto #3.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, frozen section: Astrocytoma, C/W
high histological grade.

SPECIMEN D: Left frontal tumor.
FIXATIVE: Formalin.
GENERAL: Multiple small and large soft, fleshy, tan—white tissue

fragments size ranging from 0.5—2.4 cm. Cut Surface is
non—homogeneous with areas of hemorrhage.
SECTIONS: Xl-XS.

 

MICROSCOPIC: A. Portion of cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter
with slightly increased cellularity. There is an occasional atypical
nucleus. There are areas of rarefaction with prominent reactive

astrocytes.

B,C. Portions of brain tissue extensively infiltrated by a neoplastic
proliferation of glial cells with an astrocyte phenotype. The tumor
is

moderately cellular, with moderate nuclear atypia. Mitotic figures
are

not identified. Some microvessels are prominent, however, no clear
microvascular cellular proliferation is present.

D. Large portions of cerebral cortex and white matter partially or
totally effaced by‘a glial neoplastic proliferation with features
similar to thoee ones described for parts B and C. In here, however,
there are focal areas with greater cellularity ("proliferation
centers“), in which mitotic activity is readily identified. Focally,
nee—formed vessels are present, but are devoid of bone fide
microvascular cellular proliferation. There are no areas of necrosis.

SPECIAL STAINS: immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP and MlB—l were
performed on sections from block X5. The GFAP demonstrates the heavy
fibrillary component of the neoplasm, with the MIBul a proliferation
index of 23% is determined in a proliferation center.

COMMENT: In this brain there is an astrocytoma that infiltrates and
effaces the brain. The tumor has prominent gliogenesis. The
neoplastic cells have moderate nuclear atypia, and mitotic activity is
confined to some more cellular areas. The proliferation index in
these

areas is 23%. Although nee—vessels are focally prominent, there is no
definitive microvascular cellular proliferation.

These morphological features are those of an astrocytoma with focal
anaplastic transformation.
