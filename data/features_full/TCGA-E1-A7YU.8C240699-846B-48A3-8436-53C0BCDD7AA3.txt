CLINICAL HISTORY:
Anaplastic astrocytoma on outside slides.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Left temporal brain tumor" (AFl), in formalin. The specimen is a fragment
of soft yellow—tan brain which is approximately 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm in aggregate
dimensions. A portion of the tissue has been previously submitted as frozen
section AFl. The frozen section remnant is submitted in Block A1. A small

portion of tissue is retained in formalin and the remainder is submitted in
Block A2 and A3.

B. "Left temporal brain tumor", received fresh. The specimen is several
fragments of pink and yellow~tan tissue which are 2 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm in

aggregate dimensions. A small portion is retained in formalin and the
remainder is submitted in El.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
A. "Left temporal brain tumor": AFl— glioma.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

The specimen submitted as "left temporal brain tumor" consists of multiple
portions of brain which is infiltrated by a neoplastic proliferation of
malignant glial cells. Cytologically, the predominant pattern in this glial
tumor is that of cells with round to oval hyperchromatic nuclei which exhibit
a speckled chromatin pattern and punctate chromocenters lacking nucleoli.
Mitotic activity is identified in these cells. In addition there is vascular
proliferation and focal calcification in areas of tumor degeneration. Another
small component of the tumor is characterized by nuclei with elongated spindle

cells and hyperchromatic spindle shaped nuclei. Mitotic activity is also
identified in this focus of the tumor.

DIAGNOSIS:
A~B. "LEFT TEMPORAL TUMOR":

MIXED ANAPLASTIC OLIGODENDROGLIOMA~ASTROCYTOMA. SEE COMMENT.

COMMENT: The predominant tumor component of this specimen is an
oligodendroglioma and would be considered'a grade III oligodendroglioma in
some grading systems.” There is no evidence of necrosis.
