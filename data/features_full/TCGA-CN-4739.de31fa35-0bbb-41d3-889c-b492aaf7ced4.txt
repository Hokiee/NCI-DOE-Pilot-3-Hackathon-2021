GROSS DESCRIPTION:
Specimen is received in 5 parts.

Part 1 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials *and "right larynx bio sy“. Received is a single, light tan— ivory,

completed. The specimen is entirely submitted in a cassette labeled AFS.

Part 2 is received fixed. identiﬁed with the patient's name, initials .and tabeled as ”right selective neck dissection levels 274 It
consists of 11.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm oriented fragment of ﬂbroadlpose tissue and lymph nodes ("Stitch - level 28 has two strings; level 4
has one string "). On dissection multiple lymph nodes are identified measuring 0.5 and up to 2.0 cm In greatest dimension. The
largest lymph node is located at level 4.

Level 28 lymph nodes range In size from 0.3 upto 1.8 cm in greatest dimension and they are submitted as foliowe:

Level 4 lymph nodes range in size from 0.4 up to 1.8 cm in greatest dimension. They are submitted as follows:
3E — multiple lymph nodes
3F-3G — multiple lymph nodes with the largest one bisected in each.

Part 4 is received fixed identiﬁed with the patient‘s name, initialsqand “larynx." it consists of a 8.2 $8.0 x 5.0 cm previously
opened total Iaryngectomy with attached right lobe of thyroid, and yoid bone (8.2 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm)..

On inspection, there is an irregularly shaped, white, exophytic and friable mass with central ulceration measuring 2.8 x

2.5 cm. The tumor involves the right true and false vocal cord, and right ventricle. The tumor is shutting and possibly involving the
anterior commissure, and extends 0.9 cm above the false cord and 0.5 cm below the true vocal cord. Cut surface reveals the
tumor involves the thyroid cartilage, and may extend to anterior soft tissue.

The right lobe of thyroid is present measuring 3 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm and shows ﬁbrotic brown parenchyma with focal cystic nodules on
serial sectioning.

Tumor is banked for research purposes. Digital images are taken.
