Gross Description:

The specimen is received in ten parts, all labeled with the patient‘s name.
Specimen A is received fresh for frozen section evaluation additionally labeled
"bronchial margin-F8." The specimen consists of a piece of cartilage with a
eccentric lumen. The specimen measures 2 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm. The eccentric lumen
measures 0.5 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted for frozen section
evaluation. The remainder of the specimen is submitted for permanent section
evaluation in cassette A1 .

Part B is received in a formalin filled container additionally labeled "right

upper lobe." The specimen is consistent with the upper lobe of a lung. The

specimen measures 13 x 15 x 5.8 cm. There is a staple line, which is 9 cm

inferior to the bronchial margin. The pleural surface is a dull gray-tan color.

There is a central apical scar, which has a white cloudy appearance. The

specimen has been previously sectioned for tissue procurement by the

Tissue Bank. Additionally, there is a defect in the pleura of the lobe. Multiple
enlarged lymph nodes are appreciated in the peribronchial region. There are two
areas of umbilication in the pleural surface, one near the superior end of the

lobe and one near the inferior and. Serial sectioning reveals two masses

underlying both umbilications. The masses have a variegated appearance with some
areas appearing to be necrotic. The lung parenchyma has grossly visible air

spaces and several emphysematous biebs. The larger mass measures 5.4 x 5.4 x 4.9
cm, and extends into the lumen of the bronchus. This mass abuts the pleural
surface and is 0.7 cm from the bronchial margin. The smaller mass measures 1.9

x 0.9 x 1.1 cm, abuts the pleural surface and is 6.5 cm from the bronchial

margin. Four potential lymph nodes are found, the greatest dimension of each
lymph node is 2.4 cm, 2.2 cm, 1.8 cm and 1.2 cm.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

B1 large tumor nearest pleural surface;

82 large tumor;

83 large tumor;

B4 large tumor;

B5 small tumor;

86 parenchyma;

B7-8 one lymph node bisected;

89-10 one lymph node bisected;

B11—12 one lymph node bisected;

B13 one lymph node bisected;

B14 vascular margins;

B15 larger mass to include bronchus;

B16 staple line adjacent to bronchial margin/ larger mass ( over-inked
blue)

 

 

 

 

 

Specimen C is received fresh for frozen section evaluation additionally labeled
"right lower lobe." The specimen consists of a wedge of lung parenchyma. The
specimen measures 5.5 x 3.5 x 2.2 cm. There is a staple line running along the
specimen that measures 11.4 cm in length. Serial sectioning of the specimen
reveals a white mass that abuts the pleural surface. The mass measures
approximately 2.4 x 1.8 x 0.7 cm. The mass abuts the staple line.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

C1 remainder from frozen section evaluation for permanent section
evaluation;

CZ representative section through the tumor;

C3-4 mass to inked staple line.

Specimen D is received in a formalin ﬁlled container additionally labeled

"inferior pulmonary ligament." The specimen consists of a single fragment of
fibrofatty tissue with a potential lymph node. The specimen measures 1.5 x 1.2 x
0.7 cm. Further palpation reveals two potential lymph nodes, which are submitted
in whole in cassette D1.

Part E is received in a formalin filled container additionally labeled "10R."

The specimen consists of a probable lymph node, a firm fragment of tissue that
is dark red in coloration. The specimen measures 2.1 x 1.4 x 0.8 cm. The
specimen is bisected and submitted in two cassettes.

Specimen F is received in a formalin filled container additionally labeled "4R." '
The specimen consists of a fragment of fibrofatty firm tissue that measures 3.5
x 2.5 x 1.7 cm. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes F1 and F2.

Specimen G is received in a formalin filled container additionally labeled "2R."
The specimen consists of a fragment of lymph node tissue measuring 1.0 x 0.8 x
0.5 cm. The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted in one cassette.

Specimen H is received in a formalin filled container additionally labeled
"subcarinal lymph node". The specimen consists of two lymph node tissue
fragments measuring 3.0 x 1.6 x 0.5 cm for the larger one and 1.8 x 1.6 x 0.5 cm
for the small one. The entire specimen is submitted as follows:

H1 One lymph node bisected;
H2-H3 one lymph node bisected.

Specimen l is received in a formalin filled container additionally labeled

"right upper lobe true surgical margin". The specimen consists of a fragment of
bronchial margin measuring 1.7 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm. The specimen is bisected and
entirely submitted in one cassette.

Specimen J is received in a formalin ﬁlled container additionally labeled
"right lower and middle lobes". The lung measures 15.0 x 14.0 x 4.5 cm with
attached portion of bronchus that measures 6.0 cm in length and 2.0 cm in
diameter. Received are also 5 lymph nodes measuring 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm in

 

greatest dimension each. Two sections from the lung are submitted in cassettes
J1 and J2.

J3 Two probable lymph nodes;

J4 one lymph node, bisected;

J5 two lymph nodes, bisected;

J6 bronchial and vascular margins;
J7 one lymph node bisected.

The final diagnosis of each specimen incorporates the microscopic examination
findings.
