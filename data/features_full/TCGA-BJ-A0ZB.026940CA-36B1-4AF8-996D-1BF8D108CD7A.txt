ROUND: ‘ . '
3:125:15 in either BHAF or HAS genes or FiET/PTC rearrangements are found In more than 70% of papillary therid carcinomas
(1 ). BFiAFVBOOE (T1799A) mutation has been associated with more aggressrve behavior of papillary carcinoma (2. 3). The
association between BRAF VGOOE mutation and features of tumor aggressiveness have also been observed in papillary .
microcarcinomas (4). Mutations in the HAS genes or PAXE/PPAFig rearrangement occur In ~70% of follicular thyrord carcinomas:
and with lower frequency in oncocytic (Harthle cell) carcinomas (5). Regarding the specificny of these mutations for cancer, BFlA
V600E mutation and HET/PTC and PAXB/PPAFig rearrangements are overall emails for malignancy In the therid, although they
have been reported with a very low frequency in benign thyroid lesions (6). FiAS mutations occur in malignant andobenign thyroad
tumors, being found in ~40~50% of follicular and anaplastic carcinomas, 30-40% of follicular adenomas and 10-15 /o of papillary
carcinomas (6).

MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS:

 

, manual microdisssction was performed to collect tumor tissue. Specimens with the minimum of 50% of

action target are accepted for the analysis. Optical density readings were obtained. Real-time PCR was performed on the

LightCyc/er platform to amplify BRAF codons 599-601, NRAS codon 61, HHAS oodon 61, and KRAS oodons 12/13 sequences. Post-PCH melting

curve analysis was used to detect possible mutations. If required, the mutation type was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the PCH product on
DNA from samples positive for each of these mutations was used as positive controls. Ampliﬁcation at 35 cycles or earlier was

considered sufficient for the analysis. The limit of detection is approxima teiy 10-20% of alleles with mutation present in the background of normal
DNA.

MEC1 FISH STUDIES ARE NEGATIVE FOR TRANSLOCATION.
# cells analyzed: 60

# cells with translocatlon pattern: 0
# cells with the normal pattern: 60(100%)

MAMLZ translocation detection is as follows: Normal cells without the MAML2translocation contain two fusion signals. Cells with
the t anslocation pattern show one fused signal (green and orange fusion) and one separate green and one separate orange
signal. Targeted areas containing greater than 20% of cells with the translocation pattern are considered positive.

MECi FISH analysis was manually performed and quantitatively assessed by analysis of a minimum of 60 cells using the MAML2
SpectmmOrange (teiomeric) and the MAML2 SpectrumGreen (centromeric) probes.

COMMENT:

This case has been reviewed by r and all concur with the above diagnosis.
Molecular studies for thyroid carcinoma are being done and the results will follow in an addendum. We are also doing
FISH study for MAML2 to further evaluate the areas of squamous metaplasia and, more speciﬁcally, to rule out a primary

RESULTS:

BET/PTC: The targeted area of the tissue showed 1(1 .6%) of the cells with the rearrangement pattern and 60(98.4%) of the cells
with the normal pattern. The targeted ages is considered NOT rearranged for the BET/PTC region.

The RET/PTC1 Probe did not contain the rearrangement pattern.

My signature is attestation that l have personally reviewed the submitted material(s) and the above diagnosis reflects that evaluation.

RET/PTC Methodology Description:

Probe: HET/PTC Probe (10q11.2) and FlET/PTC1 Dual-Color Fusion Probe 10q11.2-10q21
Probe Description: The FIE T probe (labeled SpectrumGreen) is a 207 kb DNA probe located at band 10q11.2.
The H4 and 369 probes are approximately 100kb each (labeled in ' ‘ J, and are located at band 10q21.

RET/PTC rearrangement is suggested to be present when three RET signals are identiﬁed in greater than 8% of the analyzed
cells.

HET/PTC1 rearrangement detection is as follows: Normal cells without the FlET/PTC1 rearrangement show two pair of green and
orange signals separated. Cells with the HET/PTCl rearrangement show two pair of signals (green and orange) in juxtaposition
and one green and one orange signal separated in greater than 8% of analyzed cells within the targeted area.

HET/PTC FISH analysis was manually performed and quantitatively assessed by analysis of a minimum of 60 cells using the PTC
(369/H4) SpectrumOrange and the BET probes.
