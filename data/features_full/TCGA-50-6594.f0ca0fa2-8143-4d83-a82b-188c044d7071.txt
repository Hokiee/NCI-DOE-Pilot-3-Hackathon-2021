KRAS codon 12113 mutations are found in approximately 10-30% lung adenooarclnomas and associated with biotory of
smoking. The presence of KRAS mutation loads to resistance to EGFR therapies (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21
mutations are present in about 10% of_ and up to 40% In thmopuiation common in_ and
associated with the clinical response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2). Those mutations are mutually exclusive and
their presence may have prognostic andlor therapeutic implications (3 4). Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy
number by FISH analysis (amplification) to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical response stable disease,

time to progression, and survivai) In patients with advanced non-Small cell lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosinu itinaoe
inhibitors.

Approximately 3% of lung adenocarcinomas within the Asian population have an interstitial deletion and inversion in
chromosome 2p reaulting in the EML4/ALK fusion gene (ALK+) which is sensitive to ALK inhibitors (5.6). The prevalence
of this abnormality in the Western population Is stiil unknown. Detection of this abnormality is critical for identifying

patients eligible for therapies that target ALK enzymatic activity. EMLd/ALK rearrangements are mutually exclusive with
KRAS and EGFR mutations.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
SUMMARY STATEMENT

The posterior segmentectomy demonstrates a 2. 5 cm poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma associated with
angiolymphatic and parietal pleural invaoion. Metastatic adenooaroinoma is present in posterior and apical segment
level 11, level 10 and level 5 lymph nodes. Surgical resection margins are free of tumor. Pathologic stage I5 TBNZMX
