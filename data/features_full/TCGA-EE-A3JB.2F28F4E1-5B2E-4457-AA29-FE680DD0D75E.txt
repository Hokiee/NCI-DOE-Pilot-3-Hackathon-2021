MICROSCOPIC REPORT

1. “LESION RIGHT ARM STITCH PROXIMAL".

The sections of skin show several, roundeddeposits of metastatic melanoma in the dermis and snbcutis. The
melanoma is composed of sheets of pleomorphic epithelio” id cells that lack melanin pigment. The mitotic rate
is 20.~’mn12. There is only a mild focal lymphocytic reaction to the melanoma.

Excision appears complete with the deep margin clear by 2mm and the nearest lateral margin clear by at least
7mm.

 

2. "SEBACEOUS CYST POSIERIOR SCALP". p
The sections of ‘skin show a trichilemma'l cyst (pila‘r cyst). No evidence of malignancy is seen. Excision
appears complete
