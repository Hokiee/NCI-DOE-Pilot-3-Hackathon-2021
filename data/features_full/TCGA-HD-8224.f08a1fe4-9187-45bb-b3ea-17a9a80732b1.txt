Anterior deep margin of tongue (FSA1), biopsy:
Diffusely infiltrating squamous cell carcinoma.

Middle deep margin of tongue (FSA2):
Diffusely infiltrating squamous cell carcinoma.

Almost total glossectomy with frozen section examination:
Posterior shaved margin positive for squamous cell carcinoma.
Medial shaved margin positive for squamous cell carcinoma.
Areas of lymphovascular invasion are identified.
Perineural invasion identified.
Random sections of tongue show diffuse invasive squamous cell carcinoma
extending through multiple areas of the posterior and medial margins.
P16 immunostain will be done on block 82 and reported in an addendum.
Tumor extends all the way to tip of tongue.

Gross Description

"FSA1." All frozen section tissue is submitted in cassette “FSA1." Tea bag.
"FSA2." All frozen section tissue is submitted in cassette “FSA2.”
"FSB1." All frozen section tissue is submitted in cassette “FSB1.”
"FSBZ." All frozen section tissue is submitted in cassette “FSB2.”

"B,-." The specimen consists of a 5.7 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm right lateral portion of tongue. The posterior margin has previously
been inked green, and the medial margin has been inked black. A portion of the deep margin has remained uninked. This
area will be inked orange. The surface of the tongue has a gray-tan to white-tan, thickened, nodular appearance. There is a 2.2
x 1.7 cm gray—tan, ﬁrm central mass, which extends to the posterior, medial, and deep margins. "81-82," mass to include
medial and deep margins; "B3-B4," step sections, "BB," central tongue towards anterior tip, "B4," anterior tip; “85," mass to
include deep and posterior margins; "BB," right lateral tongue, representative.

"C-' The specimen consists of a 5.5 x 6.0 x 3.0 cm left lateral portion of tongue with new posterior, deep, and anterior
margins. The tongue has a gray-tan, wrinkled appearance. The new anterior deep margin has previously been inked black,
and the new posterior margin has been inked green. Deﬁnite tumor is grossly difficult to identify. "C1," posterior margin; "CZ,"
new anterior deep margin; "C3-CS," posterior margin; "CS-CB," anterior deep margin; “09-010," anterior deep margin; "C11,"
posterior tongue; "C12," central tongue; "C13," anterior tongue.

This case is also received with a single yellow cassette labeled —

"D, Level 1A." The specimen consists of a-4.2 x 2.7 x 1.5 cm yellow—tan, fatty fragment. On examination, 4 possible lymph
nodes are identiﬁed. These range in size from 0.5 to 1.0 cm. "D" 4p, representative.
