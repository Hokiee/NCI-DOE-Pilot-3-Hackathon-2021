Gross Description
Fourteen specimens are received. labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. Specimen A is
received fresh for intraoperative consultation and specimens B-N are received in formalin.

Specimen A is labeled "composite resection." It consists of a partial mandibulectomy specimen with attached soft
tissue measuring in toto, 7.0 x 4.8 x 3.4 cm. There are four disrupted teeth and a tooth root. The cut surface of the
soft tissue reveals a white ﬁrm lesion measuring 2.7 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm. This lesion comes to within 0.3 cm from the deep
edge on the left posterior aspect and comes to within 0.6 cm from the deep margin on the right posterior aspect. The

tumor grossly involves the mandible. The soft tissue margin is inked black. Sections are submitted as follows:

Specimen B is labeled "left neck level 1." It consists of a salivary gland measuring 4.1 x 2.3 x 1.2 cm. it also
contains a separate ﬁbroadipose fragment measuring 2.0 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm. The cut surface of the salivary gland shows

no masses or lesions. The outer surface of the salivary gland is inked black. The specimen is submitted as follows:

Specimen C is labeled "left facial node" and consists of multiple fragments of ﬁbroadipose tissue with lymph nodes

measuring in aggregate. 3.0 x 2. 5 x 0.7 cm The specimen is dissected for lymph nodes which are submitted entirely

toto, 5.9 x 4.7 x 4.5 cm. The cut surface reveals multiple positive lymph nodes ranging in size from 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm
to 3.0 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm. Sections are submitted as follows: Dictated by '

Specimen l is labeled "anterior gingiva; ink true margin" and consists of a fragment of mucosa and underiying soft
tissue measuring 5.5 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm. The specimen is oriented with blue ink marking the true margin. Blue ink is

reapplied to this surface. The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in cassettes "l1" through "l3."

specimen is submitted in cassettes "J1" through "J3." Dictated by

Specimen K is labeled "right level 1" and consists of a fragment of ﬁbroadipose tissue. muscle and a salivary gland
measuring in total 7.0 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm. The cut surface reveals a friable, white lesion adiaoent to the salivary gland
measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm. Sections are submitted as follows. Dictated by ’ ’

Specimen L is labeled "anterior mandible" and consists of a portion of the anterior mandible measuring 6.2 x 2.0 x 1.5
