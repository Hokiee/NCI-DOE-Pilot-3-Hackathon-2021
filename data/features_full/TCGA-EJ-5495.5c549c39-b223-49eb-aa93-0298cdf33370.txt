the patient Is a
He underwent a pros a e nee e Iopsy . demonstrating prostatlo

adenocarcl'noma. with a maximal Gleason score 4 + 4 = 8.

PRE—OF’ DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer.

POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: Same.

WURE: Radical retropublc prostatsctomy and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection.

 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS: .TCGA-EJ 5495
PART ‘II RIGHT PEI—VIC LYMPH NODES, EXCISIUN -
. A. MICROSCOPIC FOCUS 0F METASTATIC PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINDMA LARGELY REPLACING ONE OF
NINE (1(9) LYMPH NODES (SLIDE 1C).
3. METASTATIC FOCUS MEASURES 0.15 CM.
C. No EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IS IDENTIFIED (See comment).

PART 2: LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES. EXCISION -
NINE BENIGN LYMPH NDDES (Ola). N0 EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.

PART 3: PROSTATE, BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES, AND DILATERAL DISTAL VASA DEFERENTIA (RADICAL
PROSTATECTOMY) _

A. PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, ACINAR TYPE WITH FOCAL ONCOCYTIC AND FOCAL SIGNET RING CELL
FEATURES, GLEASON SCORE 5 + a = 8 WITH A TERTIARY GLEASON PATTERN 4 CARCINOMA
COMPONENT. GLEASON PATTERNS 4 AND 5 COMPONENTS COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY 75% OF THE
EXAMINED TUMOR VOLUME. CARCINOMA EXTENSlVELY INVOLVES BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT LOBES OF
THE PROSTATE GLAND.

MAXIMAL TUMOR DIAMETER 13 2.3 CM IN A HISTOLOGIC SECTION.

CARCINOMA COMPRISES APPROXIMATELY 40% OF THE EXAMINED PROSTATE GLAND VOLUME.
MULTIFOCAL ESTABLISHED EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IS PRESENT IN THE FOLLOWING REGIONS:
BILATERAL POSTERIOR BASE I PERISEMINAL VESICLE SOFT TISSUE (SECTIONS 3A, 3C, 3AA),
SILATERAL ANTERIOR MID PROSTATE (SECTIONS 3N AND 33), AND LEFT ANTERIOR BASE (SECTION 3T).
EXTENSIVE CARCINOMATOUS PERINEURAL INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

SEVERAL MICROSCOPIC ANGIOLYMPHATIC TUMOR EMSOLI ARE IDENTIFIED (SECTIONS so, 3T. 3RR,
AND 3W).

CARCINOMA EXTENSIVELY iNFILTRATES BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES (SECTIONS 3A AND SO) AND
RIGHT VAS DEFERENS (SECTION SE).

CARCINOMA IS PRESENT AT THE RIGHT VAS DEPERENS RESECTION MARGIN. MAXIMAL LINEAR EXTENT
OF MARGIN POSITlVlTY IS 0.3 CM. ALL OTHER SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS SAMPLED ARE
MICROSCOPICALLY FREE OF NEOPLASIA.

I. MULTIFOOAL HIGH-GRADE PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA.

J. NON—NEOPLASTIC PROSTATE WITH FOCAL GLANDULAR ATROPHY.

K. TNM PATHOLOGIC STAGE: T3b, N1, MX.

L. HISTOLOGIC GRADE: 63-4 (SEE COMMENT AND SYNOPTIC}.

COMMENT:

Parts 1 and 3: One small lymph node is largely retained by metastatic Carcinoma {slide 10), visible on the H&E stained
sectlon. The diagnosis of metastatic prostatio adenocarotnoma is supported to an immunohistochemicaf panel of stains,
demonstrating that the metastatic Carcinoma Cells are immunoreactlve for pankeratin, prostate speciﬁc antigen, and
androgen receptor, and are negative for leukocyte common antigen and 6068. Cytokeratin immunostains performed on
the other two right pelvic lymph nodes sections (slides 1A, 1B) are also performed. and Show no occult metastatic foci in
these tymph nodes. The overall pathologic N Stage Is N1. . ‘
