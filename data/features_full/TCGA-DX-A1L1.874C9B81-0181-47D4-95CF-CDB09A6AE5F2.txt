DIAGNOSIS: y

1) SOFT TISSUE, PELVIC AND LEFT RETROPERITONEAL \SARCOMA, SEGMENT OP
COLON} RESECTION:

- DEDIPPERENTIATED LIPOSARCONA.

- THE DMIFPERENTIATED COKPONENT PREDONINATES AND HAS A HIGH GRADE
NYXOFIBROSARCONA- -LIKE GROWTH PATTERN.
- THE TUMOR IS PRESENT AS TWO NASSES MEASURING 5.5 I 7.5 X 3.5 CN AND 3.5 X
3.2 I 2.6 CN, RESPECTIVELY. '

- THE TUNOR INVOLVES PERICOLONIC SOFT TISSUES AND FOCALLY INFILTRATES
INTO THE BOWEL WALL.

- FOCAL TUMOR NECROSIS IS IDENTIFIED.

- THO BENIGN LYNPK NODES (0/2) .

- TEE BOWEL, URETER, AND VASCULAR NARGINS ARE FREE OF TUNOR.

- GROSSLY, THE TUMOR IS COVERED BY A THIN TRANSLUCENT MEMBRANE, AND
NICROSCOPICALLY THE TUMOR IS PRESENT LESS THAN 1.0 Nil FROM THE INKED SOFT
TISSUE KARGIN.

2) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND, LEFT NEPHRECTONY:

- KIDNEY WITH FOCAL CAPSULAR PIEROSIS, NO TUNOR SEEN (SEE NOTE) .
- ADRENAL GLAND WITH NO SIGNIFICANT HISTOPATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS.

- TEE URETER. VASCULAR, AND SOFT TISSUE NARGINS ARE BENIGN.

NOTE: THE CAPSULE OF THE KIDNEY IS FOCALLY THICKENED. GROSSLY. MICROSCOPIC
EXANINATION OF THESE AREAS REVEALED SCATT’ERED AT‘IPICAL STRONAL CELLS WHICH
ARE INNUNOKISTOCHENICALLY NEGATIVE FOR NDNZ, CDKI AND HID-45. THESE FINDINGS
ARE CONSISTENT WITH A REACTIVE RATHER THAN NEOPLASTIC PROCESS.

3) ILIAC VEIN; EXCISION:
- PRAGKENTS OP DEDIP‘FERENTIATED LIPOSARCONA INVOLVING FIBROADIPOSE

TISSUE.
- THE VEIN IS FREE OF TUMOR.

THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL). AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

*1. Report Electronically Signed Out *‘ﬁ

Gross Deecrintion:

,

l).The specimen is received fresh and is labeled I'pelvic and left
retroperitoneal sarcoma“. It consists of an unoriented, unopened segment of
colon that measures 21.2 cm in length and 6.5 cm in greatest circumference.
The external surface is remarkable for two adherent multi-nodular, white
-yellow fleshy masses measuring 8.5 x 7.5 x 3.5 cm and 3.5 x 3.2 x 2.6 cm
respectively which are located 4.2 cm from one bowel margin (designated
margin one), 6.5 cm from the other bowel margin (designated margin two), 0.5
cm from the closest ureter margin, and 0.4 cm from the vascular margins.
These masses are centered within the subseroeal fibroadipose tissue and do
not grossly extend into the bowel wall. The cut surfaces of the masses are
heterogeneous with areas appearing soft and gelatinous and other areas
appearing more firm and fleshy. Focal necrosis is identified (less than 10%
of the tumor cut surfaces). A 13.2 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm tubular structure grossly
consistent with ureter is identified embedded within and encased by this
mass. The ureter is probe patent throughout its length but is grossly
distended to maximum diameter of 1.2 cm. Adjacent to the tied off ureter
margins several large caliber vessels are identified which appear embedded
within the tumor. The margins of the ureter are submitted. The mass is inked
black and the specimen is opened to reveal an unremarkable mucosal surface.
No mucosal masses or lesions are identified. Lymph nodes are identified in
the pericolic adipose tissue and are submitted. Representative sections are
submitted. Photographs are taken TPS is submitted.

Summary of sections:

URN -- ureter margins

U -- ureter

N1 -— proximal margin

M2 -- distal margin

VI -- vascular margins

TU —- tumor with adjacent ureter
T1 -— larger tumor

T2 -- smaller tumor

U -- uninvolved mucosa

LN —- lymph nodes

2). The specimen is received fresh labeled Ileft kidney'l and consists of a
kidney with attached ureter, renal vessels and perinephric fat weighing 428
g in total. The kidney measures 12.2 x 10.2 x 5.5 cm. The attached ureter
measures 2.8 cm in length and 0.7 cm in diameter. The attached renal vein
measures 1.5 cm in length and 1.4 cm in diameter. The renal vessels and
ureter margins are grossly unremarkable. An adrenal gland is identified,
measuring 4.9 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm. The kidney is inked black and bivalved to
reveal dilated renal pelvis with no renal parenchymal lesions. The capsule
of the kidney is focally thickened on the anti~hiler aspect. No grossly
evident tumor is identified in this area. The perirensl fat is soft and
lobulated. No masses or lesions are identified in the attached soft tissue.
The cortex measures 0.8 cm and the calyces appear normal. No lymph nodes
are identified in the perinephric fat. The specimen is photographed.
Representative sections are submitted.

Summary of sections:

UV! —- ureteral and vessel margins

RP -— renal pelvis representative sections

K -~ representative sections kidney with thickened capsule
PST -- perirenal soft tissues

AD -— adrenal gland

3). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled 'iliac vein' and consists
of a 2.9 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm fragment Of tan —- red soft tissue. The specimen is
bisected to reveal a 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.2 on firm yellow homogeneous nodule. The
specimen is entirely submitted.
