Reported:
Physician(s):
Phy Loca
m old woman has headaches and visual disturbances for
about 2

weeks. On clinical examination, retinal hemorrhages. On imaging
studies,

large left temporal parietal, intrauaxial brain tumor with
questionable

hemorrhage or calcium deposits. There are associated edema and
heterogenous

enhancement.

OPE RAT}: VE DIAGNOSES
Not Given

Operation/Specimen: A: Brain,left temporal tumor, biopsy
B: Brain,left temporal tumor, biopsy

PAT HOLOG 1 CAL E3 IAG NOS I S :

A and 8. Brain, left temporal parietal, excisional biopsies and
resection:

Anaplastic astrocvtoma. MIBml proliferation index: 15%.

See comment.

COMMENT

Specimen A is small fragments of a glial neoplastic proliferation with
nuclear

anaplasia and mitotic figures sprinkled throughout the tumor.
Specimen B is

large fragments of brain infiltrated and effaced by a similar glial
proliferation with an astrocyte phenotype, marked nuclear anaplasia,
and brisk

mitotic activity.

The MIB—l proliferation index is about 15%. There is focal (cortical)
microvascular calcification, but microvascular cellular proliferation
and

necrosis are inconspicuous.

The morphological findings are interpreted as an anaplastic glioma,

 

predominantly astrocytoma, with perhaps a minor oligodendroglial
component
(part A).

PROCEDURES/ADDENDA
MGMT Promoter Meth lation
Date Ordered : * Date Reported: -

Interpretation
NEGATIVE ~ No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected.

Results—Comments

TEST DESCRIPTION: Bisulfite treatment of DNA followed by PCR
amplification of

both methylated and unmethylated MGMT promoter sequences, with
products

detected by gel electrophoresis.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results
from a

stand—alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its
performance

characteristics determined by the I Molecular Pathology laboratory as

required by— regulations. It has not been cleared or approved
for

specific uses by the 0.3. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA
has

determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are

provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted
only in

the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A.

Received fresh, several fragments, 0.7 cm. in aggregate. Semi firm,
grayish—pink. In total, Al and A2.

 

B.
SPECIMEN: Left temporal tumor.

FIXATIVE: None.

GENERAL: A 3.0 x 2.5 x 0.9 cm. aggregate of soft dusky red to graywtan
brain

tissue. Sectioned.

SECTIONS: Bl~B3, all submitted.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

 

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates moderate glial
fibrillogenesis by
the neoplastic cells. About 25% of the neoplastic cells over express
the p53
protein. The CD34 depicts a microvasculature without microvascular
cellular
proliferation. In the more active areas, the MIB—l proliferation
index is
about 15%.

These findings support a diagnosis of anaplastic astrocytoma.
