DIAGNOSIS

(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 7 (3+4). (SEE COMMENT)
TUMOR CONFINED TO THE PROSTATE.
Margins of resection free of tumor.
PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH-GRADE.
Right and left seminal vesicles, no tumor present.
Segments of right and left vasa deferentia, no tumor present.

COMMENT

The prostate gland contains a single focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor involves the right anterolateral, right lateral
and right posterolateral peripheral zone with extension into the right transition zone. The tumor focus measures 2.5 x 1.5 cm In the
largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in the three cross-sections of the prostate, extensively in the apex, and focally
in the base region. The tumor is confined to the prostate. The margins of resection are free of tumor.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vase deferentia.

The prostate gland (4.5 x 2.9 x 4.6 cm, 37.5 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
right posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the left side. A nodule is palpated in the right
posterolateral aspect of the prostate. Serial cross—sections after ﬁxation demonstrate an area consistent with tumor in the right
peripheral zone extending from the ﬁrst to the third cross-sections.

The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

SECTION CODE: C1, CZ, base of right seminal vesicle and right vas deferens; CB, C4, base of left seminal vesicle and
left vas deferens; CS, prostatic base right border; C6, 07, prostatic base right posterior border; 08-012, prostatic base central
portion; C13, prostatic base left border; C14, C15, prostatic base left posterior border; C16, C17, apex anterior; C18, C19, apex
left; 020-C23, apex posterior; C24, 025, apex right; C26, detached portions of margin of resection according to specimen
radiograph; 027-038, sections of the three cross-sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.

The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in
black. Blue ink (019-22, 28) and orange ink (C33, 34 and 38) denote surfaces which do not represent a true margin of resection.
