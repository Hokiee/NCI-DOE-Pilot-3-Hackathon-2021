A. Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes, hysterectomy and bilateral

nodes (0/6).

C. Lymph node, left periaortic, regional resection: Six negative lymph
nodes (0/6).

D. Lymph node, right pelvic, regional resection: Eight negative lymph
nodes (0/8).

E. Lymph node, right periaortic, regional resection: Four negative
lymph nodes (0/4).

Microscopic Description:

Histologic type: Leiomyosarcoma ,
Histologic grade: Moderate to high grade
Primary tumor (pT) TNM (FIGO): 8,5 cm in greatest dimension, limited

to the uterus (ple)

Margins of resection: Negative

Vascular invasion: Not identified

Regional lymph nodes (pN): Twenty—four negative lymph nodes (0/24).
Other findings: Unremarkable ovaries and fallopian tubes; cervix
without dysplasia; endometrial cystic atrophy with polyp.

Comments: Microscopic examination shows a hypercellular tumor composed
of spindle cells resembling smooth muscle, with moderate to severe
pleomorphism, geographic necrosis, mitotic activity that is greater
than 10 per 10 high power fields I in some areas, and an
infiltrative border with the myometrium. Findings morphologically are
most compatible with leiomyosarcoma. Immunostaining supports the
diagnosis, with scattered positive staining with smooth muscle actin,
positive staining with CD10, and negative staining with desmin, c—kit
and S-lOO.

Intraoperative Consultation
A) Uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes and ovaries, excision: Spindle cell
neoplasm suSpicious for a leiomyosarcoma.‘

Gross Description
A. Received fresh labeled "uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries"
is a 400 g, globoid, 9.5 x 8.5 x 8.5 cm uterine corpus with attached
3.5 cm cervix and bilateral adnexa. The serosa is smooth tan-pink—red.
The annular 3 cm tan—white ectocervix surrounds a 0.8 x 0.2 cm ovoid
patent os. Endocervical mucosa is mildly trabecular tan—pink. The
distorted uterine cavity is lined by flat tan-pink endometrium
averaging 0.2 cm. The cavity is distorted by a submucosal/intramural
8.5 x 7.8 x 7.0 cm focally necrotic firm tan-white nodular lesion. A
frozen section is performed (two blocks frozen). The uterine cavity
contains a moderate amount of friable red brown debris. A portion of
the nodular lesion is Submitted for tissue procurement as requested.
The myometrium is smooth tan—pink and measures up to 1.8 cm in
thickness. Bilaterally, the cerebriform rubbery tan gold ovary is
average 1.8 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm. The stroma of both ovaries is tan-pink
with identifiable corpora albicantia. The fimbriated tan—pink right
and left fallopian tubes are 7 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter.
The lumina are pinpoint and stellate. RS 18. Summary: 1 and 2 —
anterior cervix, continuity inked blue. 3 — anterior
endomyometrium, 4 and 5 — posterior cervix, continuity inked black,
6 — posterior endomyometrium, 7 through 10 — lesion to endometrial
surface, 11 and 12, 13 and 14 - lesion to serosal surface of specimen,
15 and 16 - additional sections of lesion to myometrium, l7 - right
adnexa, 18 — left adnexa

B. Received fresh labeled "left pelvic lymph node" is a 5.5 x 4.5 x 1.7
cm aggregate of soft, lobulated tan gold adipose tissue. Several
slightly rubbery tan gold-pink tissues in keeping with lymph nodes
measuring up to 2.3 cm are recovered. The lymphoid tissues are
entirely submitted.

Summary: 1 — 2 lymph nodes, 2 through 5 — 1 bisected lymph node per
cassette

C. Received fresh labeled "left periaortic lymph node" is a 3.3 x 2.3 x
1.3 cm aggregate of soft, lobulated tan gold adipose tissue. A few
slightly rubbery tan gold-pink tissues in keeping with lymph nodes
measuring up to 1.0 cm are recovered. The lymphoid tissues are
entirely submitted.

Summary: 1 — 5 lymph nodes, 2 — 1 bisected lymph node

D. Received fresh labeled "right pelvic lymph node" is a 4.2 x 4.0 x
1.7 cm aggregate of soft, lobulated tan gold adipose tissue. Several
slightly rubbery tan gold—pink tissues in keeping with lymph nodes
measuring up to 3.7 cm in greatest dimension are recovered. The
lymphoid tissues are entirely submitted.

Summary: 1 — 4 lymph nodes, 2 - 2 lymph nodes, 3 - l bisected lymph
node, 4 and 5 — 1 bisected lymph node

E. Received fresh labeled "right periaortic lymph node" is a 2.7 x 2.4
x 1.0 cm aggregate of soft, lobulated tan gold adipose tissue. A few
slightly rubbery tan gold-pink tissues in keeping with lymph nodes
measuring up to 1.8 cm are recovered. The lymphoid tissues are
entirely submitted.

Summary: 1 - 3 lymph nodes, 2 - l bisected lymph node
