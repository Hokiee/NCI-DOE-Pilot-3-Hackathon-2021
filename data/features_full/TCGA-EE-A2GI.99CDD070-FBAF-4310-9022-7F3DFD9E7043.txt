SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT

Tissue was sent to the for evaluation for lgH
rearrangement. The results are as follows:

"Procedure:
Specimen TISSUE
DNA lgH Rearrangement See below

The laboratory received parafﬁn ﬁxed sections . DNA was prepared from this sample and
ampliﬁed using primers for the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH).

{la-VJ/

No monoclonal B-CELL (IgH) population was detected."

The prominent marginal/mantle zone is interpreted as marginal/mantle zone hyperplasia.

SUPPLEMENTARY SUMMARY

RIGHT AXILLARY DISSECTION:
- METASTATIC MELANOMA in one of twenty one lymph nodes (1/31)
— No extranodal extension is seen.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

"RIGHT AXILLARY DISSECTION". The specimen consists of ﬁbrofatty tissue 120 x 110 x 40mm with
attached skeletal muscle 85 x 65 x 20mm. The largest lymph node measures 65mm across. Serial
sectioning of the skeletal muscle is unremarkable.

MICROSCOPIC REPORT

"RIGHT AXILLARY DISSECTION". Microscopy confirms the presence of metastatic melanoma in the
macroscopically involved lyinpllnode (block A). The tumour is composed of spindled and epithelial cells
with moderate to abundanﬁosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli. Foci of necrosis are seen. The
tumour stains positively in immunostains for S 100, HMB45 and Melan A, supporting the diagnosis of
melanoma. The deposit partially replaces the lymph node and is intraparenchymal in location. No extranodal
extension is seen in the sections examined (including additional sections taken speciﬁcally to assess for
extranodal extension).

 

An additional 30 lymph nodes are identiﬁed and no further deposits of metastatic melanoma are seen.

Several of the uninvolved lymph nodes are enlarged and show a prominent marginal/mantle zone (e.g. blocks
B and C). Occasional monocytoid-type cells are seen. Scattered single histiocytes are identified. No
pericapsular extension is seen. The sinuses are preserved. Scattered reactive follicles are present while other
follicles appear regressed. Immunohistochemical studies for lymphoid markers have been performed and
conﬁrm an expansion of the marginal/mantle zone. The follicles show a reactive pattern in a bcl-Z stain. No
aberrant expression of CD5 or CD43 by B-lymphocytes is seen (CD20, CD79a). A cyclin D1 stain is
negative. The appearance is a little unusual and is favoured to be marginal/mantle zone hyperplasia rather
than marginal zone lymphoma.

 

COMMENT
Metastatic melanoma is seen in one lymph node. Other nodes are enlarged and show expansion of the

marginal/mantle zone. This is favoured to be a reactive hyperplasia but PCR has been requested to exclude
the possibility of a marginal zone lymphoma. A supplementary report will be issued with the result.

RIGHT AXILLARY DISSECTION:

- METASTATIC MELANOMA in one of twenty one lymph nodes (1/31)

~ No extran'odal extension is seen.

- Several other nodes are enlarged and show a prominent marginal/mantle zone with features
favouring marginal/mantle zone hyperplasia (see comment).
