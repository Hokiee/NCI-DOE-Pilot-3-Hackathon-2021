Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis

Page 2 of 10

Clinical Histor
The patient is 2— who presents with a peivic mass and undergoes ieft oophorectomy.

Gross Description

The specimen is received in eleven parts, iabeied with the patient's name and medical record number.
Parts C-K are received in formalin.

Part A, received fresh from the Operating Room and labeled “left ovary," consists of one ovary weighing
31.5

gm and measuring 6.2 x 4.1 x 2.0 cm. Attached to the ovary is a faiiopian tube measuring 6.0 cm in
iength

x 1.0 cm in average cross—section. 2.0 cm from the end of this tube is an area where the tube expands to

 

 

1.5 cm. The ovary is soft, with a papillated, shaggy surface. It is pink—tan and friable. A segment is distal
into the ovary and taken for research purposes, and a segment adjacent to this is frozen for
intraoperative

diagnosis. The outside of the specimen is inked black. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
Cassette A1: Remnant of frozen section.

Cassette A2: Segment of ovary demonstrating tumor.

Cassette A3: Segment of tube with mass.

Cassette A4: Proximal margin of fallopian tube and representative section of normal tube.

Part B, received fresh from the Operating Room and labeled "anterior rectal wall tumor," consists of one
soft, pink-red, irregular specimen of tissue measuring 9.0 x 3.5 x 0.6 cm. A segment of this tissue
measuring 1.0 x 2.0 x 0.4 cm is similar in appearance to the main tumor. This segment of tissue is
removed and submitted to Oncotech as per the patient's and the surgeo ' ' ' ns. The specimen is
serially sectioned and representative sections are submitted in cassettes

Part C, labeled "anterior rectal mass," consists of a single, unoriented fragment of tan to gray, soft tissue
measuring 3.0 x 2.4 x 1.2 cm. Serial sectioning reveals wrinkled, gray tissue, which appears to have
ﬁrmixed white tissue, which may represent tumor. Representative sections are submitted in cassette

Part D, labeled "omentum," consists of two, unoriented, irregularly shaped fragments of tan to yellow,
soft

tissue, which grossly appear to be omentum completely infiltrated by metastatic tumor. The frag nts
measure 16.0 x 14.0 x 4.5 cm in aggregate. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes

Part E, labeled "spleen,n consists of a single, irregularly shaped and unoriented fragment of soft tissue
measuring 12.5 x 10.0 x 5.5 cm. It consists of a red spleen, which has large areas grossly involved with
tan-yellow tumor. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes -including junction between
spleen and tumor.

Part F, labeled "appendix," consists of an appendectomy specimen measuring 3.2 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm. The
appendix measures 3.3 cm in length, with an average diameter of 0.5 cm. Representative sections,
including a longitudinal section of the tip, are submitted in cassettes .Grossly, no abnormalities are
noted.

Part G, labeled "right groin node," consists of multiple, irregularly shaped fragments of tissue measuring
3.5 x 3.0 x 1.4 cm in aggregate. Two of these fragments appear to be lym h nodes, which have been
entirely replaced by tumor. These lymph nodes are submitted in cassette Additional lymph nodes are
submitted in cassette

Part H, labeled "retrohepatic tumor," consists of two, irregularly shaped fragments of tan to white, soft
tissue, measuring 3.3 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm in aggregate. They grossly appear to represent the same tumor
identified in prior specimens. Sections from each fragment are submitted in cassettes

Part I, labeled "umbilical nodule," consists of multiple, irregularly shaped fragments of tan to gray, soft
tissue measuring 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.3 cm in aggregate. These again demonstrate the n tumor found in
other specimens in this case. Representative sections are submitted in cassettesﬁ

Part J is received in formalin additionally labeled "uterus and right ovary." It COI‘lSlS s o a uterus with
attached cervix, as well as the right ovary and right fallopian tube. The uterus measures 9 cm superior to
inferior, 6 cm cornu to cornu, and 4 cm anterior to posterior. The cervix has a fish—mouth 05, which
measures 0.4 cm. The cervix measures 2.5 cm in diameter and has a length of 1.7 cm. The right ovary

measures 3 cm in length and has a maximum diameter of 2.1 cm. It is remarkable for grossly evident
Page 3 of 10

tumor on the serosal surface of the ovary. The right fallopian tube measures 5.3 cm in length and has an
average diameter of 0.5 cm.

The uterus is opened to reveal unremarkable endometrium. The endometrium measures 0.1 cm in
thickness. The myometrium measures 1.2 cm in thickness and contains multiple leiomyomata, the largest
measuring 2.3 cm in maximum diameter. The serosal surface on the posterior side of the uterus shows a
small subserosal leiomyoma, measuring 1.4 cm in maximum diameter. The uterus is oriented by the
peritoneal reflection and inked black posteriorly and blue anteriorly. Sections of the uterus are submitted

      

Cassette J1: Anterior cervix.
Cassette 32: Posterior cervix.

Cassette J3: Anterior endomyometrium.

Cassette J4: Posterior endomyometrium.

Cassette J5: Posterior uterine subserosal leiomyoma.

The tumor on the surface of the ovary measures 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. Sectioning through the
ovary reveals that it appears to be involved by the tumor internally, as well as externally. The ovary
additionally contains a cystic area 1.2 cm in maximal dimension. Representative sections of the ovary
showing tumor invasion and tumor on the surface are submitted in cassette-An additional section of
the ovary showing the cystic space is submitted in cassette —Grossly, the fallopian tube is not involved
by tumor. Representative fallopian tube sections are submitted in cassette

Part K, labeled "right peri—aortic lymph,“ consists of a single, irregularly shaped fragment of black, soft
tissue, which appears he lymph node. It measures 3.2 x 2.5 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is entirely
submitted in casse e
