intraogeratlve Consultation:

An lntraoperatlve non-microscopic consultation was obtained and Interpreted as: 'Called to pick up ‘uterus. cenrix.

grams and measuring (fundus - cervix) 11.0 cm. (cornu to comu) 5.5 cm. (anterior to posterior) 5.5 cm. Opened to
show an invasive nodular yellow-ten mess on the posterior wall measuring 5.5 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm. Shown to surgeon.

Microscopic Description and Comment;

The tumor show a high grade nuclear feature with glandular differentiation. The differential diagnosis is between high
grade endometroid carcinoma and uterine serous carcinoma.

tmmunostatns (performed on 2 different blocks) showed that the tumor cells are strongly and ditiusely positivity for p16
and P53. lmmunostalne for ER and PR are positive in tumor cells (weak for ER. mixed weak and strong for PR). This
lmmunophenotype supports the diagnosis of uterine serous carcinoma.

Mme
The patient is a year old with a history at endometrlei adenocarclnoma, FIGO grade 3 (‘i Operative
procedure: Hysterectomy. bilateral salplngo-oophoreclomy. omentectomy and lymph node dissection.

Gross Desori tion-
The specimens are received in five formalin-filled containers each labeled with the patient's name. ' - ~ _

The first container is labeled “uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries." It consists of a 22? gram uterus
wrln auuuned cervix. and bilateral adnexa. it measures 11.0 x 5.5 x 5.5 cm. The cervix measures 3.2 cm in maximum
diameter. and the external as is up to 0.5 cm. The across. both anteriorly and posteriorly. is smooth and glistening.
The specimen has been previously extensively sectioned. during lntraoperative consultation, to disclose the posterior
wall is replaced by e 5.5 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm neoplasm. The lesion is tan-gray. has a nodular appearance, with loci of
hemorrhage on cut surfaces. it extends more than two-thirds of the 4.2 cm endometrlai thickness. The distal
endometrial cavity is 5.2 x 3.8 cm with locally hemorrhagic endometrlal lining. Both the lower uterine segment and the
3,6 cm long cervical canal appear free ol tumor. The anterior wall. which has an Identical nodular appearance on out
