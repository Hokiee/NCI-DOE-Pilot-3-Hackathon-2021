Final Diagnosis:

1, 2, 3. Cultures

4. Pleural tissue:
— Adenocarcinoma.

5, 6, 7. Cultures

8. Chest wall fistula:
- Adenocancinoma invading c est w ll.

9. Chest wall fistula, left:
— Adenocarcinoma invading chest wall and skin with ulceration, extending
to the circumferential margi and deep tissue free wall.

10. Pleural left chest:
— Adenocarcinoma.

Comment: The tumor is positive for CK7, TTF—l, Cam 5.2, cytokeratin
AEl/AB3, and vimentin; and negative for MA903, CK20, CD31, CD34, CD45,
CD20, Calretinin, EMA, Melan A, HMB~45, and 8-100 protein. These findings
support the diagnosis of a primary lung adenocarcinoma.

pTNM: T4 N0 MK.
