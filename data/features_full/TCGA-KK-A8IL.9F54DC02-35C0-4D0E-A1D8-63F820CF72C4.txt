DIAGNOSIS

(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA GLEASON SCORE 9 (4+5). (SEE COMMENT)
EXTRAPROSTATIC EXTENSION PRESENT.
TUMOR INVADING RIGHT AND LEFT SEMINAL VESICLES AND PERIVESICULAR SOFT TISSUE.
TUMOR EXTENDING FOCALLY TO THE MARGIN OF RESECTION.
PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA, HIGH-GRADE.
SEE PREVIOUS REPORT FOR DIAGNOSIS OF PELVIC LYMPH NODES.

COMMENT:

The prostate gland contains a single focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor is located in the left anterolateral, left lateral,
left posterolateral, left posterior, mid posterior and right posterior peripheral zone. The tumor focus measures 2.3 x 1.5 cm in the
largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the four cross sections of the prostate and extensively in the apex and base
regions. The tumor exhibits extraprostatic extension in the left posterolateral surface of the prostate and left superior
neurovascular bundle region. The extent of extraprostatic extension is 3.5 mm. The tumor extensively invades both right and left
seminal vesicles including intra and extraprostatic portions. Extension into perivesicular soft tissue is also present. Tumor extends
focally to the margin of resection in the left posterolateral surface and left superior neurovascular bundle region. The extent of
marginal involvement is approximately 1.0 mm.

Please refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and attached segments of right
and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (4.2 x 3.7 x 3.3 cm, 29 gm, postﬁxation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the right
and left posterolateral aspects of the prostate appears symmetrical. A nodule is palpated on the left side of the prostate. Serial
cross sections after demonstrate a ﬁrm area of possible tumor in the left posterolateral peripheral zone of the first two of the four
cross sections of the prostate.

The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

SECTION CODE: A1, A2, base of right seminal vesicle and right vas deferens; A3, A4, base of left seminal vesicle and
left vas deferens; A5, prostatic base right border; A6. A7, prostatic base right posterior border; A8-A11, prostatic base central
portion; A12, prostatic base left border; A13, A14, prostatic base left posterior border; A15, apex anterior; A16, A17, apex left; A18,

Specimen Date Tlme:

A19, apex posterior; A20, A21, apex right; A22, detached portions of margin of resection according to specimen radiograph;

A23-A38, sections of the four cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.
The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in

black. Orange ink (A29, 30, 33, 34 and 38) denotes surfaces that do not represent the true margin of resection.
