**********Addendum *******‘k**

SPECIMEN181: A. LEFT LOWER LUNG LOBE
B. HILAR MARGIN

C. 10L LYMPH NOD13
D. 6TH RIB

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Left lung ca.

PRE—OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
None

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:

A. LEFT LOWER LUNG LOBE
Bronchial mucosa at margin of resection negative; however, there are dissociated tumor clusters

within the bronchial lumen and in peripheral alveoli.
COMMENT: Histmi of recurrent bronchioloalveolar carcinoma as pe-

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. LEFT LOWER LUNG LOBB
Received fresh in a single container labelled *ﬂ designated “left lower lobe
completion” and consists of a single lobe of lung W61 111g gm. The pleural surface ranges

from tan red to black red and is rough with adhesions. The bronchial margin is removed and
submitted en face in a single block labelled FSA] for frozen section diagnosis. A large mass is
palpable within the lung tissue and the pleura overlying this mass is inked black. The specimen
is serially sectioned and an irregularly shaped tan yellow soft to focally firm tumor measuring
6.0x3.4x2.5cm. is identiﬁed. This tumor abuts the pleura focally in several places but does not
appear to grossly invade through the pleura. One of the places where it is closes to the pleura is

directly adjacent to the bronchial margin. The bulk of the tumor is 0.70m. away from the nearest
portion of the bronchial margin. Another smaller similar appearing tumor measuring 1.40m. in
diameter is noted approximately 0.5cm. away from the larger tumor. One anthracotic level 11 and
one anthracotic level 12 peribronchial lymph node are identiﬁed. The bronchi are opened distally
from the bronchial margin and the bronchial mucosa is uniformly tan without masses or lesions.
The tumors do not grossly appear to arise from any major bronchus. The remainder of the cut
surfaces are composed of tan red poorly aerated lung tissue. Representative portions of both
normal appearing lung tissue and tumor are submitted to tissue procurement. Representative
portions of the specimen are submitted per the code of sections.

FSAI: frozen section of bronchial margin en face

A2: vascular margins

A3: tumor abutting inked pleura adjacent to bronchial margin

A4—A9: tumor

A10: uninvolved lung adjacent to tumor

Al 1: uninvolved lung away from tumor

A12: one level ll peribronchial lymph node

A13: one level 12 pet-ibronchial lymph node

B. PYLOR MARGIN
Received in formalin in a single container labelledmd designated “pylor
margin” and consists of a single portion of soft dar 'ng l.7x0.7x0.3cm.

The specimen is bisected and the cut surfaces are unremarkable. The entire specimen is

c—nd designated “6‘“ rib”
and consists of three portions of bone appearing to e segmen s o n ranging from
1.7x0.6x0.2cm. to 5.3X1.0x0.5crn. to ll.0xl.2x0.Scm. The resection margins on all portions are
cortical surfaces are smooth and tan grey. A representative portion of bone is removed by sawing
and submitted after decalciﬁcation in a single cassette labelled DI.

LUNG CANCER TEMPLATE

1. Tumor type: Adenocarcinoma

2. Histologic Grade: PD

3. Tumor location: Peripheral

4. Tumor size: 6.0x3.4x2.5cm

5. Angiolymphatic invasion: Present

6. Perineural invasion: absent

7. lnvolvement of main stem bronchus: Absent

8. Bronchial margin: Negative, see comment

9. Visceral pleural margin: Positive

10. Hilar lymph nodes: Negative (0/3)

11. lnsitu Carcinoma: Absent

12. Pathologlc Stage: pTZ pN1 NIX

13. Non-neoplastic lung: Atelectasis; interstitial fibrosis; chronic inflammation

COMMENT: In “B" although the bronchial margin is negative for carcinoma, dissociated clusters of
tumor cells are seen within the bronchial lumen and within adjacent alveoli. Tumor cells are also noted in
the perlvascular soft tissue of the vascular margin. No tumor is seen intraluminally at the vascular margin.

 

 

 

ADDENDUM:
The pathologic stage should be pTZNUMx to correspond to the negative lymph nodes (0/3).
