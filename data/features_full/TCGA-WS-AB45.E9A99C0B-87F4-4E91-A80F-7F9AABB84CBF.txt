The pathologic stage assigned here should be regarded as provisional, as it reflects only current pathologic data and does not
incorporate full knowledge of the patient’s clinical status and/or prior pathology.

lmmunostains for the following cytokeratins (pan—cytokeratin, CAM 5.2 and OSCAR) performed on selected lymph node sections
are negative consistent with the above diagnosis.

Attestation:
By this signature, I attest that l have personally formulated the ﬁnal interpretation expressed in this report and that the above diagnosis is based
upon my examination of the slides and/or other material indicated in this report.

A. Received fresh and subsequently placed in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "tumor".is a 14.0 cm colectomy
specimen with a diameter of 4.5 cm and two stapled margins. The specimen is opened along the antimesenteric site to reveal a
large friable fungating mass measuring 7.0 x 7.0 x 5.0 cm, ﬁlling the cecum. The mass is 5.5 cm from the distal rection margin

and 4.5 cm from the proximal resection margin. The mass appears to be circumferential and due to the size of the mass, distorts
the specimen. There is an attached appendix, 10.0 cm in length with an average diameter of 0.7 cm. The appendix is serially
sectioned revealing a 0.2 cm lumen ﬁlled with brown soft fecal material. The appendix does not appear to be involved by the
mass. The appendioeal oriﬁce is inked green. The distal margin is marked by a suture and is inked blue. The pericolonic fat
deep to the mass is inked black. The mass is sectioned to reveal an average thickness of 0.9 cm. The mass appears to extend
through the submucosal and into the wall. The mass focally replaces the wall and extends into the pericolonic fat. The remainder
of the mucosa is tan—pink with mucosal folds arranged in the usual manner, however, there is a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm tan-pink polyp that
is 1.0 cm from the blue inked distal resection margin. Sectioning of the pericolonic fat reveals 13 possible lymph nodes ranging in
size from 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm to 1.3 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm. The remainder of the pericolonic fat is unremarkable.
