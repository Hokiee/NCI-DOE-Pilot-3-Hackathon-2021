DIAGNOSIS:

A. Lymph node, liver hilum, biopsy: A single (1) lymph node is
negative for tumor.

B. Common bile duct, distal margin, excision: Negative for tumor.

C. Liver, left lobe and gallbladder, partial hepatectomy and
cholecystectomy: Invasive Grade 4 (of 4) adenocarcinoma with
mucinous and Signet ring cell features, is identified forming a mass
(2.9 x 2.6 x 2.0 cm) involving the left hepatic duct. The tumor
directly invades the adjacent liver parenchyma. The hepatic
parenchymal resection margin is involved by invasive carcinoma.
Lymphovascular invasion is identified. Perineural invasion is not
identified. The gall bladder is uninvolved and shows chronic
cholecystitis. The non—neoplastic hepatic parenchyma will be
reviewed on permanent sections with special stains and reported in
an addendum.

D. Right main bile duct, margin, excision: Negative for tumor.
E. Liver, caudate lobe, partial hepatectomy: Negative for tumor.

F. Lymph nodes, hepatic duodenal, biopsy: Metastatic grade 4 (of 4)
adenocarcinoma is identified in a single (1 of 3) lymph node.

With available surgical material, [AJCC pTZle] (7th edition, 2010).

Frozen section histologic interpretation of liver hilum lymph node,

common bile duct margin, and right main bile duct margin performed
by:

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic
examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of the
specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are
reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes
identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a
revised report.

ADDENDUM:

Non—neoplastic liver parenchyma showing portal tract expansion by
mild chronic inflammation, edema and bile ductule proliferation,
consistent with bile flow obstruction. There is mild macrovesicular
steatosis and mild cholestasis. The trichrome shows mild portal
fibrosis. Iron stain is negative. PAS—D stain is negative for
intracytoplasmic globules.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled "lymph node; liver hilum, bioosv" is a 2.0
x 1.3 x 0.6 cm.lymph node. All submitted. Grossed by

B. Received fresh labeled "distal common bile duct margin - margin

up" is a 1.1 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm portion of pink—tan tissue with

orientation. Margin submitted. Grossed by

C. Received fresh labeled "left hepatectomy" is a 525 gram, 22.5 x
13.0 x 5.2 cm liver wedge specimen with an 8.0 x 3.0 X 1.5 cm
gallbladder and a 13.9 cm stent. A single 2.9 x 2.6 x 2.0 cm

tan—white mass is present at the inked surgical margin.

The mass

underlies the left hepatic duct but does not grossly appear to
involve the duct lumen. Surgical resection margin is submitted
perpendicularly. The common bile duct margin is widely free of

tumor. The gallbladder has a wall thickness of 0.2 cm.

No stones

are present. No cholesterolosis. Representative sections are

submitted. Grossed by

D. Received fresh labeled "right main bile duct — margin up" is a
1.5 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm portion of tan—pink bile duct with orientation.

All submitted. Grossed by

E. Received fresh labeled "caudate lobe of liver" is a 7.7 x 5.3 x
3.4 cm portion of liver. There is a 0.2 x 0.2 cm pale tan
thickening on the caudate capsule. No masses are identified.

Representative sections are submitted. Grossed by

F. Received fresh labeled "hepatic duodenal lymph nodes" are three
lymph nodes measuring 2.2 x 1.3 x 1.3 cm, 2.2 x 1.1 x 1.0 cm, and
1.7 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm. A single lymph node is grossly positive with a
metastasis measuring 1.3 x 1.1 x 1.0 cm. Lymph nodes submitted.
