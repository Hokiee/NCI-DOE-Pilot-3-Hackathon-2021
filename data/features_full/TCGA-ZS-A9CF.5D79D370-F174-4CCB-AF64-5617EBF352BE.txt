Clinical Information Supplied

lesion ... . Haemochromatosis.
Macro Report ' ﬁﬁﬁuﬂanﬁﬁT ”A35:

1. Received is a left lobe of liver measuring l32x95x58mm. The
surgical resection margin is inked blue. On transverse slicing 2
distinct tumour nodules each with a hard or cream—white cut
surface are noted. Focal areas of necrosis and softening are
present. The larger lesion measures 72x59x45mm and the smaller
60x35x44mm. The larger lesion is 4mm from the inked blue resection
margin. The smaller lesion is clear by approximately 26mm. An area
of firm white scarring is present at the resection margin. This is
especially clear near the larger lesion.

   

2. A fragment of brown-white tissue 21x8x8mm. On transverse
slicing a lymph node is revealed.

Micro Report

1. Sections confirm two tumours with morphological features
consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma. Both tumours show an
anastomosing trabecular architecture with large atypical cells
bearing abundant cytoplasm and focally producing bile. The larger
lesion is associated with spread into small branches of portal
veins. Although the lesion approaches close to the inked resection
margin the final resection margin is entirely clear of tumour. The
smaller of the 2 lesions, as noted macroscopically, is well clear
of the resection margin. Adjacent liver parenchyma shows some
chronic inflammation in portal areas and steatosis. Both are mild
in degree. There is no obvious evidence of iron pigment on routine
staining however liver histochemistry will be performed and
results issued in a supplementary report.
