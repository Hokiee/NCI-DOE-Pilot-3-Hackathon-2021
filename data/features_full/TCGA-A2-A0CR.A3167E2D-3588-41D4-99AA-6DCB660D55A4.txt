—year-old female with breast carcinoma, left.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
LEFT BREAST MASTECTOMY received fresh, labeled with the patient’s name,
designated "LEFT BREAST AND AXILLARY CONTENTS" consists
of a 1,044.0 gram modified radical mastectomy specimen. It measures 20.5
cm medial to lateral, 20.0 cm superior to inferior, 4.5 cm anterior to
posterior, with an attached axillary tail, 11.0 x 7.0 x 3.7 cm, and an
overlying ellipse of nipple bearing skin, measuring 18.0 x 9.5 cm. The
nipple is inverted and the skin is otherwise unremarkable. Ink code:
Blue=superior superficial, green=inferior superficial, black=deep.
Sectioning reveals a poorly defined, indurated mass in the uppgrﬂinger
quadrant focally abutting the deep margin. Continuous with this lesion and
extending laterally to the outer portion of the breast is a broad area of

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Patient: Specimen #:
GROSS DESCRIPTION (continued):

variably indurated fibrous tissue (overall maximum dimension of mass plus
indurated fibrous tissue = 9.0 cm). Multiple sections are harvested for
the protocol with matching paraffin sections as follows:

Al: Skin (medial tip).

A2: Lymph node, 1.8 cm, mid/upper axillary tail.

A3: Tumor, upper inner quadrant.

A4: Indurated fibrous tissue (5.0 cm from medial extent of tumor),
central.

A5: Indurated fibrous tissue (7.0 cm from medial extent of tumor),
central.

A6: Indurated fibrous tissue (9.0 cm from medial extent of tumor),
mid center.

A7: Grossly normal fibrofatty tissue, lower outer quadrant.

Sectioning through the axillary tail reveals 14 possible lymph nodes
ranging in size from 0.2 cm to 3.0 cm in greatest dimension. Additional
representative sections are submitted in cassettes A8 through A22, as
follows:

A8: Nipple.

A9—A11: Mass upper inner quadrant.

A12: Centralized fibrous area.

A13: Upper inner quadrant.

A14: Lower inner quadrant.

A15: Lower outer quadrant.

A16: Upper outer quadrant.

A17: Five possible lymph nodes.

A18: Five possible lymph nodes.

A19: Two possible lymph nodes, largest lymph node bisected and submitted

in its entirety.

A20: One lymph node bisected and submitted in its entirety. ,

A21-A22: One lymph node bisected and submitted in its entirety in two
cassettes. 22CF
