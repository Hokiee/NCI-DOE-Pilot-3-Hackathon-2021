This specimen is received in three containers, each labeled with the patient's name
and medical record number.

Part one is received fresh for intraoperative frozen section, labeled "anterior
temporal tumor", and consists of a 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm pink soft tissue fragment.
Approximately half the specimen is submitted for frozen section and subsequently
for permanents in cassette lFA. The remaining tissue is entirely submitted in
cassette 1A.

Mlcroscoplc Examination ,

Sections of all three specimens are similar and will be described together. They

display a glial, infiltrative tumor of astrocytic lineage. The neoplasm is

moderately hypercellular and displays mild nuclear pleomorphism and hyperchromasia.
Scattered mitotic figures are seen but there is no microvascular proliferation or

necrosis present.

Immunohistochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein is diffusely positive in
the tumor. MIB—l, a proliferation marker, is positive in approximately 10% of the
nuclei. IDH—l staininn is neoative. All controls are appropriate.
