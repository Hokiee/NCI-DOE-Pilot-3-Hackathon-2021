Left groin melanoma. 4:710 ,3,

DIAGNOSIS:
A. LYMPH NODE, LEFT EXTERNAL ILIAC, EXCISION:

- THREE OF THREE LYMPH NODES ARE POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC MELANOMA (3/3)

B. LYMPH NODE, LEFT COMMON ILIAC, EXCISION:

- ONE LYMPH NODE, POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC MELANOMA (1/1)

C. LYMPH NODE, LEFT OBTURATOR, EXCISION:

- TWO OF TWO LYMPH NODES, POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC MELANOMA (2/2)

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. LEFT, EXTERNAL LIAC LYMPH NODE

Received fresh labeled with the patient’s identification and 'Ieft external iliac lymph node’ are
three tan pink—black lymph nodes ranging from 5 x 2 x 1.4cm to 2 x 1.6 x 1.3cm. The specimens
are serially sectioned. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. The
remainder of the specimen is submitted as follows:

A1: one lymph node

A2-A4: one lymph node
A5-A7: one lymph node

B. LEFT COMMON ILIAC NODE

Received in formalin labeled with the patient’s identification and ’Ieft common iliac node’ is a
tan red—hemorrhagic lymph node 9 x 3 x 2cm. The specimen is serially sectioned. Entirely
submitted in 81-36.

C. LEFT OBTURATOR LYMPH NODES

Received fresh labeled with the patient’s identification and ’left obturator lymph nodes’ is a tan
pink matter lymph node 5.5 x 4 x 3cm. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a
hemorrhagic-necrotic cut surface. Representatively submitted in C1-C5.

ADDENDUM

Comment: Per clinician’s request, the slides were re—reviewed.

The number of lymph nodes in specimen A and B remain the same.

The remaining tissue from specimen C was entirely submitted in cassettes C6 to C15. Three
additional microscopic lymph nodes/lymphoid tissue were identiﬁed and one of them is positive
for metastatic melanoma. Therefore the total number of lymph nodes in specimen C is 5.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. LYMPH NODE, LEFT EXTERNAL ILIAC, EXCISION:

- THREE OF THREE LYMPH NODES ARE POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC MELANOMA (3/3)

B. LYMPH NODE, LEFT COMMON ILIAC, EXCISION:

- ONE LYMPH NODE, POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC MELANOMA (1/1)

C. LYMPH NODE, LEFT OBTURATOR, EXCISION:
