nodes appear to be grossly involved by tumor.

Portions of the tumor are submitted to the tumor bank.

SECTION CODE: A1 -A6, larger nodule, representative section: A7-A9, smaller nodule,
representative section; A10, one lymph node; A11, two lymph nodes.
(B) ADDITIONAL APEX OF FEMORAL TRIANGLE - Received are skin and underlying soft tissue, 5.0 x
1.5 x 2.0 cm. The skin surface is unremarkable. The cut surface inked blue. The specimen is serially
sectioned. A well-deﬁned black nodule, 1.2 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm is identiﬁed, and the nodule expanded to one

(C) LEFT COMMON ILIAC BIFURCATION - One lymph node is identiﬁed, 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm, and
entirely submitted in C.
(D) LEFT lLlAC AND OBTURATOR CONTENTS - Adipose tissue (4.0 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm). Thirteen lymph
nodes are identiﬁed, ranging from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm to 1.6 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm.
