CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Pelvic mass. endometrial carcinoma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

1. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section labeled "uterus,
cervix. tubes and ovaries“. It consists of a markedly distorted globular
uterus with adnexa weighing 564 g and measuring 12 cm from fundus to
cervical cs, 6.5 cm from cornu to cornu, and 8.5 cm in anterior posterior.
The aerosol surface is smooth, tan—pink. and glistening. The cervical as
is slit—like and patnlous meaSuring 0.3 cm. The ectocervix is smooth and
tanugray measuring 2 x 2 cm. 0n opening, the endocervical canal is
unremarkable. The endometrial cavity measures 7 cm in length and % cm
across. The endometrium is tan-pink and focally nodular throughout the
endometrial cavity measuring up to 0.7 cm in thickneSB. No apparent
invasion or dominant mass is soon. In the fundus a 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm
polypoid soft lesion is identified. In the posterior uterine wall there is
9 x 7 x 7 cm firm calciﬁied intramural nodule located as superficial as 0.3
cm from the surface of the endomecrium. serial sectloning through the
nodule reveals gray soft to rubbery homogeneous center and firm calcified
edge measuring up to 0.7 cm in thickness. The anterior myometrium is
tan-pink and trabecular, and measures 2.5 cm in thickness, the posterior
myometrium measures up to 7.5 cm in thickness. Multiple small well
circumscribeﬁ firm nodules with white whorled cut surfaces are present in
the myometrium measuring up to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. The adnexa
are attached and are grossly unremarkable. The right and left fallopian
tubes measure 5 and 6.5 cm in length, respectively. The right and left
ovaries measure 3 x 2.3 x 2.1 cm and 2.1 x 1.7 x 1.4 cm, respectively.
There are several hemorrhagic corpus luteal cysts at the periphery of the

2. The specimen is received fresh labeled ”RIGHT pelvic lymph nodes". It
consists of multiple fragments of fibxoadipose tissue measuring 4.5 x 2.5 x
0.9 cm in aggregate. Serial aectioning reveals 5 lymph nodes ranging in
size from 0.4 em up to 1‘2 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is
entirely submitted in S cassettes, with one bisected lymph node in each
cassette, labeled ZAvZE.

3. The specimen is received fresh labeled "RlcﬁT para—aortic lymph node".
It consists of one fragment of fibroadipose tissue measuring 3.5 x 3.5 x
0.9 cm. Serial sectioning reVEals one possible lymph node measuring 3.5 x
3.4 x 0.7 cm. The specimen io entirely submitted in two cassettes. (one
half of the opecimen in each cassette), labeled 3A—3B.

4. The specimen is received fresh labeled ”LEFT para-aortic lymph node".
It consists of one fragment of fibroadipose tissue measuring 2.5 x 2.5-x
