SROSS DESCRIPTION
\A) LEFT KIDNEY - A radioai nephrectomy specimen (18.0 cm x170 cm x 10 cm), including a kidney (16.0 cm x 9.0 cm x 10.0 cm).

ureter (12.0 cm x 0.5 cm), hilar lymph nodes (measuring overali 15.0 x 6.0 x 6.0 cm). and adrenal gland (4.0 x1.5 x 0.5 cm).
A well-circumscribed tumor (15.0 x 8.5 x 9.0 cm) is present occupying approximately 90% of the renal parenchyma. It is yellow tan
with extensive areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. The tumor appears to invade the renal sinus and renal vein, however, the renai vein
margin is free of tumor. The tumor does not appear to extend into the perirenal fat marginThe pelvis appears nodular but has a
smooth surface. The kidney parenchyma away from tumor showa multiple tumor nodules. One centimeter from the ureteral margin is
a 0.2 cm cystic nodule. The ureteral margin is grossly free of tumor

The renal hilum is expanded (15.0 x 6.0 x 6.0 cm) and contains multiple matted lymph nodes (approximate total of 23), most of
which are grossly involved by tumor.

The adrenal gland appears uninvoived by tumor.

(8) MODE BELOW THE BIFURCATEON - A lymph node (4.0 cm x 2.2 cm x 2.0 cm) grossly involved by tumor.
