1: LYMPH NODE EXTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN

2: RIGHT MODIFIED RADICAL NECK DISSECTION (SHORT SUTURE LEVEL ZB/SPINAL ACCESSORY LYMPH NODE) LONG
SUTURE LEVEL 4

3: MANDIBLE

Gross Description:

Specimen #1 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled lymph node external jugular vein and consists of a 1.0 cm
lymph node which is bisected and entirely submitted for frozen section labeled FS1A. The frozen residue is submitted in the
corresponding cassette.

Specimen #2 is received fresh for orientation labeled right modiﬁed radical neck dissection (the short suture-level ZBIspinal
accessory lymph node. long suture-level 4) and consists of a 9.0 x 5.0 x 1.5 cm right modiﬁed radical neck dissection to include the
3.0 x 3.0 x 1.6 cm grossly unremarkable submandibular gland, a 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm segment of muscle and a 1.5 x 0.4 cm
unremarkable thin-walled vessel.

Palpating level 1 reveals three grossly unremarkable nodes ranging from 1.2 cm to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph
nodes are entirely submitted as follows:

2A—ZB: mid size node serially sectioned

2C: smallest node with adjacent grossly unremarkable vessel
2D-ZG: largest node with adjacent muscle in ZG
2H: representative section of submandibular gland with adjacent adipose tissue.

Palpating level 2A reveals ﬁve candidate nodes ranging from 0.8 cm to 1.3 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are
entirely submitted as follows:

2l-2L: each cassette representing a bisected node
2M—2N: one serially sectioned node.

Palpating level 28 (identiﬁed by a short suture) reveals two candidate nodes, 1.0 cm and 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. The nodes
are entirely submitted as follows:

20: one bisected node
2P: one bisected node
20: the rest of the adipose tissue with possible nodes.

Palpating level 3 reveals six candidate nodes ranging from 0.4 cm to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. The nodes are entirely
submitted as follows:

2R-2T: each cassette representing one bisected node
2U: three whole nodes.

Level 4 is palpated to reveal two candidate nodes, 0.5 cm and 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. The nodes are entirely submitted as
follows:

2V: one bisected tissue to include the largest node and the adjacent smaller, possibly matted node
2W: adipose tissue with possible additional nodes from level 4.

Specimen #3 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name designated mandible. It consists of
consists of a tan-pink oriented mandible and attached soft tissue measuring 3.3 cm lateral to medial, 4.1 cm superior to inferior,
and 5.5cm in depth. The soft tissue and bone margins are inked as follows: anterior-orange, medial/deep—black , lateral-blue.
posterior-green and true inferior—red. There are 4 loose discolored teeth in the anterior ﬂoor of the mouth and one molar to the far
right with the third tooth and molar showing cavities. The mucosal surface is tan-pink with focal areas of involvement by tumor and
is left un-inked. The soft tissue appears pink-grey and edematous. Abutting the molar tooth and the underlying mucosa is a
lobulated smooth grey mass measuring 4.1 x 3.3 x 1.3 cm. Cut sections through the mass show a homogenous grey pink cut
surface with focal areas of necrosis extending to the soft tissue and into the root of a missing tooth which is replaced by tumor.
The mass is grossly located 0.2 cm form the lateral margin. 0.3 cm from the medial/deep margin, 0.6 cm from the anterior margin
and 0.9 cm from the posterior margin. The mandible is serially sectioned after decalciﬂcation and shows an irregular cut surface of
the bone with necrotic foci. Representative sections are submitted from anterior to posterior following decalciﬁcation as follows:
SAFS: Tumor to closest medial/deep margin.

38-8: Soft tissue and tumor-lateral aspect of mandible

3T—OO: Soft tissue and tumor-medial aspect of mandible

3PP: inferior margin

SQQ: Anterior margin
