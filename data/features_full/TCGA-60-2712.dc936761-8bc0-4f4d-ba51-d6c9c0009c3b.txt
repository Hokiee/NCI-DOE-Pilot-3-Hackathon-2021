GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. 4R RIGHT DISTAL PARATRACHEAL
Received fresh is one fragment of tan-black soft tissue measuring 0.3 cm. Submitted in toto for
frozen section.
B. 4L LEFT DISTAL PARATRACHEAL
Received fresh are multiple fragments of tan—black tissue measuring 0.5 cm in aggregate.
Submitted in toto for frozen section. ‘
C. ADDITIONAL LOW 4R RIGHT DISTAL PARATRACHEAL
Received fresh are multiple fragments of tan-black soft tissue measuring 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm.
Submitted in toto for frozen section.
D. LEVEL 7 SUBCARINAL
Received fresh are multiple fragments of tan-black soﬁ tissue measuring 1 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm in
aggregate. Submitted in toto for frozen section.
B. 2R RIGHT PROXIMAL PARATRACHEAL -
Received fresh are multiple fragments of tan—black soft tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.3 cm.
They are submitted in toto for frozen section.
F. 2L LEFT PROXIMAL PARATRACHEAL
Received fresh is one fragment of tan-black soﬁ tissue measuring 0.3 cm in diameter and
submitted in toto for frozen section.
G. FIFTH RIB .
Received in formalin is a portion of rib measuring 2 X 1 x 0.8 cm. The outer surface is tan-pink
and irregular. Sections are submitted after decalciﬁcation.
H. LEVEL 5 LYMPH NODE -
Received in formalin is one lymph node measuring 2 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. It is bisected to reveal
black to pink homogenous cut surface. It is submitted in toto in one cassette.
1.. LUNG LEFT UPPER LOBE,LOBECTOMY:
Received in fresh state is a resected upper lobe of left lung with total dimensions of l 5x14x4
cm. in the upper half of the Specimen located .4 cm. from the nearest bronchial margin. There is
a ﬁrm ovoid to round palpable mass which on section has a tan cream yellow tan-white tumor
with central areas of necrosis. The tumor measures 8x7x4 cm. The overlying pleura is retracted
and inked blue. At the hilum in line with the bronchus and protruding from the long is a
presumptive enlarged matted lymph node with tumor partly displacing one hilar blood vessel.
Remainder of the specimen shows congestion With ateiectatic change . Multiple sections are
submitted and labeled as follows: portion of tissue for tissue procurement and photograph of
specimen is a well deﬁned round to oval tan-yellow ﬁrm tumor mass with central tumor necrosis
measuring 8 x 7 x 4 cm.
Sections are submitted as follows:

FSIl: bronchial margin

FSIZ: sections from the tumor for frozen section

13—17: sections from the tumor

18: sections from the mass and lymph nodes adjacent to the tumor

 

 

11 1-112: section of lymph node paratracheal
113-115: sections from the non—neoplastic lung tissue ‘

J. 111. LYMPH NODE _

Received in formalin is one irregular lymph node measuring 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm. It is triseeted to
reveal black and pink homogenous cut surface. It is submitted in toto in one cassette.

K. LEVEL 6 LYMPH NODE

Received 1n formalin Is one lymph node measuring 1 x 0.8 x 0. 5 cm. It Is bisected to reveal
black homogenous cut surface. It Is submitted' m toto in one cassette.

L. LEVEL 9 LYMPH NODE

Received in formalin is one lymph node measuring 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. It is bisected-to reveal a
black cut surface. It is submitted in toto in one cassette.
