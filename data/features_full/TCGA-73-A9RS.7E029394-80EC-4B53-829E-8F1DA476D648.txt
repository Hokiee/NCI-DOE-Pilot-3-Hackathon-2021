GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. 4R LYMPH NODE
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "4R lymph node" are two

fragments of red-tan soft tissue measuring 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm and 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted
for frozen section, FSA.

B. ADDITIONAL 4R LYMPH NODE

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "additional 4R lymph node" are
multiple (approximately 5) fragments of red-tan soft tissue ranging from 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm up to 0.9 x
0.3 x 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted for frozen section, FSB.

C. 4R LYMPH NODE #3

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "4R lymph node #3" are two

fragments of red-tan soft tissue measuring 0.1 and 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. Entirely submitted for
frozen section, FSC.

D. LEVEL 7 LYMPH NODE

Received fresh labeled with the patient‘s identiﬁcation and designated "level 7" is a fragment of red-tan
soft tissue measuring 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. Entirely submitted for frozen section, FSD.

E. 4R LYMPH NODE #4

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "4R lymph node #4" are multiple

(approximately 4) fragments of red-tan soft tissue ranging from 0.3 up to 0.9 cm in greatest dimension.
Entirely submitted for frozen section, FSE.

F. PERIBRONCHIAL BIOPSY (RIGHTSIDE)
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "peribronchial biopsy right side"

is a fragment of red-tan soft tissue measuring 0.5 x 0.1 by less than 0.1 cm. Entirely submitted for
frozen section, FSF.

G. PORTION OF 8TH RIB

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "portion of eighth rib" are
two fragments of unoriented bone measuring 4 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm in aggregate. Representatively submitted
in G1 for decalciﬁcation.

H. PORTION OF 7th RIB

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated “portion of seventh rib" are
two fragments of unoriented bone measuring 3.9 x 3 x 1.3 cm in aggregate. Representatively submitted
in H1 for decalciﬁcation.

l. RIGHT LUNG WITH MID CHEST WALL

Received fresh and subsequently ﬁxed in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and
designated "right lung with mid chest wall" is an oriented (suture marks sixth rib) right pneumonectomy
specimen with en bloc chest wall resection of ribs (3) and intercostal soft tissue. The right lobe, 20 x 18
x 8.5 cm, middle lobe (collapsed), 10.5 x 9.2 x 2 cm, and lower lobe 11 x 10.8 x 5 cm. The attached
chest wall consisting of three ribs, 9.3 x 6.2 x 1.5 cm, collectively. and portion of intercostal soft tissue, 7
x 3 x 1 cm. ink code: Right upper lobe-blue, right mid lobe-orange, right lower lobe- black, lateral bone
margin-green, anterior bone margin-yellow, posterior tissue (possible upper lobe Iung)-red. The pleural
surface of the upper lobe shows multiple builae, ranging from 0.5 up to 2 cm in greatest dimension. The
superior portion of the upper lobe shows an ill-deﬁned, nodular, ﬁrm white tan, centrally necrotic mass
grossly adherent to the chest wall, measuring approximately 9.2 x 6.5 x 5.4 cm, located 6.5 cm from the
bronchial margin, extending to the lateral and posterior soft tissue margins (green ink, red-ink). The
remainder of the upper lobe is sectioned to show deep red, consolidated, focally ﬁbrotic lung
parenchyma. The middle lobe is sectioned to reveal deep red, consolidated lung parenchyma. No
lesions or nodules are grossly appreciated in the middle lobe. The right lower lobe (apex) shows an ill-
deﬁned, ﬁrm, red—tan, hemorrhagic lesion, 1.3 x 1 x 0.9 cm, located approximately 16.5 cm from the
bronchial margin. The remainder of the right lower lobe shows consolidated, focally ﬁbrotic lung

parenchyma. Gross photograph is taken. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement.

fragment of tan possible lymphoid tissue measuring 2.3 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm. The specimen is sectioned,
entirely submitted. J1 .
