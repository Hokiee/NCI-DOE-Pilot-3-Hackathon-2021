formalin is a 513 gram, 15.0 x 17.0 x 10.0 cm, portion of
liver with attached gallbladder, approximately 5.0 x 2.0 x
1.0 cm. The liver capsule is redwpurple and was previously
inked in black over the surgical margin. The specimen is

serially sectioned. On sectioning, it reveals a 14.0 x 9.0
cm well-circumscribed, tan—yellow mass with a necrotic
center, about 2.5 x 4.0 cm. The mass is about 2.5 cm away
from the inked margin. The remainder of the liver
parenchyma is dark brown. Representative sections are
submitted as follows:

Cassette Designation:

Al Section from the mass

A? Mass near the inked margin

The gallbladder has a yellow~tan serosal surface. There is
a disrupted area, about 1.0 x 1.0 cm, over the serosal
surface. The gallbladder is opened and it has a tan—yellow,
smooth mucosa, with scattered yellow spots. Representative
sections, including the cystic duct margin, are submitted in
cassette A8.

8. The specimen is labeled "biopsy, left lateral segment."
Received fresh for frozen section are two tan—yellow cores
of liver, about 1.5 cm in greatest dimension, and the
specimen is submitted in toto for frozen section. The
frozen section remnant is submitted for permanent in
cassette B.

C. The specimen is labeled "perigastric lymph node."
Received in formalin is a 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.3 cm tan—yellow
lymph node. The specimen is bisected and submitted entirely
in cassette C.

D. The specimen is labeled "midhody stomach resection."
Received in formalin is a 3.0 X 2.0 x 0.5 cm fragment of
pink-tan soft tissue. The specimen is inked in black over
the deep surface and serially sectioned. On sectioning, it
was a 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.4 cm tan~white lesion which is about 0.2
cm away from the inked margin. The specimen is submitted
entirely in cassettes 01 to D3.

Microscopic:
Histological examinations have been performed on specimens
Lax-“D.

A. Sections show wellecircumscribed mass composed of nests
of cells with large. hyperchromatic nuclei. There is an
evidence of massive necrosis in the central part of the
mass. Normal portal triad architecture is not identified in
most parts of the mass. There is no evidence of margin,
vascular involvement. Sections from the gallbladder show
unremarkable columnar mucosa with normal wall thickness and
there is no evidence of tumor extension into the
gallbladder. Glypican stain shows patchy positivity and
reticuline shows multiple areas of disruption which confirm
the diagnosis.

B. H and E, trichrome, and reticulinwstained sections
demonstrate cores of liver tissue with hepatocytes arranged
in cell layers one cell thick. The lobular architecture is
intact with no fibrosis. Mild macrovesicular steatosis is
present that comprises less than 10% of the specimen volume.
Negative for lobular necroinflammatory activity. Negative
for dysplasia or malignancy.

C. Sections show two fragments of lymphoid tissue. There
is no evidence of tumor inside the lymph node.

D. Sections show a well—circumscribed mass composed of

nests of spindle cells with short, uniform nuclei. The
cells form whorled, storiform patterns and are separated by
fibrovascular septae. There is no evidence of margin
involvement. The gastric mucosa is unremarkable. 09117,
