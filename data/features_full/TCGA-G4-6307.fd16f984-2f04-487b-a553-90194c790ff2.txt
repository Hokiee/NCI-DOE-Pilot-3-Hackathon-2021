GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. RIGHT OVARIAN CYST
Received fresh labeled with patient's name and "right ovarian cyst" is a 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm pink-tan
cystic soft tissue fragment. A section is submitted for frozen section in FSA1 and the remainder of the
specimen is submitted in cassette A2.
B. LEFT OVARIAN CYST
Received fresh labeled with patient's name and "left ovarian cyst" is a 1.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm pink-tan soft
tissue fragment. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in FSB1 .
C. LEFT COLON, SIGMOID, UPPER RECTUM
Received fresh and labeled with patient's name and "left colon, sigmoid and upper rectum" is a segment
of colon and rectum, measuring 20 cm in length and 6 cm in open circumference. The serosa is
smooth. There is a pink-tan fungating mass 4 x 5 x 3 cm, located 4 cm from the rectal margin and 9.5
cm from the colonic margin. It appears to invade into the muscularis propria. There is a 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.3
cm. polyp located 0.5 cm from the mass towards the proximal colonic margin. Sixteen possible lymph
nodes are found ranging in size from 0.4 to 1.7 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are
submitted as follows:

C1: colonic margin

C2: rectal margin

C3-C5: mass and deep margin

06: mass with polyp

C7: representative sections of normal appearing colonic mucosa

08: five possible lymph nodes
C9: five possible lymph nodes

Cf 0: four possible lymph nodes

Cf 1-Cf 3: one bisected lymph node each
D. DISTAL DONUT
Received in formalin and labeled with the patient name and "distal donut" is a ring of tan mucosa tissue
measuring 0.9 cm in length with an outer circumference of 1.6 cm. It is bisected and there is a stapled
surgical line present. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette D1.
E. PROXIMAL DONUT
Received in formalin and labeled with the patient name and "proximal donut" is a ring of tan mucosa
tissue with an outer circumference of 1.9 cm and measuring 0.8 cm in width. There are blue sutures
present throughout the specimen. The specimen is submitted entirely in cassette E1.
F. SMALL BOWEL NODULE
Received fresh for frozen section evaluation labeled with the patient's name and "small bowel nodule
excision" is a fragment of tan soft tissue measuring 2.0 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. The tissue is bisected to show a
firm white nodule measuring 1 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The entire specimen is submitted in a cassette FSF1.

ADDENDUM:
ANALYSIS OF MISMATCH REPAIR PROTEIN EXPRESSION
MLH1 Expression: Present
MSH2 Expression: Present
MSH6 Expression: Present
PMS2 Expression: Present

Expression of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 in the tumor was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.
Peritumoral lymphocytes and normal glands serve as internal positive controls expressing MLH1,
MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2.

Testing for Microsatellite Instability has been ordered. The results will be issued in a separate report.
