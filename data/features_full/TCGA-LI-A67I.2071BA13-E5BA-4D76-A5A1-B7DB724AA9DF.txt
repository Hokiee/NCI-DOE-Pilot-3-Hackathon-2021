COMMENT

Sections show mainly a high-grade (grade 3) sarcoma with pleomorphic and storiform features. There are foci of lower grade areas
with curvilinear capillaries and myxoid change which is reminiscent of “myxofibrosarcoma”. Focally the cells are rhabdoid
appearing and note is made of IHC stains on prior core biopsy with negative myogenin.

— Surgical Pathology Report _

surgeon as follows: long suture-proximal. The specimen is inked blue-lateral, green-medial and black-deep. The deep surface is
focally covered by muscle but largely covered by deep fascia. Sectioning reveals a 20 x 15 cm partially circumscribed white ﬁrm
mass with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis (percent necrosis approximately 40%). The mass appears to be pushing the borders
and appears to be inﬁltrative. However. positivity cannot grossly be assessed. The mass is closest to the deep margin less than 1

mm. Pictures were taken. Representative sections are as follows:

1A-1V: tumor to margins
1W-1 BB: representative sections of the tumor.

Specimen #2 is received in formalin and labeled most proximal margin and consists of a 5.0 x 1.9 x 1.2 cm ﬁrm. irregular soft tissue
specimen with a cut surface. The non-cut surface is inked blue. Representative sections are as follows:

 

2A: representative cut surface (thinned)
ZB'. perpendicular sections of the non-cut surface.
