DIAGNOSIS: 6J1: LMMWW...

A. Common bile duct margin, excision: Negative for tumor. (5 QD‘Z)

Qt) 6/6/14

 

 

B. Pancreas, duodenum, portion of jejunum, and portion of superior
mesenteric vein; Whipple resection: Invasive ductal adenocarcinoma,
moderately differentiated, 2 .8 cm in greatest dimension, located in
the uncinate process. Tumor extends beyond pancreas to involve
peripancreatic soft tissue, duodenal wall, and superior mesenteric
vein. Angiolymphatic and perineural invasion are present. Uncinate
margin involved by carcinoma. Gallbladder with chronic
cholecystitis, uninvolved by tumor. Multiple (2 of 19) lymph node
involved by metastatic carcinoma.

AJCC stage (with available surgical material): pT3 N1 (7th edition).

DIAGNOSIS COMMENT:
Although tumor is present at superior mesenteric vein (superior and
inferior) margins on permanent sections, tumor is not observed on
the frozen section slides, which were concurrently reviewed.

PRELIMINARY FROZEN SECTION CONSULTATION:
A. Common bile duct margin, excision: Negative for tumor.

B. Pancreas, duodenum, portion of jejunum, and portion of superior
mesenteric vein; Whipple resection: Invasive ductal adenocarcinoma,
moderately differentiated, 2 .8 cm in greatest dimension, located in
the uncinate process. Tumor extends beyond pancreas to involve
peripancreatic soft tissue, duodenal wall, and superior mesenteric
vein. Angiolymphatic and perineural invasion are present. Uncinate
margin involved by carcinoma. Gallbladder with chronic
cholecystitis, uninvolved by tumor. Multiple (2 of 19) lymph node
involved by metastatic carcinoma. Holdover to evaluate permanent
sections.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received fresh labeled "common bile duct margin up" is a 1.0

x 0.7 x 0.7 cm portion of bile duct with orientation. Margin
submitted. Grossed by '

B. Received fresh labeled "total pancreas, duodenum, portion
jejunum, portion superior" is a 30.5 cm segment of duodenum, a 7.9 x
4.9 x 4.8 cm apparent total pancreas, a 2.1 cm segment of superior
mesenteric vein, and an 8.7 x 3.8 x 1.6 cm detached gallbladder.
Upon sectioning, there is a 2.8 x 2.7 x 2.4 cm firm white

inﬁltrative mass within the uncinate process. The mass extends to
involve the duodenal wall, nearly obstructing the lumen. The mass
also invades the attached superior mesenteric vein and encases an
adjacent larger caliber artery, and extends to the uncinate margin.
The superior and inferior margins of the superior mesenteric vein
and the uncinate margins are shaved. The portal vein groove margin
is submitted perpendicularly. Peripancreatic and periduodenal lymph
nodes are identiﬁed. Representative sections are submitted.
