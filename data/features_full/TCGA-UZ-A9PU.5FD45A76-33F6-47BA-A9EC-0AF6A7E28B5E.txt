Clinical History

The patient is a ear-old male who was discovered to have an incidental ﬁnding of a 4.6 cm
enhancing renal mass on the anterior aspect of the mid to inferior pole of the right kidney. The patient
undergoes an open partial right nephrectomy.

Gross Description

The specimen is received in formalin in one part, labeled with the patient's name, medical record
number and "right partial nephrectomy,“ and consists of an unorlented ovoid apparent renal tissue that
is ﬁrm, and a soft apparent fat tissue. The total specimen measures 9.2 x 4.6 x 4.5 cm. The ovoid
renal tissue measures 6.2 x 4.5 x 3.8 cm and the fat tissue measures 9.2 x 3.5 x 0.5 cm. The specimen
was received with all margins inked black and has been serially sectioned. The renal mass abuts the
surgical margin and occupies approximately 90% of the renal tissue. The mass is ovoid and soft,
tan-white, and measures 5.8 x 4.5 x 3.3 cm. There is a red-brown region of apparent
necrosis/hemorrhage, measuring 3.1 x 2.7 x 2.5 cm, within the renal mass. A thin rim of apparent
renal parenchyma surrounds the mass, with the thickest depth measuring 0.9 cm. The perirenal fat is
soft and unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Cassette A1: Renal mass with resection margin, two sections.

Cassette A2: Renal mass showing relationship to inked perirenal fat, two sections.

Cassette A3: Renal mass showing relationship to inked perirenal fat, one section.

Cassette A4: Renal mass/necrosis, one section.

Cassette A5: Apparent normal renal
parenchyma, one section.

Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. Final diagnosis made by attending pathologist
following review of all pathology slides.
