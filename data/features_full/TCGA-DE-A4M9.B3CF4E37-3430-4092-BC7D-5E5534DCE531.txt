Comment:

Amendment Comment:

Following case finalization, it was brought to our attention
that this distorted specimen is only the right lobe and isthmus,
rather than the entire thyroid.

The dominant focus of carcinoma corresponds to the large right
lobe nodule, and is present in blocks Al—Al8. A separate small
focus is present in grossly normal gland in block A20. The
diagnosis and margin status are unchanged. The specimen received
is revised from total thyroidecomty to R lobe/isthmus, as above.

Clinical History:
-year—old male with right thyroid nodule interpreted as atypia
of undetermined significance on FNA.

Gross Description:
Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally
labeled "right isthmus and thyroid".

Specimen fixation: Formalin

Type of specimen: Total thyroidectomy

Size and weight of specimen: 30 grams, right lobe nodule (3.2 x
2.8 x 2.3 cm), remainder of left lobe and isthmus roughly (3.2 x
2.7 x 1.3 cm)

Orientation: Inking: anterior/blue, posterior/black,
isthmus/yellow

Tumor location: Right lobe
Focality: Unifocal
Dominant tumor: Right

Tumor description: Firm gray/white well-circumscribed, smooth
with focal hemorrhage

Tumor size: 3.0 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm

Confinement / non-confinement: Confined

Distance of tumor to capsule/inked surgical margins: Grossly
abuts the anterior and posterior capsule and isthmus, but with
no extension into the isthmus.

Appearance of thyroid gland away from tumor: The uninvolved
right thyroid parenchyma and all of the left thyroid parenchyma
is soft, red/brown with normal architecture.

Parathyroids: Not identified

Lymph nodes: N/A

Tissue submitted for special investigations: Tumor given to
tumor procurement foundation.

Digital photograph taken: No

submitted entirely)

normal right lobe and isthmus)
