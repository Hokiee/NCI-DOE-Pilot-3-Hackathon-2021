Surgery date: Surgical Pathology

DIAGNOSIS:
A. Lymph node, common hepatic artery, biopsy: A single (1' of l)

lymph node 15 1nvolved by adenocarcrnoma. 16$ - a _ 3

B. Pancreas, neck margin, excision: Negative for tumor. MWMM/ ﬁll! ”Hugs 9500/3
C. Common hepatic duct, margin, excision: Negative for tumor. 611' W “AWL 625‘ 0

D. Pancreatic head, duodenum, portion of jejunum, and gallbladder; 9’3 5/5/14}
pylorus-sparing Whipple resection: Invasive moderately to poorly
differentiated (grade 3 of 4) ductal adenocarcinoma is identiﬁed
forming a 3.2 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm solid mass located in the pancreatic
head. The tumor extends beyond the pancreas to involve
peripancreatic soft tissue. Angiolymphatic invasion is present.
Perineural invasion is present. Tumor necrosis is absent. The
uncinate margin is positive for invasive carcinoma. The remaining
margins are uninvolved. The adjacent non—neoplastic pancreatic
parenchyma shows chronic pancreatitis. Multiple (4 of 18) regional
lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, including a
common hepatic artery lymph node (see part A).

With available surgical material, [AJ CC pT3N1] (7th edition, 2010).

This ﬁnal pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic
examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of the
specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are
reviewed to conﬁrm these ﬁndings. Any substantive changes
identiﬁed on permanent section review will be reﬂected in a

revised report.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received fresh labeled "common hepatic artery lymph nodes" is a
2.7 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm lymph node. Lymph nodes submitted. Grossed by

B. Received fresh labeled "pancreatic neck margin" is a 3.2 x 1.5 x
0.3 cm fragment of tan pancreatic tissue with orientation. Margin
submitted. Grossed by .

C. Received fresh labeled "common hepatic duct margin" is a 1.0 x
1.0 x 0.3 cm fragment of tan soft tubular tissue with orientation.
Margin submitted. Grossed by

D. Received fresh labeled "pancreatic head, duodenum, portion of
jejunum, gallbladder" is a Whipple specimen consisting of 24.0 cm in
length portion of duodenum, 8.5 x 4.3 x 3.5 cm portion of pancreas,

and a 9.0 X 4.5 x 1.0 cm gallbladder. The pancreatic uncinate
margin is inked yellow and shaved. The portal vein groove is inked
black and submitted perpendicularly. There is a 3.2 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm
tan, firm diffusely inﬁltrative solid mass within the head of the
pancreas at the uncinate margin. The mass extends to the
peripancreatic soft tissue. A stent is present within the common
bile duct. The gallbladder contains no choleliths. Peripancreatic
and periduodenal lymph nodes are identiﬁed. Representative
sections are submitted. Grossed by
