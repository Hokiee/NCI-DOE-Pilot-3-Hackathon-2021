Intraoperative Consultation:
An intraoperative non-microscopic consultation was obtained and interpreted as:
“Called to pick up '#2, uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries,’ consisting of a
radical hysterectomy specimen with a uterus measuring 8 x 6 x 4 cm. The
posterior surface of the cervix has a small soft tissue fragment attached to it.
Opening the uterus reveals a smooth endometrial surface with no grossly
identifiable lesion. The myometrium contains small leiomyomas. Dr.
informed. All for permanents. By .
FSl: Omentum, biopsy

- "Adenocarcinoma, consistent with Mullerian origin," by a

MicrOSCOpic Description and Comment:

Histologic sections show extensive peritoneal tumor extension. The ovaries are
normal in size, with multifocal involvement. The tumor may represent a primary
peritoneal serous carcinoma.

History:

The patient is a year old woman with ovarian carcinoma and omental caking.
Operative procedure: Exploratory laparotomy with total abdominal hysterectomy
and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

Specimen(s) Received:

A: OMENTUM

B: HYSTERECTOMY, UTERUS, TUBES, OVARIES AND CERVIX

C: GASTRIC COLIC OMENTUM

D: RIGHT PERIRENAL MASS

Gross Description
The specimens are received in four formalin—filled containers, each labeled

The first container is labeled "omentum, FSl/X" and holds
multiple pieces of fatty tissue measuring, in aggregate, 4.5 x 3.5 x 0.3 cm.
The specimen appears to be diffusely infiltrated by fibrotic tissue suggesting
tumor. Included in the container is a white cassette holding a piece of fatty
tissue measuring 2.2 x 1 x 0.3 cm. Labeled Al (F81); A2, A3 — additional pieces
of fatty tissue "X" Jar l.
The second container is labeled "uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries" and holds a
uterus with bilateral adnexae weighing 172 grams. The uterine serosa is
remarkable for the presence of multiple nodular lesions involving the anterior
and posterior surface. The lesions appear to coalesce in some areas. They
range in size from 1 to 0.7 cm in diameter. The right and left lateral portion
of the uterus has been previously inked black. Small vessels are identified at
this area; some may represent parametrial tissue. The parametrial tissue
appears to be involved by fibrous indurated tissue, maybe representing tumor
implants. The uterus measures 8 cm from superior to inferior, 6 cm in width and
4 cm from anterior to posterior. The cervix measures 0.5 cm in length and 4 cm
in diameter. No vaginal cuff is grossly identified. The endocervix and lower
uterine segment are grossly unremarkable. The uterine cavity is triangular in
shape. The endometrium has an average thickness of 1 mm and no endometrial
lesions are grossly identified. The myometrial thickness is 2.5 cm and an
intramyometrial leiomyoma, measuring 0.6 cm, is identified toward the lateral
left uterine wall. The left fallopian tube measures 3 cm in length and 0.4 cm
in average circumference. The serosa is grossly unremarkable. The right ovary
mnaenrge 1 v 1 F. v 1 (‘fn_ “PI-1n Qty-om; ig gray—white. and grnssly unremarkable.

The left fallopian tube measures 4.5 cm in length land 0.5 cm in average

The third container is labeled "gastrocolonic omentum" and holds multiple pieces
of fatty tissue that are grossly consistent with an omentum. The specimen
measures, in aggregate, 22 x 16 x 1.5 cm. The omentum appears to be diffusely
infiltrated by gray—white tumor in an area that represents, upon reconstruction,

The fourth container is labeled "right perirenal mass" and holds a piece of
fibrous tissue measuring 3 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm. On sectioning, it appears to be
diffusely infiltrated by tumor in all extension. Labeled Dl. Jar l.

HISTOPATHOLOGIC TYPE
The histologic diagnosis is serous adenocarcinoma

TUMOR LOCATION
The locations of the primary tumor(s) are the right and left ovary (synchronous
primary tumors)

HISTOLOGIC GRADE
The histologic grade is poorly differentiated (GB)

TUMOR INVASION
Tumor does invade the adjacent fallopian tube/peritubal soft tissue

TUMOR INVOLVEMENT
Metastatic involvement of the omentum is present

TUMOR SIZE
The maximum dimension of tumor implants outside the true pelvis is greater than
or equal to 2 cm

PRIMARY TUMOR (T)
Based on the above information, the primary tumor is classified as macroscopic

REGIONAL LYMPH NODES (N)
The regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed (NX)

DISTANT METASTASIS (M)
The status of distant tumor site cannot be assessed (MX)
