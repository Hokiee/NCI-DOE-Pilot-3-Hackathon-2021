Final Diagnosis:

A-C. Cranium. left anterolateral temporal lobe #l, #2 and (ESSA resection: Low gade oligoastmcytoma.
astrocytic predominant (WHO grade II).

 

Seen in consultation with

lmmunohistochemical stains were performed on parafﬁn embedded tissue using antibodies to GFAP. IDHl

(RI 32H). p53 and 1067. GFAP is positive in tumor cells. many of them with abundant cytoplasm and processes.
IDHI (RI32H) stain is negative. p53 protein is weakly to moderately expressed in tumor cells. Kiﬁ‘l labeling is
low. This immunophenotype supports above diagnosis.
