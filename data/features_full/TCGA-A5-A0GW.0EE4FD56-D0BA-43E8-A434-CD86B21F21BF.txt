Final Diagnosis

A. Uterus and cervix (hysterectomy, 85 gm):

— Polypoid adenocarcinoma, endometrioid.type, FIGO grade 2~3,
1.6 X 1.5 X 1.0 Cm

— Tumor shows superficial myometrial invasion involving 7% of
myometrial wall thickness (0.1 cm /1.4 cm).

— Tumor does not involve lower uterine segment or cervix.

— Highly suspicious for lymphovascular invasion.

- Left and right parametrial margins are negative for
malignancy.

— Background complex hyperplasia with atypia identified in lower
uterine segment.

~ Unremarkable ectocervix and endocervix.

— Follicular cyst of right ovary.

— Hemorrhagic corpus luteum cyst of left ovary.

- Unremarkable right and left fallopian tubes.

B. Left pelvic lymph node (excision):
— Four lymph nodes negative for malignancy (0/4).

C. Left periaortic lymph node (excision):
— Three lymph nodes negative for malignancy (0/3).

D. Right pelvic lymph node (excision):
— Fibroadipose tissue, no lymph nodes identified

E. Right periaortic lymph node (excision):
- Two lymph nodes negative for malignancy (0/2).

Clinical History
year-old female with endometrial cancer.

Pre Operative Diagnosis
Endometrial cancer.

Operation Performed
LSC hysterectomy; BSO + BPPALND.

Gross Description
The specimen is received in 5 parts.

Part A is labeled "uterus and cervix" and consists of a uterus
and cervix with attached adnexa, previously opened, laterally on
the right side. The specimen weighs 85 grams and measures

10.5 X 7.5 X 4.5 cm in aggregate. The left fallopian tube
measures 3.4 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter. The left ovary
measures 2.6 X 2.4 X 1.5 cm and is tan—white with multiple, <
0.5 cm serous cysts. The right fallopian tube measures 3.2 cm
in length by 0.4 cm in diameter. The right ovary measures 3.0 X
2.2 X 1.8 cm and is tan-white with multiple subcentimeter cystic
lesions. The uterus measures 5.5 cm in width, 7.3 cm in length,
and 3.5 cm anterior to posterior. The cervix measures 2.6 cm in
diameter. The endometrial cavity contains a 1.6 X 1.5 X 1.0 cm,
soft, partially necrotic lesion in the anterior half. The
endometrial cavity measures 2.0 x 5.0 X 0.6 cm. The myometrium
measures 1.3 cm in thickness and the endometrium measures 0.2 cm
in thickness. The tumor is located 1.2 cm from the anterior
margin and 1.2 cm from the posterior margin. The specimen is
inked as follows: anterior=red, posterior=black, right
parametrium=orange, left parametrium=green. Representative
sections are submitted as follows:
