Gross Description:

l).The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "left colon, stitch marks
proximal". It consists of a sigmoid colon that measures 20 CM in length and
five CM in diameter. The serosal surface is focally puckered and wrapped by
fat towards the distal aspect of the specimen. The radial serosal surface is
inked black and the specimen is opened to reveal an ulcerated tumor
measuring 5x2x0.4 cm causing slight constriction near the proximal end.
Tumor is located 13 cm from the distal margin and 6 cm from the proximal
margin. Serial sectioning reveals tumor invasion to a depth of 0.4 cm
penetrating through the muscularis propria.. The remaining mucosa appears
grossly unremarkable. Pericolic and peri-rectal adipose tissue is
thoroughly examined for lymph nodes, and all possible nodes are submitted.
Representative sections are submitted. TPS is submitted.

Summary of sections:
PM - proximal margin
DM - distal margin
T - Tumor

U - uninvolved mucosa
LN - lymph nodes

 

2) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Gallbladder" and consists
of a variegated pink-tan to red purple gallbladder measuring 7.0 x 3.5 x 3.0
cm. The surface of the gallbladder is smooth and glistening with no apparent
defects. It is opened to reveal 30 cc of green black bile, with a yellow
black multi-lobulated friable gallstone attached to the mucosal surface.

The remainder of the mucosa is yellow-green smooth and velvety. The wall
thickness measures up to 0.2 cm. Representative sections including the
cystic duct margin are submitted.

Summary of sections:
M - cystic duct margin
U - undesignated

3) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "hepatic artery lymph node"
and consists of a pink-tan rubbery lymph node measuring 1.3 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm.
The lymph node is bisected and entirely submitted.
