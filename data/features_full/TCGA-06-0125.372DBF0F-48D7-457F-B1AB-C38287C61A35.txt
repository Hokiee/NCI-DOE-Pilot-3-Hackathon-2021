PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:

A. OCCIPITAL LOBE:

l. BENIGN CEBRAL CORTEX WITH MILD GLIOSIS.

2. UNREMARKABLE LEPTOMENINGES.

B. BRAIN TUMOR, BIOPSY: GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME. (MIB: 15%)
Operation/Specimen: Occipital pole — FS.

Clinical History and Pre-Op Dx: H/O Crani for tumor

GROSS PATHOLOGY:

A. Occipital pole: Multiple tissue fragments, 0.4-0.6 cm.
INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION, Frozen section diagnosis: Brain
parenchyma with gliosis. CASSETTES: l, 2.

B. Brain tumor: Multiple 0.5—1.2 cm. tissue fragments.
INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION, Frozen section diagnosis: Glioma.
CASSETTES: Glioma in cassette 3, remaining tissue in cassettes 4, 5.

MICROSCOPIC: A. Sections show well preserved cerebral cortex with

mild gliosis. No neoplasm present. The leptomeninges appears

unremarkable with no evidence of glioma cells. Immunostain for GFAP

confirms the absence of glioma cells in the leptomeninges.

B. Sections show high grade glioma with hypercellularity, vascularendothelial
hyperplasia and foci of necrosis. These changes are

consistent with recurrent glioma.
