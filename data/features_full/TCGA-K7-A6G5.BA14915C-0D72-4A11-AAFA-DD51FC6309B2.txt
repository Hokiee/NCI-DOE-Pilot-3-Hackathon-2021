comment
Trichrome, reticulin, and iron stains examined.

By immunohistochemistry, the tumor is positive for Heppar and
glypican. CEA polyclonal shows a canalicular pattern. The
morphology and immunoprofile supports the above diagnosis.

Appropriate positive ccntrols were stained along side sections
from this case. The ccntrol tissue was examined and judged to
be technically acceptakle.
