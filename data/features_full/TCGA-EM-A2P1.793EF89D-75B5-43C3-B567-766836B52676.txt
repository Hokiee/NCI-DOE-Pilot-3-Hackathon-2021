Gross Descri tion

1. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "Left level Vi" contains one piece of tan
tissue measuring 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm received in 10% buffered formalin.

1A submitted in toto

2. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "Left Thyroid, Bilateral Level 6 and 7' and
Right Level 3 and 4" consists of a thyroid gland and attached neck dissection received attached
to a green towel and is oriented by the surgeon weighing 35.0 g. The right thyroid lobe measures
4.1 cm Si x 2.2 cm ML x 1.2 cm AP, the left thyroid lobe measures 3.2 cm Si x 2.2 cm ML x 0.9
cm AP and the isthmus measures 2.5 cm Si x 1.8 cm ML x 0.4 cm AP. The external surfaces
have fibrous adhesions and are painted with silver nitrate. No parathyroid glands or no lymph
nodes are identiﬁed grossly. The neck dissection measures 6.0 cm Si x 6.5 cm ML x 1.0 cm AP.
The left lobe contains ill-delineated nodule that measures 3.1 cm Si x 1.5 cm ML x 0.9 cm AP.
The isthmus contains a well delineated nodule that measures 0.4 cm Si x 0.3 cm ML x 0.4 cm
AP. The remainder of the thyroid tissue is unremarkable. Left level 6-7 demonstrates a tumor that
measures 2.5 cm Sl x 1.6 cm ML x 0.9 cm AP. The tumor is ﬁrm and yellow tan. The right level 3-
4 demonstrates a tumor mass that measures 2.1 cm Si x and 1.3 cm ML x 0.8 cm AP. Additional

lymph nodes that range from 0.2 to 2.0 cm are identified. Tissue is stored frozen. Representative
sections are submitted.
