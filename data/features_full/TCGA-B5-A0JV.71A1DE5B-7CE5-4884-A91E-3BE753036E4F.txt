CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm of the corpus uteri, abnormal bleeding (post menopausal).

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries (AFl-Z)". Received fresh is a
179.2 gram (11 x 7.5 x 4 cm) uterus with bilateral adnexa. The serosal
surface (anterior) discloses multiple subserosal leiomyomata (0.6 cm) and a 2
cm powder burn mark. The opened specimen reveals a 6 x 4 cm exophytic tumor
diffusely involving both anterior and posterior endometrial surfaces, invading
to a maximum depth of 0.6 cm in a a 2.3 cm thick myometrium (Al, frozen
section remnant AFl). The tumor extends to within 1.5 cm of the anterior
endocervical 05, and 2.5 cm from the posterior endocervical os. . The cervix
(posterior) discloses a 0.6 x 0.6 cm endophytic polyp located 1 cm from the
exocervical 05. The right adnexa consist of an ovary and fimbriated fallopian
tube (2/5 cm) which are both unremarkable. The left adnexa consist of an
ovary and fimbriated fallopian tube (1.9/5.5 cm) and are both unremarkable.
The paracervical soft tissue margins are grossly negative, and the remainder
of the myometrium is unremarkable.

B. "Proximal right IP". Received fresh is a 1.5 x 1 x 1 cm fragment of
fibroadipose tissue. The specimen is unoriented and unremarkable. The
specimen is bisected and submitted entirely in block Bl.

C. "Right periaortic node". Received fresh is a 2.5 x 2 x 0.7 cm fragment of
fibroadipose tissue. The specimen contains one 2 cm lymph node which is
bisected and submitted entirely in block C1.

D. "Right pelvic node". Received fresh is a 6 x 4 x 1.7 cm aggregate of
multiple fragments of fibroadipose tissue. Multiple candidate nodes are

found, the largest of which is 3 cm in greatest dimension.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Dl— largest node bisected

D2- two lymph node candidates (one black and bisected)
D3- additional candidates

E. "Left periaortic", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 1 x 1 cm
lymph node candidate. The specimen is submitted entirely in block E1.

F. "Left pelvic node", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 5.5 x 3 x
1.5 cm aggregate of fibroadipose tissue. Multiple lymph node candidates are
found, the largest of which is 2 cm in greatest dimension. The candidates are
inserted in blocks F1—3.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: HYSTERECTOMY, OOPHORECTOMY & LYMPHADENECTOMY

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 6th Edition): pT2b pNO pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.
