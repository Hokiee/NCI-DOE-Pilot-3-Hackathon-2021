A. The specimen consists of a 7.0 x 3.2 x 1.5 cm gallbladder with e grey
congested across. The thickness of the wall ranges from 0.2 to 0.3 cm. The
mucosal surface-is green and velvety. No stones are identified. The cystic
duct is patent. Three representative sections are submitted in cassette A.

\Mr B. The specimen consists of an irregular ﬂragment of soft tissue measuring
1.1 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm. Bisected and submitted in toto in cassette 8.

C. The specimen consists of a 21.0 cm oﬂ duodenum with a proximal segment of
pancreas measuring 4.5 x ¢.6 x 2.5 cm. The common bile duct is patent and its
resection margin is taken enfnce. There is s 3.5 x 1.2 x 2.6 cm firm mass
occupying all the tissue located above one common bile duct, This mass is
located at 0.2 cm from the surface in contact with the mesenteric blood
vessels and 0‘4 cm from the anterior surface of the pancreas. Located at the
mucosal surface at 3.3 cm and 7.4 cm from the proximal reacotion, there are

MIGR03COPIG DESCRIPTION:
atroma. The uncinate and other main resection margins are clear of malignant
cells but there is extranodal invacive carcinoma around the pyloric nodes
that touchaa the painted outer surface of the specimen. Two of the pyloric
nodes hava metastatic cancer. 15 other nodéc are negative.
The resection margin at the neck of the pancreaa is exact of carcinoma, but
\M’ there are Home atypical changes compatible with PAN IN 13 and 2 present in the
pancreatic duct at this margin.
