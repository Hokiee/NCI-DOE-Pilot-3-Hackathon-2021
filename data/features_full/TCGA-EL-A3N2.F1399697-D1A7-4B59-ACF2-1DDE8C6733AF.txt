SROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT LATERAL NECK DISSECTlON — An unoriented fragment of tan—yellow adipose tissue (11.0 x 5‘0 x 1.0 cm).

Two possibly grossly positive lymph nodes are present 1.5 and 2.5 cm. The larger positive lymph node has a cystic
component Remainder of the specimen consists of multiple possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 to 1.3 cm. .

SECTION CODE: A1, largest positive lymph node entirely submitted; A2, second possibly positive lymph node
entirely submitted; A3. A4. one possible lymph node in each bisected; A5. four possible lymph nodes; Ae-Ae, three possible
lymph nodes in each.

(3) LEFT LARYNGEAL weave, QUERY TUMOR -— A single fragment of red-brown tissue (0.4 x 0.8 x 0.1 cm), Entirely
submitted in 81 for frozen section diagnosis.

(C) QUESTlON LEFT SUPERlOR PARATHYROID ~— A tiny soft tissue (0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm, weighing 0.005 grams) is
submitted entirely in Cl for frozen diagnosis.

*FS/DX: BENIGN FlBROADlPOSE TISSUE.
(0) TOTAL THYROIDECTOMY AND BILATERAL LEVEL Vl ~ A (4.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm) left thyroid lobe with attached (3.5 x 2.5 x
0.2 cm) fragment of adipose tissue and a detached right thyroid lobe (4.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm). The entire specimen weighs 0.02 kg.

A yellow to brown mass entirely replaces the left lobe. This mass extends to involve the external surface where there
is a 2.00m are of papillary excrescences. The cut surface of this lesion is also diffusely ﬁrm with no areas of hemorrhage or
necrosrs,

The right lobe consists of red~brown unremarkable thyroid tissue. The attached adipose tissue is sectioned to reveal
multiple lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 cm with a 0.7 cm lymph node grossly positive.

SECTlON CODE: Di-DT. lesion in left lobe with cassettes 1~5 containing papillary external surface extension; D8-
010, representative right lobe; Di 1, one grossly positive lymph node entirely submitted; 012, three possible lymph nodes;
013, four possible lymph nodes; 014-016, remainder of adipose tissue entirely submitted.
