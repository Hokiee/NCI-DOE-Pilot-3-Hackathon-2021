Left lobe liver (2195 grams, 26 x 16 x 9 cm), separately submitted tissue from
Segment V liver (30 grams, 5 x 4 x 3 cm), needle biopsy from Segment V liver No.1
(2 mm) and No.2 (7 mm), left periportal lymph node (2.1 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm) and
gallbladder (8 x 3.5 x 2 cm). A1, Bl, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, Dl, D2, E1
