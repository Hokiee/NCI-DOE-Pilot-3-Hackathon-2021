The lmmunohlstochemical stains on the first sentinel lymph node (specimen A) reveals seven
positive cells with the Cytokeratin stain In the subcapsuiar space Indicating incidental microscopic
micrometastases. The seven cells are in total measurements less than 0.1 mm. The second lymph node
(specimen B) is negative. No individual positive cells seen.
