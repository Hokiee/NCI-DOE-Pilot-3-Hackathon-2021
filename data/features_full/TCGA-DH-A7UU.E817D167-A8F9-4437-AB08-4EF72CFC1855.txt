COMMENT: Sections show an infiltrating glioma with prominent nuclear and
cellular pleomorphism and non-uniformity and increased mitoses. There
are scattered blood vessels with prominent endothelium, however,
definitive microvascular proliferation is not identiﬁed in this
material. There is individual cell necrosis but no deﬁnitive
pseudopalisading or geographic areas of necrosis are seen. Tumor cells
and tumor cell processes are immunoreactive for GFAP. The tumor is

positive for mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH-l). P53 is

immunoreactive in numerous tumor cell nuclei (70% approximately). PHH3
conﬁrms increased mitotic activity (up to 25 mitoses per 10 high power
fields). Ki—67 confirms an elevated proliferation index (up to 30%
approximately). These ﬁndings support the diagnosis.
' has reviewed this case and concurs.
Molecular testing for 1p and 19q chromosome status has been ordered and
results will follow in an addendum to this report.

8. Brain tumor
A. The specimen is received fresh designated "brain tumor" and consists
of multiple irregular and varying sized fragments of pink to tan soft
tissue measuring 2.5 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm in aggregate. Three representative
pieces are submitted for frozen section, as well as a single
representative piece submitted for touch preparation. The resulting
intraoperative diagnosis is "Infiltrating glioma. Defer ﬁnal grade to
permanent sections. The frozen section tissue
is resubmitted for permanent processing in cassette FSA1, and the

remaining tissue is submitted entirely in cassette A2.

B. The specimen is received fresh designated "brain tumor” and consists
of multiple pink-beige-tan and red soft tissue fragments measuring 2.5 x
1.5 x 0.4 cm in aggregate. The specimen is submitted entirely in cassette

Test description

Reference range: 1p/ 19q: Non-deleted

A tumor is considered to have 1p or 19q deletion when the 1p probe to 1q
probe ratio (1p/1q) or the 19q probe to 19p probe ratio (19q/19p) is

1.30. A tumor is considered to have chromosome 1 or 19 gain when the
percentage of nuclei with > or =3 signals is >20%. A normal 1p/1q ratio

is 0.9-1.05 and a normal 19q/19 p ratio is 0.93-1.02.

The test uses two dual-probe p36 probe combined with a
control 1q probe and a 19q13.3 probe combined with a control 19p probe.
Probes are specific to the minimally deleted regions of 1p (1p36) and 19q
(19q13.3) to detect 1p and 19q deletion. The selection of tissue and the
identification of target areas on the H&E stained slide is performed by a
pathologist. The number of 1p and 19q signals in the area of interest is
scored. The testing was performed and performance characteristics of this
test were validated by the
