COMMENT: ~

A high percentage of tumor ceIls (greater than 20%) immunostainin for MGMT has been re orted to be
associated with a relatively diminished response to Temodar # Hence,
the low 3% result in this case suggests a-ltkelihood of this tumor being responswe o emo er.

Recent studies have shown that co-expression of EGFRvIII and PTEN as detected by immunosiainini

5‘ hi Icantl correlated with a clinical response of gliobiastomas to EGFR kinase inhibitors
Hence the loss of PTEN in this case suggests a diminished probability of
response 0 - mass in Ibitors. ‘
