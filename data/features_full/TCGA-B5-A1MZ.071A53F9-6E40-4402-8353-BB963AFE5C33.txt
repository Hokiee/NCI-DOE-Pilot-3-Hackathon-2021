CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm corpus. Grade 2 endometrial adenocarcinoma.

 

 

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries", received freSh for frozen and later
placed in formalin at on is a 200 gram, 10.6 x 4.7 x 7 cm
hysterectomy specimen with 0.5 cm in diameter cervix and 1.1 cm in diameter
patent 05. The soft tissue around the cervix is inked blue and the serosal
surface is inked black. No lesions are seen in the serosa. Opening the
cervix reveals 7.5 cm in length x 5.5 cm in diameter endometrial cavity. The
endocervical canal is 4.5 cm in length x 0.7 cm in width. Approximately 8.1 x
3.5 x 0.9 cm, tan—brown, exophytic lesion is seen near the right cornu and
extending 3.5 cm away from the nearest ectocervix, located in the posterior
segment of the uterus. On cut section, the endometrium is 0.2 cm in thickness
and the myometrium is 2.9 cm in thickness. The lesion extends 0.9 cm into the
2.9 cm myometrium. Representative section of the deepest extension is
submitted for frozen in blocks AFl-2, frozen section remnant submitted in
blocks A1—2, respectively. Approximately 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.5 cm intramural nodule
is seen in the posterior segment of the uterus.

The right fallopian tube is 5.1 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter. Sectioning
reveals a 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm pedunculated paratubal cyst. The right ovary is
2.3 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm. Sectioning reveals no mass or lesions. The left fallopian
tube is 6.2 cm in length x 0.9 cm in diameter. Sectioning reveals no mass or
lesion. The left ovary is 1.9 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm. The cut surface is yellow-tan
and lobulated with no mass or lesions.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

A1-2— frozen section remnant AFl—2, full-thickness deepest extension of the

lesion
A3- endocervical canal, anterior section
A4— lower uterine segment, anterior segment
A5— endocervical canal, posterior segment
A6— lower uterine segment, posterior segment

A7-8— representative section of the lesion
A9—10- representative full-thickness of the lesion

 

All- full-thickness section of anterior segment of the uterus

A12— full-thickness section of the posterior segment of the uterus

Al3- representative section of intramural nodule

A14~ representative section of right fallopian tube and ovary

AlS- representative section of left fallopian tube and ovary

B. "Left external iliac", received fresh and placed in formalin at . on

is a 6.2 x 4.5 x 1.5 cm aggregate of fibrofatty tissue. Dissection
reveal four lymph node candidates ranging from 1.5 to 2.6 cm in greatest
dimension. Largest lymph node is bisected and submitted in block B1. Two
lymph node candidates, one is inked and both are bisected and submitted in
block 82. Remaining lymph node and fibrofatty tissue is submitted in block
B3.

C. "Left obturator node", received fresh and placed in formalin at -w on

is a 5.5 x 4.6 x 1.1 cm aggregate of fibrofatty tissue. Dissection
reveals 12 lymph node candidates ranging from 0.5 to 2.3 cm in greatest
dimension. The largest lymph node is bisected and one lymph node is inked
black and submitted in block Cl. Three lymph node candidates are submitted in
block C2. Remaining lymph nodes are submitted in block C3.

D. "Right pelvic node", received fresh and placed in formalin at on

> is a 7.1 x 6.5 x 0.9 cm aggregate of fibrofatty tissue. Dissection
lcvedls 15 lymph node candidates. The largest lymph node candidate is
bisected and in addition two lymph node candidates, one inked blue and the
other inked black is submitted in block Dl. Remaining lymph node candidates
are submitted in blocks D2—3. Remaining fibrofatty tissue submitted in block
D4.

E. "sigmoid nodule", received fresh and placed in formalin at on
is a 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm tan nodule, submitted in toto in a mesh bag in
block E1.

F. "Gallbladder", received fresh and placed in formalin at ‘ on

is a 6.5 x 2.7 x 1.1 cm cholecystectomy specimen. One surface is rough with
dense fibrous adhesions, consistent with hepatic surface. The opposite
surface is smooth, green-tan, and glistening, consistent with serosa. The
cystic margin is taken and submitted in block F1. Opening the gallbladder
reveals multiple green, faceted stones, ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 cm in greatest
dimension. The gallbladder mucosa is yellow-green, consistent with
cholesterolosis. No discrete mass or lesions are seen. On section, the
gallbladder wall thickness is 0.2 cm. Representative section of the
gallbladder mucosa is submitted in block Fl.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:

A. "Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries": AF1-2 (full—thickness, bisected)-
grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma,
invasion of inner third of myometrium

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: Hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 7th Edition): pTla pNO pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.
