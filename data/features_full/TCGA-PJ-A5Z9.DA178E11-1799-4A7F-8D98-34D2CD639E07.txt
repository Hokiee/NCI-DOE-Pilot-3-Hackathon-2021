GROSS DESCRIPTION:

Received fresh is a 75-gram, 6.5 x 6.3 x 5.8 cm soft, nodular. red-gray partial nephrectomy covered with a few tags
of golden yellow perinephric fat. The irregular, partially cauterized 5 x 4.5 cm resectional margin is inked.
Sectioning reveals a soft, nodular. friable. dusky, mottled yellow-gray to red-gray 6 x 5.7 x 4.9 cm mass which
appears grossly to come within 0.1 cm of the inked margin of resection. The nodular mass does not grossly
appear to invade through the renal capsule. There is a narrow rim of rubbery. red.gray renal parenchyma present
at the base of the specimen. Representative sections to include the inked margin are submitted in A1-A2.
Additional sections to include the periphery are submitted in A3.

Slides were microscopically examined by the pathologist.
