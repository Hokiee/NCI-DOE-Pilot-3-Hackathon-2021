Gross Description

Received is a single specimen contain-r The recuisition and specimen container are
labelled with the patient's name,» U . The cassette and identifiers are
labelled with the Surgical Number ‘, .

The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The container
is designated “Liver segment 3". This consists of a segmental resection of liver tissue,
weighing 201 g and measuring 9.5 cm across the surgical resection margin x 7.5 cm
perpendicular to the resection margin x 6.0 cm. The shape of the specimen appears to be a
protuberant nodule beneath the capsule of the liver. The capsule appears grossly intact.
The resection margin is painted blue. Much of the sample is occupied by a well rounded.
multinodular tumor that shows areas of hemorrhage and possible necrosis. Some of the
smaller lobulated nodules are also discolored green. The tumor measures 8.5 x 7.0 x 6.0
cm. This mass extends close to the capsule with areas of sclerosis on the capsular
surface. Between the tumor mass and the resection margin is a zone of parenchyma with a
nodular, cirrhotic appearance. The tumor lies 0.6 cm from the margin at its nearest
point. There is no gross evidence of vascular invasion. Towards one side there appears to

be attached adipose tissue on the capsular surface overlying the tumor. Sections are
taken as follows:

A1 to 4. tumor with nearest resection margin
A5 to 8. tumor with capsular surface

A9/10. additional sections of tumor

All/12. liver parenchyma away from tumor mass

Microscopic Description

Sections show hepatocellular carcinoma with the typical nodular and trabecular growth
pattern with broad trabeculae, mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism, and scattered
mitotic activity. The morphology is compatible with grade II hepatocellular carcinoma.
There is one focus with venous invasion at the edge of the tumor nodule, but no distant
venous invasion can be seen. The resection margins are clear by 6 mm on the histology
evaluation. The liver capsule shows fibrous thickening overlying the tumor, but there is
no clear evidence of extracapsular extension and the adherent adipose tissue is not
involved.

The adjacent liver shows well developed cirrhosis. There are well preserved portal
tracts. but architecture between portal tracts and central venules is disturbed with
multiple small nodules. There is a chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the portal tracts
and fibrous septae focally aggregating into nodules. but also focally showing spill over
and obscuring of the liver cell plates, consistent with mild and focal interface
hepatitis. This is mostly made up of small lymphocytes. but plasma cells can be easily
found. There is minimal fatty change in the parenchyma and minimal hemosiderin
accumulation. No other abnormal inclusions can be seen. Immunostains for hepatitis B
surface and core antigen are negative. The etiology of the underlying cirrhosis is
difficult to ascertain, but the areas with lymphoid aggregates and the past history of
documented Hep C would be compatible with this being the main etiology. The presence of
plasma cells always the consideration of autoimmune hepatitis, but the morphology is not
specific. An additional finding that might correlate with the imageing are areas with
bile duct dilation and aggregation in the fibrous septa recapitulating the pattern of Von
Meyenbergs complexes, but more comptible with secondary change due to the cirrhosis.
