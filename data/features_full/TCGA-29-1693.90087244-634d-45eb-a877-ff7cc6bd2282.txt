CLINICAL HISTORY:
Not provided.

GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. "Omentum (AF1)", received fresh for frozen section is a 20 x 6 x 2 cm
portion of omentum with numerous firm papillary tumor nodules up to 4 cm in
diameter {frozen section AFl remnant), additional in block A2.

B. "Left thigh lipoma, short stitch superior, longulateral". received unfixed
is an 11 x 7 x 4 cm mass comprised primarily of well defined lobules of
adipose tissue. The specimen is marked with blue ink and representative
sections are submitted in block Bl.

C. "Right tube and ovary", received unfixed is a 2 x l x cm ovary and attached
3.5 x 0.5 cm fallopian tube. A tiny focus of papillary material is present
focally on the ovarian surface (Cl).

D. "Left ovarian mass", received unfixed is a 3 x 2 x 0.6 cm solid tumor
composed of moderately firm white tissue (D1).

E. "Left ovary", received unfixed is a 58 gram, 6.5 x 6 x 2.5 cm specimen
consisting of a complex multicystic mass with extensive areas of solid tumor
formation and focal necrosis (El—E3). No definitive ovarian or fallopian tube
remnant are identified.

F. "Omentum", received unfixed is a 6 x 3 x 1.0 cm fragment of omentum with a
single lesion 0.5 cm area suspicious for tumor (Fl).

G. "Left pelvic side wall", received unfixed is a 3 x 3 x 1 cm fragment of
adipose tissue with embedded and adherent firm white tissue (G1).

H. "Sigmoid colon", received unfixed is an unoriented segment of large bowel
12 cm in length that is stapled at both ends. The serosal surface is
hemorrhagic and there is extensive deposits of tumor in several fcci extending
from the serosal surface and into the wall of the colon. The opened specimen
reveals a single focus of transmural tumor invasion with extensive underlining
of the mucosa and numerous tumor nodules in the pericolonic adipose tissue
{H1—H2:largest lesion, H3: additional lesion). The mucosal margin of resection
appears grossly free of tumor {Hd—HS).

I. "Right pelvic side wall", received unfixed is a 2 X 2 x 1 cm aggregate of
multiple fragments of irregular tan and brown tissue which are submitted in
toto in block 11.

J. "Transverse colon nodule”, received unfixed is a firm white nodule 2 x 1 x
1 cm in size with a small amount of surrounding adipose tissue (J1).

K. "Left pelvic side wall“, received unfixed are several fragments of
hemorrhagic firm white tissue measuring 2 x 2 x 1 cm in aggregate which are
submitted in toto in block Kl.
