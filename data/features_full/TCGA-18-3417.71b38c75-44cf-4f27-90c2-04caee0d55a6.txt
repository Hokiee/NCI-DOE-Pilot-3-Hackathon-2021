WENT
6. Sections of specimen 6 show soft tissue with rare small clusters of

tumour cells. One such cluster demonstrates probable perineural invasion.

8. Sections show two separate tumors composed of poorly differentiated
carcinoma with focal suggestion of squamous differentiation. The larger
tumor is found superiorly in_the lower lobe. This tumor invades and
puckers the overlying pleura, but chest wall invasion and invasion into
the upper lobe are not identified. However, a second tumor is identified
more centrally in the upper lobe. This is separate from the RLL tumor,
measures 3 cm in greatest dimension, and shows similar histology to that
of the RLL tumor. The tumor demonstrates extensive vascular invasion,
including invasion of some larger vessels, and several pulmonary infarcts
are noted in the upper lobe. Multiple peribronchial lymph nodes are
involved by tumor, including by direct invasion of the RUL tumor. By
immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells show strong cytoplasmic staining
for I 5/6, focal moderate staining for high and low molecular weight
cytokeratin, and moderate to strong nuclear staining for p63. The tumor
cells are negative for cytokeratin 7 and 20, and TTF~1. The morphological
and immunohistochemical features are consistent with poorly
differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Given the morphologic
similarities betwaen the RUL and RLL tumors and the extent of vascular
invasion, the RUL tumor is strongly favored to represent a metastasis
from the RLL tumor. The pathologic stage is therefore assessed to be
pTZNlMl. -

8. The Specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "LUNG: right lung
bronchial resection with ribs 4 & 5/QS". The specimen is received fresh
and subsequently placed in to 10% buffered formalin.. It consists of a
right lung: upper, middle and lower lobes, with overall dimensions of
_ “1.0 cm SI x 21.0 cm ML x 7.5 cm AP. A small portion of unremarkable 4th
.d 5th ribs are identified on the upper lobe, measuring 5.0 x 1.4 x 0.7
cm and 7.4 x 1.4 x 0.8 cm. The pleural surfaces of all three lobes are
homogeneously purple and congested, showing diffuse black pigmentation.

Cross sections of the right upper lobe reveal three separate, poorly
defined lesions. The largest measuring 3.0 x 3.0 x 2.3 cm, located within
the ?anterior segment. The cut surface of this lesion is homogeneously
white and firm;. Further sections‘show gross invasion into the bronchus
and adjacent lymph nodes. This tumor is located "1.5 cm from the
bronchial resection margin, and 0.6 cm from the closest pleural surface.
The two smaller lesions are located 2.0 cm beneath the ribs, within the
anterior aspect. Both lesions are homogeneously tan, solid and grossly
appear to have a red hemorrhagic center measuring 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm and
1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. The distance between the two smaller lesions is 0.6
cm. Both lesions are located ”5.0 cm from the bronchial resection margin
and 1.1 cm from the closest pleural surface. The remaining parenchyma of
the right upper lobe is homogeneously dark brown and unremarkable.

CrOSS-sections of the right middle lobe are homogeneously dark brown,
spongy and unremarkable.

Within the superior segment of the right lower lobe, a well—circumscribed
tumor is noted measuring 5.0 x 4.0 x 4.4 cm. The cut surface of the
tumor is homogeneously white and firm; located 5.5 cm from the bronchial
resection margin. Cross sections of the tumor show that it abuts the
pleural surface, causing "pleural puckering“. Further sections reveal
gross invasion into the pleura. Approximately 1.5 cm from the larger
, mor, a smaller calcified nodule is noted (within the base of the right
lower lobe) meaSuring 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The remaining parenchyma of

the right lower lobe is homogeneously dark brown and otherwise
unremarkable.

Multiple lymph nodes are noted throughout the right lung, ranging from
013 to 2.8 cm. Four pieces of tumor and four pieces of normal lung
parenchyma have been taken for tissue banking. The bronchial resection
margin has been removed (en face) and submitted for intraoperative
consultation by.frozen section.
