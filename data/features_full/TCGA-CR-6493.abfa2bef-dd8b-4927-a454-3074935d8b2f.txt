GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1) SOURCE: Right Neck Dissection Levels 2-4

The specimen is received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's
name, medical record number and "right neck dissection level 2-4." The
specimen consists of fibroadipose tissue and lymph nodes measuring in
aggregate 6.5 X 7.0 X 1.7 cm. A thorough lymph node dissection was
performed and multiple candidate lymph nodes were identified. The largest
lymph node appears to be matted to another lymph node and this matted
aggregate measures 4.7 X 1.5 X 2.0 cm. The remaining candidate lymph nodes
range in size from 1.0 cm to 2.2 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes
are bisected and submitted in entirety.

Summary of sections: 1A-1B, largest lymph node bisected, 1/1 each; 1C, 3
candidate lymph nodes, 3/1; 1D, 3 candidate lymph nodes, 3/ 1; IE, 5
candidate lymph nodes, 5/1.

2) SOURCE: Right Tongue

Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and MR name
and "right tongue-stitch anterior". The specimen consists of a
hemiglossectomy specimen measuring 8.9 X 5.0 X 4.8 cm in greatest
dimension. The lateral surface shows eXposed ulcerated tumor measuring 6.1
X 2.9 cm. This section of the tumor abuts the mucosal surface. The surface
of the tongue has two nodular-like lesions present midway moving towards
the posterior surface. These nodules are white and hard with petechial

markings. These two nodules measure 1.2 X 1.0 X 0.3 cm and 0.8 X 0.5 X 0.2
cm. A stitch is present marking the anterior surface of the tongue and was
placed by the surgeon. The medial margin is inked black, the posterior
margin inked blue and the inferior margin is inked orange. The medial
surface shows muscle and no obvious tumor. Both the posterior and the
inferior surface show soft tissue that does not resemble tumor. The tongue
is serially sectioned from anterior to posterior revealing two large hard
white nodules that are hemorrhagic and ulcerated in appearance. These
nodules measure 3.0 X 2.2 cm and 2.0 X 1.9 cm. The second nodule appears to
eXtend down from the two surface nodules that are present on the surface of
the tongue. The mass appears to abut the medial margin. Also present in the
container is a small piece of detached skeletal muscle tissue measuring 3.3
X 1.4 X 1.0 cm. Representative sections of the tumor and tongue specimen
are submitted.

Summary of sections: 2A-2C, mass in relation to posterior margin, 1/1
each; 2D, 2E, mass in relation to inferior margin, 2/ 1, 1/ 1; 2F-2H, mass in
relation to medial margin, 1/1 each; 2I-2K, mass in relation to superior
surface of tongue including surface nodule, 1/1 each; 2L, representative
sections of detached muscle fragment, 3/ 1.

3) SOURCE: Right Neck Level 1

The specimen is received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's

name, medical record number and "right neck level 1." The specimen consists
of fibroadipose tissue and a candidate lymph node measuring in aggregate
6.3 X 5.5 X 1.4 cm. A thorough lymph node dissection is performed revealing
5 candidate lymph nodes, with the largest measuring 1.6 X 1.0 cm. The lymph
nodes are submitted in entirety.

Summary of sections: 3A, 2 candidate lymph nodes, bisected, 4/ 1; 3B, 3
candidate lymph nodes, 3/ 1.

4) SOURCE: Tongue Base Lesion

The specimen is received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's

name, medical record number and "tongue base lesion." The specimen consists
of tissue with a mucosal surface and what appears to be skeletal muscle.

The specimen is unoriented and measures 4.0 X 3.5 X 1.3 cm. The entire
non-mucosal surface is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned.
Summary of sections: 4A-4F, entire base lesion, M/1 each.

5) SOURCE: Teeth

The specimen is received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's
name, medical record number and "teeth for gross only." The specimen
consists of 15 teeth that measure in aggregate 6.8 X 4.5 X 0.5 cm. The
teeth are a range of molars and incisors and canines. A gross photograph
was obtained.
