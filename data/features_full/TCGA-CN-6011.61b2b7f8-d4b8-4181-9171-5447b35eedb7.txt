The specimen (part number) labeled as "teeth" has been subjected to a gross
examination only. If it is desired that this specimen be processed for
additional studies, particularly microscopic examination, it is suggested that
the case pathologist be notified within two weeks of the sign-out date of this
report. This is particularly important as specimens are routinely discarded
after a rescribed eriod of time.

 

material(s) and the ﬁnal diagnosis reﬂects that evaluation.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in 6 parts.

Part 1 is received unﬁxed with the patient's name, initials and "left

neck level 1A". It consists of a 4.0 X 1.7 X 0.3 cm tan yel ow 1brofatty

soft tissue fragment that when sectioned reveal a few possible lymph nodes, up
to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette
1A.

Part 2 is received unﬁxed with the patient's name, initials! and "left

neck level 1B". It consists of a 5.2 X 4.5 X 2.0 cm tan yel ow ﬁbrofatty

soft tissue fragment. Sectioning reveals a few possible tan-brown lymph nodes,
up to 1.8 cm in greatest dimension, and a 4.0 X 2.5 X 1.2 cm salivary gland
which has a tan brown focally hemorrhagic, nodular cut surface. No discrete
lesions are identified.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

2A-B- possible lymph nodes

2C-D- salivary gland

Part 3 is received unﬁxed with the patient's name, initials and "teeth".

It consists of five incisor teeth, one canine tooth, and one mo ar tooth all

with attached root. The teeth show eXtensive cavities with decayed debris with
no attached soft tissue. No sections are submitted; the specimen is a gross
only.

Part 4 is received unﬁxed with the patient's name, initials! and "left

neck levels 2—4". It consists of a 9.5 X 5.0 X 1.5 cm tan ye ow lobulated
fibrofatty soft tissue fragment. It is randomly designated into levels 11,

III, and IV which are serially sectioned for potential lymph nodes.

Level 11 contains a few possible tan-pink lymph nodes, up to 0.7 cm in
greatest dimension. Level 111 contains a few possible tan-brown lymph nodes,
up to in 2.5 cm greatest dimension. Level IV contains a few possible tan-brown
lymph nodes, up to in greatest dimension.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

4A-C- level II, possible lymph nodes

4D- level III, possible lymph nodes

4E- level III possible lymph node, bisected, half submitted

4F-G- level IV, possible lymph nodes

Part 5 is received fresh with the patient's name, initials and "medial
margin". It consists of a 1.9 X 0.4 by less than 0.1 cm agment of tan

yellow to gray white glistening soft tissue with a suture identifying anterior
(inked blue). The specimen is submitted in toto for frozen intraoperative
consult and permanent embedding in cassette 5AFS.

Part 6 is received fresh with the patient's name, initials. and "composite
resection left mandible". It consists of a portion of left mandible (6.5 cm
from superior (ramus) to the angle and 5.0 cm from the angle to the body with
a thickness of 0.3-0.7 cm) and attached mucosal soft tissue (4.0 X 4.0 X 1.8
cm).

The mucosal surface is gray-white and glistening with a 3.0 X 2.5 cm
gray-white to tan-brown nodular mass (0.2 cm from the posterior and medial
margins, 0.4 cm from the lateral margin, and 1.7 cm from the anterior margin).
The mass has a gray white to tan-brown focally hemorrhagic firm cut surface
which grossly appears to abut the underlying bone. The posterior and laryngeal
nerve margins are submitted for frozen intraoperative consult (medial margin
submitted in part 5).

The remaining bone and soft tissue are grossly unremarkable.

Ink Code-

Blue— lateral

Orange- anterior

Black— true soft tissue medial
Digital images are taken.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

6AFS- frozen section, resubmitted, posterior margin

6BFS- frozen section, resubmitted, laryngeal nerve

6C— lateral mucosal margin, shave

6D- anterior mucosal margin, shave

6E— tumor and medial margin

6FDR- anterior bone, margin, shave following decalcification
6GDR— posterior bone, margin, shave following decalciﬁcation
6H-I- random tumor

6JDR- tumor and underl in bone
