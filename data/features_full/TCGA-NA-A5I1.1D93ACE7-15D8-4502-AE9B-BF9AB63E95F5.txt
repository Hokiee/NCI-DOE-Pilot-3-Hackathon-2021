CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm corpus uceri.

GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. "Uterus and bilateral adnexa”, received in formalin is a 600 gm. 14 x 11 x

7.5 cm. specbnet consisting of uterus and bilateral fallopian tubes and
ovaries. Opening of the uterus discloses that approximately 90% of the
endometrial cavity is replaced by numerous exophytic, fleshy, partially
necrotic tumor masses (largest mass 6.5 cm). The tumor masses involve both
the anterior and posterior walls as well as the anterior and posterior lower
uterine segments. The cervix is grossly free of tumor both in both anterior
and posterior aspects. The tumor grossly extends to wi2hin 1 mm of the
serosal surface in the posterior fundus, but the aerosol surface is grossly
free of tumor. Both the right and left ovaries and fallopian tubes are
grossly unremarkable and free of tumor.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Al— anterior cervix

AZ— posterior cervix

A3— anterior lower uterine segment of tumor
Aé— posterior lower uterine segment of tumor

A5—6— full thickness section anterior endomyometrium with tumor
A7-B— posterior endomyometrium full thickness section with tumor
A9~10~ additional sections of tumor

All— left ovary and fallopian tube

A12~ right ovary and fallopian tube

B. "Posterior upper vagina", received in formalin is a 2.8 x l x C.9 cm
fragment of white, soft tissue with a mucosal surface. The soft tissue margin
is inked blue. The specimen is sectioned and submitted entirely in 81—2.

C. "Posterior vaginal margins", received in formalin is a 2.5 x 1.2 x 1 cm
segment of white, soft tissue with a mucosal surface. The soft tissue margin
is inked blue. The specimen is sectioned and submitted entirely in Cl—B.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PRTHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: HYSTEROEALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 6th Edition): pT3 pNx pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
pas: pathology informacion, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. "UTERUS AND BILATERAL ADNEXA":

w

UTERUS: 5C0 GRAMS
ENDOMETRIUH:
TUMOR SITE: DIFFUSE
HISTOLOGIC TYPE: CARCINOSARCOMA.
FIGO GRADE: 3
TUMOR SIZE: APPROXIMATELY 10 X 8 X 2 CM.
MAXIMUM DEPTH OF MYCMETRIAL INVASION: 0.0 CM, IN A 1.0 CM THICK WALL.
LYMPHATIC/VASCULAR INVASION: PRESENT
ADJACENT NON-NEOPLASTIC ENDOMETRIUM: ATROPHIC
REMAINING MYOMETRIUM: NO PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS
CERVIX: NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR [NO SQUAMOUS EPITHELIUM IS IDENTIFIED)
SEE COMMENT.
SEROSA: NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
RIGHT AND LEFT OVARIES: NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
RIGHT AND LEFT FALLOPIAN TUBES: NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

3. "POSTERICR UPPER VAGINA":

MALIGNANT SURFACE GLANDS CONSISTENT WITH CARCINOMATOUS COMPONENT OF
CARCINOSARCCMA, SEE COMMENT.

C. "?OSTERIOR VAGINA HARGINS":
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.

COMMENT: The endometrial lesion is a carcinosarcoma with heterologous elements
(malignant mixed mullerian tumor). The tumor has a well circumscribed, broad
junction with the myometrium, but no definited myometria invasion is seen.
However, tumor is present, at point of closest approach, 4 mm from the serosal
surface of the uterus. ’ has reviewed portions of this case. Part B
is not oriented, so it is possible that the actual margin is negative, but
clinical correlation is needed.

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis<es).
