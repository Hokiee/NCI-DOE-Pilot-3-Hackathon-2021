FINAL DIAGNOSIS

A) Left thyroid lobe and isthmus, resection: Papillary carcinoma of thyroid.
(See synoptic checklist)

B) Left paratracheal tissue, biopsy: Lymph node with metastatic papillary
carcinoma of thyroid.

C) Right paratracheal lymph node, biopsy: Parathyroid tissue present.

D) Left paratracheal lymph node, biopsy: Three lymph nodes with
metastatic papillary carcinoma.

E) Thyroid, right lobe, resection: Lymphocytic thyroiditis.

F) Lymph node, central compartment, biopsies: Four of seven lymph
nodes positive for metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma.

G) Lymph nodes, left lateral jugular, biopsy: Four of eight lymph nodes,
positive for metastatic papillary carcinoma.

GROS S DES CRIPTION

A) Received fresh for frozen section labeled "left thyroid lobe and isthmus" is a lobe
of thyroid weighing 55 grams, and measuring 7.0 x 5.5 x 3.5 cm. The red/tan
capsular surface appears intact. The specimen is inked with black ink, serially
sectioned, and reveals a large dominant nodule which has replaced the majority of
the thyroid, measuring approximately 6.5 cm in greatest dimension. A small amount
of peripheral red/tan normal thyroid is identiﬁed. Representative section of nodule is
submitted for frozen section as A1. Touch preps are made from the specimen.
Additional sections are submitted for permanent section as follows: A2—A9
additional sections of mass with inked capsule, A10 sections of uninvolved thyroid.

B) Received fresh for frozen section labeled "left paratracheal tissue" is an irregular
portion of pink/tan soft tissue weighing 70 mg, and measuring 0.9 cm in greatest
dimension. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section as 31.

C) Received fresh for frozen section labeled "right paratracheal tissue" is an
irregular portion of pink/tan soft tissue measuring 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. The
specimen weighs 30 mg. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section as
C1.

D) In formalin labeled "left paratracheal lymph nodes". The specimen consists of
two ovoid portions of pink/tan soft tissue measuring 0.7 and 1.5 cm. The larger
specimen is bisected and all three pieces are submitted in cassette D1.

E) In formalin labeled "right thyroid lobe". The specimen consists of a portion of
dark purple/red thyroid tissue measuring 4.0 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm, 6.0 grams. The
specimen is inked and serially sectioned revealing dark purple thyroid parenchyma.
No suspicious lesions are identiﬁed. The specimen is submitted entirely in cassettes
E1-E6.

F) In formalin labeled "central compartment lymph nodes". The specimen consists
of an irregular portion of yellow fatty tissue measuring 4.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm. The
specimen is dissected in search of lymph nodes. Multiple lymph nodes are identiﬁed
which range in size from 0.5 up to the largest which measures 1.9 cm. Four smaller
lymph nodes are submitted whole in cassette F1. A single large lymph node is
bisected and submitted in cassette F2. A single lymph node bisected and submitted
in F3, a single lymph node bisected and submitted in cassette F4, a single lymph

 

    

ncdébuééct’éd and submitted m F5.

G) in formalin labeled "left lateral jugular lymph nodes". The specimen consists of
an irregular portion of pink/tan soft tissue measuring 4.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. The
specimen is dissected in search of lymph nodes. Multiple lymph nodes are identiﬁed
ranging in size from 0.3 up to the largest which measures 1.5 cm. Smaller lymph

nodes are submitted whole in cassette G1, the larger lymph node is bisected and
submitted entirely in cassette GZ.
