I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (ANDIOR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED

THIS REPORT.

1). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled ”Part of sixth rib" and
consists of a segment of rib bone measuring 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm. One end is
inked in black, and the other is inked in green. The specimen is bisected
and reveals homogeneous red-tan bony cut surface with no discrete
abnormalities grossly noted. The cortical surface appears intact. The
specimen is bisected and submitted entirely, pending decal.

2). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Level 9 lymph node" and
consists of an anthracotic lymphoid fragment measuring 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm,

which is entirely submitted.

3). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Level 11 intralobar
lymph node" and consists of three anthrecotic lymphoid fragments ranging
from 0.2 to 0.8 cm. which are entirely submitted.

4). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled “Level 5 lymph node” and
consists of a 0.8 cm anthracotic lymphoid fragment, which is entirely
submitted.

5). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Level 12 lymph node‘1 and
consists of three anthracotic lymphoid fragments ranging from 0.4 to 0.9 cm
which are entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U—undesignated

6.) The specimen is received fresh and is labeled, "left upper lobe“. It
consists of a 17 x 10 x 2.5 cm lung lobe with attached bronchus and blood
vessels straddled by multiple staple lines, which weighs 230 grams following
fixation. The specimen is received with an incision. The attached bronchus
measures 0.6 cm in length. The pleural surface is smooth and glistening.
The pleural surface is inked black. Serial sectioning reveals a 1.5 x 1.5 x
1.2 cm white, tan, stellate tumor. The tumor has irregular borders. The
tumor is situated in the peripheral lung parenchyma, located 5 cm from the
bronchial margin and 1.5 cm from the closest staple line. The tumor is
subpleural with a puckered overlying pleural surface. The tumor grossly
does not involve the bronchus. The bronchial mucosa is smooth and
glistening. Peribronchial anthracotic lymph nodes are identified and are
submitted. The uninvolved lung parenchyma shows congestion. Representative
sections are submitted. TPS is submitted and photographs are taken.

Summary of sections:

BM ~~ bronchial margin.

VM -- vascular margin.

SM -- staple margin.

T —— tumor

Rn — random lung parenchyma at least 3 cm away from main tumor

RC - random lung parenchyma close to tumor {within 3 cm of main tumor)

LN ~— lymph nodes
