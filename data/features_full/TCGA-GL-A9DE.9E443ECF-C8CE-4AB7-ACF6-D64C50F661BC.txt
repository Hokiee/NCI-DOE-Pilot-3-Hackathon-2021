performed by the staff pathologist.

Gross Description:

The specimen is received in formalin labeled with the patient name and additionally labeled, "right kidney"
and consists of a kidney received

with abundant perinephric fibroadipose tissue. The kidney has dimension of 11.5

x 7 x 5 cm. The attached ureter has a length of 5 cm and diameter of 0.4 cm. The

specimen is received partially inked and partially incised. Sectioning through .

the specimen reveals a tan-brown, lobulated, fairly well-delineated mass in the

mid portion of the kidney that has dimensions of 4.8 x 3.7 x 3.5 cm. This mass

involves the renal sinus fat, focally abuts the wall at the renal vein and ‘

focally extends to the renal capsule. The mass does not appear to extend beyond
the renal capsule. The mass has a hemorrhagic, degenerative cut surface. A
portion of the mass has been submitted to the Tissue Bank. Adjacent to

the mass is a cortical cyst that is 0.8 cm in greatest dimension that contains
tan-brown ﬂuid. The cyst lining is predominately smooth. There is a tan-white.
well-delineated nodule that is 1.2 cm from the mass that has dimensions of 0.3 x
0.2 x 0.2 cm. The remaining, uninvolved renal parenchyma is pink-tan to
red-brown with a fairly well-delineated corticomedullary junction. The thickness
of the cortex is up to 1.2 cm. The collecting system is lined by pink-tan,

granular mucosa. The capsule strips with some difﬁculty revealing a red-brown
to pink-tan, nodular surface.

The hilar fat is removed and has a weight of 15 g. Sectioning reveals no
deﬁnitive lymph nodes.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:
1 hilar margins en face;
2,3 mass to inked external surface;
4 mass to capsule;
mass to renal sinus fat;
mass to renal sinus fat and wall of renal vein;
mass to uninvolved kidney;
cortical cyst adjacent to mass;
9 well-delineated nodule adjacent to mass;
10 uninvolved renal parenchyma;
11,12 hilar fat for possible lymph node capture.

Please note. multiple gross photographs are taken. Also there is no adrenal
gland present.
