Gross Description: A. "Fat over mass." A 6.5 x 5.5 x 2.0 cm aggregate of unremarkable fatty fragments.
B. "Left kidney ." A 186 gram, 13.5 x 7.5 x 3.1 cm kidney with previously stripped perinephric fat and
capsule. The renal artery, vein and ureter at the margin are unremarkable. A well circumscribed slightly
necrotic 3.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm mass in the lower pole is grossly confined within the kidney. No extension
into the small amount of perinephric fat is identified. The remainder of the kidney to include the renal

pelvis is grossly unremarkable. A separate 6.5 x 4.5 cm aggregate of perinephric fat is received and is
unremarkable.

Focal papillary adenoma (1 mm) away from tumor mass, lmmunostains were previously performed on
the biopsy and consistent with a papillary RCC. Neoplasm has relatively higher Fuhrman nuclear grade
than typical papillary renal cell carcinoma (probably grade 3), however morphology is compatible.
lmmunostains for cytokeratin 7, pancytokeratin, p504S and FAX-8 were performed and all four stains
are positive. This is consistent with a papillary-type renal cell carcinoma.
