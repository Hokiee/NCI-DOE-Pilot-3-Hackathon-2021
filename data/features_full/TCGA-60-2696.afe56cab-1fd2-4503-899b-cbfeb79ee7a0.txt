Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation anddesignated ”left upper lobectomy" is a
resected lobe of lung weighing 903 g and measuring 22 x 14.5 x 2.5 cm. The overlying visceral
pleura is smooth and red. A palpable mass lies subjacent to the bronchial margin. Sectioning
shows a ﬁrm beige centrally friable mass measuring 5.5 x 3.5 X 3 cm approaching the bronchial
margin at distance of 0.2hcm, and 0.5—cm from the pleural surface. No additional lesions or
nodules are grossly appreciated. The remainderof the specimen shows deep red consolidated
lung parenchyma. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement.
