DOB/Age/Sex: Race: Taken: ‘
Location: Received:
Physician(s): Reported:
SPECIMEN:

A: LEFT BREAST LUMPECTOMY B: AXILLARY CONTENTS
C: LEFT SUPRACLAVICULAR LYMPH NODE

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

A. LEFT BREAST, LUMPECTOMY:
RESIDUAL INFILTRATING DUCTAL CARCINOMA, POORLY DIFFERENTIATED
RESIDUAL TUMOR SIZE: 2.5 X 2.0 X 1.5 CM
DEEP SURIGIAL MARGIN INVOLVED BY MAIN TUMOR
MEDIAL, SUPERIOR, AND INFERIOR MARGINS FOCALLY INVOLVED BY
DISCONTINUOUS TUMOR FOCI (LOCAL MICROMETASTASES)
0 EXTENSIVE LYMPHATIC INVOLVEMENT

B. LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS, DISSECTION:
METASTATIC CARCINOMA INVOLVING 18 OF 20 EXAMINED LYMPH NODES
EXTENSIVE EXTRANODAL EXTENSION AND NON-NODAL METASTASES

C. LEFT SUPRACLAVICULAR LYMPH NODE, EXCISON:
-METASTATIC CARCINOMA INVOLVING l EXAMINED LYMPH NODE

COMMENT:
The findings were discussed with by phone

The deep surgical margin is involved by residual gross tumor (Block A24).
The medial, superior, and inferior margins are involved (< 0.6mm) by
microscopic foci, separate from the tumor. (Blocks A5, A10, A11, A23, A39).

Of the 18 involved axillary lymph nodes, 1 has a micrometastasis (B3). An
additional lymph node (822) has isolated tumor cells. These were
identified by routine light microscopy and hematoxylin-eosin stain.

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
Patient: Specimen #: -

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY:
A year old ' female with left breast cancer with a positive margin.
Palpable lymph node.

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left breast cancer.

POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left breast cancer.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. LEFT BREAST LUMPECTOMY Received fresh, labeled with the patient's
name, and designated "LEFT BREAST TISSUE, SKIN INTERIOR, ONE STITCH
MEDIAL, TWO STITCHES SUPERIOR" is a specimen which consists of a piece of
fibrofatty tissue, 6.5 x 6.5 x 5.3cm with an overlying ellipse of skin,
5.0 x 2.0cm. There is a 3.5cm scar on the skin surface. Posteriorly a
small patch of skeletal muscle is noted. The specimen is oriented with
sutures (one — medial; two - superior). Inked as follows: blue —

a superior; green - inferior; yellow — medial, red — lateral, and black —
posterior. Sectioning reveals a 3.0cm biopsy cavity with hemorrhagic
walls and surrounding fat necrosis in the medial half of the specimen.
Medially adjacent to the cavity and involving the deep margin is a firm,
tan tumor measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.5cm. The remaining tissue is fat and
fibrous tissue. Sections of skin, tumor, and grossly normal fibrous
tissue are harvested for the CBCP protocol with matching paraffin sections
as follows: A1, skin, lateral tip; A2, tumor, medial portion; A3, tumor,
lateral aspect; A4, grossly normal fibrous, mid medial - superior, 2.5cm
from the tum; A5-A6, medial margin; A7—A8, adjacent representative
section; A9-A12, biopsy cavity; A13-A17, representative biopsy cavity; A18
— A19, biopsy cavity; A20—A22, biopsy cavity; A23-A25, biopsy cavity;
A26-A28, biopsy cavity; A29-A30, biopsy cavity; A31—A33, adjacent left mid
section; A34, representative section; A35, representative section;
A36-A39, lateral margin. 39CF

B. AXILLARY CONTENTS Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name,
anddesignated "AXILLARY CONTENTS, LEFT TAG AT HIGHEST AXILLARY NODE" is a
specimen which consists of a piece of soft yellow tissue, 14.5 x 6.5 x
3.5cm, containing numerous and large lymph nodes. There are several
cyst-like structures found on serial sectioning ranging in size from 2.5

x 2.0 x 1.0cm to 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0cm. The cyst are filled with a red
viscous fluid. Further sectioning reveals a 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.0cm hemorrhagic

axillary tale; B2, lymph node with tumor, 1.6cm, lower axillary tail; BB,
grossly benign lymph node, 0.7cm, upper axillary tail; B4, grossly
positive single lymph node; B5, single lymph node in multiple pieces;
B6-B7, multiple possible lymph nodes; BB, bisected possible lymph node;
B9, single positive possible lymph node; B10, single possible bisected
lymph node; B11, fragments of possible lymph node; B12, fragments of
possible lymph node; B13-B14, bisected possible lymph node; B15, possible
lymph node; 816, single possible lymph node; B17—B18, skeletal muscle with
cyst wall; Bl9-B22, representative sections of axillary mass; B23-B25,
area of possible lymph nodes. 25CF

C. LEFT SUPRACLAVICULAR LYMPH NODE Received in formalin, labeled with the
patient’s name, and designated "LEFT SUPRACLAVICULAR LYMPH NODE" is a
specimen which consists of a 1.3 x 0.7cm lymph node containing a 0.8cm
tumor. A portion of the lymph node is submitted for the CBCP protocol.
