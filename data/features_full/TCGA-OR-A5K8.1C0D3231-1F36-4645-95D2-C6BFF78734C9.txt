DIAGNOSIS

(A) RIGHT ADRENAL MASS:
ADRENOCORTICAL NEOPLASM OF UNCERTAIN MALIGNANT POTENTIAL (9.0 CM, IN GREATEST DIMENSION).
(SEE COMMENT)
Tumor is conﬁned to the adrenal gland.
Margins of resection, no tumor present.

COMMENT

The tumor focally Invades into the adrenal capsule, but no unequivocal invasion into perladrenal soft tissue is identiﬁed. No
necrosis is present. The tumor cells have mostly eosinophilic cytoplasm. A small nest growth pattern is readily identiﬁed.

There are mitotic ﬁgures, but they are uncommon (7 mitotic ﬁgures/50 high-power ﬁelds). The Kl-67 index is 17.0% (performed by
image analysis).

Per the modified Weiss' criteria, the tumor has a score of 4 (Nuclear atypla: 1, Mitoses: 1, Atypical mitoses: 0, Spongiocytic tumor
cells: 0, Diffuse architecture: 1. VenOus invasion: 0. Sinus invasion: 0, Capsular invasion: 1, Necrosis: 0).

Based on these ﬁndings, the tumor is considered of uncertain malignant potential.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

70 n at
There is a well-circumscribed mass (9.0 cm, in greatest dimension) located at the periphery and involving the adrenal
gland. The mass is tan-pink and ﬂeshy with focal areas of hemorrhage and possible necrosis.
The remainder of the uninvolved adrenal gland (4.0 x 2.5 x 0.4 cm) is unremarkable.
INK CODE: Black - outer surface.
SECTION CODE: A1-A3, tumor with adjacent uninvolved adrenal gland; A4, A5. tumor with inked outer surface; A6,
tumor with area of hemorrhage and inked outer surface; A7-A10. tumor with hemorrhagic areas; A11-A15. tumor with ﬂeshy areas.
