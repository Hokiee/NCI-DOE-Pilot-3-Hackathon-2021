Gross Description:
The specimen is received in eight parts each labeled with the patient name

Part A received in formalin labeled "anterior lymph node," and consists of a

single probable lymph node received with some associated fat that has a greatest
dimension of 1.9 cm. The lymph node is bisected and entirely submitted in
cassette A.

Part B received in formalin labeled "inferior pulmonary ligament lymph node,"
and consists of a portion of irregular, ragged, gray-yellow, lobulated fat that
has dimensions of 3.2 x 2.8 x 0.6 cm. The fat contains six probable lymph nodes
that range from 0.2 to 1.6 cm in greatest dimension. Lymph nodes are entirely
submitted as labeled:

B1 five lymph nodes submitted in toto;

B2 one bisected lymph node.

Part C received in formalin labeled "hilar lymph node," and consists of a single
probable lymph node received with some associated fat that has a greatest
dimension of 1.6 cm. The lymph node is bisected and entirely submitted in
cassette C.

Part D received in formalin labeled "tracheobronchial lymph node," and consists
of five probable lymph nodes that range from 0.3 to 1.6 cm in greatest
dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as labeled:

D1 two lymph nodes submitted in toto;

D2 one lymph node submitted in toto;

D3 one bisected lymph node;

D4 one bisected lymph node.

Part E received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled "left upper lobe,"
and consists of a left upper lung lobe that has a weight of 491 g and dimensions
of 18.2 x 10.6 x 8.5 cm. There is an attached portion of chest wall that is
comprised of a single rib with some associated soft tissue that has dimensions
of 7.8 x 4.2 x 2.6 cm. This chest wall is only loosely attached to this

specimen. The hilar structures are identified with the bronchus opened and the
vessels stapled. There are a few extra parenchymal peribronchial lymph nodes
present. There is a staple line that radiates superiorly from the hilum that

has a length of 8.9 cm. The pleura is gray-purple, smooth and glistening to
shaggy with focal cautery effect where the chest wall is adherent to the lung
lobe. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a red-brown spongy lung
parenchyma that is 75% replaced by a gray-yellow to red-brown, focally granular,
markedly degenerated and roughly spherical mass that has dimensions of 10.2 x
8.4 x 7.2 cm. This mass extends to within 1.8 cm of the bronchial margin. This
mass extends to within 0.2 cm of the inked parenchymal margin. This mass
extends to the pleura at the site of the adherent chest wall. This mass grossly
appears to invade through the pleura and into the chest wall. This mass extends
to within 0.2 cm of the rib and to within 1.2 cm of the anterior chest wall

margin. The lung parenchyma distal to the mass is markedly consolidated. There
are no additional lesions identified. Representative sections have been
submitted for frozen section diagnosis FSE1 and FSE2 with the residue
resubmitted for permanent sections in cassettes E1 and E2 respectively.

Additional representative sections are submitted as labeled:
E3 anterior rib margin en face after decalcification;
E4 posterior rib margin en face after decalcification;
E5 mass to rib and anterior soft tissue margin after decalcification;
E6 vascular margins en face;

E7-11 mass to include inked, stapled parenchymal margin in
cassettes E7-E8 and pleura at the site of adherent chest wall in cassettes E9
and E10;

E12 consolidated lung parenchyma distal to mass;
E13 normal most lung parenchyma;

E14 two lymph nodes submitted in toto;

E15 one bisected lymph node.

Part F received in formalin labeled "subcarinal lymph node," and consists of two
portions of irregular, ragged, gray-yellow, lobulated fat that have dimensions

of 2.2 x 2.0 x 0.8 cm and 2.3 x 2.0 x 0.6 cm. The fat contains eight probable
lymph nodes that range from 0.4 to 1.7 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph
nodes are submitted in toto in cassettes F1 and F2.

Part G received in formalin labeled "AP window," and consists of three probable
lymph nodes that have greatest dimensions of 0.7, 1.3 and 1.4 cm which are
submitted in toto in cassette G.

Part H received in formalin labeled "lower paratracheal," and consists of four
probable lymph nodes received with some associated fat that have greatest
dimensions of 0.4, 0.5, and 1.0 cm which are submitted in toto in cassette H.

Please note: all cassettes are labeled with the case number

Results-Comments
At the request of Dr. , a representative portion of this case was
sent to Molecular Pathology for KRAS mutation analysis. This addendum is

created to report those findings.

Cerner accession number:

Body site: Left lung, left upper lobe

Specimen type: Paraffin embedded tissue
Surgical Pathology Block number: ,

RESULTS: No KRAS mutations were detected (Wild Type KRAS) at codon 12 of the
KRAS gene in the provided specimen. The codon 13 mutations could not be
analyzed.

INTERPRETATION: No KRAS mutations were identified at codon 12 of the KRAS gene
in the provided specimen. The codon 13 mutations could not be analyzed.

METHOD/ASSAY LIMITATIONS: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist before
processing. DNA is isolated and the exon 2 of the KRAS gene is amplified by PCR.
PCR products are subjected to Shifted Termination Assay (STA-TrimGen) technology
to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13. STA products are analyzed by capillary

gel electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. This assay is validated for the
detection of mutations in codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene. Mutations in other
codons of KRAS are not evaluated. False positive or negative results may occur

for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue
sample analyzed. Mutations present in a low percentage of cells may not be
detected. Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and other
laboratory information findings for the most accurate interpretation.
