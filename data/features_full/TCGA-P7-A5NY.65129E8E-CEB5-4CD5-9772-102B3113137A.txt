Gross Description

"A" - Received in formalin labeled "left adrenal pheochromocytoma" is a 37-gram, 6.5 x 5.5 x 3.0 cm
adrenal gland. The specimen is inked blue and serially sectioned revealing a well-circumscribed lobulated
rubbery nodule (4.2 x 3.3 x 2.2 cm) with a heterogeneous gold-yellow cut surface and a slightly
hemorrhagic center. The nodule grossly arises from the adrenal medulla and is <0.1 cm from the nearest
inked margin. No other discrete masses or suspicious are grossly identiﬁed. The nodule occupies
approximately 80% of the adrenal gland volume. The remainder of the adrenal gland has a gold-yellow
cortex and a brown—tan medulla. At the periphery of the adrenal gland within the adipose tissue is a 1.2 x
0.4 x 0.3 cm patent unremarkable possible vessel which is uninvolved by the nodule. Representative
sections are submitted as labeled: "A1" - nodule and possible vessel, "A2"-A " ~ nodule random sections;
"A5" - remote from nodule (ﬁve cassettes).

"B"- Received in formalin labeled' 'right adrenal pheochromocytoma” Is a 457—gram 13 5 x 10 5 x 6. 5 cm
adrenal gland mass with minimal attached yellow lobulated adipose tissue. The mass is inked green and
serially sectioned revealing a cut surface that Is 90% solid and 10% cystic. The solid area is
heterogeneous red- -pink and varies from rubbery to edematous. The cystic component consists of several
smooth-walled unilocular cysts (ranging from 0.5 cm to 4.5 cm) ﬁlled with brown-red thick ﬂuid. the
periphery of the mass contains remnants of adrenal gland cortex and medulla. Additionally identiﬁed
