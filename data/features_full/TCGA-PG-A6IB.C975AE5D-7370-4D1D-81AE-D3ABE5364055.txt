DIAGNOSIS:

1. Uterus, cervix. ovaries and tube, laparoscopic vaginal hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy:

— High grade carcinoma of the endometrium.

- The tumor is poorly differentiated, with some histologic features
suggeetive of serous carcinoma. Tuna: cells show no immunoreactivity for
p53, BR and PR.

— Tumor invades less than one half the thickness of the myometrium.
- Lymphovaacular invasion is easily identified.
- No endocervical involvement seen.

, See synoptic report below for full details.
2. LEFT pelvic lymph nodes, biopsy:
~ sixteen lymph nodes, negative for tumor (0/16).

3. LEFT common lymph node, biopsy:

CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Uterine cancer.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

1. The specimen is received fresh and labeled uterus, cervix. ovaries and
tubes. It consists of a uterusr cervix with attached bilateral ovaries and
fallopian tubes. The specimen weighs 107gram in toto and with following
measurements: 8.5cm from fondue to exocervix; 5.0cm from cornu to cornUI
3.70m from anterior to posterior. The right ovary and fallopian tube
measures 2.2 x 1.0 x 0.7cm and 3.0 x 0.6 x 0.5cm. respectively. The left
ovary and fallopian tube measures 2.4 x 1.2 x 0.7cm and 8.3 x 0.6 x 0.5cm.
respectively. The exocervix is ten white and smooth. as opening, the
andocervical canal measures 2.ch in length and is a 0.6cm across. It has a
tan unremarkable mucosa. The endometrial cavity measures 4.0cm in length
and 3.5cn from cornu to cornu. The endometrium is ten and has a sessile
polyploid tumor on the posterior wall, measuring 3.0 x 2.7 x 1.5cm. The
tumor appears to be invasion of the underlying mucosa to a depth of 0.5cm
of the myometrium. The myometrium measures 1.8cm in maximum thickness.
The tumor is located 1.3cm from the lower uterine segment. Rest of the
endometriun is tan-red, smooth and grossly unremarkable. There is a 1.0 cm
of tan-white. rubbery and well-circumscribed leiomyoma within the
myometrium. The right and left ovaries have a tan white smooth outer
surface with several white corpora albicantia. The both fallopian tubes
have grossly identifiable pinpoint lumen with fimbriated ends.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

A: tumor with deepest invasion
: tumor with deepest invasion

C: tumor with lower segment of the uterine
D: tumor
E: posterior cervix

F; anterior cervix
G: anterior endometrium and myometrium

2. The specimen is received fresh labeled “LEFT pelvic lymph nodes.' It
consists of fragments of tan-yellow and focally hemorrhagic adipose tissue
measuring ix 2 x 1 cm in aggregate. The specimen is submitted entirely as
follows:

A - possible lymph nodes
B-C - remainder of adipose tissue

3. The specimen is received fresh labeled "LEFT common lymph node“ and
consists of a portion of tan-yellow adipose tissue measuring 1 x 0.6 x 0.3
cm. The specimen is submitted entirely in one cassette.

4. The specimen is received fresh labeled "RIGHT pelvic lymph nodes." It
consists of fragments of tan-yellow and focally hemorrhagic adipose tissue
measuring 3.5x 2 x 1 cm in aggregate. Possible intact lymph nodes are
palpated and the specimen is entirely submitted in two cassettes.

5. The specimen is received fresh labeled "RIGHT pars-aortic lymph nodes.“
It consists of fragments of tan-yellow and focally hemorrhagic adipose
tissue measuring 2 x 1.5 x 0.5 cu in aggregate. Possible lymph nodes are
palpated and the specimen is submitted entirely in one cassette.

6. The specimen is received fresh labeled 'LEPT para—aortic lymph nodes”
and consists of 3 fragments of tan-yellow adipose tissue measuring 1.3 x
1.0 x 0.3 cm in aggregate. Possible lymph nodes are palpated and the
specimen is submitted entirely in one cassette.

7. The specimen is received fresh labeled 'omentum‘ and consists of a
portion of tan-yellow to tan-red adipose tissue measuring 4 x 3 x 0.6 cm.
The specimen is submitted entirely as follows:

A — possible lymph nodes
B-C - remainder of fat
