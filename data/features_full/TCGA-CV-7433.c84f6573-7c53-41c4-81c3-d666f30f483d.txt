GROSS DESCRIPTION
(A) LOWER :JUGULAR NODEs, LEFT SIDE — A segment of fatty yellow soft tissue
containing multiple lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 cm to 1.0 cm. All lymph
nodes are submitted in toto.

SECTION CODE: A1, four lymph nodes; A2, one lymph node; A3, thre
nodes, A4, one lymph node; A5, three lymph nodes; A6, one lymph node.
(B) ESOPHAGEAL MARGIN — The specimen consists of a strip of mucosa ( . x 8

x 0.3 cm in greatest dimensions). The specimen is diVid two segments
and submitted entirely for frozen section in Bl and 82.

*Fs/DX: FOCAL MILD DYSPLASIA AND DE GMENTS WITH DYSPLASIA/ATYPIA
(CANNOT GRADE SINCE NOT FULL—THICKNESS).W
(c) SUPERIOR LARYNGEAL NERVE, RIGHT SIDE — A . x 0.2 x 0.2 cm tan fragment,

entirely submitted in C for frozen section.

*FS/DX: NERVE SEGMENT AND ADJACENT SOFT TISSUE, No TUMOR PRESENT.”
(D) SUPERIOR PHARYNGEAL MARGIN — The sgecimen consists of a 1.2 x 0. x .
cm portion of tan mucosa. A second sma ler portion of tan mucosa which is 0.5
x 0.4 X 0.2 cm is also present. NO nodules are masses are identified.
orientation is provided. Entirely submitted for frozen section in D. #

*FS/DX: MUCOSA, SUBMUCOSA, MUSCLE. NO SEVERE DYSPLASIA OR INVASI
CARCINOMA. (CANNOT RULE OUT FOCAL MILD DYSPLASIA-TOO CAUTERIZED TO
EVALUATE).
(E) LARYNGEAL PHARYNGECTOMY AND RIGHT NECK DISSECTION, INCLUDING JUGULAR VEIN
AND RIGHT THYROID LOBE — A product of laryngeal pharyngectomy and right neck
dissection with overall measurements of 10.0 x 9.0 X 5.5 cm. On the right
supraglottic area and involving the right glottic and midline is a large mass
with overall measurements of 6.0 x 6.5 x 2.5 cm. The mass is fungating,
ulcerative, and deeply invading to cartilage and involving the right and
middle supraglottic area, including the right glottic and midline. The
mucosal and deep margin of resections are grossly uninvolved. L mph nodes are
identified on both the right and left aspects of the laryngeal p aryngectomy
specimen. The left lymph nodes correspond to the "middle and inferior" lymph
nodes. The left lymp node dissection consists of a 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm
portion of fibrofatty tissue containing two lymph nodes ranging from 1.5 to
1.4 cm in maximum dimension. The right lymph node dissection is 8.5 x 2.5 x
2.0 cm portion of fibrofatty adipose tissue containing upper, mid, and lower
jugular lymph nodes. Multiple lymph nodes are identified in all levels
ranging from 0.5 to 1.8 cm in maximum dimension.

SECTION CODE: Representative sections of tumor and adjacent mucosa from
ri ht to left Side from E1—E13, mucosal margin circumferentially from right to
le t from E14—E19 and E21; E20, representative section of the left glottic
area; E22, representative section of thyroid; E23 and E24, tracheal margin of
resection. T e left and right neck dissections are submitted as follows: E25,
left lymph_nodes, corresponding to "middle—inferior"; E26, one lymph node,
corresponding to left "middle/inferior” l ph node; E27—E48, rig t neck lymph
nodes submitted as follows: (E27—E3O rig t upper jugular lymph nodes, E31 one
right upper jugular lymph node, E32 one right upper jugular lymph node, E33
one rig t upper ju ular lymph node, E34 one rig t mid jugular lymph node, E35
one right mid jugu ar lymph node, E36—E38 one right mid jugular lymph node,
E39—E45 one right lower jugular lymph node, E46 one right ower jugular lymph
