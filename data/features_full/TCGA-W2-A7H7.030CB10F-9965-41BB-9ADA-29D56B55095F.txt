Clinical Notes:
Ere-op diagnosis: Adrenal mass.

Diagnosis:
A. Adrenal mass, left, resection:
- Pheochromocytoma, see comment.
- Tumor focally extends to inked margin.

COMMENT (A): Sections Show a fairly well circumscribed
lesion that measures 3.2 cm in greatest dimension and is
composed of small nests of cells within a vascular
background. The neoplastic cells exhibit salt—and'pepper
chromatin, with moderate cytologic pleomorphism, and rare
multinucleation. There is no evidence of extra adrenal
infiltration, vascular invasion, increased mitotic activity,
or necrosis. Overall, these features favor a benign
pheochromocytoma, but morphology does not also accurately
predict tumor behavior.

is a 44 gram, 9.0 x 5.3 x 2.2 cm, portion of pink to yellow-
tan soft tissue. The specimen is marked with black ink and
serially sectioned to reveal a 6.0 x 3.7 x 2.4 cm adrenal
gland with a 3.2 x 3.0 x 2.4 cm mass. The mass is soft and
lobular, ranging from pale pink—gray to red—purple. The
mass grossly appears to arise from the medulla, and is
partially surrounded by a thin rim of bright orange adrenal
cortex. Red-gray medulla is present within the adrenal
