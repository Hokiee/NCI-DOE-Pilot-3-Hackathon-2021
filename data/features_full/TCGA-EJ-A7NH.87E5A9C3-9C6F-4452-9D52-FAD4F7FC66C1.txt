FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

PART 1: PROSTATE. LAPAROSCOPIC ROBOTIC ASSISTED PROSTATECTOMY -

. INVASIVE POORLY DIFFERENTIATED PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA. GLEASON SCORE: 3+4=7.
MICROSCOPIC GLEASON PATTERN 5 CARCINOMA IS IDENTIFIED AND CONSTITUTES APPROXIMATELY
2% OF THE TOTAL TUMOR VOLUME.

THE CARCINOMA MEASURES 1.2 CM IN GREATEST MODULAR DIMENSION.

THE CARCINOMA IS MULTIFOCAL, INVOLVES BOTH THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT LOBES OF THE
PROSTATE. AND CONSTITUTES APPROXIMATELY 5—1 0% OF THE TOTAL PROSTATE VOLUME ASSESSED.
THE CARCINOMA IS CONFINED WITHIN THE CAPSULE OF THE PROSTATE.

ALL INKED MARGINS OF RESECTION ARE FREE OF TUMOR.

BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES, NO EVIDENCE OF CARCINOMA SEEN.

PERINEURAL INVASION BY THE CARCINOMA IS IDENTIFIED.

MULTIFOCAL HIGH GRADE PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN) IS SEEN.

TNM STAGE: T20 N0 MX.,

HISTOLOGIC GRADE: GS (POORLY DIFFERENTIATED).
