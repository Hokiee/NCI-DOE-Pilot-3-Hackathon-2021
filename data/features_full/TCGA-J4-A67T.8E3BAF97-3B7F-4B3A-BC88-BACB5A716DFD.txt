Case Clinical Information
PROSTATE CANCER

Gross Description
A. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"tissue over prostate" is a yellow, fibrofatty tissue fragment
measuring 3 x 2 cm. No lymph node is grossly identified. The
specimen is submitted complete in Al—A3.
B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"right extended pelvic lymph node" is a yellow fibrofatty tissue
fragment measuring 7 x 7 x 1 cm. The fat is trimmed and eight
probable lymph nodes are grossly identified. The largest
measures 1 x 0.5 cm and the smallest measures 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The
specimen is submitted complete in 31—32.
C. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"prostate gland seminal vesicle and vas deferens" is a radical
prostatectomy specimen which includes a 47 gram prostate gland
with attached seminal vesicle and vae deferens. The prostate
gland measures 3.5 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm and has a shaggy capsule that
is disrupted at the bladder resection margin and has been
previously inked black on the left and blue on the right. The
right seminal vesicle measures 3 x 1 cm. The right vas measures
5 x 0.6 cm. The left seminal vesicle measures 3.5 x 1.5 cm. The
left vas deferens measures 4.5 x 0.5 cm. The inferior prostate

is sectioned transversely, removed from the rest of the
specimen, and sectioned from anterior to posterior parallel to
the plane of the urethra. The remaining gland is serially
sectioned transversely and shows a firm, focally nodular
parenchyma. The seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia show no
abnormalities. Representative sections submitted as follows:
inferior prostate demonstrating apical margin submitted entirely
anterior to posterior in C1-C6; bladder resection margin C7—C8;
complete section of mid gland anterior C9-C10; posterior
Cll—C12; complete section of upper third of gland, anterior
ClS-C14; posterior C15-C16; remainder of the posterior gland
submitted in Cl7-C24; right seminal vesicle and vas deferens
025; left seminal vesicle and vas deferens C26. Also, there are
two additional cassettes for research, labeled "tumor" and
"normal"

C. The case was reviewed along with

After review, it is concluded that the tumor focally penetrates
through the capsule of the right posterior prostate.

Surrounding the tumor at this site, a single—cell layer of
fibrous tissue is appreciable at the margin. This tumor is best
regarded as being completely excised.

The TNM stage of the tumor is revised as:

TNM stage: pTza, pNO, pr.
