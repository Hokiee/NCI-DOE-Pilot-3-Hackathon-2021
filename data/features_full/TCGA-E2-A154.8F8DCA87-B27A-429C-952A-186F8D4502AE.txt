SPECIMEN(S):

A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 LEFT AXILLA
B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 LEFT AXILLA
C. LEFT BREAST WLE

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 LEFT AXILLA

Received fresh labeled with the patient’s identiﬁcation and "SLN #1, left axilla" is a 2.0 x 1,5 x 0.5 cm possible lymph
node. The tissue is serially sectioned and touch imprints are performed. The specimen is entirely submitted, A1-A2.
B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 LEFT AXILLA

Received fresh labeled with the patient‘s identiﬁcation and "SLN #2, left axilla" is a 1.6 x 1.4 x 0.4 cm possible lymph
node. The tissue is serially sectioned and touch imprints are performed. The specimen is entirely submitted. B1.

0. LEFT BREAST

Received fresh and subsequently placed in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "left breast" is an
oriented (short-superior, long-lateral) 26 gm, 5.8 x 5.1 x 1.8 cm lumpectomy. Ink code (previously inked in OR):
anterior-yellow. posterior-black. medialvgreen, lateral-red. superior-blue, inferior—orange. The specimen is serially
sectioned into seven slices revealing a 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm stellate, gritty white tumor that is closest to the anterior
margin at less than 0.1 cm. Tissue is procured. Also, identiﬁed is a second 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm, ﬁrm tan-white,
suspicious nodule that is closest to the inferior margin at 0.2 cm. The second nodule is at least 0.4 cm inferior to the
tumor. No additional masses are identiﬁed. Representative sections:

01 -C2-slice 7. interior margin, perpendicular

C3-slice 6, tumor-lateral half

C4-slice 6, tumor-medial half

CS-slice 5, tumor to anterior margin

CG-C7-slice 4. tumor to anterior and posterior margins

CS—slice 2, representative posterior and lateral margins

CS—slice 1. superior margin, perpendicular

DIAGNOSIS:

A. LYMPH NODE. SENTINEL #1, LEFT AXILLA, EXCISION:
- ONE LYMPH NODE. NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1).

B. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #2, LEFT AXILLA. EXCISION:
- ONE LYMPH NODE. NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1).

C. BREAST, LEFT. WIDE LOCAL EXCISION:

- INV SIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA. SBR GRADE 2, MEASURING 1.2-CM

B. LYMPH NODES. ADDITIONAL LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS. DISSECTION:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1).

NOTE: Four tumor nodules are grossly identiﬁed. Microscopically 3 of them are invasive ductal carcinoma that have
the same morphology and one is DCIS. The tissues in between these nodules show scattered foci of DCIS.
Therefore. these foci may be interconnected through DCIS. Largest conﬂuent invasive tumor measures 2.5-cm.

Two intramammary lymph nodes are identiﬁed, one is positive for metastatic carcinoma.
