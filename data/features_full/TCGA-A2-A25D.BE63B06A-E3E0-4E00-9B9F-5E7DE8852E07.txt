SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Patient: Specimen #:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued):

Comment: The lymph node metastases seen in parts "B" and "C"
demonstrate multiple foci of extracapsular extension and in most cases
represent near complete replacement of the underlying nodal architecture.
This case received prospective peer review.

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY:
' female with medical diagnosis of breast cancer (invasive
mammary adenocarcinoma, right breast breast; positive right axillary node).

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
None provided.

POST~OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
None provided.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A: Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name

and designated, "Right Outer Breast Lumpectomy" and consists of an
irregular portion of soft tissue oriented with a single suture ~ anterior;
double - lateral; and short - superior. The specimen measures 10.5 cm
superior to inferior; 7.0 cm medial to lateral; and 3.0 cm anterior to
posterior. The specimen is inked as follows: superior = blue; inferior
green; medial = red; lateral = yellow; anterior = orange; and posterior
black. Serial sections reveal a poorly-defined, firm tan-white mass
measuring 3.2 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. The mass approaches the closest margin as
follows: 0.2 cm inferior; 0.5 cm deep and anterior; and 1.0 cm medial.
The remainder of the specimen is composed of lobulated, yellow-tan adipose
tissue admixed with a minimal amount of fibrous tissue and is otherwise
unremarkable. Representative sections are sequentially submitted from
superior to inferior as follows: Al- superior margin; A2-A4— adjacent
normal; A5-A7- mass with deep and anterior margins; A8- mass; A9—A10— mass
with deep margin; A11~A13— mass with deep, anterior and medial margin;
A14—A16— mass with lateral, inferior and anterior margin; A17-A19- mass
with deep and inferior margins.

Matched sections of A4 and A6-A8 are submitted in OCT and Paraffin per

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Patient: Specimen #:
GROSS DESCRIPTION (continued):
CBCP protocol. Time in formalin: 28 hours.

B: Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name

_ and designated, "Highest Right Axillary Lymph Node" and consists
of an irregular fragment of tan~yellow adipose tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.0
x 0.5 cm. Blunt dissection reveals an ovoid fragment of tan, soft tissue
representing possible lymph node measuring 1.5 cm in greatest dimension.
Sectioning of the possible lymph node reveals a tan-white, firm cut
surface. "'

C: Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name

1nd designated, "Right Axillary Lymph Node Dissection" and
consists of an irregular fragment of tan-yellow, lobular adipose tissue
measuring 10.0 x 6.0 x 3.0 cm. The specimen is blunt dissected to reveal
22 roughly ovoid fragments of tan—white, firm tissue representing possible
lymph nodes ranging from 0.4 to 4.3 cm in greatest dimension. Sectioning
of the possible lymph nodes reveals a tan-white, firm cut surface with
focal areas of hemorrhage. Sections are submitted as follows: C1- five
possible lymph nodes; C2- representative sections of four possible lymph
nodes; C3- representative sections of four possible lymph node; C4-
representative sections of three possible lymph nodes; CS- representative
sections of two possible lymph nodes; C6- representative sections of two
possible lymph nodes; C7— representative section of one possible lymph
node; C8- one whole possible lymph node, bisected.
