Lymph node of 3,6x2,5x1,6 cm. The surface is smooth and whitish.

LEFI' INGUINAL LYMPH NODE (BIOPSY)

— DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LIMPHOMA WITH FOCAL PLASMOCELLULAR
DIFFERENCIATION.

The lymph node shows a practically complete substitution of the normal
tissue by a diffuse lymphoid proliferation of large cells, showing occasionally
plasmocellular differentiation.

The immunohistochemical study shows that the neoplastic cells are positive
for CD20, CD79a, CD43 BCL2, BCL6 and MUM1 and negative for CD3, CD5,
CD10, CD23, C021 and p53. The cells show kappa light chain restriction
The Ki67proliferation index is approximately around 60%.

No rearrangement of the BCLZ gene by PCR (MBR MCR) has been
observed 1. ( (D (in:
