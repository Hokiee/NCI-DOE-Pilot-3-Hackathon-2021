SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

lntraoperatlve Diagnosis:
1. Adenocarcinoma. Bronchial margin is negative for tumor

Clinical Diagnosis:
LUNG CA

W

A. Received fresh for frozen section consultation is a specimen labeled "right superior segment" that
consists of a wedge shaped piece of lung parenchyma weighing 58 grams and measuring 8.5 x 4.5 x
2.5 cm with a bronchial stump of 0.8 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. A tan-gray solid nodule with
stellate borders measuring 2 x 2 x 1 cm is present within the lung parenchyma, adjacent and retracting
the overlying pleura and extending within 1.5 cm of the bronchial and 1.7 cm from the nearest
parenchymal margin. The remaining lung parenchyma appears red and soft. No peribronchiai lymph
nodes are present. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1 bronchial shave margin
frozen, A2 — A8 nodule (A2 for frozen section evaluation, A8 with pleura, with parenchymal margin), A9
of unremarkable parenchyma distal to mass, A10 vascular margin.

B. Received fresh on Telfa gauze labeled "R11 stump" is an irregular-shaped segment of red-gray soft
tissue measuring 1.3 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is totally submitted in formalin in one cassette.

0. Received fresh on Teifa gauze labeled "R7" is an irregular-shaped segment of red—gray soft tissue
measuring 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is totally submitted in formalin in one cassette.

D. Received fresh on Telfa gauze labeled "R11 node" is an irregular—shaped segment of red-gray soft
tissue measuring 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is totally submitted in formalin in one cassette.
