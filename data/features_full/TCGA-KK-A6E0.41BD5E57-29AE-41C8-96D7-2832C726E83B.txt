DIAGNOSIS

(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 9 (4 + 5). (SEE COMMENT)
TUMOR EXTENDING FOCALLY INTO EXTRAPROSTATIC TISSUE.
Margins of resection, free of tumor.
Right and left seminal vesicles. no tumor present.
Segments of right and left vasa deferentia. no tumor present.
PERINEURAL INVASION, PRESENT.
No lymphovascular invasion identified.
PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH GRADE.

COMMENT

The prostate gland contains two foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma. Both tumor foci are located in the peripheral zone. The
dominant tumor focus is located in the right anterolateral, right lateral, right posterolateral and right posterior peripheral zone. This
tumor focus measures 2.0 x 1.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in two cross sections and extensively
in the apex and base region. In the right superior neurovascular bundle region. this tumor focus extends into extraprostatic tissue.
The extent of margin of extraprostatic extension is 4.0 mm. The margin of resection is free of tumor.

The second tumor focus is located in the left posterolateral peripheral zone. exclusively in the apical region. This tumor focus
measures 1.0 x 0.2 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in a single apical section. This tumor is conﬁned
to the prostate. All margins of resection are free of tumor.

GROSS: DESCRIPTION

(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES — A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (4.7 x 2.7 x 3.0 cm, 28 grams, post fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the left
posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears slightly more abundant than along the right side. An area of firmness is noted on the

right side of the prostate. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate an area consistent with tumor in the right side of the two
cross sections of the prostate.

The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

Also included in the container are three fragments of tubular structures consistent with vas deferens measuring 2.6 x 0.4 x
0.2 cm, 3.7 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm, 1.2 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm and a fragment of adipose tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm.

SECTION CODE: A1-A4. detached fragments of tissue: A5—A7. right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens
from the base towards the tip; A8-A10. left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; A11,

apex posterior; A28, A29, apex right; A30-A37, sections of the two cross sections of the prostate according to specimen
radiograph.

The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red. right surface in yellow and posterior surface in
black. Blue ink (A29) and orange Ink (A34 and A35) denote surfaces that do not represent the true margin of resection.
