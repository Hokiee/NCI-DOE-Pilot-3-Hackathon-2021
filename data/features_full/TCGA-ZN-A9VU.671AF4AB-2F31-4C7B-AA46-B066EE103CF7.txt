GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh, in ten parts, each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.

Part A, "#1. Left port site #1", consists of a tan/white skin ellipse (4 x 1.5
cm), excised to a depth of 2 cm, with a well—healed linear scar (2 cm in
length). The deep aspect of the specimen contains a firm tan tissue (2 x 1.2 x
1 cm). The outer aspect of the specimen is inked blue. Representative
sections are submitted for histologic evaluation.

Micro Al and A2: 1 frag, RSS.

Part B, "#2. Left sixth rib“, consists of a single portion of tan/pink rib
(13.5 x 1.4 x 0.7 cm). Bone marrow squeeze is performed.

Micro Bl: Bone marrow squeeze, multi frags, RSS.

Part C, "#3. 2R", consists of two fragment of yellow/brown soft tissue (1.6 x
1.0 x 0.8 and 1.2 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm) consistent with lymph nodes. Entire specimen
is submitted for histologic evaluation. Larger node is inked red and bisected
prior to submitting.

Micro C1: 2 lymph nodes, one inked and bisected, 3 frags, ESS.

Part D, "#4. Level 5", consists of a single fragment of tan/anthracotic soft
tissue (0.6 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm), which is entirely submitted for histologic
evaluation.

Micro D1: 1 frag, ESS.

Part E, "#5. Level 9", consists of a single fragment of tan/yellow/anthracotic
soft tissue (1.0 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm) consistent with a lymph node. The specimen is
entirely submitted for histologic evaluation.

Micro El: 1 lymph node, 1 frag, ESS.

Part E, "#6. Level 8", consists of a single fragment of yellow/anthracotic soft

tissue (0.9 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm), which is entirely submitted for histologic
evaluation.

Micro F1: 1 frag, ESS.

Part G, "#7. Level 5 #2", consists of a single fragment of
yellow/brown/anthracotic soft tissue (2.0 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm) grossly consistent
with one lymph node. Entire specimen is submitted for histologic evaluation.

Micro G1: 1 lymph node, bisected, 2 frags, ESS.

Part H, "#8. Level 4L", consists of a single fragment of yellow/brown soft
tissue (1.5 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm) grossly consistent with two lymph nodes (ranging

from 0.2 to 0.9 cm in greatest dimension). Larger lymph node is inked blue and
bisected prior to submitting. Entire specimen is submitted for histologic
evaluation.

Micro H1: 2 lymph nodes, larger inked blue and bisected, and fibroadipose, 3
frags, ESS.

Part I, "#9. Level 10", consists of a single fragment of tan/anthracotic soft
tissue (0.9 x 0.4 X 0.3 cm) consistent with a lymph node. Entire specimen is
submitted for histologic evaluation.

Micro 11: 1 lymph node, 1 frag, ESS.

Part J, labeled "#10. Left pleura and diaphragm", consists of multiple
fragments of tan/pink papillary soft tissue, tan/yellow lobulated fat and
tan/red muscular soft tissue (21 x 18 x 2.8 cm; 430—gram in aggregate) with
extensive firm, tan/white tumor. Representative sections of tan/pink papillary
