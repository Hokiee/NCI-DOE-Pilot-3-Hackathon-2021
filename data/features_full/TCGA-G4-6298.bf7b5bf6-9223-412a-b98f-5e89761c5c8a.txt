GROSS DESCRIPTION:

RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY WITH PARTIAL SEGMENTS 5-6
Received fresh is a segment of cecum with attached terminal ileum, overall measuring 15x14x6.5cm.
Both ends are stapled. The attached terminal ileum is measuring 8cm in length, 3cm in diameter.
Attached to the cecum also identified a small piece of liver segment measuring 3.0x6.0x2.0cm. The
serosa is inked black. Opening of the cecum reveals close to the ileocecal valve, there is a tumor which
measures 6.0x3.0x3.0cm on the mucosa and 4.5cm away from the stapled distal margin on the colon
and less than 1cm away from the ileocecal valve. The surface of the tumor is ulcerated and sectioning
through the tumor reveals the tumor is already penetrating through the muscularis propria reaching into
the serosa, which might caused the adhesion to the liver. The rest of the mucosa in colon and terminal
ileum are unremarkable. The sections are submitted as follows:

A1: shaved margins from distal margin on the colon

A2: shaved margins from terminal ileum

A3-A4: representative sections across the tumor into the adhered liver

A5: representative sections across the tumor into the ileocecal valve

A6—A8: representative section from the deepest invaded tumor
A9: representative sections from grossly unremarkable mucosa in terminal ileum and colon

A10: representative sections from appendix including the base, mid portion and tip

A11 : additional section from the junction of tumor and liver.

A12—A16: 24 presumptive lymph nodes
