GROSS DESCRIPTION

The specimen is received in eight separate containers labelet “mated A

through H.

A

The container is received fresh unﬁxed labeled “lelt breast lump for gross margin". The specimen
consists of a 20 gm. ovoid mass of apparent fatty and ﬁbrous encased tissue which is 4.1 x 3.3 x
2.5 cm. in greatest overall dimension. There is a single short suture indicating anterior margin
inked with yellow dye. posterior/deep margin is inked black. There are two short sutures
Indicating superior margin Inked with orange dye, inferior ls inked red. There is a single long
suture indicating lateral margin inked with blue dye. medial is inked green. Sectioning reveals a
well-circumcised tumor mass which is 2.4 x 2.2 x 2.2 cm. in greatest overall dimension and
consists of a pink-tan ﬁrm with scattered cystic spaces filled with amber-colored ﬂuid. The tumor
mass grossly appears to be 0.3 cm. from the anterior. 0.5 cm. from the posterior/deep. 0.2 cm.
from the superior. 0 4 cm. from the Inferior. 0.6 cm. from the lateral. 0.6 cm. from the medial. The

specimen is submitted In ten blocks.
