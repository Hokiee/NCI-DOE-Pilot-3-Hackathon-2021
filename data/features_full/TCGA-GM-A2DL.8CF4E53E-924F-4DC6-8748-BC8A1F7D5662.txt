MMENT

Immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratlns have been requested on tissue sections from both sentinel lymph nodes. Those
results will be reported as an addendum. Molecular pathologic assays have been requested on tissue sections from block C1 of
the primary tumor. Those results will be reported as an addendum. The invasive carcinoma measures 1.2 cm in greatest
microscopic diameter (slide C1) and focally invades pectoralls muscle, extending to within 5.0 mm of the deep margin (slide 02).

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT AXILLA, SENTINEL LYMPH NODE BIOPSY #1. IN VIVO 216, Ex VIVO 4 - A 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm lymph node. The
specimen is transected and two touch imprints were performed. The remnant of the tissue is submitted in toto in A.
'TP/DX: NO CARCINOMA IDENTIFIED.
(B) LEFT AXILLA SENTINEL BIOPSY #2, IN VIVO 416, EX VIVO 887 - A 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm lymph node with surrounding fat
tissue. Specimen is bisected and two touch imprints are performed. A remnant of the lymph node is submitted in 81-82.
*TP/DX: NO CARCINOMA IDENTIFIED.
(C) LEFI' NEEDLE LOCALIZATION, SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY - A segmental mastectomy specimen (7.0 x 7.0 x 4.0 cm)
with a skin ellipse (2.8 x 1.2 cm). The specimen has two clips indicating anterior aspect and one clip indicating the middle aspect.
e specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral. The cut surface shows an ill-defined, white-firm lesion measuring 0.8 x
(gt-3 x 0.6 cm that is 0.7 cm from the deep margin. The remnant of the breast tissue is predominantly composed of fatty tissue.
INK CODE: Green - inferior; blue - superior; black - deep; yellow - superficial; red - lateral; orange - medial.
SECTION CODE: 01-02, tumor in relation to the deep margin; CS, extra section from the tumor; C4-C5, random section
from the breast including the skin.
) SECOND DEEP MARGIN, CLIP ON TRUE MARGIN - An oriented irregular fragment of skeletal muscle measuring 3.0 x 1.5 x
if“? cm. The specimen is oriented as clip on true margin. The true margin is inked in black. The specimen is serially sectioned and
entirely submitted in 01-02.
(E) SECOND MEDIAL MARGIN, CLIP ON TRUE MARGIN — An oriented irregular fragment of adipose tissue measuring 4.0 x 2.0
x 0.8 cm. The specimen is oriented as clip on true margin. The true margin is inked in black. The specimen Is serially sectioned
and entirely submitted in E1 -E4. ' '

(F) SECOND SUPERIOR MARGIN. CLIP 0N TRUE MARGIN - An oriented irregular fragment of adipose tissue measuring 3.5 x

2.0 x 0.8 cm. The specimen is oriented as clip on true margin. The true margin is inked in black. The specimen is serially
sectioned and entirely submitted in F1.F3.

(G) SECOND INFERIOR MARGIN - An oriented irregular fragment of adipose tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 0.6 cm. The specimen
is oriented as clip on true margin. The true margin is inked in black. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in
G1 ~G3. I '
