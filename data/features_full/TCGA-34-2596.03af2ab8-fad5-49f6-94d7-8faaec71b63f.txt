ADDENDUM

Flexible bronchoscop imediastinoscopy.

Fluorescence in-situ hybridization studies performed on the squamous cell carcinoma show

a ratio of Her2 I Neu to the centromere of c
ampliﬁcation in the targeted region. The re

hromosome 17 of 1.30, indicating low—level
tin of Cyclin-Di gene to the centromere of

chromosome 11 is 1.14, indicating a lack of amplification in the targeted region. The ratio of
EGFR gene to the centromere of chromosome 7 is 1.07, indicating an absenoe of

ampliﬁcation in the targeted region.

Her2 / neu and Cyclin D‘I ampilfication may 191;) in identifying those patients likely to
experience shorter survival when considered together with other major risk factors.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

Part 2 is labeled "left tracheobronchial an

tissue ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 cm. The s

Part 3 is labeled "sublnnominate lymph n
measuring from 0.4 to 0.6 cm. The spec

cassette 3A.

Part 4 is iabeled "left paratracheai lymph

0.5 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted following intraoperative consultation in cassette 4A.

Part 5 is labeled "portion of 6th rib" and consists of a 1.5 cm hemorrhagic rib. Representative sections are
submitted for decalcification in cassette 5A.

Part 6 is labeled "inferior pulmonary ligament lymph node" and consists of a single 1.0 cm anthracotic lymph
node. The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette 6A.

Part 7 is labeled "posterior hilar lymph node“ and consists of a single 0.5 cm anthracotic lymph node. The
specimen is entirely submitted in cassette 7A.

Part 8 is labeled "anterior hilar lymph node" and consists of two anthracotic lymph nodes measuring 1.0 and
1.4 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette 8A.

Part 9 is labeled "subcarinal lymph node" and consists of seven sections of anthracotic tissue ranging in size
from 0.5 to 2.0 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes 9A through QC.

Part to is labeled "left lung" and consists of a native pneumonectomy specimen measuring 24.0 x 13.0 x 3.0
cm and weighing 470 grams. The pleural surface is ten and hemorrhagic and torn in areas around the lower
lobe. The parietal pleura is adherent to the visceral pleura in the upper lobe. The visceral pleura is smooth and
glistening. The hilar bronchus is patent at the margin, but obstructed with a mass located 1.8 cm from the
margin. The hilar vessels are patent. The hilar lymph nodes are enlarged. On cut surface, the parenchyma is
diffusely anthracotic and spongy. A ten tumor measuring 4.3 x 3.7 X 2.0 cm is centrally located involving the
upper and lower lobes and'the main bronchus. The tumor'contains areas of necrosis. The bronchi distal to the
tumor are obstructed and contain mucus. The vessels are patent. Multiple hilar lymph nodes grossly
containing tumor are seen. Digital images are taken. Representative sections are submitted in the following
cassettes:

10A — frozen section of bronchial and vascular resection margins

‘lOB-‘i DC - hilar lymph nodes

tOD-loE — tumor with hilar pleura (inked orange)

10F-106 - tumor and bronchus

10H-1OI - lymph nodes with tumor

10J-10K - tumor with adjacent lung

10L - background lung, upper lobe, with obstruction and cyst

10M-100 - lymph nodes

Part 11 is labeled "AP window lymph node" and consists of a single anthracotic lymph node measuring 2.0 cm.
The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette 11A.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Microscopic examination substantiates the above diagnosis. Mucicarmine, PAS and PAS with diastase are
negative. Elastic stain shows intact visceral pleura.
