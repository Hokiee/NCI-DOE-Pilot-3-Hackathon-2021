Diagnosis:

(1) shows colon mucous membrane with parallel crypts and associated mucosa and
submucosa.

(II) shows a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (colon carcinoma, G2) with
penetration of all parietal layers (pT3), and lymph vessel invasion. There are also lymph
node metastases of the carcinoma described (pN2).

(III) shows free anastomosis rings.

There was no evidence of any residual tumor in preparations 1. and 111., so that the
resection margins were free in relation to this situation.

Preliminary information is being compiled.
