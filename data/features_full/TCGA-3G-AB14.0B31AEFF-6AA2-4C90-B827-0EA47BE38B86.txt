DIAGNOSIS ‘

(A) THYMUS AND MEDIASTINAL FAT: ""

THYMOMA, WITH FOCAL CAPSULAR INVASION (SEE COMMENT")

Margins of resection free of tumor.
COMMENT: *
lmmunohistochemical studies done on tumor sections show positive staining for keratin 5/6 and PAXB in the epithelial cells and
positive staining for 0099 in the lymphoid component of the tumor. The immunohistochemicai pattern supports the above
diagnosis. . .

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) THYMUS AND MEDIASTiNAi. FAT - The specimen consists of one pale pink unoriented thymus (8.5 x 6.0 x 1.2 cm) and
yellow-gray fibroadipose tissue (9.5 x 6.5 x 1.3 cm). . . _

The external surface of the thymus" is pink-red and smooth. The external surface of the thymus inked and serial sectioned.
Two pale gray well-demarcated, firm nodules (1.8 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm, 1.5 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm) are identiﬁed. The cut surface of the noduies
are pale pink and with focal friable possible necrotic area. A 0.1 cm of possible capsule is identiﬁed at the larger nodule of the
specimen. Small portion of tumor and normal tissue is submitted for tumor bank. The nodules are entirely submitted.

T he‘external surface and cut surface of the adipose tissue are unremarkable. he specimen is representatively submitted.

lNK CODE: Blue —- external surface of the thymus. ,_

SECTlON CODE: A-‘l-A3, entirely submitted of the larger nodule with possible capsule; A4, entirely submitted of smaller.
nodule with friable cut surface; A5, representative sectioning of the adipose tissue; A6, representative sectioning of the uninvolved
thymus. . . .
