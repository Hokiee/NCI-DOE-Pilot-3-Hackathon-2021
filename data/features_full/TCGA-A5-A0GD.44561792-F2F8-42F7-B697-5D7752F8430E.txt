COMMENT: Atypical endometrioid mullerianosis, subserosal, and
Halthard rests in the right fallopian tube. Atrophy in the squamous
epithelium of the cervix with focal mild squamous atypia of
undetermined significance as well as chronic cervicitis and
microglandular hyperplasia in the cervix. The endometrial

with a low architectural grade (grade I) but of high nuclear grade
(grade 3 and grade 2 nuclear grade). Focal minimal squamous
differentiation and oxyphilic cellular changes in the endometrial
adenocarcinoma which often invaginates into the superficial
myometrium as irregular nests and islands (pseudoinvasion) and
effaces the endometrial-myometrial junction in multiple areas
extending as large epithelial islands with pushing borders into the
very adjacent myometrium. The exact measurement of the maximum
depth of invasion of the carcinoma cannot be accurately evaluated or

maximum depth of invasion is considered to be very superficial (less
than 20% or 1/4 of the myometrial total thickness, questionable

0.5 to 1 mm maximum depth out of 10 to 15 mm total myometrial
thickness). Focal adenocarcinoma is also present in the

flat endometrium intermixed with the endometrial hyperplasia.

1: UTERUS, FALLOPIAN TUBES AND OVARIES

Labeled “uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries", received fresh in the
Operating Room and subsequently fixed in formalin, is a specimen
consisting of an entire uterus with attached adnexae weighing 66.9
grams. The uterus measures 7.5 cm superior to inferior, 3.5 cm
anterior to posterior, and 3.5 cm cornu to cornu. The cervix
measures 2.5 x 2.0 cm and is covered by white smooth mucosa. Focal
areas of hemorrhage are present. The cervical os measures 0.5 x 0.2

‘cm and is fishmouth shaped in contour. A 2.7 in circumference by
1.0 cm to 0.7 cm in length posterior vaginal cuff is identified as
well as a 2.0 in circumference by 0.1 to 0.2 cm in length of
anterior vaginal cuff is identified. The left lateral vaginal cuff
ranges from 1.5 cm in length and 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm in thickness and
there is no vaginal cuff present in the right side. The vaginal cuff
margin is inked black. The right parametrium measures 2.5 x 1.0 x
1.0 cm and the left 2.5 x 2.0. The serosal surface of the uterus
is tan with no adhesions identified. The right fallopian tube
measures 6.5 x 0.5 cm and is covered by a smooth tan serosa. Cross
sectioning of the tube is unremarkable for any gross lesions and
shows a pinpoint lumen. The right ovary measures 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.7
cm. The external surface of the ovary is tan—yellow and bosselated.
Cross sectioning of the ovary is unremarkable for any gross
lesions. It has variable thickness cortex and solid white fibrous
medulla. The left fallopian tube measures 5.5 x 0.5 cm and is
covered by a smooth tan serosa. Cross sectioning of the tube is
unremarkable for any gross lesions. The left ovary measures 2.5 x
1.5 x 1.0 cm. The external surface is tan-yellow and bosselated.
Cross sectioning is unremarkable for any gross lesions. The cortex
is relatively thin of variable thickness without gross lesions. The
medulla is white and fibrosed. Both fallopian tubes are complete
with fimbriated ends and both adnexae are ligated. The uterus is
opened laterally. In the upper endocervix is a 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm
polyp near the left lateral wall. The endocervix is covered by
corrugated tan mucosa and is unremarkable for any other gross
lesions. An anterior wall mural scar is suspected in the cervix.
The endometrial cavity measures 4.5 x 4.5 cm and is filled
partly by tan polypoid with broad base tumor mostly located in the
left lateral posterior and anterior walls, which measures 4.0 x 3.0
cm in surface. This diffusely polypoid endometrial tumor has a tan
homogeneous cut surface and minimally papillary outer surface. It
occupies 50-60% of the endometrial lining and extends just above the
lower uterine segment and close to the fundus. On sectioning it
seems to infiltrate less than 30% of the myometrium (superficial
invasion). The rest of the endometrium is coarsely granular and
thickened. The maximum thickness of the myometrium measures 1.5 cm.
No gross lesions are identified. Representative sections are
submitted.

lymph nodes ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 cm in diameter are identified.
