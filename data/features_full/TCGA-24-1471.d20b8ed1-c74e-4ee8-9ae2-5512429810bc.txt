Intraoperative Consultation:

An intraoperalive non-microscopic consultation was obtained and interpreted as: “Called to pick up 'uterus, cervix,
bilateral salptngo-oophorectomy, and rectoslgmoid,‘ consisting oi colon. measuring 24 x 5 cm, uterus measuring 8.5 x
4.5 x 4 cm. and detached right adnexa. measuring 4.5 x 4 x 1.5 cm. Soft tissue surfaces are inked blue. The colon is
opened to show unremarkable tan mucosa. The uterus is opened to show a tan-red polypoid lesion, measuring 1 x 1
cm. Posterior to the uterus and anterior to colon is a heterogeneous tan-red-yellow solid mass, measuring 8.5 x 6.5 x

5.5 cm. The mesentery fat shows a mall nant—a earin l m h node, measuring 3 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm. Tumor taken for

Microscopic Description and Comment:
Serosal tumor is present at the margin of the rectosigmoid specimen. As the specimen was not oriented, it cannot be
determined whether this is the proximal or distal margin. The mucosa! surlace is free of malignancy.

Gross Description;
The specimens are received in tour formalln~tiiled containers each labeledm The first container is
labeled "omenlar nodule. FStIX.“ it holds a white cassette that holds a piece 0 ye ow— an r ro atty tissue, measuring

1.5 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm. There is an ill-defined. white density in the central portion of this piece of tissue. Labeled A1 (F81).

The remainder of the contents of the jar are yellow tibroadipose tissue aggregating to 4.5 x 3 x 2.5 cm with a firm,
white-tan, 1.5 x 1.4 x 1 cm nodule attached. Labeled A2 - nodule; A3 - remainder of tissue. Jar 0.

The second container is labeled "uterus, cervix, BSO, rectoslgmold." It holds a previously opened segment oi colon

with en bloc uterus, and sott tissue mass intervening between the tall posterior uterus, and the rectus. The intestine
has been previously opened to show a segment of mucosa that has normally folded tan-brown suriace. The margins

are not oriented. The lumen of the bowel is strictured to an apparent diameter of less than 1 cm at its closest approach
to an underlying 8.5 x 6.5 x 5.5 cm soft tissue mass. At the same location, there is an adjacent satellite nodule,
possibly representing a metastatic lymph node, measuring 2 x 2 x 3 cm. The tumor itself shows variegated yeliow—whlte
extensively necrotic tissue. The soil tissue margins surrounding it have been previously inked. The tumor lies
extensively within 2 mm of the margin. it is densely adherent to the ieit posterior uterine wall. Sections through this
area show a putative necrotic cystic ovarian remnant that measures 2.5 x 2 x 2.5 cm. This structure contains abundant
necrotic friable pink-tan material. The tumor abuts. but does not definitively infiltrate the underlying myometriurn. The
uterus has been previously opened to show a convoluted endometriat cavity. and endocervlcal canal, distorted by
multiple underlying firm, white leiomyomas with solid, whorled cut sections. The largest measures 2 cm in greatest
dimension. The ectocervix is tan-brown to while, smooth, and unremarkable. The serosai surface is unremarkable
except for the left posterior portion, which was adhesed to the aforementioned necrotic tumor. The mesenteric adipose
tissue is dissected to show twelve lymph nodes in addition to the large metastatic lymph node, previously described.
The separately submitted right ovary measures 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm. and has an attached brown—purple ovary, measuring
5.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. Sections of ovary show a firm, chalky white-yellow parenchyma without cyst.
The surface is cerebrilorm. yellow, and without papillary excrescences. The sections of fallopian tube show tan-brown
fallopian tube wall with pinpoint lumen. and no gross tumor. Labeled Bi - colonic margin; B2 and Be . colon with
nearest approach to tumor; 84 to 86 - tumor with nearest soft tissue margin; B7 to B9 - tumor in area oi putative

The third container is labeled "omentum." it holds seven pieces of yellow-brown, iibroiatty tissue, ranging from 2 cm to
it cm In greatest dimension. Sections of omentum show enumerable iirm, white tumor implants, ranging from less
than 1 cm to 2 cm in greatest dimension. Labeled C1 to C4 - multiple omentai metastasis. Jar 3.

The fourth container is labeled ”donuts (lntestinal)." it holds two depot-shaped pieces of tan-brown mucosa. measuring
1.5 x 1 x 1.0 cm, and 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The mucosa in each piece ls invested with numerous metal staples. Labeled Di

SYNOPTIC REPORTING FORM FOR MALIGNANT OVARIAN NEOPLASMﬁ

HISTOPATHOLOGlC TYPE
The histologic diagnosis is serous adenocarclnoma

TUMOR LOCATION
The location of the primary tumor is the left ovary only

HISTOLOGIC GRADE
The histologic grade is poorly differentiated (GS)

TUMOR lNVASlON
Tumor does not invade the adiacent fallopian tubelperitubal sott tissue

TUMOR lNVOLVEMENT
Tumor involvement oi the pelvic peritoneum/soft tissue is present
Metastatic involvement of the omentum is present

PFltMAFtY TUMOR (T)
Based on the above information, the primary tumor is classified as macroscopic peritoneal metastasis beyond pelvis
more than 2 cm in greatest dimension or regional lymph node metastasis (Tao/lilo)

REGIONAL LYMPH NODES (N)

The regional lymph nodes are classified as regional lymph node metastasis (N1)
The total number of regional lymph nodes examined is 12

-Z ; ' ' ;. ‘ SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT , I

Extranodai extension by tumor metastases is absent

DISTANT METASTASIS (M)
The status oi distant tumor site cannot be assessed (MX)

STAGE GROUPING
The Final AJCC/UlCC/FIGO stage is TSC/N‘i/MX

The pathologlc stage assigned here should be regarded as provisional, and may change after integration of clinical
data not provided with this specimen.
