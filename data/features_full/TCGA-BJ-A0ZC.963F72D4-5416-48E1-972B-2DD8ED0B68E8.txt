MOLECULAR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY TESTING:
Block I:

A. Mutations in BHAF, NRAssf, HFtASb‘1, KHAS12/13 NOT identified.

B. FISH test results are negative for BET/FTC rearrangement.
NOTE:

DNA was extracted in the amount sufficient for testing.

BACKGROUND:

Mutations in either BFIAF or HAS genes or RET/PTC rearrangements are feund in more than 70% of papillary thyroid carcinomas
(1). BRAF V600E (Ti 799A) mutation has been associated with more aggressive behavior of papillary carcinoma (2, '3). The
association between BFiAF V600E mutation and features of tumor aggressiveness have also been observed in papillary
microcarcinomas (4). Mutations in the RAS genes or PAX8/PPAHg rearrangement occur in ~70% of follicular thyroid carcinomas

MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS:
For para din-embedded surgical specimens, manual microdissection was performed to collect tu

mor tissue. Specimens with the minimum of 50% of
tumor cells in a microdissection target are accepted for the analysis. Optical density readings were obtained. Rea/dime PCR was performed on the
_ ~_I‘jiplati‘or7n to amplify BRAF codons 599-601, NHAS codon 61, HRAS codon 61, and KHAS oodons 12/13 sequences. Post-PCR melting
cunre analysis was used to detect possible mutations. If required, the mutation type was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the PCR product on
' " _ DNA from samples positive for each of these mutations was used as positive controls. Ampliﬁcation at 35 cycles or earlier was

considered sufﬁcient for the analysis. The limit of detection is approximately 10-20% of alleles with mutation present in the background of normal
DNA.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
TI-Ivnom GLAND, TOTAL THYFIOIDECIOMY (29.5 GHAMS) — .,
A. PAPILLARY MICROCAHCINOMA, FOLLICULAFI VARIANT, 0.4 CM, LEFT LOBE (see comment).

B. NODULAFI THYFIOID (LARGEST NODULE'ES—CNI, SOME OF WHICH SHOW FIBROSIS AND OSSIFICATION).
C. CHRONIC LYMPHOCVTIC THYROIDITIS.

D. NO PARATHYROIDS ARE SEEN.
E. STAGE: pT1 Nx MX.

COMMENT:

We have demonstrated a focus of papillary microcarcinoma , follicular: variant (0.4 cm) in the left lobe of the thyroid. The
margins are free of tumor. No extrathyroidai extension or angiolymphatic invasion is seen

RESULTS:

1i: RET/PTC: The targeted area of the tissue showed 3(5.0%) of the cells with the rearrangement pattern and 57(95.0%) of the
cells with the normal pattern. The targeted area is considered NOT rearranged for the RET/PTC region.

The FlET/PTCi Probe did not contain the rearrangement pattern.

Results

RET/PTC Methodology Description:

Probe: HET/PTC Probe (10q11.2) and RET/PTCi Dual-Color Fusion Probe 10q11.2-10q21

Probe Description: The HET probe (labeled SpectrumGreen) is a 207 kb DNA probe located at band 10q11.2.

The H4 and 369 probes are approximately 100kb each (labeled in SpectrumOrange), and are located at band 10q21.

HET/PTC rearrangement is suggested to be present when three RET signals are identiﬁed in greater than 8% of the analyzed
cells.

FiET/PTC1 rearrangement detection is as follows: Normal cells without the RET/PTC1 rearrangement Show two pair of green and
orange signals separated. Cells with the RET/PTCT rearrangement show two pair of signals (green and orange) in juxtaposition
and one green and one orange signal separated in greater than 8% of analyzed cells within the targeted area.

HETﬂDTC FIQM annlusis was manually performed and quantitatively assessed by analysis of a minimum of 60 cells using the PTC
(369/H4) a and the FIET SpectrumGreen probes.
