RENAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION OF NON—NEOPLASTIC RENAL pARENCHYMA _

DIEFUEE MESANGIAL EXPANSION WITH FOCAL NODUEAR GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS
CONSISTENT WITH EARLY DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY (SEE NOTE).

FOCAL GLOBAL AND SEGMENTAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS, MOST LIKELY SECONDARY T0
FUNCTIONAL AND STRUCTURAL ADAPTATIONS (SEE NOTE).

SEVERE ARTERIAL AND HYALINE ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS (SEE NOTE).

NOTE: ‘
The non—neoplastic renal parenchyma shows changes-consistent with early

diabetic glomerulosclerosis, as well as extensive global glomerulosclerosis and
severe vascular scarring. Prominent vascular sclerosis has traditionally_been
considered part of the structural Changes seen in diabetic patients with kidney
disease, although it is important to note that these lesions are non—specific,
and they can result from a number of etiologies, including the
microangiopathies from inherited or acquired procoagulant states, the healed
phases of hemolytic-uremic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,
angiotoxic drugs, radiation, and other metabolic diseases Therefore, a
primary form of vascular injury superimposed on renal damage from diabetes
mellitus cannot be definitively ruled out.

Segmental or global glomerulosclerosis is frequently the. _consequence of
adapta-tions for hemodynamic Changes and glomerular hypertrophy following loss
of functioning nephrons. Such loss of. nephrons is often the result of an
independent primary glomerular,.tubu1ary interstitial, neoplastic, or vascular
disease.' These patients often show subtotal- visceral epithelial cell foot
process effadement ultrastructurally, and they may be at risk for persistent
sub— nephrotic proteinuria; they do not often manifest hypoalbuminemia or edema.
In this patient, diabetic sclerosis, severe vascular scarring, healed episodes
of interstitial nephritis from antineoplastic or pharmaceutical agents, and the
resected maSS all .may have contributed to nephron loss with subsequent

glomerular obsolescence

A few mesangial areas reveal early nodular expansion. The

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh,
name and unit number.

in two parts, each labeled with the patient?s

Part A, Received fresh in the frozen section lab labeled "#1. Regional lymph
node", and consists of a single fragment of yellow/red soft tissue (2.6 x 0.9 x
0.6 cm) within which two lymph node candidates (0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm and 0.9 x
0.5 x 0.5 cm) are identified. The smaller lymph node candidate is frozen as

FSAl and the larger is frozen as FSA2.

Micro Al: "FSAl" remnant, 1 frag,
Micro AZ: “FSAZ” remnant, 1 frag,
Micro A3: Non frozen tissue, 2 frags

Part B, Received fresh in frozen section lab labeled "#2. Right kidney“, and
consists of a right radical nephrectomy specimen (1121.5 grams; 27.5 x 14 x 6.2
cm), to include right kidney (12.0 x 7.2 x 7.0 cm), renal artery (1.8 cm in
length x 0.5 cm in diameter), renal vein (0.4 cm in length x 0.7 cm in
diameter), ureter (10 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter), abundant
paranephritic fat and Gerota's fascia (13 x 9 x 0.1 cm). An adrenal gland is
not present. Within the mid pole, there is a yellow/red, focally hemorrhagic,
solid partially encapsulated mass (5.? x.s.2 x 4.3 cm), 10.3 cm of the ureteral
margin, 6.5 cm from the renal artery margin, and 2.5 cm of the renal vein
margin. The mass grossly appears to impinge upon but not involve the renal
pelvis or caliceal system and grossly abuts but does not invade the renal
capsule (at the anterior lateral aspect). There is a 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm clear
fluid filled cortical cyst at the anterior/superior aspect of the kidney which

abuts the Gerota's fascia (inked black). There are two additional cystic
structures (1.0 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm and 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm) present in the anterior
aspect of the kidney adjacent to the renal mass which display no excrescences.
The remainder of the parenchyma is red/tan with a well defined cortical
medullary junction. The pelvis and ureter display a tan, glistening lining

INTERPRETATION:

9 of 14 metaphases contained the clonal aberrations that included deletion of
the chromosome 3 short arm (3p). This aberration is a characteristic finding
in renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type.

The abnormal karyotype was seen in metaphases from tumor parts labeled T1 and
