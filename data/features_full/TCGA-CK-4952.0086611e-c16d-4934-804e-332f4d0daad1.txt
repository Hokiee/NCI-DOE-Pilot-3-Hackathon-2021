PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:

A. SPECIMEN DESIGNATED "PERIGASTRIC LYMPH NODES":

Heterotopic pancreas with focal pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia
type 1 (PanINll
No lymph node is present.

B. SPECIMEN DESIGNATED “RIGHT COLON, HEMICOLECTOMY":
MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA, low grade, moderately differentiated
(7.0 Cm in greatest dimension).
The tumor forms a fungating mass and has an infiltrating border.
The tumor invades through the subserosa to the serosal surface.
The proximal, distal, and radial resection margins are negative
for tumor.
Invasive tumor is 152mm from the proximal resection margin, 206mm
from-the distal resection margin, and 21mm from the radial
resection margin.
Lymphovascular invasion is not identified.
Venous invasion is not identified.
Perineural invasion is not identified.
Peritumoral lymphoid response (including Crohn‘s—like infiltrate)
is mild.
Residual adenoma is present.

Regional lymph nodes ' ' ' al): 5:31
AJCC Classification T4 N2 MX.

CLINICAL DATA:
History: None provided.
Operation: Laparoscopic converted to open right hemicolectomy.

Operative Findings: None provided.
Clinical Diagnosis: Colon cancer.

TISSUE SUBMITTED:
All. Perigastric lymph node.
B/2. Right hemicolectomy to F5.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh, in two parts, each labeled with the patient‘s

name and medical record number.

Part A, "#1. Perigastric lymph node”, consists of a red/brown fibroadipose
tissue fragment (2.5 x 1.5 X 1.0 cm) containing a single lymph node. The
specimen is entirely submitted.

Micro Ill—AZ: Lymph node, bisected, 1 frag per cassette, -

Part B, "#2. Right hemicolectomy", consists of a hemicolectomy specimen (37.5 x
?.5 cm), including an appendix (7.0 x 0.5 cm) and the distal ileum (3.0 x 2.0
cm), which includes a stapled resection margin (blue, 2.0 cm) and a distal
stapled resection margin (black, 2.8 cm) . There is a fungating tan/red mass
(7.0 x 4.0 x 2.3 cm), which measures 12.6 cm to the ileocecal valve, 15.2 cm to
the proximal stapled resection margin, 20.6 cm to the distal stapled resection
margin, and 2.1 cm to the radial margin. There is a second tan/yellow polyp

(0.3 cm in diameter), which measures 4.0 cm to the distal stapled resection
margin and 33.0 cm to the proximal stapled resection margin. No other lesmns
are identified. Representative sections of the tumor and normal bowel are

submitted to the tissue bank. TWenty five candidate lymph nodes (largest — 3.2

x 1.9 x 1.6 cm) are identified in the mesentery. Representative sections of
the larger two lymph nodes are submitted. The remaining lymph nodes are
entirely submitted.

By his/'her signature below, the senior physician certifies that he/she

 

personally conducted a microscopic examination ("gross only" exam if so stated)

of the described specimen(s) and rendered or confirmed the diagnosis(es)
related thereto.

ADDENDUM:

Immunostains for MLHl, MSH6, PMSZ, and MSH2 reveal intact nuclear staining in
tumor cells. In a very small percentage of tumors, there is an underlying
hereditary genetic defect despite intact nuclear expression in tumor cells.
Clinical correlation is required.
