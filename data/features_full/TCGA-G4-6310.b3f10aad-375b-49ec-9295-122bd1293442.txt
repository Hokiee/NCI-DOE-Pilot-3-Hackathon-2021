GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. RECTUM, SIGMOID COLON AND ANUS
Received fresh and labeled with the patient’s name "A - rectum, sigmoid colon and anus", is a closed
segment of colon including anus and rectum measuring 32.0 cm in length with the proximal
circumference of 4.6 and distal of 7.1 cm. The serosa is unremarkable. There is a fungating polypoid
mass with serpentine borders measuring 2.3 cm in length with a width of 2.4 cm located 0.5 cm from the
dentate line and 4.9 cm from the anal resection margin. The epicenter of the tumor is 1.8 cm from the
dentate line. It is approximately 24.0 cm from the proximal margin. In the lower portion of the rectum
are additional polyps ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 cm. In the mid portion of the specimen are polyps ranging
from 0.1 to 0.3 and in the proximal region diverticuli are seen. Sections of mass and normal appearing
mucosa are submitted for procurement. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

A1: Proximal margin

A2: Distal margin

A3-A6: Sections of mass and deep margin

A7: Polyps proximal to mass

A8—A9: Polyps from mid portion of specimen to proximal region

A10: Diverticula

A11: Normal appearing mucosa

A12: Proximal, 5 possible lymph nodes

A13: Proximal, 1 bisected lymph node

A14-A17: Distal, 6 possible lymph nodes each

A18-A21 : Distal, 2 bisected lymph nodes each
B. COLON
Received fresh and labeled with the patient’s name "B - colon", is a closed segment of colon including
terminal ileum, cecum, and right colon measuring approximately 60.0 cm in length. The serosa is
unremarkable. There is attached vermiform appendix measuring 8.2 cm in length with a diameter of 0.9
cm. The specimen is opened and the portion of terminal ileum is 6.9 cm in length with an internal
circumference of 3.9 cm. Within the cecum is a firm indurated polypoid lesion with serpentine borders
measuring 5.8 x 5.2 x approximately 0.9 cm in depth. It is located adjacent to the ileocecal valve and
6.5 cm from the proximal margin. It extends through the muscularis propria and areas of necrosis and
hemorrhage are seen. Throughout the colon there are polyps ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 cm. Within the
distal portion of the specimen there are diverticuli. Sections of mass and normal mucosa are procured.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Bf: Proximal margin

B2: Distal margin

B3-BB: Sections of mass

B9: Polyps proximal to mass

Bf 0-B1 1: Polyps distal to mass

B12: Diverticuli

Bf 3: Normal appearing mucosa and appendix

Bf 4-B1 7: proximal, 6 possible lymph nodes each

318: proximal, 1 lymph node

Bf 9-B23: proximal, 2 bisected possible lymph nodes each

B24-B30: distal, 6 possible lymph nodes each

B31-B32: distal, 1 possible lymph node each

The interpretation of the above immunohistochemistry stain or stains is guided by published results in
the medical literature, provided package information from the manufacturer and by internal review of
staining performance and assay validation within the lmmunohistochemistry Laboratory of the. The use
of one or more reagents in the above tests is regulated as an analyte specific reagent (ASR). These
tests were developed and their performance characteristic determined by the Department of Pathology
Laboratory at. They have not been cleared or approved by the US. Food and Drug Administration.
The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.

INTERPRETATION: No abnormalities in mismatch repair protein expression identified.

Expression of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 in the tumor was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.
Peritumoral lymphocytes and normal glands serve as internal positive controls expressing MLH1,
MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2.

Testing for Microsatellite Instability has been ordered. The results will be issued in a separate report.
