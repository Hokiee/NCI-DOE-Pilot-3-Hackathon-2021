Gross Description:

A. Received in formalin labeled “Right breast mass" is a 1050-gram mastectomy specimen (25.0 x 15.5 x 5.6
cm) with a tan-

white skin ellipse (25.4 x 10.0 cm) and nipple (1.8 x 1.6 x 0.4 cm) and two sutures indicating medial and one
suture

indicating superior. There are no visible lesions or scars present. The specimen was previously serially
sectioned with

black ink added on the posterior aspect. There is a hard tan-white. ill-deﬁned centrally located (5.5 x 3.5 x
3.0 cm).

located 3.5 cm from the deep margin and more than 5.0 cm from the remaining margins. The remaining
breast stroma is

markedly fibrotic with cystic areas ﬁlled \M'th a clear fluid measuring up to 0.6 cm in greatest diameter. The
stroma to ‘

adipose ratio is 50:50. Representative sections are submitted in eleven cassettes as follows:

Cassette #1 Deep margin

Cassette #2 Upper outer

Cassette #3 Upper inner

Cassette #4 Lower outer

Cassette #5 Lower inner

Cassettes #6-10 Composite section of mass

Cassette #11 Nipple

B. Received in formalin labeled "Right'breast sentinel node, axilla #1 count 5356” is a segment of adipose
tissue (4.0 x 3.7 x

1.3 cm). Sectioning reveals a possible lymph node measuring 1.6 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The lymph node is
trisected and

submitted in into in two cassettes.
