Diagnosis:

1. : Resected ileocolic material with a moderately differentiated colorectal
adenocarcinoma located in the cecum, measuring a max of 3.8 cm in diameter and
with circumscribed infiltration of the pericecal adipose tissue and with ten regional/
local lymph node metastases. Tumor-free small and large intestine resection
margins. Tumor-free mesenteric resection margin. Evidence of lymphangiosis
carcinomatosa also in the perityphlitic adipose tissue as well as in the tunica
muscularis propria of the appendix. Tumor-free omental adipose tissue.

2. : Resected colon with circumscribed ulcerous mucous membrane defect displaying
a condition following an ablation of a colorectal adenocarcinoma infiltrating the
submucosa. No further sections of the neoplasia diagnosed previously. Tumor-free
lymph nodes in the region. Tumor-free colon resection margins and accompanying
colon wall tourniquet.

Tumor stage relating to 1: pT3, pN2 (10/20) pMX; G2, L1, V0, local R0
Tumor stage relating to 2: pT1, pN0 (0/6) pMX; G2, L0, V0, R0.

Diagnosis:

1. : Resected liver tissue with a bilious hamartoma (so-called Meyenburg complex).

2. : Further tumor-free resected liver with small bile duct cysts and pericystic scarred
area.

3. : Superficial resected liver tissue with scarred capsular area. No signs of
malignancy and in particular no metastasis of a colon carcinoma in the material at
hand.
