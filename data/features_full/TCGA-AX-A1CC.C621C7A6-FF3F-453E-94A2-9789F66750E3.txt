Microscopic Diagnosis:
A) Omental nodule, biopsy:
- Adipose tissue with hemorrhage and focal fat necrosis, no evidence of malignancy

 

B) Uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy:

- Sgousadenggarcinoma (1.5 cm), Grade Ill/[I], invading 1.5 cm into a 1.8 cm thick myometrxum, with lymphovascular invasion, not
involving the cervix (see comment and Microscopic Summary)

- Ovaries: peritoneal inclusion cysts

- Fallopian tubes: paratubal cysts

Comments:

The tumor is composed of admixed glandular and solid areas. Both are strongly and difﬁisely positive for vimentin and p53; there is patchy
staining for p16 in the glandular areas. These results in combination with tumor cell morphology and architectural grth patterns, are
consistent with a diagnosis of serous carcinoma. ER shows 2+ expression in 80% of the glandular cells, but only H- expression in <5% of the

6, syna

cells in the solid-growth areas. CDS ptophysin and chromogranin are negative, excluding the presence of a neuroendocrine component.
Clinical History:

The patient is . female with endometrial cancer. Preop dx: Endometrial cancer.

MACROSCOPIC SUMMARY:

Specimen Type: Hysterectomy

Tumor Site: Not speciﬁed

Tumor Size: Greatest dimension: 1.5 cm

Gross Description:
Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis labeled with patient name and medical record number are two specimens.

Specimen A, designated "omental nodule," is one red-tan soﬁ tissue fragment measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is submitted
entirely for frozen section diagnosis with the remainder of tissue submitted in cassette (FSAl).

Specimen B, designated "utems/cervix/tubes/ovaries" is a 65 g specimen, including an unopened uterus (6.5 x 5.5 x 4 cm), right fallopian tube
(4.5 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter), right ovary (1.8 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm), left fallopian tube (4.6 cm in length, 0.3 cm in diameter), and let!
ovary (1.3 x l x 0.4 cm). The exocervix (2.5 x 2.5 cm) is covered by a smooth glistening white mucosa. The external as is circular and

Received later, in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. are six additional specimens.

Specimen C, designated "right periaortic lymph node," are two pieces of ﬁbrofatty tissue measuring 1.4 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm and 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm.
The specimen is submitted entirely in cassette (C1).

Specimen D, designated "omentum," is a 21 x 19 x 2 cm piece of ﬁbrofatty tissue. The surface is golden yellow and glistening. Cut sections
reveal homogeneous ﬂbrofatty tissue with no masses or lesions. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes (Di-DS).

Specimen E, designated "leﬁ periaortic lymph node #1," is three nodules with maximum dimensions of 0.6, 0.5, and 0.5 cm. The nodules are
submitted entirely in cassette (El).

Specimen F, designated "left periaortic lymph node #2," is a 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm nodule. The specimen is submitted entirely in cassette (F l).

Specimen G, designated "R pelvic lymph node," is two nodules measuring 0.8 x and 0.5 cm in maximum dimension. The specimen is
submitted entirely in cassette (GI).

Specimen H, designated "L common iliac LN," are eight nodules, the largest with a maximum dimension of 0.9 cm. The specimen is
submitted entirely in cassettes (Hi-H3).
