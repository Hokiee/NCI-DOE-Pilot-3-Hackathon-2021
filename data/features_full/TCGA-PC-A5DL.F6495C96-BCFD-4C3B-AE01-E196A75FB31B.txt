Final Diagnosis:
1. Microbiology Specimen
2. Microbiology Specimen

3. Liver, segment 4 (biopsy):

- Von Meyenburg complex (bile duct hamartoma).

4. Retroperitoneal soft tissue (excision):

- Intermediate grade leiomyosarcoma (11 cm) with focal necrosis.
- Inked margins are free of tumor.

5. Appendix (appendectomy):

- Appendix with non-speciﬁc chronic inﬂammation.

Note: Immunohistochemical staining shows the tumor cells are positive for
SMA, vimentin and desmin and negative for HMB45. These results are
supportive of the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma.
