(A) LEFT NECK DISSECTION, MANDIBULECTOMY, FLOOR OF MOUTH ALVEOLECTOMY,
RADICAL RESECTION 0F FACIAL SKIN — A 17.0 x 9.0 x 7.8 cm specimen which
consists of a skin eiiipse, underiyinE soft tissue, and attached portion of
mandibie with associated mucosa and s eietai muscie. The skin e11ipse is 10.0
x 7.0 cm and has a centra11y Tocated iocated raised soft erythematous nodu1e.
The noduie is 2.0 x 1.8 cm. The skin margins are grossiy unremarkabie. The
portion of mandibuiar bone is 6.0 x 3.0 x 1.4 cm and ﬁrOSSTy uninvoTved by
tumor. The overiying mandibuiar mucosa/fioor of mout is pink—tan and
siight1y erythematous. The mucosa is 5.0 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm. Attached to the

mandib1e is ske1eta1 musc1e, sa1ivary g1and, and adipose tissue. The sa1ivary

giand abutts a firm tumor but apﬁears grossiy uninvo ved. _The sa1ivary giand
15 3.0 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. The attac ed 1ymph node dissection 15 11.0 x 3.0 x 1.0
cm. The attached skeietai muscie is 5.0 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm.

A 4.5 x 4.0 x 3.5 cm firm spherica1 mass is present within the centrai
aspect of the skin. The mass extends to abut the outer aspect of the mandibie.
The deep portion of the tumor bed is smooth and has a 0.4 cm skeietaT muscie
margin in the deep anterior and posterior region. The centra] aspect of the
tumor is partia11y necrotic. The tumor appears to be groSSIy away from a11
surgicai margins.

The sa1ivary giand has an unremarkab1e parenchyma. Muitipie 1ymph nodes
are identified. The Targest 1ym h node measures 1.2 cm in greatest dimension.
There are no matted or necrotic ymph nodes present. A representative sampie
of this sampie is submitted for frozen section and a representative sampie of
the remainder of the specimen is submitted for permanent fixation.

(B) ADDITIONAL POSTERIOR MARGIN LONG = NEW MID POSTERIOR MARGIN, SHORT =
LINGUAL MARGIN) — An oriented portion of pink—tan mucosai 1ined tissue which
is 3.0 x 2.6 x 1.2 cm. The Tong suture is piaced at 6 o'ciock and the short
suture is piaced at 3 o'ciock.

The centrai aspect of the mucosai surface is siightiy e1evated and
erythematous. The eievated portion measures 1.0 x 1.0 cm. The deep aspect
consists of smooth skeietai muscie.
