Addendum Discussion: '

The neoplastic cells are diffuselv immunoregctive for 953. suqqestinq a astrocvtic origiLL.
Numerogs MlB-1 reactive cglls are present with a labeling index estimated at 20%.

Although a minor population suggesting oligodendroglioma differentiation was seenl this strong
diffused 953 positivig argues against this and spggests that the apparent perinuclear halos were
simply cells with poor differentiation in a few processes.

Addendum Diagnosis:
Anaplastic Astrocytoma (WHO grade Ill)

Microscopic Description:

1, 2 sections demonstrate a markedly hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely inﬁltrates both
gray and white matter. The majority of the tumor cells have an oligodendroglioma phenotype with
perinuclear halos and fine branching vasculature. However, a signiﬁcant minority of an
astrocytoma phenotype is also seen. Atypica is moderate to focally marked. Numerous mitotic
ﬁgures are seen. Neither microvascular proliferation nor necrosis are present.

3. Sections demonstrate a similar diffuse glial neoplasm. However, here most areas show a less
cellular and inﬁltrating tumor.
