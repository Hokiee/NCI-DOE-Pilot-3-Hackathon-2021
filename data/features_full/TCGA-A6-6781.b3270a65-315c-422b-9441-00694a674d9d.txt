SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

SPECIMEN
A. Subtotal colectomy
B. Appendix

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Carcinoma splenic flexure
POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: Same, hepatic flexure to sigmoid-descending
colon junction.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Received fresh labeled "subtotal colectomy" is a
previously unopened and unoriented 35 cm. segment of colon

surfaced by smooth to slightly scabrous tan-pink serosa with a
copious amount of attached mesocolon and omentum. A palpable area
of induration is noted. The omentum overlying the area is focally
retracted and subsequently inked orange. The pre-serosal surface in
the vicinity of the palpable mass is inked black. The undesignated
margins measure 6.0 and 6.5 cm. in circumference respectively. Upon
opening, there is a circumferential 10.5 x 9.5 cm. focally necrotic
glistening tan—pink tumor mass which is 9 cm. from the larger
circumference margin. On sectioning, the tumor has a maximal
thickness of 2.4 cm. grossly extending through the muscularis to
within 0.15 cm. of the inked pre-serosal surface (block 4) and
adherent omentum (see blocks #2 and 3). A portion of tumor and a
portion of normal mucosa are submitted for tissue procurement as
requested. A pedunculated 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm. tan pink-red polyp is
present within 2 cm. of the margin of the tumor mass (between the
tumor mass and the larger circumference margin). The remaining
mucosa is unremarkable glistening tan—pink with regular folds and
the wall averages 0.7 cm. A single shallow

diverticulum is also identified. Several soft to slightly rubbery
mucoid-appearing tan-white tissues in keeping with lymph nodes
measuring up to 1.3 cm. in greatest dimension are recovered from the
attached mesocolon.

Representative sections are submitted in fifteen (15) blocks as
labeled:‘

BLOCK SUMMARY: #1 - Undesignated margins (smaller circumference
margin inked

blue larger, circumference margin closest to tumor inked green); 2,3
- tumor

to inked indurated omentum; 4 - tumor to inked free radial serosal
surface; 5

- central tumor; 6 - tumor to normal mucosa; 7,8 - bisected polyp

(1/2 per

cassette); 9,10 - random from remainder of specimen; 11 — eight (8)
whole

lymph nodes; 12,13 — seven (7) whole lymph nodes per cassette; 14 -
six (6)

whole lymph nodes; 15 - one (1) bisected lymph node. -

B. Received in formalin labeled "appendix" is a 5.0 x 0.7
cm. gross
unremarkable appendix. The specimen is sectioned to show an intact

wall.

discrete gross lesions are identified. Representative sections of
the

specimen are submitted in one cassette with the proximal end inked
blue.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Histologic type: Mucinous adenocarcinoma.
Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated.
Primary tumor (pT): Tumor invades completely through the wall of
the colon into the omental fat (pT4b).
Proximal margin: Negative.
Distal margin: Negative.
Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative.
Vascular invasion: Negative.
Regional lymph nodes (pN): 2 of 30 mesenteric lymph nodes contain
metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma (pN1b).
Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: Absent.
Distant metastasis (pM): pr
Other findings: Adenomatous polyp. Appendix with appendiceal lymph
node without significant histopatholgic findings.

DIAGNOSIS
A. Colon, subtotal colectomy:
Invasive moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma
extending through the wall of the colon into the omental fat.

Proximal, distal and radial margins of resection are free of

tumor.

Two of 30 mesenteric lymph nodes contain metastatic mucinous
adenocarcinoma (2/30).

Adenomatous polyp.

B. Appendix, appendectomy:
No significant histopathologic findings.
Periappendiceal lymph node without significant pathologic
findings.
