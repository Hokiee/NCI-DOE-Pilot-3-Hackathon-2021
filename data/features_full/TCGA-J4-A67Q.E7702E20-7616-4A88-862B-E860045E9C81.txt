Case Clinical Information
PROSTATE CANCER

Gross Description

A. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"tissue over prostate“ are yellow fibrofatty tissue fragments
measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm. No lymph nodes or areas of
induration are grossly identified. The specimen is submitted
complete in Al—Az.

B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"prostate gland seminal vesicle, vas deferens" is a radical
prostatectomy specimen which includes a 38 gram prostate gland
with attached seminal vesicle and vas deferens. The prostate
gland measures 4.0 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm and has a shaggy capsule that
is disrupted.at the bladder resection margin and has been
previously inked black on the left and blue on the right. The
right seminal vesicle measures 2.0 x 1.0 cm. The right vas
measures 3.0 x 0.5 cm. The left seminal vesicle measures 3.0 x
1.5 cm. The left vas measures 4.0 x 0.5 cm. The inferior
prostate is sectioned transversely, removed from the rest of the
specimen and sectioned from anterior to posterior following the
plane of the urethra. The remaining gland is serially sectioned
transversely and shows a firm, focally nodular parenchyme. The
seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia show no abnormalities.
Representative sections submitted as follows: inferior prostate
demonstrating apical margin submitted entirely anterior to
posterior in Bl~86 ; bladder resection margin submitted in
BV—Be; complete section of mid gland anterior 39—310; posterior
Bil-B12; complete section of upper third of gland, anterior
313-314; posterior BIS—BIG; remainder of the posterior gland
entirely submitted in 817-322; right seminal vesicle and vas
deferens B23; left seminal vesicle and vas deferens 324. Also
there are two research blocks which are submitted.
