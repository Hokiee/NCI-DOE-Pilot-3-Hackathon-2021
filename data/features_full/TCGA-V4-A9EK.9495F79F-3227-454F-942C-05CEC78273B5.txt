Date of surgery :
Left eye enucleation

The eyeball measures 25 mm in diameter with a segment of optic nerve of 6 mm. At the
section, there is at the postero-lateral part of the eyeball a large pigmented tumor adherent to
the internal face of the sclera, measuring 18 mm main line by 12 mm maximum thickness.

Samples have been made for cryopreservation . The specimen has been then included entirely
after ﬁxation.

Microscopy

The tumor seen laterally at the posterior part of the eye correspond microscopically to a tumor
proliferation of fusiform cells made of medium to large size cells with cytoplasm nearly
always loaded with melanin pigment preventing the visualization of the nucleus which is
therefore difﬁcult to analyze. This tumor proliferation is adherent to the internal part of the
sclera whose internal layers are inﬁltrated without any extraocular inﬁltration. In the front, the
tumor inﬁltrates the posterior part of the ciliary body but stays outside the iris, the irido
corneal angle and the anterior chamber. Behind, it stays distant from the intraocular
emergence of the optic nerve which is free on its entire course ( prelaminar part, optic
foramen, post laminar part , meningeal sheaths and posterior cut end.)

Conclusion
Melanoma with fusiform cells measuring 18 by12 mm main lines.

The tumor inﬁltrates in front the posterior part of the ciliary body.Behind, the proliferation
stays distant from the intraocular emergence of the optic nerve which is free on its entire

course ( prelaminar part, optic foramen, post laminar part , meningeal sheaths and posterior
cut end.)

The tumor proliferation inﬁltrates the internal layers of the sclera but no extra sclera extension
was found.
