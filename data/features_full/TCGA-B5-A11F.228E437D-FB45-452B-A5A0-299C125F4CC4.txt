CLINICAL HISTORY:
55 year old woman with a stage I endometrial carcinoma.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Uterus". A uterus measuring 9.5 x 4.0 cm and bilateral 2 cm fragments of
fallopian tubes. The uterus is grossly distorted by multiple leiomyoma
ranging from 1 to 3 cm in diameter. The uterus is opened anteriorly in the
midline revealing an exophytic mass measuring 5 x 3 x 1 cm with numerous
papillary projections into the endometrial cavity, involving anterior and
posterior endometrium and extending very close if not into the upper portion
of the endocervical canal. The endocervical canal measures 3 cm in length.
The myometrium is 1.5 cm thick. Grossly, the endometrial tumor appears to
involve the superficial myometrium. The resection margin is inked in black
and multiple representative sections are taken.

BLOCK SUMMARY:
Al remnants of Ail, consisting of a 2 x l x 0.3 cm soft tan tissue and

multiple 2- -3 mm fragments.
A2 remnant of Af2 consisting of tan _soft tissue fragments measuring 1 x 0. 5 x

0.2 cm.

[“A3 anterior endocervical canal, and the left fallopian tube.

A4 posterior endocervical canal, and right fallopian tube.
A5 anterior corpus and endocervix.

A6 anterior corpus including a leiomyoma.

A7 posterior corpus.

A8 posterior corpus and endocervical canal.

A9 1 cm leiomyoma.

B. "Left tube and ovary". A 5 cm segment of fallopian tube, an ovary
measuring 3 x 1.5 x 0.1 cm, and a cyst measuring 25x 1.5 x 1 cm that is
attached to the inferior portion of the ovary. The fallopian tube is 0.5 cm
in diameter and appears unremarkable. The ovary is yellow—tan with lobulated
surface. No focal lesions are present. The cyst attached to the ovary is
unilocular, contains a small_amount of serous fluid. The wall is thin and
translucent. ’

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Bl remnant of Bfl consisting of two 5 mm fragment of irregular dark red
tissue. Submitted in toto.

B2 representative section of the ovary and fallopian tube.

B3 ovary.and cystic lesion.

C. "Right tube and ovary". An ovary measuring 3 x l x 0.7 cm and a 3 cm
segment of fallopian tube. Representative sections of the fallopian tube and
ovary submitted in Block Cl. '

D. "Right pelvic node". Two irregular shaped fibroadipose tissue fragments
measuring 3 x 2 x 0.5 and 4 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm. Sections reveal possible 5-6
lymph node candidates. submitted in Blocks D1 and D2.

E. "Left pelvic lymph node". Multiple fragments of fatty soft tissue and
lymph node candidates, the largest measuring 4 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. Cut section is

tan and maroon. Reiresentative sections are submitted in Block El.

Af2: Leiomyoma
Bfl: "Left tube and ovary": Reactive mesothelium

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

Sections of the uterus show a neoplasm composed of irregular glands in a
cribriform pattern, with a prominent desmoplastic stromal reaction. The tumor
for the most part is limited to the endometrium, with only a few foci which
are suspicious for very superficial myometrial invasion (1 mm or less).
Sections of the upper endocervical canal show that the carcinoma approaches to
immediately adjacent to the endocervix, but no actual invasion of endocervix

identified microscopically.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. "UTERUS, CERVIX," (HYSTERECTOMY):

1. E DOMETRIOID ADENOCARCINOMA, FIGO GRADE‘E/s.

2. DEPTH or INVASION? SUREREICIALLY INVASIVE AT MOST (LESS THAN 1 MM OF
MYOMETRIAL INVASION).

3. MYOMETRIUM THICKNESS: 1.5 CM.

4. CERVICAL INVOLVEMENT: ABSENT.

5. VASCULAR INVASION:. ABSENT.

6. MULTIPLE LEIOMYOMATA.

7. ALL SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR.

B. "LEFT TUBE AND OVARY":

EALLOPIAN TUBE AND OVARY WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS. NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
C. "RIGHT TUBE AND OVARY":

FALLOPIAN TUBE AND OVARY WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS. NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCX.
D. "RIGHT PELVIC NODE": .

TEN LYMPH NODES, NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY (0/10).
E. "LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES":

THREE LYMPH NODES, NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY (073).
