Microscopic

Sections demonstrate a moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm which diffusely
infiltrates both gray and white matter. The majority of the tumor cells
demonstrate either perinuclear halos or gemistocytic cytoplasm. The minority
component with possible fibrollary astrocytic phenotype is also seen. Nearl all
tumor cells lack overt processes and have round nuclei with mild to moderate
atypia. Mitotic figures are not seen. There is no micovascular proliferation or
necrosis.

Addendum

Scattered MlB-1 reactive cells are present throughout the tumor. A labeling
index of 4.4% is calculated.

Diagnosis

Consistent with low grade oligodendroglioma
