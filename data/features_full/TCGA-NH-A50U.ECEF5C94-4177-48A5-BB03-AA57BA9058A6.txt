COMMENTtS)

The large mass involving the cecum is an invasive adenocarcinoma with areas of mucinous
differentiation noted. While most of the tumor is low grade, there are microscopic foci
where the tumor is of a higher histologic grade. The tumor extends into the proximal
appendix as well as involves the subserosa of the distal ileum. The patient's carcinoma
will be further evaluated for KRAS mutation and mismatch repair defect (by IHC).
Additional reports will follow,

GROSS DESCRIPTION :

A. Received fresh for frozen section. labeled with the patient‘s name and "liver biopsy"
are several core biopsies of pale, tan and red tissue which range from 0.2 to 1 cm in
diameter to 0.1 cm each, submitted in block A for frozen section evaluation.

B. Received fresh for tissue banking labeled with the patient's name and ”right colon“ is
a 15 cm segment of large bowel. The bowel includes cecum and a 7.5 cm appendix consistent
with a right colon. There is a 13 cm segment of distal ileum. The bowel has a palpable.
9.0 x 7.0 x 5.0 cm mass associated with the cecum. The distal ileum is focally adhesed to
the mass. The bowel is opened to have an edematous mucosa. There is a focal area of
identifiable fungating tumor at the appendiceal os. Visible tumor is 1.5 cm and is deep
within the cecum. The tumor comes to within 11.0 cm of the distal margin and is
approximately 1.5 cm from the ileocecal valve. There is a sessile 0.3 cm polyp within the
ascending colon. The polyp is 7.5 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning oi the tumor
shows it to bulge beneath the small bowel. The tumor focally involves the wall of the
small bowel and possibly to the mucosa. The tumor tracks up the base of the appendix. and
there is a large. feted 3.0 cm abscess cavity in the adipose adjacent to the mass and
cecum. The tumor appears to involve the cecal serosa. The radial mesenteric fat margin
averages 1.0 cm. The adipose in the region of the cecum and ileocecal valve have centrally
necrotic. tumor—replaced. matted lymph nodes. Representative sections are sampled as
labeled:

B1 — proximal margin

BZ — distal margin

83 — sections of appendix to include tip

B4 — ileocecal valve

85,36 — sections of mesenteric fat margin

B7 ~ sections of possible polypoid lesions adjacent to ileocecal valve and
