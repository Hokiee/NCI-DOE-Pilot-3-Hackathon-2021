- PATH REPORT

Microscopic

Sections demonstrate a moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm. The tumor is
composed of generally moderately atypical fibrillary astrocytes. In addition, many
bizarre, multinucleated cells are seen. Neither microvascular proliferation nor
tumor necrosis is present. Only a rare mitotic figure is seen. Which is
unexpected given the degree of atypia. Nevertheless, the cytologic features are
unequivocally anaplastic. No eosinophilic granular bodies or Rosenthal fibers
are seen. There is no microcystic degeneration.

Addendum

Scattered MlB-1 cells are seen throughout the tumor. In the areas of highest
proliferative activity, a labeling index of 6.5% is calculated. This is indicative of a
moderately proliferative neoplasm that is consistent with the anaplastic cytologic
features.
