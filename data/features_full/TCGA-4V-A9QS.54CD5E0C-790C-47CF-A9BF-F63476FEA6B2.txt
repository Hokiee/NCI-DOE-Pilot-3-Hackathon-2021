Nature of sampling : thymectomy
Macroscopic examination :

1 . thymectomy :

Thymectomy specimen weighs 75 g fresh and addressed oriented . It measures 10
cm x 7.5 cm x 4 cm . it is bordered by a strip of lung parenchyma measuring 5

x 1.5 cm and a tab pericardium at the posterior surface measuring 6 x

4 cm . The limits of resection are marked with green ink .

When cut, the presence of a whitish nodule, ill—deﬁned, non-encapsulated

macroscopically, and invading the pulmonary parenchyma and the pericardium and
the adjacent adipose tissue.

This nodule measuring 7 cm x 4 cm x 4 cm.
2 . Left pleural nodule 0.8 x 1 cm, whitish cut.

3 . implant of the left pleura :

Five biopsy fragments of 0.7 to 3 cm of seat whitish nodules of 0.5 to 1.5 cm
diameter .

4 . Diaphragmatic implant :
The tongue of the diaphragm measuring 5 x 3 cm . It is home to three nodules
individual measuring 0.6 to 2 cm in major axis , although limited , in the cutting whitish

5 . Mediastinal fat : Two fragments respectively measuring 4 x 2.5 cm and 6.5 x 4.5
cm . No invidualisable nodule on storied samples taken .

Histopathological examination :

1 . Thymectomy (1A -1E )

When cut, the tumor is lobulated , separated by septa . Tumor cells are
large , polygonal , with large nuclei , prominent nucleolus. They

are arranged in bays or fences around the vascular structures and septa .

Lymphocyte quota is relatively abundant disseminated without lymphoid follicle
individualized .

Few areas of peripheral medullary differentiation. Absence of Hassall's corpuscle .
The tumor is poorly defined and invades the mediastinal fat.

The limits of surgical resection are in healthy tissue.

- The adjacent parenchyma thymic nodule ( 1F ) comprises a thymus involution
fat persistently rare lobulated structures.

Immunohistochemical examination :

- Epithelial Cells :

Expression of cytokeratin KL1 , 5/6 and 19 .

Lack of expression of cytokeratin 20 , the CD5 and CDZO . few homes EMA +
- T Lymphocyte phenotype , immature : CD5 + , CDla + , CD99 + .

2 . Left pleural nodule :
Pleural nodule consists exclusively by type 32 thymoma .

3 . Implant at the left pleura :

All nodules examined show the same histological appearance identical . Thymoma
32 .

4 . Diaphragmatic implant: The diaphragm is the seat of a nodule matching
Histologically BZ thymoma described above.

5 . Mediastinal fat : lobule of adipose tissue without lymph node structure
and l or normal or thymic tumor parenchyma .

Conclusion:

Thymoma subtype 32 7 cm.
