Gross Description:

1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section
diagnosis, labeled "Right ureter". It consists of a tan,
rubbery, tubular fragment measuring 0.3 cm in diameter. The
entire specimen is submitted for frozen section diagnosis in one
cassette.

Summary of sections:

FSC - frozen section control
2) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section
diagnosis, labeled "Left ureter". It consists of portion of

tubular shaped tissue measuring 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm. The entire
specimen is submitted for frozen section diagnosis in one
cassette.

Summary of sections:

FSC - frozen section control
3) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled
"Bladder, Prostate and Seminal Vesicles". It consists of a

fragment of tissue measuring 19 x 12 x 2.5 cm. The prostate and
bladder are easily recognizable. The prostate is separated from
the bladder and submitted as whole mount sections. Upon opening,
the bladder cavity is partly ulcerated, partly edematous,
especially on the anterior wall. There is a papillary lesion
located at the superior part,Q§_§h§waQ§erior wall, close to the
dome. The ulcerated area comes close to the bladder neck, where
the prostate begins. Some tissue is saved for TPS and pictures
are taken. The specimen is sampled in a total of fourteen
cassettes.

The specimen also consists of a radical prostatectomy specimen
which includes prostate, seminal vesicles, and portions of right
and left vasa deferentia. The specimen weighs 35 grams. The

prostate measures 2.3 cm from apex to base, 4.5 cm transversely
and 4.2 cm from anterior to posterior. The right seminal vesicle
measures 3 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm and the left seminal vesicle measures
3.1 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm. The external surface of the prostate is
smooth. The prostate is serially sectioned from apex to base at
approximately 3 mm intervals. 100% of the prostatic tissue is
submitted.

Summary of Sections:

LUM - left ureteral margin

RUM - right ureteral margin

LUO - left ureteral orifice

RUO - right ureteral orifice

DOME - lesion near the dome

T — tumor area on anterior bladder wall

BNEF — bladder neck en face

PW — posterior wall

4) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Right Vas
Deferens". It consists of a tubular structure measuring 4.5 cm

in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. Representative sections are
submitted in one block.

Summary of Sections:
U — undesignated

5) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left Vas
Deferens". It consists of a tubular structure measuring 5 cm in
length and 0.3 cm in diameter. Representative sections are
submitted in one block.

Summary of Sections:
U - undesignated

6) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Right Pelvic
Lymph Nodes". It consists of an aggregate of fibrofatty soft
tissue measuring 6 x 4.5 x 3 cm approximately. Possible lymph
nodes are submitted in four cassettes.

Summary of Sections:
U - undesignated

7) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Right Common
Iliac Lymph Nodes". It consists of a fragment of fibrofatty soft
tissue measuring 2 x l x 1 cm. The specimen is entirely
submitted in one cassette.

Summary of Sections:
U - undesignated

Possible lymph nodes are submitted in four cassettes.

Summary of Sections:

U — undesignated

9) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left Common
Iliac Lymph Nodes". It consists of a fragment of fibrofatty soft
tissue measuring 1.5 x l x 1 cm. The specimen is bisected and
