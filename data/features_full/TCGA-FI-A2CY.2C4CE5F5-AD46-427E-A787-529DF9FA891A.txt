Most of the tumor is exophylic. The tumor cells in the hysterectomy lorrn glands and some solid arena. The tumor cells

have a high nuclearlcytopiesmic ratio and nuclear hyperchromesia. lmmunosteins show that the tumor cells are
diffusely positive for me (some areas with patchy) and 953 (some areas weak). ER is weekly and dlﬂusely expressed
in tumors and PR is only locally expressed in tumor colts. This tmmunoproﬁle is consistent with mixed serous and
endornetn‘oid carcinoma. Some tumor cells have hybrid lealures. We re-reviewed this patients previous material

Gross Descriptim;

The specimens are received in nine fonnatin-frtlod containers. each labeled with the patient‘s name
The ﬁrst container to labeled ”abdominal scof and contains two fragments of skin measuring 3.3 x 5.0 and

3—5 x1.5 cm. Each trauma-oration a linear scar running along its length. Serial sectioning reveals ﬁrm fibrollc tissue
in the region of the scar. No grossly identiﬁable lesions are seen. Representative sections from each of these
fragments are submitted. Labeled A1 and A2. Jar 1.

The second container is labeled 'ulenrs. cervix. and bilateral tubes and ovaries.“ it contains a uterus with attached
cervix and bilateral attached ednexaa weighing 133 grams. The uterine corpus measures 8.5 cm from top to bottom.
55 cm from cornu to comu, and 4.0 cm anterior-posterior. Multiple nodular masses are seen in subseroaal location.
The ectocervix is grossly unremarkable. tan-pink and shows small petechial hemorrhages. The as is probe patent. The
specimen is bivalved to reveal an exophytic lesion in the anterior endometrlal cavity. This lesion measures 2.5 x 1.0
cm. Sectioning reveals the extent of this lesion to be superﬁcial and conﬁned to the endometrtum. A wall thickness is
difficult to delerrnine as it is distorted by the presence of multiple myomas. the largest of which measures 4.0 x 3.5 x
3.5 cm. The right ovary measures 1.3 cm in greatest dimension and is unremarkable. atrophic. The right tallopian tube
Is pinned out like a string and has an average diameter of 0.3 cm and a length 0140 cm. The tell fallopian tube is
similarly pinned out like a string and has an average diameter of 0.2 cm except in the radon oi the ﬁmbria where its
appearance ls more unremarkable. The left ovary measures 1.2 cm in greatest dimension and is grossly atrophic and
unremarkable. Labeled B1 - anterior cervix: 32 ~ posterior cervix: 83 to B7 - exophytic lesion from the anterior
endomyometn‘um; 88 - posterior myomelrium (single full thickness section pleaded); 89 to 812 - remainder of
endometriei lining; 813 - right ovary and tube: 314 - left ovary and tube. Jar 2.

The third container is labeled 'lell extemel iliec lymph node' and contains a fragment of ﬁbroedipose tissue measuring
3.0 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm. This fragment is dissected to reveal multiple tan nodularitles which are sampled as putative lymph

nodes. Labeled C1 ~ single node serially sectioned; C2 ~ putative lymph nodes. Jar 1.

The tourth container is labeled “left obturatcr lymph node" and contains a fragment of llbroletly tissue measuring 4 .0 x
1.5 x 1.0 cm. Two probable lymph nodes matted together are discarded out from this fragment and are round to
measure 1A and 1.6 cm in greatest dimension. respectively. Labeled D1 - node 1 serially sectioned; 02 ~ node 2
serially sectioned; 03 - remainder of specimen. Jar 0.

The fifth container is labeled 'right extemel lliac lymph node“ and contains a fragment of ﬁbrcadipose tissue measuring

6.0 x 4 .0 x 0.8 cm. A single nodular fragment of tan-pink soft tissue measuring 0.7 cm in greatest dimension is
retrieved from this ﬁbrofetty fragment and is sampled as a putative lymph node. Labeled E1. Jar 1.

The sixth container is labeled 'right obturalnr lymph node" and contains a single fragment of librotatty tissue measuring
3.0 x 3.0 x 0.7 cm. The specimen is dissected to reveal multiple nodular fragments of ten-pink soft tissue ranging in
size from 0.6 cm to 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. Putative lymph nodes are sampled. Labeled F1 - single node serially

sectioned; F2 - multiple putative lymph nodes. Jar t.
The seventh container is labeled ‘rlght perieortic lymph node“ and contains a fragment oi I'Ibroadlpose tissue

measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm. A single nodulu fragment of tan-pink soft tissue measuring 1.8 x 0.3 x 0.5 cm is
retrieved from the specimen and sampled as a putative lymph node. Labeled G1 - single node serially sectioned. Jar 0.

The eighth container is labeled ”left pedeortic lymph node' and contains a ﬁbrofatty fragment of tan-pink soft tissue
measuring 3.0 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm. This fragment is bisected to reveal solid ten-pink cut surfaces. Entirely submitted.

labeled H1-H2. Jar 0.

The nlnlh container is labeled ‘omentum' and contains a single sheet-litre fragment of ﬁbrofatty tissue measuring 30 x
12 x 2.5 cm. Specimen is serially sectioned to reveal unremarkable yellow adipose tissue on all cut surfaces. Labeled

it to l5. Jar 2.
