CLINICAL INFORMATION:

Pre— Op Dx: Bladder cancer

Post-0p Dx: Same

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "R. distal ureter
F/S". It consists of a portion of ureter measuring 0.2 cm in length by 0.3 cm in
diameter. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in cassette AFS.

B: The specimen is received fresh from the 0.R. and labeled "Left distal ureter
F/S". It consists of a portion of ureter with attached fat measuring 0.3 cm in

length by 0.4 cm in diameter. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen
section in cassette BFS.

C: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Bladder/prostate".

It consists of a cystoprostatectomy specimen measuring 19 x 14.5 x 5 cm. Attached
is a peritoneal segment measuring 18.5 x 14.5 x 0.1 cm. The peritoneum is smooth
and glistening. The prostate measures 5 x 4.5 x 3 cm with attached right seminal
vesicle which measures 2.5 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm and the left seminal vesicle measures 2.1
x 1. 2 x 0.5 cm. Also contiguous is a right distal ureter which measures 6 cm in
length and 0.6 cm in circumference, and the left ureter measures 6.5 cm in length
and o. 5 cm in circumference. The bladder measures a x 7 x 4 cm. Opening the
bladder along the anterior wall reveals a 7.5 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm grayswhite tumor mass
which coaupiss the anterior wall and the right lateral wall, that comes within 1 cm
from the right ureterovesical junction. The tumor grossly involves the bladder
wall and comes to within 0.2 cm from the inked serosal margin. The uninvolved
bladder wall measures 0. 4 cm in thickness. The urethra measures 3 cm in length and
O. 9 cm in circumference with normal— —appearing mucosa. The outer surface of the
prostate is inked black with superimposed red on the right side. Sectioning of the
prostate reveals multiple pink- tan soft nodules up to O 4 cm in greatest diameter.
Sectioning of the perivesical fat reveals a 2 x 1 cm firm area on the perivesical
fat. At the request of the surgeon, an intraoperative gross consultation was

performed in order to aid in the care of this patient. Representative sections
are submitted in 39 cassettes.

D: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "R. para caval lymph nodes".
It consists of a 6 x 4 x 1 cm fatty tissue fragment. Sectioning reveals one lymph

node which measures 1.5 cm in greatest diameter. Totally embedded in three
cassettes.

E: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "R. common iliac L. nodes“.
It consists of a 3 x 3 x 2 cm matted lymph nodes with surrounding fat. Totally

4 x 3 x 2 cm gray-tan soft tissue fragment. Bisected and totally embedded in one
cassette.

G: The specimen is received formalin and labeled "Presacral L. nodes“. It

consists of a 6 x 4 x 0.5 cm fibromembranous fragment with fat. Totally embedded
in four cassettes.

H: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "R. external iliac L. nodes".

It consists of a 3 x 2 x 2 cm fibromembranoue tissue fragment and fat. Totally
embedded in four cassettes.

.1}: The spssines is Isssivsé is.ﬁ9ssalin.and labeled "3- nqu 9f clpquet"- It

consists of a 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm lymph node. The lymph node is bisected and
totally embedded in one cassette..

J: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled “R. obturator/hypogastric L.

nodes“. It consists of a 6 x 5 x 2 cm fibromembranous tissue fragment and fat.
Totally embedded in six cassettes.

K: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "L. para aortic L. nodes". It

consists of a 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm fatty tissue fragment. Totally embedded in one
cassette.

L: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "L. common iliac L. nodes".
It consists of three lymph nodes ranging from 0.4 up to 0.5 cm in greatest
diameter. The lymph nodes are totally submitted in three cassettes.

M: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled “L. node of cloquet". It

consists of a l x l x 0.5 cm fat. The specimen is totally submitted in one
cassette.

N: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled “L. external iliac L. node".

It consists of a 2 x 1 x 1 cm fatty tissue fragment. Totally embedded in one
cassette.

0: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled “L. obturator/hypogastric L.
nodes". It consists of a 4 x'3 x 0.5 cm fatty tissue fragment. Sectioning
reveals multiple lymph nodes. Totally embedded in four cassettes.

P: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "r. presciatic L. node". It
consists of a 1 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm aggregate of fat. Totally embedded in two cassettes.

Q: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "L. presciatic L. nodes". It
consists of a 1 x 1 x 0.5 on aggregate of fat. Totally embedded in two cassettes.

R: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "R. proximal ureter (margin)".

It consists of a 1 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter portion of ureter with
stapled end. The stapled end is inked black. The specimen is trisected and
totally submitted in one cassette.

5: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "L. proximal ureter (margin)".
It consists of a 1.2 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter portion of ureter. The
specimen is serially sectioned and totally submitted in one cassette.
