SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Copy To:
Clinical Histornyiagnosis: ? Renal Cell CA vs. TCC. Left Renal Mass.

Source of Specimen(s):

A: Left kidney, para aortic lymph nodes and left adrenal gland
B: Additional para aortic lymph nodes

C: Left common iliac lymph nodes

Gross Description:
Received in three parts.

Source of Tissue: 1. Labeled #1, left kidney, para aortic lymph nodes,
left adrenal gland

Frozen Section Diagnosis: lFS— ONCOCYTOMA PER.

Gross Description: Received fresh is a left kidney with attached
perinephric fat weighing 580 grams with an overall measurement of 20 x 13
x 9 cm. In the superior aspect of the perinephric fat is the adrenal

gland measuring 3 x 2.5 x 1.3 cm and it is grossly normal appearing. No
lymph nodes are found in the attached fat. At the hilum, there is a 10.5

X 0.5 cm segment of ureter which is opened and is normal appearing. The
vascular margins are free of any lesions or masses. The specimen is
bivalved and the kidney itself measures 12.5 x 7.5 x 4.7 cm. In the lower
pole of the kidney there is a large round tumor measuring 6.5 x 5.0 x 4.0
cm. The lesion pushes on the capsule and grossly approaches the inferior
and middle. However, no gross invasion is found. Representative sections
of the tumor are submitted for frozen section consultation in IFS. The
second lesion is found in the mid lateral aspect of the kidney and

measures 1.4 X 1.4 x 1.2 cm and is orangishrbrown in color and soft. This
lesion is 2 cm from the above mentioned mass. Further sectioning through
the superior pole discloses an ill~defined circumscribed potential lesion
that measures 0.8 x 0.8 cm and may represent a third tumor. The superior
pole lesion is 5.6 cm from the inferior pole mass.

Designation of Sections: lAr ureter margin, 1B“ vascular margin, 10
adrenal gland, lD— large mass in relationship to hilum, 113— large mass in
relationship to normal appearing parenchyma, 1F~ tumor in relationship to
capsule and fat, lG—lH— smaller tumor in middle of kidney, llHlJ— smaller
potential lesion superior left kidney, lKhlL uninvolved kidney, lM—IN—

perinephric fat

Summary of Sections: lA—lN

 

Tissue is procured for cytogenetic studies.

Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled #2, additional para aortic lymph nodes

Gross Description: Received fresh are five fatty lymph nodes measuring
from 1 up to 3 cm.

bisected node.

Source of Tissue: 3. Labeled #3, left common iliac lymph nodes

Gross Description: Received fresh are three yellow to red firm lymph nodes
measuring respectively l x 0.8 x 0.8, 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.8 and 1.4 x 0.9 x 0.9
cm. Submitted as is in 3A.

Final Diagnosis:

1. Left kidney, adrenal gland and para aortic lymph nodes; radical
nephrectomy:

— Three tumors confined to the kidney.

— Two oncocytomas located at the lower pole (6.5 cm) and upper pole (0.8
cm).

- One chromophobe renal cell carcinoma located in the middle portion (1.4
cm).

— Ureteral and vascular resection margins and one lymph node are all
negative for tumor (0/ 1). H

» Adrenal gland is negative for tumor, see note.

2. Additional para aortic lymph nodes:
- No tumor seen in all ten lymph nodes (0! 10).

3. Left common iliac lymph nodes:
— No tumor seen in all four lymph nodes (0/4).

Note: On immunohistochemical stains the oncocytoma tumor cells are
positive for CD10 (cytoplasrnic) and E~cadherin (variable and weak
membranous staining) and are negative for vimentin and cytokeratin CK7.
The chromophobe renal cell carcinoma tumor cells are positive for
cytokeratin CK? and E—cadherin (strong membranous), and are negative for

 

vimentin and CD10. This case was presented at our intradepartmental
conference on- with agreement in diagnosis. See cytogenetics
report.

CYTOGENETIC ANALYSIS REPORTS

KARYOTYPE: '
Abnormal mosaic. karyotype: 44,X,~Y,u1,+7,—14,+20,—21 [8}!46,XY[12]

RESULTS:

The renal mass was sent to a commercial laboratory for cytogenetic
analysis.

The chromosomes from the cells of nine— and ten—day adherent cultures were
counted and analyzed, and two of these metaphases were karyotyped by G—
banding. Eight cells had a modal chromosome number of 44 and were
characterized by the loss of chrdmosomes Y, 1, 14, and 21 and gain of
chromosomes 7 and 20. Twelve cells had a modal chromosome number of
46 and appeared to have a normal karyotype. Cytogenetic abnormalities
involving the numerical loss of chromosomes Y and I, often without
additional changes, have been reported in renal oncocytomas.
