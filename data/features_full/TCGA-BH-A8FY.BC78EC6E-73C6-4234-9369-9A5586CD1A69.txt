COMMENT:
There Is a microscopic focus of Iobular carcinoma In eitu with 1.0 mm o1 Invasive carcinoma In section 1A (section of the
nipple). Thie focus is highlighted by Immunoeteln. e-ceclterln and p120, (see Microecopic Deecrlptlon).

Sentinel lymph node #2 show- rare keratin positive cells . Lymph node #1 (Part 3), In almost completely replaced by let.

Estrogen I progesterone receptor: and HER-zineu done In the previous core biopsy_ are reported
as follows: ER positive, PR positive. HER-Zineu negative, score 1+ 111.1) 0 _
