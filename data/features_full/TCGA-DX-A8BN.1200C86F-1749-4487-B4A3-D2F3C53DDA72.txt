SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

 

clinical Diagnosis 5 History:

with large deep soft tissue mass medial thigh. needle biopsy
consistent with sarcoma.

Specimens Submitted:

1: Proximal margin left thigh (fs)

2: Proximal margin # 2 left thigh (is)
3: Left thigh mess

DIAGNOSIS:

1. Soft tissue, proximal margin left thigh: excision:
- Skeletal muscle with atrophy and chronic inflammation.
— No tumor seen.

2. Soft tissue, proximal margin # 2 left thigh; excision:
— Skeletal muscle with atrophy and chronic inflammation.
- No tumor seen.

3. Soft tissue, left thigh; resection:
- High grade Pleomorphic sarcoma (MPH), involving skeletal muscle.
— The tumor measures 10.9 cm in greatest dimension.
- Resection margins are free of tumor.
- Closest margin is the medial margin with a clearance of < 1 mm.

Note: Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumor cells are positive for
vimentin and CD34, while negative for A31:A33, SKA, desmin, CD117, CDKA,
MDM2. and 5100. There is patchy positivity for BCLZ. Based on the morphology
and the immunoprofile, the findings are consistent with a high grade
pleomorphic sarcoma

Some of the immunohistochemistry and Isa tests were developed and their
performance characteristics were determined by the

They have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is
not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not
be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified
under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA ' 83) as
qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDBS (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

,-. Report Electronically Signed Out **'

Gross Description:

1. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled,
"Proximal margin left thigh (fs)'and consists of a fragment of soft pink-
tan tissue (0.5x 0.3x 0.2 cm). The specimen is entirely frozen and submitted
in one cassette.

Summary of sections:

Psc- frozen section control

2. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation. labeled.
"Proximal margin # 2 left thigh (fs)' and consists of a fragment of soft
white—pink tissue (0.7x 0.3x 0.2 cm). The specimen is entirely frozen and
submitted in one cassette.

Summary of sections:

PSC- frozen section control

3. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "left thigh mass, black
stitch-proximal, white stitch-deep right periosteum, green stitch-medial".
It consists of a soft tissue mass measuring 11.5 x 6 x 5 cm. There is
attached skeletal muscle along the deep aspect measuring 9 x 5 cm. The
margins are inked as follows: - proximal green, distal yellow, deep blue,
medial black, lateral orange/black. The specimen is serially sectioned
revealing a round, well circumscribed, white fleshy mass measuring 10.9 x
6.1 x 4.0 cm. There is approximately 10% necrosis. The tumor is 0.5 cm from
the proximal margin, 2.9 cm from the distal margin, 0.1 from the medial
margin, and 0.7 cm from the deep margin. TPS is submitted. Photographs are
taken. Representative sections are submitted.

Summary of sections:

PM proximal margin

DH distal margin

MN medial margin

Lu lateral margin

D deep margin

AM anterior margin

T tumor

T9-additional tumor to lateral margin
T10-additional tumor to medial margin
Til—additional tumor to lateral margin
