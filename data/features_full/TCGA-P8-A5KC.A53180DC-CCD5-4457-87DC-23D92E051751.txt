FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

ADRENAL GLAND, LEFT, MASS. ADRENALECTOMY (168 GRAMS)-
PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA. 7 CM, 139 GRAMS.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received fresh labeled with the patient’s name, ", and “left adrenal mass.” The specimen (168 g. 9.5 x 8.6
x 4.5 cm) consists of a left adrenal gland and attached yellow, tabulated adipose tissue. Upon sectioning of the adrenal gland, an
encapsulated. rubbery. homogenously red-brown mass with focal ﬁbrosis (139 g, 7 x 5.5 x 4.3 cm) is seen arising from the
medulla. The uninvolved adrenal gland appears mildly compressed (5 x 3.5 x 0.5 cm at its widest dimension) with a normal
appearing golden~yellow cortex (0.1 cm). inner band of red zone reticularis (<0.1 cm), and innermost core of gray medulla (0.1 cm).
Digital images are taken. Tissue from the tumor and uninvolved adrenal gland is procured for clinical tissue banking.
