MICROSCOPY

Sections show a partially pigmented choroidal melanoma
consisting predominantly of spindle cells. Tumour cells
express Melan—A and HSP 27 (score 2). There are
approximately 7 mitotic figures in 40 high power fields.
Closed loops are focally present. The lymphocytic infiltrate
within the tumour is minimal. Scattered macrophages are
present. Tumour necrosis is not seen. Bruch's membrane

appears breached in the sections examined. There is no
tumour extension through optic nerve or vortex veins
examined. Tumour, however, infiltrates through the sclera
emerging on scleral surface and loosely attached episcleral
tissue. Therefore completeness of excision may not be

guaranteed.

Elsewhere, the comes shows no significant abnormality. The
anterior chamber angles are open and the anterior chamber is

deep. The iris shows no significant abnormality but the .
ciliary body appears atrophic with hyalinisation of ciliary

processes. The lens shows glassy appearance. Retina

overlying the tumour is slightly atrophic.

DIAGNOSIS

Left eye, enucleation: choroidal melanoma of predominantly
spindle cell type with extrascleral infiltration.
