Microsco . lo Descri otion:

CASE SHOWN AT m

All three specimens contain similar adenocarcmoma, which is all viable, poorly differentiated
and has a predominant solid sheet—like pattern.

In the ovary, there are slit—like spaces and some bizarre giant cells indicating serous
differentiation. The tumour is extracapsuiar, and present within the adherent ovarian
ligaments.

in the omentum, the tumour is destructive, with the largest single area (formed of contiguous
modules of tumour) being 16 millimetres across, but nowhere quite reaching a single solid
mass greater than two centimetres across. Lymphatic but no vascular invasion is present

here.

 

 

In the nodule from the peritoneal surface of the abdominal wall, the tumour is all viable and
measures it millimetres across, surrounded by fibrotic tissue within which no definite muscle

is identifiable.
