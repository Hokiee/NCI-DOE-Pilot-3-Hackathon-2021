Macroscopy: Q43 )0/4// 3
Cerebral cortex segment weighing 36 grams and measuring 5. 2 x 4. 5 x 3. 5 cm. One of

its sides is coated by lightly congested menige. The other side shows up bloody,
brownish with hemorrhagic areas.

Microscopy:

The histological sections showed neuroepithelial and multinodular malignant neoplasm,
composed of rounded and monomorphic nuclei cells, with granular chromatin and with
mild hyperchromasia. The cytoplasm is scanty, observing, sometimes, clear perinuclear
halos. We also observed some large and eosinophilic cytoplasm cells with
minigemistocistic pattern (GFOC). The tumor is infiltrating, undermining the white matter
and adjacent neocortex. which are seen outbreaks of neuronal sattelitosis. Are seen
some secondary Scherer structures and extent of the neoplasm to the adjacent
subarachnoid and the Virchow Robin spaces. Are also seen foci of necrosis and
dystrophic calcification. The mitotic figures are easily found. Calls attention the
presence of dystrophic calcification in the media of some arteries of medium caliber.

Diagnosis:
Biopsy product of the left temporal lesion: anaplastic oligodendroglioma, WHO grade II
(9451/3).

Award of 1p/19q deletion analysis:
The hybridizations were performed on 5 micrometers thick sections of formalin-fixed
and parafﬁn-embedded neoplastic tissue (FFPE) in the most representative tumor area

with 1p36/1q25 and 19q13/19p13 probe. 100 to 200 were evaluated in each
slide cores.

In this case: The ratio of signals from 1p/1q probes was 1.02. The ratio of signals from
19q/19p probes was 0.92. Conclusion: Anaplastic oligodendroglioma, WHO grade III,
with no 1p/19q deletion.
