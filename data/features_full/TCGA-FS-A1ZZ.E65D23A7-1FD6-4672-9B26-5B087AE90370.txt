The H&E stained slide at hand shows an epitheloid malignant tumor with sparse amount of
connective tissue. The tumor constitute approx. 95 percent of the tissue. The tumor cells
show round to oval nuclei with granular chromatine. There is a high nucleo/cytopiasmatic
ratio. The mitotic count is 1 mitoses per square millimetre. The tumor cells have a middle
sized cytoplasm. The tumor shows a sheet like growth pattern. Lymphocytic infiltrates
compound approx. 5 percent of the tissue cells.
