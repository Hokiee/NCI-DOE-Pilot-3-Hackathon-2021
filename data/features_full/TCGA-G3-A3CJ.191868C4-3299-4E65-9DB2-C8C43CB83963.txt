Gross Description

Received are specimens A to B. All requisitions and specimen containers are labelled with the patient‘s name
" ‘ The cassettes and AP identifiers are labelled with the Surgical Number

Gross photos are taken of the specimen.
A. Devitalization - Fixation Times

Devitalization Time: 1054
Fixation Start Time: Not specified on requisition.
Total Fixation Time: Not specified on requisition.

The specimen consists of an intact formalin-fixed gallbladder measuring 7.5 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm., A cystic duct lymph node is
identified. No gallstones are noted in the gallbladder and mucosal wall appears normal in thickness. No masses or
nodules are seen in the gallbladder either. Representative sections are submitted in a single cassette.

B. Devitalization - Fixation Times

Devitalization Time: 1131
Fixation Start Time: Not specified on requisition.
Total Fixation Time: Not specified on requisition.

The specimen consists of a right lobe of liver weighing 1254 9. Within the liver, there is a circumscribed tumor mass
measuring 12.0 cm in maximum dimension. The nodule has areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. Smaller nodules are
noted in the surrounding hepatic parenchyma measuring between 0.1 cm to 4.0 mm. Also, the hepatic vein seems to have
a clot in it, the largest clot measuring up to 0.5 cm in diameter. The surrounding liver appears congested but is not

definitely cirrhotic. The multiple smaller nodules are tumor noted may be grossly consistent with vascular invasion. The

main tumor mass comes to within 1.0 cm of the inked resection margin, though the smaller possible intravascular ones
come closer to within 0.4 cm. The tumor has a greenish appearance to it.

Representative sections are taken as follows:

BI - section of liver and nearest resection margin to the tumor.
B2 - representative sections of uninvolved liver,

BS - sections of intravascular blood clot.

B4 through BQ - sections of tumor.
