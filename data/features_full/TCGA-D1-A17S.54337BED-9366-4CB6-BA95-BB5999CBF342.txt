Surgical Pathology

DIAGNOSIS:

A. Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and

bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy: Endometrial
adenocarcinoma,

endometrioid type, FIGQ grade 1 (of 3) is identified
formingia mass“mm I“ "mw'

(4. 8 x 3.1 x 2.3 cm) circumferentially involving the
endometrial

cavity. The tumor invades 0.4 cm into the myometrium
(total

myometrial thickness, 2.2 cm). The tumor does not involve
the

endocervix. Lymphovascular space invasion is not
identified. The

margins are negative for tumor. The bilateral ovaries and
fallopian

tubes show no diagnostic abnormalities. [AJCC pleNOMx]

 

B. Gallbladder, cholecystectomy: Chronic cholecystitis
with

cholelithiasis containing multiple mixed stones ranging in
size from

0.6 cm to 3.4 cm in greatest dimension An adenomyoma is
also

present. A single benign cystic duct lymph node is
identified.

C. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, dissection: Multiple (25)
left pelvic
lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

D. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, dissection: Multiple (27)
right
pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic

examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation
of the

specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent
sections are

reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive
changes

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled "uterus, bilateral tubes and
ovaries" is

a 220.0 gram uterus and cervix with attached bilateral
tubes and

ovaries. The uterine serosa is smooth There is a 4.8 x
3.1 x 2.3

cm polypoid mass in the left side of the endometrial
cavity which

grossly appears to invade 0.4 cm into the 2.2 cm thick
myometrium.

There are no leiomyomas. There is a 2.3 x 1.6 x 1.4 cm
right ovary

with a smooth outer surface and a solid cut surface with a
7.2 x 0.4

cm right fallopian tube. There is a 2.7 x 1.6 x 1.2 cm
left ovary

with a smooth outer surface and a cystic and solid cut
surface with

a 6.9 x 0.4 cm left fallopian tube. Representative
sections

submitted.

B. Received fresh labeled "gallbladder" is a 6.2 x 2.7 x
2.7 cm

gallbladder with a 0.4 maximum wall thickness and patent
cystic

duct. A cystic duct lymph node is identified. Multiple
mixed

stones (ranging in size from 0.6 cm to 3.4 cm in greatest
dimension)

are identified, including two stones incarcerated in the
neck. No

masses are grossly identified. Representative sections are

submitted.

C. Received fresh labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes" is a
10.2 x 7.9

 

 

 

x 2.0 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.
