, ﬁnical Diagngsls and History:
ear old female with left invasive CNDCIS ? extensive DCIS 12-1 :00
cT1,cNo,cMo clinical stage I

Tissue(s) Submitted:

1: LEFT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODES #1

2: LEFT AXILLARY PALPABLE LYMPH NODES

3: LEFT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2

4: LEFT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #3

5: LEFT TOTAL MASTECTOMY SUTURE IN AXILLARY TAIL

Gross Description:
Specimen #1 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled left axillary sentinel lymph nodes, and consists of three lymph

nodes with attached fat, ranging from 0.2 cm to 2.4 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are submitted in their entirety for
permanent microscopy as follows:

1A: two lymph nodes
1 B: one lymph node serially sectioned

Specimen #2 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled left axillary palpable lymph nodes, and consists of four lymph
nodes, ranging from 0.8 cm to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are serially sectioned to reveal predominantly pink-
tan cut surfaces, one of which displays a white focus. A smear preparation from the lymph node with the white focus is performed.
The lymph nodes are submitted in their entirety for permanent microscopy as follows:

2A-D: one lymph node per cassette

Specimen#3 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled left axillary lymph node, sentinel #2, and consists of one, 0.9
cm lymph node, which is serially sectioned and submitted in its entirety labeled 3A.

Specimen #4 is received in formalin labeled left axillary sentinel lymph node #3, and consists of six lymph nodes ranging from 0.2

cm to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. The largest lymph node is bisected and the lymph nodes are submitted in their entirety as
follows:

4A: five lymph nodes
48: one lymph node, bisected

Specimen #5 is received fresh labeled left total mastectomy, suture in axillary tail, and consists of an 858 gm, 25 x 23 x 5 cm left
total mastectomy specimen, with a suture marking the axillary tail. There is a 24 x 17 cm, ovoid to elliptical portion of brown skin
on the anterior aspect, displaying a 2 x 2 x 1 cm averted nipple. The skin displays multiple brown-black, flat to raised,
predominantly keratotic skin lesions, ranging from 0.1 cm to 1.0 cm and 0.6 to 0.2 cm. The largest lesion is located at 12 o’clock,
1.7 cm from the nearest 12 o'clock margins. One of the smaller lesions appears to be transected at the 5 o’clock margin. The
specimen is inked as follows: superoanterior~ blue, inferoanterior — green, posterior— black. The posterior margin is intact. The
specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 1.6 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm tan-white, ovoid, lobulated, indurated mass located retroareolar. 6 cm
from the deep margin and 3 cm from the overlying skin. Sectioning of the mass reveals a clip. Anterior to the mass is some dense
fibrosis, displaying possible comedonecrosis. Sectioning of the remaining fibrous tissue reveals a 1.2 x 1.0 X 0.6 cm rubbery, but
stellate area of fibrosis at 1-2 o‘clock, 11 cm from the nipple. Sectioning of this area reveals a clip. The clip is located 3 cm from
the deep margin, and 6.5 cm from the overlying skin. No definitive gross tumor is associated with this clip. The remaining breast
parenchyma consists of approximately 90% yellow, lobulated adipose tissue, and 10% scattered white, rubbery fibrous tissue. A
small portion of tumor and normal are submitted for TCGA studies. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

5A: nipple

58-5D: mass with clip, no margin

5E-SG: representative fibrous tissue anterior to mass, no margin

5H: representative deep margin to mass

5l-5K: stellate area of fibrosis with clip

5L: posterior margin and anterior skin to stellate area of fibrosis with clip
5M-50: representative fibrous tissue at 12-1 o’clock

5P: representative upper inner quadrant

50: representative lower inner quadrant

5R: representative lower outer quadrant

58: representative upper outer quadrant

5T: representative margin in second largest skin lesion
5U: representative medium five skin lesions

5V' representative smaller skin lesions

Time in formalin: 1 pm, submitted same day
