1-. Stem-Resection: proximal stomach and distal esphoagus with quick section on esophageal margin and gastric margin

Diagnosis

1. Gastroesophagectomy specimen:

- well differentiated adenocarcinoma of the proximal stomach extending into the distal esophagus
- invading into adventitial/serosal adipose tissue. (mpT3)

— hyperplastic polyp with focal intramucosal adenocarcinoma, (mpT1a)

- one out of 23 lymph nodes positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma (1/23), (pN1)

- resection margin negative for carcinoma

- Lesser curvature
- Predominantly posterior wall
- For GEJ tumors: 80% in stomach

- CONFIGURATION: Exophytic with an ulcerated center, non-circumferential

- DIMENSIONS: Diameters 6.4 x 6.3 cm
Depth 2.0 cm

— DESCRIPTIVE CHARACTERISTICS: The exposed surface is congested and necrotic. The cut surface has a pink-tan
friable appearance

— PERFORATION: No

- DISTANCE FROM MARGINS:
- PROXIMAL 0.6 cm
— DISTAL 2.5 cm

— RADIAL 0.2 cm (adventitial surface of esophagus) (in the area of the stomach the tumor is covered by adipose
tissue)

ESTIMATED DEPTH OF INVASION: Into perigastric fatand at least one adjacent lymph node

LESIONS IN NONCANCEROUS STOMACH: There is a villiform polyp that is present 2.5 cm from the distal edge of the

tumor approaching the distal margin (grossly difﬁcult to visualize after frozen section). The polyp measures 2.7 x 1.5 x
0.7 cm.

LYMPH NODES: Multiple perigastric lymph nodes are identiﬁed along the lesser curvature ranging in maximum
dimension from 0.3 to 2.9 cm. Several of these grossly appear to be involved by tumor.
