CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Radical cystoprostatectomy.

Specimen submitted: A. Right pelvic lymph node; B. Bladder, prostate. seminal vesicles; C. Right pelvic lymph node; D. Left
pelvic lymph node; E. Leﬂ distal ureter; F. Right distal ureter

DIAGNOSIS:
A. Pelvis, right, lymph nodes (excision):
Nodular deposits of urothelial carcinoma in fibroadipose (lymph node replacement cannot be excluded).

B. Bladder, prostate. seminal vesicles (resection):
Bladder:

- High grade, papillary urothelial carcinoma with focal micropapillary pattern, 6.0 cm, involving
entire bladder (all walls).

- There is multifocal invasion of muscularis propria and local extension into perivenical tissue.

- Lymphatic (B4, B9) and venous (BS) invasion is identiﬁed.

- Multifocal urothelial carcinoma in situ of bladder, extending into the distal lei't ureter and
bladder neck.

- Ulcers with foreign body giant cell reaction, consistent with previous biopsy sites.

— Margins of resection, including urethral and ureteral, are negative for invasive carcinoma.

- One lymph node, negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/1).

. TNM staging: pT3, N1, MX (See specimen C below.)

Benign prostatic hyperplasia with acute and chronic inﬂammation.

Histologically unremarkable seminal vesicles.

C. Pelvis, right. lymph nodes (excision):

metastatic carcinoma replacement of lymph node. , C 0/0 ,3

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received fresh, the specimen is labeled "right pelvic lymph node,“ and consists ol‘a 3.5 x l.2 x 0.5 cm piece of ﬁbromuscular
tissue with two lymph nodes. both of which are entirely frozen. The remaining tissue is entirely submitted. Summary of sections:
AFSC-lymph nodes; A l-remaining tissue.

B. Received fresh. the specimen is labeled "bladder. prostate and seminal vesicles." and consists of a cystoprostatectomy specimen
measuring l4.0 x 9.0 x 5.5 cm. The prostate measures 5.5 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm and the bladder measures 7.0 x 5.5 x 4.5 cm. The right
seminal vesicle measures 2.0 x l.5 x l.5 cm, the led seminal vesicle measures 3.5 x l.5 x l.0 cm, the right vas deferens measures
5.0 x 0.5 cm and the led vas deferens measures 8.0 it 0.4 cm. The left ureter measures 2.0 x 0.9 cm and the right ureter measures

I .8 x l.0 cm. Both urctcrs are shaved and submitted. The distal urethral margin is shaved and submitted. The right aspect of the
prostate is inked green and the led aspect of the prostate is inked black. The anterior perivesical fat is inked green and the posterior
perivesical fat is inked black. The bladder is opened anteriorly to reveal a fungating tumor measuring 6.0 x 5.5 x 3.0 cm located at
the lell dome, leﬂ lateral wall and anterior wall. No tumor grossly extends outside of the muscle. Additionally. there are multiple
erythematous polypoid lesions on both right and left lateral and posterior walls measuring up to 1.2 cm. The prostate is serially
sectioned and sections are labeled from A through H from apex to bladder neck. On cut section, the prostate shows multiple cystic
and nodular areas and is otherwise unremarkable. The prostate is submitted in alternating sections and representative sections of the
bladder including tumor are submitted. Summary of sections: Bl-distal urethral margin; BZ-rigitt ureter margin; B3—left ureter
margin; B4-right urcterovcsical junction; BS—leﬂ ureterovesical junction; Bé-trigone of bladder to prostatic urethra; B7-trigone to
right wall; Bs-leﬂ wall; B9-right wall; B l 0 and BI l-posterior wall; B IZ-dome; B I 3-right and posterior wall; 8 l4-antcrior wall;
BIS-deep to Bl4; B l6-lcft wall: Bl7-section adjacent to B to; BlB-anterior wall; Bl9-leﬂ wall; BZO-anterior wall: 32 l-section
deep to 820; 822-? tumor in fat near leﬁ wall; 323 and BZ4-additional perivesical fat; BZS-RA apex; BZé-RP apex; 1327-LA apex;
B28-LP apex; BZ9-ARA; B30~ARP; 83 l-ALA; BS2—ALP mid; BS3~ALP lateral; BJd-CRA; B35-CRM; B36-CRP; BB7-CLA:

C. Received fresh. the specimen is labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes." and consists oi'a 4.0 x 3.5 x 0.5 cm piece of ﬁbromuscular
tissue and possible lymph nodes. The specimen is entirely submitted. Summary of sections: Cl through C3-ﬁbromuscular tissue
which is ﬁrm. scrieﬁy sectioned and entirely submitted; Cd-remaining tissue.

0. Received a. the specimen is labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes," and consists are 3.3 x 2.5 x [.0 cm aggregate of lymph nodes
and ﬁbrofatty l. mile v ‘“ is entirely submitted. Summary of sections: Dl through D3.

E. Received fresh. 2 x is labeled "leﬂ distal ureter," and consists of a 2.2 cm segment of ureter up to H cm in diameter.
One end is clipped an. ' site end is taken as the true margin. Representative sections of the remaining ureter are submitted.
Summary of sect" ans: r. I -ttue margin: E2-representative sections.

F. Received fresh he "eer‘imen is labeled "right distal ureter," and consists ofa 5.3 cm segment of ureter measuring up to 0.7 cm
in diameter. One d and the opposite end is taken to be the true margin. Representative sections of the remaining ureter
are submitted. 7 :ions: Fl-true margin: F2-reprcsentative sections. (.
