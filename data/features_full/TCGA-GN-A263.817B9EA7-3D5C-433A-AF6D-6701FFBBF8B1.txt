DIAGNOSIS:
A. SKINlEPT BACK AND FLANK:
- MALIGNANT MELANOMA, TYPE UNCLASSIFIED. CLARK'S LEVEL v,
BRESLOW'S THICKNESS 21 MM. WITH SATELLITE LESIONS.
- SEE TEMPLATE.

— METASTATIC MELANOMA IN Two SUBCUTANEOUS PERITUMORAL
LYMPH NODES (2/2).

- LENTIGINOUS JUNCTIONAL AND COMPOUND NEVI WITH ARCHITECTURAL
DISORDER AND MILD TO MODERATE MELANOCYTIC ATYPIA (9 SEPARATE
LESIONS).

- ATYPlCAL NEVUS PRESENT AT INFERIOR ANTERIOR MARGlN.

- DEEP AND OTHER PERIPHERAL MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE.

Melanoma template

Clark's level: V

Thickness: 21 mm.

Host reaction: Moderate

Mitotic rate: 1-3/ 10 hpf; Low

Vertical growth: Prominent

Vasc/lymphatic invasion: Absent

Ulceration: Present at the surface of the skin

Regression: Absent

Precursor: Congenital dysplastic nevus

Satellites: present

Predominant cell type: Epithelioid

Surgical margins: Free but within 6 mm of deep margin and atypical nevus present at inferior anterior
Margin.

Lymph nodes: Positive (2/2)—peritumoral, subcutaneous

Note: No convincing intraepidermal melanoma is identified in the specimen although multiple dysplastic
nevi are present. The growth pattern Of diffuse inﬁltration of dermis and subcutaneous tissue suggest
the process may have originated in a congenital nevus. The remainder of peripheral margins will be
reported in a supplemental report. Two peri-tumoral lymph nodes are present at subcutaneous tissue
with metastatic melanoma.

ADDENDUM:

The remainder of the peripheral marginshave been submitted for review. In the anterior and posterior
area margins, two discrete dysplastic nevi with moderate atypia are present.

The rest of the peripheral margins Of resection are negative.

Note: Tumor is positive for A103, HMB-45, 8-100, tyrosinase and negative for SMA and desmin. This
conﬁrms the melanocytic lineage.

SPECIMEN(S):
A. WIDE EXCISION LEFT BACK AND FLANKS

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. WIDE EXCISION LEFT BACK AND FLANK:

Received fresh for tissue procurement and labeled “wide excision" is an ellipse of skin with
subcutaneous soft tissue measuring 22x14x6 cm. The skin measures 20x10 cm. There are two
stitches attached to the specimen indicating orientation: long stitch-anterior and the short stitch-
superior. The specimen is inked as follows: deep-black. anterior-red, superior-yellow, posteriorogreen,
inferior-orange. There is a tumor mass present in the posterior portion with multi-nodular appearance
on the surface of skin and extended deeply underneath the skin towards anterior portion , 5.5 cm. in
length, 3 cm. in width and 2 cm. in depth. which is 2.5 cm. from closest superior resection margin. The
multi-nodular skin portion of mass is 2.3 cm. in length and 2.5 cm. in width. Centrally deep in the
subcutaneous tissue shows another mass which is well-circumscribed and convalesced with two more
small nodular masses measuring 3x2.6x2.5 cm. in together, which is 0.5 cm. to the closest deep
resection margin. It is necrotic centrally with dark pigmentation. Serial section reveals the mass of the
skin area is ill deﬁned, deep invading to the subcutaneous tissue with gray-white solid appearance,
focally necrotic. The second lesion Of subcutaneous is grey-white and ﬂeshy. . At the anterior portion
of the fatty tissue shows a third, well-circumscribed mass, and 0.4x0.5x0.5 cm with solid and grey whit
appearance on section. There are also multiple pigmented nevi present in the surface of the skin
ranging from 0.2 cm. to 0.7 cm. in greatest dimension. Majority of the pigmented nevi located at the
posterior central portion. The rest of the specimen shows multiple ﬁbrotic appearances admixed with
fatty and skeletal muscle.

Representative sections are submitted in 29 cassettes:

Summary of the sections:

Cassette 1,2: anterior and posterior tip

Cassettes 3 thru 5: superior anterior, superior medial. superior posterior shave biopsy random
Cassettes 6 thru 8: inferior anterior, inferior mid, inferior posterior shave margin random

Cassette 11,12: tumor on the skin with adjacent area

Cassette 13.14: the tumor underneath the skin

Cassette 15 : portion of second mass and third mass

Cassette 16 thru 18: second tumor mass with deep margin

Cassette 19 and 20: full thickness of tumor through deep to anterior portion, second mass

Cassette 21: the second mass with the relationship of the anterior skin

Cassette 22: the second mass with deep margin

Cassette 23 thm 25: ﬁbrotic area adjacent to the second tumor mass

Cassette 26 thru 29: sections Of the pigmented nevus, 98% submitted
