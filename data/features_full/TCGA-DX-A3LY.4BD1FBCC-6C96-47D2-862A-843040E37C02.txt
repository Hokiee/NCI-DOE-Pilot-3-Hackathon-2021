Clinical Diagnosis & History:

Specimens Submitted:
1: Right retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, right kidney and right
adrenal gland

DIAGNOSIS:
1. Soft tissue, right retroperitoneum, right kidney and right adrenal
gland, mass, resection:

- High grade Spindle cell sarcoma compatible with Dedifferentiated
liposarcoma. (see Note)

- The tumor measures 13.2 cm in greatest dimension.

- The dedifferentiated component includes a high grade spindle cell
sarcoma.

- Tumor does not involve the kidney or adrenal gland.

— Tumor extends close to (less than 0.1 cm) the resection margin.

Note: The retroperitoneal mass shows a high grade spindle cell sarcoma
composed of spindle cells in a predominantly palisading pattern
(schwannian). Focal areas show spindle cells in a loose, partially myxoid.
background with scattered large atypical cells. Mitoses, upto 7 per 10 hpf,
are identified. The surrounding peri-renal adipose tissue shows mild atypia,
but morphologic features are insufficient for a definitive diagnosis of a
well differentiated liposarcoma. Immunohistochemical stains show that the
tumor cells are positive for CD34, CDKA (focal) and MDMZ (focal weak) and
negative for 8100, SKA, Desmin and CD117. A MIB 1(KI67) stains shows a high
proliferation rate of 15—20%. Based on the morphology. this represents a
high grade spindle cell sarcoma compatible with a dedifferentiated
liposarcoma. The focal nature of the CDK4 and MDNZ staining is
uncharacteristic of this entity. FISH studies are being performed to confirm
this diagnostic impression.

This case was also reviewed by Dr. 1, who agrees with the above
interpretation.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND REPROVED

Gross Description:

1). Received fresh and labeled "right retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.
right kidney, right adrenal gland'' is a1355 gm resection of adrenal gland
(6.0 x2.9 x0.7cm), kidney (10.1 x 6.5 x 2.5 cm) with attached ureter (12cm
in length by 0.3cm in diameter), renal vein (0.4cm in length by 0.3cm in
diameter) and a soft tissue mass (18.2 x 11 x 9.2cm). The mass is grossly
surrounding the kidney and ureter but not invading them, and has some areas
of hemorrhage (20%) and necrosis (10%). Scent mucinous cystic areas are
identified as well. There is an area which is well defined and is white and
firm, measuring 3cm in greatest dimension. The mass is contained within the
fat surrounding the kidney. but comes within 0.1 cm to the surface of the
specimen. A portion of fat surrounding the kidney, measuring 17 x 10 x 6
cm. is yellow tan and lobulated. The adrenal gland and kidnev are grossly
unremarkable. Pictures taken and tissue submitted for
