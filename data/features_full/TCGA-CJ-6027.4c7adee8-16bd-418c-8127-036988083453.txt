Pathology Report
(A) RIGHT KIDNEY:
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR CELL TYPE), FUHRMAN'S NUCLEAR GRADE 4.
(SEE COMMENT)
TUMOR MEASURES 2.4 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION.
Vascular and ureteral margins of resection free of tumor.
No unequivocal lymphatic/vascular invasion present.

COMMENT

The tumor focally pushes into the perinephric adipose tissue as a polypoid nodule surrounded by a ﬁbrous capsule. No invasion
into the adipose tissue is identiﬁed. Multiple additional deeper sections were examined.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) RIGHT KIDNEY - A nephrectomy specimen (11.0 x 9.0 x 7.0 cm) with attached perinephric fat tissue, unremarkable segment
of ureter (7.0 cm in length and 0.4 cm in circumference), and unremarkable segments of artery and vein (< 1.0 cm in length and
0.4 cm in circumference each).
A well circumscribed, bulging tumor (2.4 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm) with soft tan-brown to yellow cut surfaces and areas of hemorrhage is
identiﬁed at the lower pole. The tumor bulges into the perinephric adipose tissue. The tumor is 3.5 cm away from the renal pelvis.
The non-neoplastic kidney parenchyma is unremarkable. A portion of the tumor and normal kidney is sent to the tissue bank and
is sectioned for special studies.

SECTION CODE: A1, margin (artery, vein, and ureter); A2, tumor in relation with fat; A3, A4 tumor in relation to fat; A5,
A6 tumor in relation with adjacent fat (one slice divided in two cassettes); A7, tumor in relation with adjacent fat; A8, fat with a
portion of tumor; A9, A10 tumor in relation with a normal kidney; A11, normal kidney-
CLINICAL HISTORY
