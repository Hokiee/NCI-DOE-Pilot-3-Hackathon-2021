Fresh tissue was taken for tumour banking (Registrar -

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

(Dr
Three specimens received.

1. "RIGHT INGUINALLYMPH NODE DISSECTION STITCH SUPERIOR" An orientated skin ellipse,
300mm long, 16mm wide and with attached subcutaneous fat up to 80mm thick. A suture indicates the
superior end

in the mid section there is a 34 x 34 x 27mm lymph node containing a brown tumour deposit up to 26mm in
maximal dimension. This node sampled (for tumour banking. The superior third of the tissue contains one
possible small lymph node. The mid section contains Nymph nodes including the large involved & sampled
lymph node. These nodes range from 3 to 34mm in diameter. Only the largest node shows macroscopic
involvement. The distal third contains two lymph nodes, 10mm & 13mm in maximal dimension.
Representative sections.

 

 

IA. Superior third with skin.

1B. Superior third small node trisected.
lC-lL. Mid section.

1C. Largest involved node, (representative).
D & B. One node.

F-L. One node per block.

M & N. inferior third lymph node (one node per block).

2 "lLIAC NODE RIGHT GROIN" Irregular fatty tissue fragments, 60mm' In maximal dimension
containing three lymph nodes ranging from 10 to 16mm In maximal dimension as well as two small possible
‘ nodes. Lymph nodes all embedded.
2A & 28. Largest node.
2C. Smaller two nodes.
2D. One possible node.
2E. One possible node.

3. "RIGHT GROIN OBTURATOR". Fatty tissue 70mm m maximal dimension, containing four lymph
nodes, the largest of which Is 55mm long and up to 15 x 9mm In cross-section. The smallest three lymph
nodes range from S to 14mm' In maximal dimension. No macroscopic tumour deposits are seen. Nodal

 

E; tissue all embedded.

3D-3N. Largest node all embedded.

4. "CLOQUET NODE". Three grey to brown tissue fragments from 8 to 10mm. All embedded in block
4A. '

MICROSCOPIC REPORT

1-4. The (R) inguino-pelvic node dissection shows metastatic malignant meIgnoma.

The tumour is seen in two nodes in the inguinal group (2/8), in blocks 1C and focally in 1F.

The pelvic nodal group is clear (0/4 iliac and 0/4 obturator).

The specimen labelled "Cloquet node" was just haemorrhagic fat.

Tumpu: histology: The melanoma has a small epithelioid cytomorphology and moderate pigment. Mitotic
rate 11/mm2.

Growth pattern: The deposits are the macroscopic one, 26mm dia, comprising lobulated tumour
aggregates within the node (1C), and an 0.5mm subcapsular micrometastasis (IF).

No extranodal extension seen. No signiﬁcant TILs response.
