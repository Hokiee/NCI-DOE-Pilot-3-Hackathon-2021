GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in 6 parts

Part 1 is received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, medical
record

number, and "Right Base of Tongue" with a stitch marking
medial/anterior. It

consists of a 5 x 3 x 2 cm portion of base of tongue. A previously
banked (by

surgeon), at least 2.6 x 2.5 x 2 cm tumor is present. The tumor abuts
lateral, medial and deep margins, and is 0.9 cm from posterior margin
and 0.6

cm from anterior margin. The specimen is serially sectioned and
entirely

submitted. Digital photographs are taken.

MICROSCOPIC:

The microscopic findings substantiate the diagnosis.

The following statement applies to all immunohistochemistry, Insitu
Hybridization Assays (ISH & FISH), Molecular Anatomic Pathology, and
Immunofluorescent Testing:

The testing was developed and its performance characteristics
determined by

the as required by
the CLIA

'88 regulations. The testing has not been cleared or approved for the
specific use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA has
determined such approval is not necessary for clinical use. Tissue
fixation

ranges from a minimum of 6 to a maximum of 96 hours.
Immunohistochemical

stains (where applicable) are performed with appropriate positive and
negative

control reactions. Immunohistochemistry assays have not been validated
on

decalcified tissues. Results should be interpreted with caution given
the

raised possibility of false negativity on decalcified specimens.

This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments of 1988 ("CLIA") as qualified to perform high-complexity
clinical

testing. Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA, ASR's used in this
laboratory

have been established and verified for accuracy and precision.
Additional
information about this type of test is available upon request.
