GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled right pleura the specimen cansists of three
fragments of parietal pleura that range in size from 19.5 x 4.0 x 0.3 cm to
45.0 x 17.0 x 0.3 cm. The surface is tan to red, smooth and glistening with
fecal petechial hemorrhages. Multiple firm, round tan nodules are palpated
that range in greatest dimension from 0.2 to 0.7 cm. One piece of the pleura
shows a surface that is ragged; brown and also contains multiple firm nodules.
On the other surface of the same piece some strips Of skeletal muscle are
identified. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal portions of the lung
surrounded by firm white.sheets. Representative sections are submitted in 10
cassettes.

8. Received fresh labeled level 7 lymph node the specimen consists of three
fragments of dark red to black firm tissue ranging in size from 1.2 x 1.0 x
0.5 cm to 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. One segment shows multiple tan—white nodules on
the cut surface that measure, on average, 0.2 cm in greatest dimension. The
specimen is submitted in toto in six cassettes.

C. Received fresh labeled level 4 lymph node the specimen consists of three
possible anthracotic lymph nodes that range in size from 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm to
0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto in one cassette.

ﬁhvn. Received fresh labeled internal mammary nodes the specimen consists of one

piece of yellow to pink soft tissue measuring 1.2 x 1.5 x 0.2 cm. _The specimen
is inspected for lymph nodes. One possible lymph node is identified measuring
0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is submitted in toto in one
cassette. '

ADDENDUM REPORT

The neoplastic: cells stain strongly positive with imunoperoxidaseé keratin,
calretinin and mildly positive with thrombomodulin stain and essentially
negative with C015, CEA, 873.2 and BEREP~4 stains. This staining pattern
supports the diacmosis of mesothelioma over carcinoma.
