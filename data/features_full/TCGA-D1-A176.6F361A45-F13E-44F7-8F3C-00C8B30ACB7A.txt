DIAGNOSIS:

A. Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and

bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy: FIGO grade II (of III)
endometrial

adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, is identified forming a
mass (4. 7" m“

x 3.2 x 1.7 cm) located in the posterior and right lateral
uterine

wall. The tumor invades 0.3 cm into the myometrium (total

 

myometrial thickness, 2.3 cm). The tumor does not involve
the

endocervix. Lymphovascular space invasion is not
identified. All

surgical resection margins are negative for tumor. There
18 an

intramural leiomyoma (0.4 cm in greatest dimension) in the
myometrium. The bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes are
not

involved. Endometriosis is present on the posterior
uterine serosa

and cul‘d6~§ac. [AJCC pleNOMX]

B-E. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, excisions: Multiple (7

iliac, 7 internal iliac, 6 common iliac, 12 obturator)
right pelvic

lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

F-I. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, excisions: Multiple (8
external

iliac, 2 internal iliac, 3 common iliac, 12 obturator)
left pelvic

lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

J, M. Lymph nodes, right and left para—aortic above the

para—aortic lymph nodes above the inferior mesenteric
artery are

This final pathology report is based on the

examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of
the

specimen(s).

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received fresh labeled "uterus, left and right tubes

and

ovaries" is a 160.0 gram uterus with attached bilateral
tubes and

ovaries and an unremarkable cervix. The posterior uterine
serosa

and cul de sac has focal adhesions suspicious for
endometriosis.

There is a 4.7 x 3.2 x 1.7 cm polypoid mass in the

posterior and
right lateral wall of the endometrial cavity with 2.3 cm

myometrial

thickness. There is a single intramural leiomyoma (0.4 cm
in

greatest dimension). There is a 2.7 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm right
ovary with

a smooth outer surface and a solid cut surface with a 10.8
x 0.7 cm

right fallopian tube. There is a 3.3 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm left

ovary with
a smooth outer surface and a solid cut surface with a 9.7

x 0.7 cm
left fallopian tube. Representative sections submitted.
