B. The specimen is received labeled with the name of the
patient and as omental mass. It consists of an irregular
portion of soft tan-brown tissue and attached fat measuring
2.5 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm. The specimen is inked blue. Cut
sections reveal a red—brown cut surface. The specimen is
entirely submitted in Bl—B3.

C. The Specimen is received labeled with the name of the
patient and as lymph node, left pelvic. It consists of two
irregular pieces of soft tan-brown tissue measuring 3 x 1.6

x 1.3 cm. The speci ' rially sectioned and entirely
submitted in C1—C5. m

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

Sections of the grossly identified renal tumor show
carcinoma with papillary morphology. The tumor is
characterized by multinodular growth and tumor cells with
moderately pleomorphic medium to large oval nuclei with
occasional nuclear grooves and ample eosinophilic to
vaCuolated cytoplasm. In areas the papillary formations are
densely packed and essentially solid. There is multifocal
intratumoral hemosiderin and formation of cystic nodules
filled with papillary tumor and blood. Tumor abuts the
fibrous renal capsule, but does not clearly invade perirenal
fat on multiple levels examined. There is invasion of small
non—muscularized veins in the renal sinus but no definitive
invasion of the renal sinus fat or large branches of the
renal vein.

The tumor is associated with a significant and extensive
diffuse and nodular lymphocytic infiltrate at the periphery
of the lesion that also extensively involve perinephric and
renal sinus fat, and show sheets and nodules of cells
extensively involve the remaining non—carcinomatous renal
cortex. These are monomorphic—appearing small lymphocytes,
and by immunohistochemistry are diffusely positive for CD20
and BCL—Z. The same B cells are negative for CD5 and CD23,
which highlights residual germinal center dendritic cells.
CD3 and CD5 show staining in a smaller population of T
lymphocytes. BCL—6 and cyclin D1 are negative.

Sections of the omental nodule show a spherical accessory
spleen with relatively normal splenic architecture and small
periarterial lymphoid nodules. The adipose tissue
surrounding the splenule is involved by dense sheets and
nodules of the same lymphoid infiltrate with identical

nondcarcinomatous areas. Positive and negative control
slides are appropriate.

DIAGNOSIS BASED ON GROSS AND MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

A. Kidney, left, radical nephrectomy:

— Papillary renal cell carcinoma (histologic type 2), 5.5 cm
in greatest dimension.

— Carcinoma is confined to the kidney, without invasion of
renal sinus fat, muscularized branches of the renal vein, or
perinephric fat.

— Carcinoma shows invasion of small non—muscularized vessels
in renal sinus.

— Small B—cell lymphoma most consistent with extranodal
marginal zone lymphoma, with diffuse involvement of kidney,
perinephric fat, and renal sinus.

— Ureter, vascular, and soft tissue resection margins are
negative for carcinoma.

- See

B. Omentum, excisional biopsy of mass:
- Accessory spleen, with surrounding adipose tissue involved
by small B—cell lymphoma.

C. Lymph node, left pelvic, excision:
— One lymph node, involved by both metastatic papillary
renal cell carcinoma and small B—cell lymphoma.
