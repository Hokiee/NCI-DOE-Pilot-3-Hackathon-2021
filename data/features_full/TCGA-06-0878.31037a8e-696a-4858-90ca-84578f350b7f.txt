OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
Not Given

Operation/Specimen: A: Brain tumor,left temporal, biopsy

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:

Brain, left temporal, excisional biopsy: Glioblastoma.
See Comment.

COMMENT

The specimen is portions of an astrocytic neoplastic proliferation with
nuclear anaplasia, brisk mitotic activity, microvascular cellular
proliferation, and zones of necrosis, some with pseudopalisading, i.e. a
glioblastoma.

Special stains to better characterize the neoplasm have been requested, and
results will be reported as an addendum.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates a gliofibrillary background
within the tumor. Less than 100 cells over express the p53 protein. The
C0163 highlights cells around areas of necrosis. With the MIBHl there is a
proliferation index of about 13% throughout the neoplasm.

 

Comment: The immunoresults support the diagnosis of glioblastoma.

 

Interpretation

NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected.

ResultSHComments
Test performed on paraffin block

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA followed
by real—time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and unmethylated DNA
Sequences.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a

stand alone diagnostic test. This its performance
characteristics deter ined by the laboratory as
required by CLIA ' regulations. as no een cleared or approved for

specific uses by the 0.8. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in
