ADDENDUM

Addendum Comment

Section, designated B4, of the left obturator lymph node shows a nodular
architecture with several follicles some of which have small germinal
centers. Occasional follicles composed predominantly or entirely of small
lymphocytes some of which have a monocytoid appearance. Scattered, rare
plasma cells are noted. Areas of fatty inﬁltration are also identiﬁed.
Increased numbers of histiocytes are seen in the dilated sinuses. An
immunohistochemical panel was performed to further characterize the
lymphocytes with respect to architecture. B and T cells (CD20 and CD3
positive, respectively) show appropriate zonation. The T cells are also
positive for CD5 and CD43. N0 co-expression of CD20 and CD43 or CD5 is
appreciated. The small germinal centers are positive for CD20, CD10 and
bcl-6, but negative for bcl-2. Some of the small follicles are positive for
CD20 and bcl—2, but negative for CD10 and bcl-6, these follicles most likely
represent either mantle/marginal zone hyperplasia or primary follicles. CD21
and CD23 stains highlight the follicular dendritic meshwork in the

follicles. Cyclin D1 is positive in the endothelial cells, but negative in

the lymphocytes.

The combined morphologic and immunophenotypic features in this lymph node
are most consistent with a reactive process. Clinical correlation and
follow-up is recommended.

Comment

The tumor is predominantly composed of endometrioid adenocarcinoma with foci
of serous carcinoma. These foci are present at the lower uterine segrnent/

upper endocervical canal junction, and consititute the area of deepest

invasion. ER immunostain is strongly positive in the endometrioid areas,

while there is patchy staining in areas ofserous carcinoma. P53 shows

strong and diffuse staining in endometrioid areas while it is negative in

areas of serous carcinoma.

Due to abnormal morphology of the lymph nodes, additional
immunohistochemical stains and hematopathology consult is pending, and the
results will be reported in an addendum.

The case is received in ten parts, each labeled with the patient's name, medical record number
and given accession number

‘ , and it is accompanied by a requisition form labeled with the same
name and accession number.

Part A: Received in formalin and labeled "UTERUS, CERVIX, BILATERAL TUBES
AND OVARIES" is a 60 gram (5.5 x 4.7 x 2.5 cm) unopened uterus with attached
right fallopian tube (6 x 0.3 cm), right ovary (2.3 x 2 x 1.4 cm), left

fallopian tube (6.9 x 0.4 cm), and leﬁ ovary (2.6 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm).

mucosal surface, and has a 0.5 x 0.5 cm circular os. The uterine serosa is
tan-pink, smooth and glistening. A. The specimen is bivalved to reveal a 2.3
x 1.2 cm endometrial cavity. The anterior endometrium features a 2.1 x 1.1 x
0.6 cm red, friable, exophytic mass extending upward from the endometrium.
The uninvolved endometrium measures 0.2 cm in thickness on average. The
myometrium averages 1.2 cm in thickness. The tumor mass appears
superﬁcial, and grossly does not invade the myometrium.

The right fallopian tube has a pinpoint lumen on cut surface. The right
ovary is tan-white, lobulated, and firm, and is serially sectioned to reveal
unremarkable tan-white parenchyma, with multiple corpora albicantia. The
left fallopian tube ia sectioned to reveal a stellate lumen, and the left

ovary is is tan-white, lobulated, and firm, and is serially sectioned to

reveal unremarkable tan-white parenchyrna with multiple corpora albicantia.
