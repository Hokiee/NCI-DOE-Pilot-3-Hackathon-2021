(B) LEFT KIDNEY:
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR) CELL TYPE, FUHRMAN'S NUCLEAR GRADE 4
(4.0 CM).
TUMOR CONFINED TO THE KIDNEY.
Margins of resection free of tumor.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) SUBCUTANEOUS INVASIVE CYST - A tan-pink nodular soft tissue specimen (3.5 x 3.0 x 2.7 cm), consistent with a thin-walled
ruptured cyst containing tan cheesy material. Specimen is representativeiy submitted In A1 and A2.
(B) LEFT KIDNEY - A nephrectomy specimen (15.0 x 8.5 x 6.5 cm).

A reddish-brown tumor mass (4,0 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm) with yellow areas is present in the mid lateral portion of the kidney. The tumor abuts
the renal capsule without apparent involvement of the adipose tissue. It is 0.5 cm from the closest external surface. No renal sinus or
renal vein involvement is identified. The remainder of the renal parenchyma has a 0.5 cm cortical cyst. Representative portions of
tumor and normal tissue are submitted for tumor banking. The tumor is submitted for electron microscopy.

INK CODE: Biack - closest external surface overlying the tumor.

SECTION CODE: B1, renai vein, artery and ureter margins; B2, one hilar lymph node; 83-313, representative sections of tumor (ail
eiiow areas submitted; 35-36, have ciosest external surface); B14, sections of kidney with renal sinus; B15, section of the cortical cyst.

(C) 11TH RIB - A tan-pink non-oriented irregular fragment of rib (3.0 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm). The specimen is entirely submitted for gross only.
