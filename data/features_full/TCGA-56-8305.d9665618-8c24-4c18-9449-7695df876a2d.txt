surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of
invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus (ie, not in the main
bronchus); or Tumor 5 cm or less in greatest dimension with any of the
following features of extent: involves main bronchus, 2 cm or more distal
to the carina; invades the visceral pleura; associated with atelectasis or
obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not
involve the entire lung)

SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPTION

A) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, 4R paratracheal

The specimen is received fresh from the OR labeled "4R paratracheal lymph
nodes." It consists of two fatty black lymph nodes measuring 0.8 and 1.3 cm
in greatest dimension. The larger node is serially sectioned and both nodes

are entirely frozen on two blocks.

INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: "No evidence of
metastaticc 'n ma. odal involvementwith small Iymphocytic lymphoma" is
rendered WE

B) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, subcarinal level 7

The specimen is received fresh from the OR labeled "subcarinal lymph node
level 7." It consists of a 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm black lymph node which is
trisected and entirely frozen on one block.

INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: "NO evidence of

metastatic c . Nodal involvement by small Iymphocytic lymphoma” is
rendered by%

C) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, additional subcarinal level 7

Labeled “additional subcarinal lymph node level 7" is a portion of
fibrofatty tissue containing eight apparent lymph nodes. The lymph nodes
range from 0.51 .8 cm in greatest dimension. All lymph nodes have
gray-black anthracotic pigmentation. The two largest lymph nodes are
bisected. All lymphoidal tissue is entirely submitted for frozen section
diagnosis on two blocks as follows:

1. One large bisected lymph node and four significantly smaller lymph
nodes (smaller Iymph nodes submitted in toto)

2. Three lymph nodes, largest lymph node bisected, two smaller lymph
nodes in toto. ,4 s: g

INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: "Multiple nodes
(8) with no evidence of metastatic tumor. Nodai in with small
lymphocytic lymphoma is present" is rendered by

D) SOURCE: Lung, right upper lobe

Labeled "right upper lobe of lung" and received fresh from the OR is a 568
gram. 17 x 11 x 5 cm portion of lung. The pleural surface displays a

stapled 3 x 1.5 cm bronchial margin with an adjacent 16 cm stapled margin.
The pleural surface is red-tan, dusky with a 2 x 1.5 cm slightly puckered
area on the opposite aspect of the bronchus. The puckered pleura is inked
green and the lung is sectioned revealing a 4.5 x 3 x 4.5 cm white—tan
mostly necrotic tumor grossly abutting the puckered pleural surface and
grossiy approaching the pleura on the opposite aspect. measuring 1.5 cm to
the staple line and 3 cm to the bronchus. The remaining parenchyma is
dusky, red-brown without additional masses or lesions identified.

 

Representative sections are submitted in ning cassettes labeied:
1. Bronchial margin. egyfage g

2. Vascular margins, on face

3. Anthracotic lymph node

4-5. Tumor to pleura (green)

6. Tumor to staple line (blue)

7. Additional tumor

8—9. Random lung

E) SOURCE: Level 10 lymph node

Labeled "level 10 lymph node" is a 3.5 cm red—brown lymph node with
numerous staples present. The specimen is entirely submitted in three
cassettes.
