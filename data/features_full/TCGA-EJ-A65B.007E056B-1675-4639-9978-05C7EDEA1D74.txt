FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

PART 1: LYMPH MODES, RIGHT PELVIC. EXCISION —
NO EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASIA IN THREE (3) LYMPH NODES EXAMINED.

PART 2: LYMPH NODES, LEFT PELVIC, EXCISION -
NO EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASIA IN TEN (10) LYMPH NODES EXAMINED.

PART 3: PROSTATE AND BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES, RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY -

A. INVASIVE POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA. MIXED SUBTYPES. GLEASON SCORE 4 + 5 - 9
(see comment).
THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT LOBES AND HAS A GREATEST NODULAR DIAMETER
OF 3 cm.
THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES APPROXIMATELY 35% OF THE EXAMINED PROSTATE VOLUME.
THE CARCINOMA SHOWS ESTABLISHED EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IN THE REGION OF THE RIGHT
POSTERIOR APEX (slides 3A. 31') AND IN THE SOFT TISSUE SURROUNDING THE LEFT SEMINAL VESICLE.
RIGHT SEMINAL VESICLE IS INVOLVED BY CARCINOMA (slide 3A).
ALTHOUGH ALL MARGINS ARE NEGATWE. THE CARCINOMA IS VERY CLOSE (LESS THAN 0.1 CM) IN THE
REGION OF THE RIGHT POSTERIOR APEX IN AN AREA OF EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSIONIslicIe 3T).
EXTENSIVE PERINEURAL INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.
NO ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.
EXTENSIVE HIGH-GRADE PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA IS IDENTIFIED.
PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE (AJCC 7th EDITION): pT3b No MX.
