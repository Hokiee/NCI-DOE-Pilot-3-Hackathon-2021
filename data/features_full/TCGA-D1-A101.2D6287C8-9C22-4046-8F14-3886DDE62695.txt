DIAGNOSIS:

A.Uterus, bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes,
hysterectomy

and bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy:

FIGO grade II (of III) endometrial adenocarcinoma,
endometrioid type ////' ‘

w1 squamous and mucinous metaplasia, is identified
forming a ‘ ‘

polypoid mass (4.0 X 3.0 x 1.0 cm), located in the fundus.
The

tumor invades 0.2 cm into the myometrium (total wall
thickness 1.5

cm). The tumor does not involve the endocervix.
Lymphovascular

space invasion is not identified. The margins are
negative for

tumor. Multiple (3) intramural leiomyomata (ranging in
size from

0.2 cm to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension) are identified. A
benign

endometrial polyp (2.5 x 1.7 x 0.6 cm) is also identified.
The

bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes are not involved.

This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic

examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation
of the

specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent
sections are

reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive
changes

identified on permanent section review will be reflected
in a

revised report.

The

uterine serosa is smooth. There is a 4.0 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm
mass in the

fundus of the endometrial cavity which grossly appears to

cm into the 1.5 cm thick myometrium. A separate
endometrial polyp

(2.5 x 1.7 x 0.6 cm) is also noted. There are multiple
(3) multiple

intramural leiomyomas ranging from 0.2 cm to 1.5 cm. There
is a 3.0

x 1.2 x 0.7 cm right ovary with a ragged outer surface and
a solid

cut surface with a 7.7 x 0.5 cm right fallopian tube.
There is a
