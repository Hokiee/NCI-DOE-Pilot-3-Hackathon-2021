Specimen
A. Left liver

Clinical Information
Liver carcinoma

Gross Description

A. Received fresh for tissue procurement labeled "left liver" is a 425
g, wedge-shaped, 21.0 x 11.5 x 6.5 cm portion of red—brown liver
parenchyma with a 16.5 x 2.4 x 1.2 cm fatty pedicle along one aspect
(in keeping with ligament of The capsular surface is deformed
by a bosselated firm subcapsular mass. On sectioning, the mass is
lobulated pale tan—yellow to tan—pink, measuring 8.7 x 7.4 x 6.0 cm. A
portion of the tumor and a portion of normal parenchyma are submitted
for tissue procurement as requested. The tumor extends to within less
than 0.1 cm of the inked capsular surface and is 3.2 cm from the
cauterized margin of resection. A pale firm focus measuring 3 cm in
greatest dimension is noted at the margin (in keeping with cautery
artifact see block 5). The remaining liver parenchyma is uniform
red—brown without additional mass lesion or abnormality.

Summary: 1 through 4 - tumor to inked capsular surface, 5 — closest
margin of resection including additional pale focus, 6 through 8 —
tumor to normal parenchyma, 9 - random parenchyma, 10 — parenchyma to
