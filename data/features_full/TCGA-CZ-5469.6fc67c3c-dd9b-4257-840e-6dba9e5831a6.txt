PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:

A/l) LEFT RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY:

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, clear cell type (11.3 cm), Fuhrman Grade II/IV.
The tumor focally abuts but does not invade the renal capsule.

No lymphovascular invasion seen.
Renal vein is negative for tumor.
Ureter (including margin) is negative for tumor.

AJCC stage (6th edition): T2 N0 MX (see below)

The non—neoplastic kidney will be evaluated by Renal Pathology; and the

findings
will be reported in an addendum.

B/2) HILAR MASS:

Lymph node (2.6 cm) with sinus histiocytosis and follicular hyperplasia,

negative
for tumor.
Fifteen (15) additional small hilar lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

CLINICAL DATA:'

History: None given.

Operation: Left laparoscopic radical nephrectomy.
Operative Findings: Not provided.

Clinical Diagnosis: Lt renal mass.

TISSUE SUBMITTED:
A/l) 1t kidney — to Tissue Bank.
B/2) hilar mass.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh in two parts, each labeled with the patient's

name and unit number.

Part A, "left kidney", consists of a 1371 gram left radicalwnenhragtgmx
specimen (31.0 x 14.0 x 8.0 cm) including perirenal’fatw(measuring in thickneSs
from 2.0 to 2.5 cm). The left adrenal gland is not present. Extending from
the renal pelvis is the ureter (11.5 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter), left
renal vein (1.5 cm in length x 3.0 cm in diameter), and left renal artery (1.8
cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter). The majority of the renal parenchyma
consists of a poorlywcircumscribed, lobulated, focally hemorrhagic, tan/white
to gray to orange soft, focally cystic mass (11.3 x 10.8 x 10.5 cm) that is 2.2
cm to the renal vein margin, 10.6 cm to the ureter margin, 2.4 cm to the renal
artery margin, and grossly abuts the kidney capsule (inked black). The
remainder of the renal cortex is tan/brown with a well—defined corticomedullary
junction. The pelvis and calyces are covered by smooth glistening mucosa. The
adipose tissue is thinly sectioned and no lymph nodes are found.

Representative sections of tumor are taken for cytogenetics, tissue banking,
and Dr. Sabrina Signoretti‘s lab. Representative sections of normal kidney are
taken for electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and tissue banking.

METAPHASES COUNTED: 6 ANALYZED: 6 SCORED: BANDING: GTG

INTERPRETATION:

Two samples from the same tumor were received.

Smiler aberrations were seen in both samples, including add(3)(p21), a
characteristic finding in renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type.

COMMENTS:
Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the
standard methods employed. Chromosome analysis was performed at a level of 400

hands or greater.
