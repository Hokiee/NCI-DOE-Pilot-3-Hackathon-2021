Gross Description

A. CORE LIVER BIOPSY
Received fresh labeled with the patient name

Description: The specimen consists of two cylinders of tan—brown tissue having lengths of 0.7 and 1.2

cm and diameters of less than 0.1 cm. The specimen is entirely embedded for a frozen section
diagnosis.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS PERFORMED AT No evidence
of malignancy.

SECTIONS:
A1. Frozen section control.

B. WEDGE LIVER BIOPSY
Received fresh labeled with the patient name

Description: The specimen consists of three pieces of tan—brown tissue ranging from 0.5-1.0 cm in
greatest dimension, each of which reveals a white-tan nodule measuring up to 0.1 cm in greatest
specimen. The specimen is entirely embedded for a frozen section diagnosis.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS PERFORMED AT
of malignancy.

No evidence

SECTIONS:
Bl. Frozen section control.

C. COMMON HEPATIC ARTERY LYMPH NODE

Received in formalin labeled with the patient name

Description: The specimen consists of an irregular piece of yellow-brown tissue measuring 3.1 cm in
greatest dimension, from which are retrieved three lymph nodes which are submitted in their entirety.

SECTIONS:
C1. One longitudinally bisected lymph node
C2. One intact lymph node and one inked and longitudinally bisected lymph node.

D. PRODUCT OF PARTIAL PANCREATICODUODENECTOMY:

Received fresh labeled with the patient name

Specimen received: Product of a partial pancreaticoduodenectomy

Orientation given: Two medium length sutures, one long suture and two long sutures identify the bile
duct, pancreatic neck and SMA margin respectively, per the intraoperative consultation form.
Integrity: The pancreatic component is intact; the duodenum is unopened.

Size of pancreas: 6.5 x 6.0 x 3.5 cm

Length of duodenum: 19.0 cm

Ducts: Probe patency cannot be demonstrated between the common bile duct and the ampulla.
Ampulla: The ampulla is easily probed from the pancreatic duct.

Inking scheme: The anterior and posterior surfaces of the pancreas are inked blue and black
respectively. The margins of the common bile duct and the pancreas are inked purple and green
respectively, after the true pancreatic margin is embedded for a frozen section diagnosis. The concavity
created by the portal vein is inked yellow and the SMA margin is inked orange.

Tumor site: Within the head of the pancreas

Tumor size: Tumor is estimated to measure 2.8 cm in greatest dimension.

Tumor description: White-tan, waxy, poorly circumscribed

Invasion of: The tumor surrounds the common bile duct, compressing it to a diameter of less than 0.1
cm, having a diameter of 1.7 cm at its margin of resection.

Distance from margins: The tumor appears to most closely approximate the pancreatic margin of
resection by 0.5 cm, the bile duct margin by 3.0 cm, the anterior blue ink aspect of the pancreas by
apparently less than 0.1 cm, the posterior pancreas by 1.0 cm, the concavity created by the portal vein
by 0.5 cm and the SMA margin by 1.0 cm.

Remaining specimen: The small intestinal component has stapled margins of resection, scant serosal
adhesions, an average wall thickness of 0.3 cm and an unremarkable mucosa. Peripheral to the tumor
the pancreas reveals unremarkable cut surfaces, excepting for a 1.1 cm smooth—walled cyst.

Lymph nodes: The lymph nodes retrieved from the specimen are submitted in their entirety.

Representative sections are submitted with the pancreatic component being submitted proceeding from
the margin towards head.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS PERFORMED AT Indicated
margins: All negative for carcinoma.

SECTIONS:

Dl. Frozen section control of common bile duct margin

D2. Frozen section control of pancreatic margin

D3. Frozen section control of SMA margin

04-5. En face proximal and distal duodenal margins, respectively

D6-7. Longitudin‘ally bisected ampulla
D8-9. Transverse of common bile duct proceeding from margin towards head with adjacent pancreatic
tissue (green ink does not represent a true surgical margin)

D10. Approximation of tumor to blue inked anterior pancreatic surface, duodenal wall and green inked
cut surface of pancreas

D11. Approximation of tumor to concavity created by portal vein including pancreatic cyst and
beginning of stricture of common bile duct

D12. Pancreatic cyst, SMA margin and the posterior surface of pancreas

D13. Compressed bile duct and posterior surface of pancreas

014. Tumor and anterior surface of pancreas

D15. Pancreas, SMA margin, posterior surface and one bisected lymph node
