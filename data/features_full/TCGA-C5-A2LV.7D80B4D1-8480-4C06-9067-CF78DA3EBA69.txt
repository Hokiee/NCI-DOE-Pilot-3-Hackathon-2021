lntraoperative Consultartlon:

An intraoperative non~microscopic consultation was obtained and interpreted as: ”Called to Operating Room to pick-up
‘radical hysterectomy specimen' consists of a radical hysterectomy specimen, including 270 gram, 13 cm (fundus to
external 03). x 5 cm (cornu to cornu) x 5 cm (anterior to posterior) uterus with attached 1.5 to 3.0 cm wide vaginal cuff
and bilateral parametrial tissue. Resection margin inked black. A 3 x 3 x 1 cm polypoid mass is present in the left
lateral cervix. Bivalved to show a 4 cm wide x 5.5 cm long unremarkable endometrial cavity. Multiple intramural and '
subserosal white, firm, well circumscribed nodules, measuring 0.5 cm to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension, consistent with
multiple leiomyomas. Portion of mass and normal-appearing tissue taken for l and Tumor Bank. Rest for
pennanents." by

Microscopic Descrﬂrion and Comment:

Sections of the cervix show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with maximum depth of invasion 9 out of
20 mm (slide A17) in the left lateral cervix. No tumor is noted in the endometrium, the pericervical/parametrial soft
tissue and in the anterior and posterior vaginal cuff. Metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma is noted in one of
seven paracervical lymph nodes (A19). Additional 47 lymph nodes do not show evidence of metastatic disease.

 

r“ ' .__r.
Histog:

The patient is a ~ year old woman with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. Operative procedure: Examination
under anesthesia, radical hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, suprapubic catheter placement, and lymph node
dissections.

Gross Description

The specimens are received in nine formalin—filled containers. each labeled with the patient's namef

The first container is labeled "radical hysterectomy specimen (Uterus. cervix)" and contains a uterus with cervix but
wrthout adnexae. The uterus measures 13 cm fundus to external 05, S cm cornu to cornu, 5 cm anterior‘posteriorly.
There is a 1.5 x 3.0 cm wide vaginal cull noted. Smooth. glistening. unremarkable serosal surface does not show any
adhesions. There is a well circumscribed subserosal gray-white nodule present. measuring 1.2 x 0.7 cm, located at
the anterior portion of the uterus. consistent with a leiomyoma. The uterus is bivalved to Show a 3 x 3 x 1 cm polypoid

mass at the left lateral portion of the cervix. The mass shows focal central ulceration. Its distance to the vaginal cuff
is 1.8 cm. There is no evidence of extension of the mass into the paracervical soft tissue. The endocervical canal is _ ..
partly occluded by the mass. The remaining visible portion of the endocervical canal measures 1.2 cm in length x 3.3
cm in greatest diameter and is lined by a smooth glistening gray-while 0.2 cm thick endocervical mucosa. The
unaffected portion of ectocervix measures 3 x 1.8 cm. The cervical 05 cannot be evaluated due to the presence of the
mass. The unremarkable endometrial cavity measures 4 cm (wide) x 5.5 cm (long). It is lined by a smooth, glistening,
unremarkable 0.2 cm thick endometrium. The thickness of the myometrium varies from 1.0 to 2.3 cm. There are
several gray-white wcll circumscribed firm nodules, measuring up to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension consistent with
leiomyomas. The paracervical/parametrial soft tissue on the right lateral portion of the uterus measures up to 6 cm in
length x 2.0 cm in greatest diameter. The paracervical/parametrial adipose tissue on the left lateral portion of the
uterus measures 8.0 cm in length x 1.0 x 0.4 cm in greatest diameter. Labeled A1 — shaved posterior vaginal cuff; A2 -
shaved anterior vaginal cuff;
