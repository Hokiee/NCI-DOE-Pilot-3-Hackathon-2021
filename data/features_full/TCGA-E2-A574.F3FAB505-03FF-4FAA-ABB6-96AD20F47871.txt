QB? :98 DESCRIPTION:

A \I’ILLOMA MEDIAL LEFT BREAST

Received fresh/in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated
"papilloma medial left breast" is an oriented (single anterior, double lateral, triple
superior), previously inked, 14 g, 4.3 X 3.2 x 2.1 cm needle localized excision. Ink code:
anterior-yellow, posterior-black, medial-green, lateral—red, superior—blue, inferior-orange.
The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 7 slices revealing ﬁrm,
focally hemorrhagic breast parenchyma. No lesions or nodules are grossly appreciated.
Entirely submitted as per the attached diagram:

A1: Perpendicular sections medial margin

A2-A3: Slice 2, bisected

A4-A5: Slice 3, bisected

A6-A7: Slice 4, bisected

A8-A9: Slice 5, bisected

AlO-Al 1: Slice 6, bisected

A12-A13: Perpendicular sections lateral margin

B. EXCISION LEFT BREAST CANCER

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "excision left
breast cancer" is an oriented (triple - superior, double - lateral, single - anterior), 46 g,
(Medial to lateral — 6.5 cm, superior to inferior - 5.4 cm, anterior to posterior - 3.5 cm)
lumpectomy specimen. (The specimen is previously inked) Ink code: anterior-yellow,
posterior-black, medial-green, lateral-red, superior-blue, inferior-orange. The specimen is
serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 9 slices revealing a 2.3 x 2.1 x 2 cm, tan-
white to tan-pink, ﬁrm to hard mass that is closest to the posterior margin at 0.2 cm, in
slices 6 to 9. Tissue is procured.

Representatively submitted in 18 cassettes as per the attached diagram:

Bl: slice 1 entire, perpendicular sections of the medial margin

B2: slice 2, representative anterior margin

B3: slice 3, representative posterior margin with the mass

B4-BS: slice 4, sections of the mass showing the closest posterior margin,

B6-B7: slice 5, mass with anterior and posterior margins

B8: slice 5, superior margin

B9-B10: slice 6, mass with anterior and posterior margins

B1 1: slice 6, inferior margin

BIZ-313: slice 6, superior margin

B 14—815: slice 7, representative anterior and key and posterior margins

Bl6: slice 8, posterior margin

Bl7-B18: slice 9, lateral margin, perpendicular sections.

C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 LEFT AXILLA

Received in formalin with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "sentinel lymph
node #1 leﬁ axilla" is a 3.2 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm ﬁbrofatty tissue within which 2 lymph nodes, 2
x 1.3 x 0.7 cm and 2.5 x 1.2 x 1 cm are identiﬁed. The lymph nodes are serially sectioned
and entirely submitted in 2 cassettes, C1-C2.

D. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 LEFT AXILLA

Received in formalin with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "sentinel lymph
node #2 left axilla" is a 3.5 x 2.5 x 0.8 cm ﬁbrofatty tissue within which 2 lymph nodes,
1.2 x 1 x 0.5 cm and 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm are identiﬁed. The lymph nodes are serially
sectioned and entirely submitted in 2 cassettes, d1-D2.
