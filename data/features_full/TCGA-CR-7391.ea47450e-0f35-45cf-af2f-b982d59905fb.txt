CLINICAL DATA

Clinical Features: Uns ecified
Operator: Dr. *
Operation: Unspec1 1e

Operative Findings: Unspecified

Operative Diagnosis: Unspecified

Tissue Submitted: l)posterior level 1 left neck; 2)level 1
lymph node; 3)left partial glossectomy;
4)left neck level 2, 3, 4; 5) anterior

 

level 1
GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1) SOURCE: Posterior Level 1 Left Neck

Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis in a container labeled
"posterior level 1 left neck" are several fragments of fibrofatty tissue
that in aggregate measure 1.4 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The tissue is palpated and
one lymph node is identified. It is bisected and entirely submitted for
frozen section diagnosis.

Summary of sections: 1AFSC, 2/ 1; 1B, remaining fatty tissue, M/ 1.

2) SOURCE: Level 1 Lymph Node

Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis in a container labeled "level 1
lymph node" is one fragment of fibrofatty tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.0
cm. The specimen is searched for lymph nodes and four possible lymph nodes
are identified. They are all submitted for frozen section diagnosis.

Summary of sections: 2AFSC, 4/ 1.

3) SOURCE: Left Partial Glossectomy

Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis in a container labeled "left
partial glossectomy, stitch on anterior margin" is one fragment of tongue
measuring 3.0 x 2.3 cm and extending to a depth of 2.0 cm. The anterior
margin is designated 12 o'clock and the specimen is inked as follows: 12
o'clock to 3 o'clock-blue, 3 o'clock to 6 o'clock-black, 6 o'clock to 9
o'clock-yellow, 9 o'clock to 12 o'clock-green. All of the margins are
removed and submitted for frozen section diagnosis. The mucosal surface of
the specimen contains a white, firm nodular lesion measuring 1.5 x 1.3 cm.
A portion of this nodule is given to research. Serial sectioning of the
specimen reveals that this nodule extends approximately 0.6 cm deep into
the specimen and is approximately 1.0 cm from the deep surgical margin.
Representative sections of the tumor of deep margin are submitted.
Summary of sections: 3AFSC, 12 to 3 o'clock, 1/ 1; 3BFSC, 3 to 6 o'clock,
1/1; 3CFSC, 6 to 9 o'clock, 1/1; 3DFSC, 9 to 12 o'clock, 1/1; 3E, 3F,
representative sections of tumor in deep margin, 1/1 each.

4) SOURCE: Left Neck Levels 2,3 and 4

Received fresh in a container labeled "left neck levels 2, 3, 4" are

several fragments of fibrofatty tissue that in aggregate measure 5.3 x 4.0

x 1.5 cm. The specimen is searched for lymph nodes and three possible lymph
nodes are identified. One lymph node is bisected and submitted in 4A, 4B.
One possible lymph node is bisected and submitted in 4C, one possible lymph
node is bisected in 4D.

Summary of sections: 4A, 4B, 1/1 each; 4C, 2/ 1, 4D, 2/ 1.

5) SOURCE: Anterior Level 1
Received fresh in a container labeled "anterior level 1" is one fragment of

fibrofatty tissue measuring 4.2 x 4.0 x 1.5 cm. The specimen is searched
for lymph nodes and one possible lymph node is identified. The specimen is

bisected and submitted.
Summary of sections: 5A, 2/ 1.
