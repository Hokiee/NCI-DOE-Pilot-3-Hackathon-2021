COMMEBW

More than 90% of the prostate gland is involved by prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor measures 4.0 x 3.8 cm in the largest
cross sectional dimension and it is present in the three cross sections and extensively in the apex and bases regions. The tumor
exhibits multifocal extraprostatic extension. The tumor invades the intra and extraprostatic portions of the right seminal vesicle and
the extraprostatic portion of the left seminal vesicle. Extensive invasion of perivesicular soft tissue is also present. The tumor
extends in the apex (anterior and posterior) and posterior base region to the inked margin of resection). The added length of
marginal involvement is 4.0 mm. Focal extension of tumor to the cauterized margin in other regions cannot be unequivocally
established.

Please refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(C) ANTERIOR BLADDER NECK - A portion of tan-gray tissue (4.4 x 1.7 x 0.8 cm). No orientation provided. Submitted in toto in
C1-C4.

(D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES — A specimen consisting of a prostate. attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (6.0 x 2.8 x 4.2 cm, 47 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the left
posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the right side. Nodules are palpated on the right and left
anterior surface of the prostate. Serial cross sections after ﬁxation demonstrate firm areas consistent with tumor in the right and
left anterior region of the prostate of the three cross sections.

The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.
SECTION CODE: D1-D4, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; D5-D8,

left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; D9, D10, prostatic base, right border;
D11-016, prostatic base, right posterior border; 017-026, prostatic base, central portion; D27, prostatic base, left border;
