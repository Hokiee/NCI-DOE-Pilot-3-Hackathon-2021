Diagnosis/ diagnoses

Resected section of colon (sigma) with an ulcerated colon carcinoma histologically
characterized as a poorly differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma, extending within
0.5 cm of one resection margin, almost completely encircling the intestinal wall and
measuring a max of 3 cm in diameter. Invasive tumor spread within all intestinal wall
layers as far as the periproctic fatty tissue layer. Lymphangial branches in the tumor
margin area.

Oral and aboral resection margins are tumor-free.

Four out of 24 mesocolic lymph nodes with extensive metastases of the colon carcinoma,
partly transgressing the lymph node capsules. The remaining lymph nodes have
uncharacteristically reactive lesions.

Therefore the tumor stage is: pT3, pN2 (4/24) L1, V0; G3
