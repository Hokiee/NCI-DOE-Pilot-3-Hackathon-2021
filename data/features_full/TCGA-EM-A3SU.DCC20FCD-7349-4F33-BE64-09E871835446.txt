Grﬂ Description
- 1. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "RT neck content". Single stitch posterior colon double stitch

superior”, consists of a functional right neck dissection oriented with sutures as indicated. The specimen measures 12.2
cm Si x 4.5 cm AP x 1.5 cm in depth. Within the tissue are multiple lymph nodes that range, from 0.2 to 1.6 cm. Lymph
nodes submitted in toto as they occur from superior to inferior.

1A—C multiple lymph nodes. per block

in—E 1 lymph node. multiple pieces

1F multiple lymph nodes

iG-H 1 lymph node, 3 pieces

1| multiple lymph nodes

 

2. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "RT paratracheal nodes” consists of a piece of ﬁbroadlpose
tissue that measures 3.5 by 1.7 x 1 .0 cm. Within the tissue are multiple lymph nodes that range from 0.5 to 1.7 cm.

2A multiple lymph nodes

23 slice from largest lymph node

3. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "RT upper parathyroid 08“, consists of a piece of tissue that
measures 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1cm. it is frozen for intraoperative consultation and submitted in toto.
, 3A frozen tissue resubmitted

4. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as “LT paratracheal node", consists of a ﬁbroadipose tissue that
measures 1.7 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm. Within the tissue at 2 lymph nodes that measure 0.4 and 1.0 cm.
4A submitted in toto

5- The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as “Total thyroid stitch-upper pole right lobe" consists of a thyroid

gland that is received oriented with a suture and weighs 23.6 g. The right lobe measures 6.0 cm Si x 2.3 cm ML x 1.4 cm
, AP, the left lobe measures 3.7 cm SI x 1.7 cm ML x 0.8 cm AP and the isthmus measures 4.0 cm Si x 0.9 cm ML x 0.5 cm

AP. The external surfaces have ﬁbrous adhesions and are painted with silver nitrate. No parathyroid glands or no lymph

nodes are identified grossly. The right lobe contains 2 delineated. encapsulated nodules that measure 1.4 cm SI x 1.3 cm

ML x 1.1 cm AP and 2.1 cm Si x 2.0 cm ML x 1.5 cm AP. The remainder of the thyroid tissue is red-brown with possible

colloidal nodules. Sections of each of the nodules and normal tissue are stored frozen. Representative sections of the

remainder of the specimen are submitted:

5A-G right lobe, superior to inferior with small nodule in B and C and large nodule and E-G

5H isthmus

5l-N left lobe in toto, superior to inferior

6. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "RT upper parathyroid #2 08", consists of a piece of tissue that
measures 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. It is frozen for intraoperative consultation. '
6A frozen tissue resubmitted

Quick Sggtion Diagnosis
3. Right upper parathyroid: F ibroadipose tissue. No evidence of thyroid or parathyroid tissue identiﬁed.
