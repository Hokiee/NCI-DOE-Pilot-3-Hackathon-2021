My S1gnature 1S attestation that I have personally reviewed the submitted
material(s) and the ﬁnal diagnosis reﬂects that evaluation.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The Specimen is submitted unfixed in twelve parts.

Part 1 is identiﬁed as "left ﬂoor of mouth margin" and is labeled with the
patients name and initials XX. Received are two delicate fragments of tan
soft tissue 1.4 X 0.6 X 0.4 cm and 0.7 X 0.4 X 0.3 cm. Entire Specimen is

taken for intraoperative frozen section diagnostic evaluation and totally
submitted labeled lAF S.

Part 2 is identiﬁed as "composite resection, left oral cavity, blue stitch on
facial artery" and is labeled with the patient's name and initials XX.

Received is an oral composite resection 8.0 X 5.0 X 3.5 cm overall comprised
of oral tongue, ﬂoor of mouth, base of tongue, oropharynX and a 2.5 X 1.5 X
0.6 cm portion of what appears to be mandibular bone. An ill-defined 3.5 X
2.5 X 1.0 cm densely ﬁrm solid pale tan-white focally nodular lesion is
identiﬁed within the region of the ﬂoor of mouth abutting the medial
adjacent margin. An overall gross photograph is taken. Representative tissue
is procured for the clinical tissue bank (areas marked with red ink)

INK CODE:

Green - left medial deep resection margin

Yellow - bone resection margin

Blue - left lateral deep resection margin

Black - remaining resection margins

CASSETTE CODE:

2AF S - left lateral pharyngeal margin frozen section tissue

2BFS - left gingival mucosal margin frozen section tissue

2CFS - left lateral deep soft tissue margin frozen section tissue

2DFS - medial deep soft tissue margin frozen section tissue

2E through 2G - representative cross sections of mass region of deep margin
2H through 21 - representative cross sections region of oral pharynx

Part 3 is identiﬁed as "left neck 1 through 4" and is labeled with the
patient's name and initials XX. Received is an unoriented selective neck
dissection approximating levels 1 through 4 comprised of uniform appearing
soft yellow lobulated ﬁbroadipose tissue. The Specimen is divided into 4
equal portions. On dissection numerous mildly ﬁrm tan lymph nodes are
identiﬁed ranging from 0.1 to 0.1 X 0.1 up to 1.8 X 1.0 X 0.5 cm.
CASSETTE CODE:

3A through 3D - possible lymph node tissue dissected from sequentially divided
quarters

Part 4 is identiﬁed as "left ﬂoor of mouth" and is labeled with the

patient's name and initials XX. Received is a 2.2 X 1.0 X 0.8 cm unoriented
portion of mildly ﬁrm red-tan tissue. The entire Specimen is submitted
labeled 4A.

Part 5 is identiﬁed as "additional deep margin" and is labeled with the
patient's name and initials XX. Received are two unoriented portions of
Slightly rounded soft red-tan tissue 3.0 X 2.0 X 1.3 cm and 2.5 X 1.0 X 1.0
cm.

CASSETTE CODE:

5A - serial cross sections of smaller portion totally submitted

5B through 5D - serial cross sections of larger portion totally submitted

Part 6 is identiﬁed as "mylohyoid" and is labeled with the patient's name and
initials XX. Received is an unoriented roughly ovate portion of mildly firm
uniform appearing red-tan muscle tissue 3.5 X 1.5 X 1.0 cm. The external
surface is marked with black ink. Representative cross sections to the Short
aXiS are submitted in one cassette labeled 6A.

Part 7 is identiﬁed as "additional left gingival margin" and is labeled with
the patient's name and initials XX. Received is a 1.5 and 0.6 X 0.3 cm
portion of tan soft tissue. Additionally received is a 0.3 X 0.2 X 0.1 cm
fragment of pale tan bone tissue. The soft tissue portion of the Specimen is
entirely taken for intraoperative frozen section diagnostic evaluation.
CASSETTE CODE:

7AF S - frozen section tissue totally submitted

7B - bone tissue fragment totally submitted following decalciﬁcation

Part 8 is identiﬁed as "right external jugular nodes" and is labeled with the
patient's name and initials XX. Received is a 1.0 X 0.8 X 0.3 cm fragment of
mildly ﬁrm red-tan tissue. The entire Specimen is submitted labeled 8A.

Part 9 is identiﬁed as "right neck 1 through 4" and is labeled with the

patient's name and initials XX. Received is a 4.0 X 3.0 X 1.5 cm intact
submandibular gland with attached selective neck dissection comprised of soft
yellow lobulated uniform appearing fibroadipose tissue 8.0 X 3.0 X 0.8 cm.
The submandibular gland is normally lobulated soft and tan on external and cut
surfaces. Multiple mildly ﬁrm tan lymph nodes are dissected from the
ﬁbroadipose tissue ranging from 0.1 X 0.1 X 0.1 cm up to 1.0 X 0.5 X 0.3 cm.
CASSETTE CODE:

9A - representative submandibular gland

9B - possible lymph node tissue dissected from level 1

9C - possible lymph node tissue dissected from level 2

9D - possible lymph node tissue dissected from level 3

9E - possible lymph node tissue dissected from level 4

Part 10 is identified as "right neck 2B" and is labeled with the patient's

name and initials XX. Received is a 3.5 X 2.0 X 1.0 cm unoriented portion of
soft uniform elongated pale tan yellow adipose tissue. On dissection no lymph
node tissue is grossly identified. The Specimen is entire submitted labeled
10A and 10B.
