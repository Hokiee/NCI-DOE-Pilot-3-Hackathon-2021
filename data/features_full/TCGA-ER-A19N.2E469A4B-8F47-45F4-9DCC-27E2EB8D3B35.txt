COMMENT:

The tumor is composed discohesive pleomorphic cells many of which contain melanin pigment. The largest lymph node
is 7cm which has extracapsular spread. This may represent multiple conﬂuent lymph nodes, therefore although the
exact number of positive nodes may not be accurate, at least four are positive.
