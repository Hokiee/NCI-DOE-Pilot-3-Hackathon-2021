SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

1. SPECIMEN DESIGNATED "Left temporal primary tumor": glioblastoma
muitiforme (who grade iv)

2. SPECIMEN DESIGNATED "Left temporal primary tumor“: glioblastoma
multiforme (who grade iv), see microscopic description.

Report Electronically Signed

This diagnostic report has been personally interpreted by the signatory
of. record.

Microscopic Description:

The tumor is composed of pleomorphic glial cells. Mitotic figures are
identified in tumor cells. Tumor necrosis is present. The
immunohistochemical stain for gliai fibriliary acidic protein (GFAP) is
positive in tumor cells. The proliferation index as determined by
nuclear staining of tumor cells with the Ki67 (MlB-l)
immunohistochemical stain is approximately 25%.

Frozen Section Diagnosis:

1. Left temporal primary tumor: Glioblastoma multiforme
