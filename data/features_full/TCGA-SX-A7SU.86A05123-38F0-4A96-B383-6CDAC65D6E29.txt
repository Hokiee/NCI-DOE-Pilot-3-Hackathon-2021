Surgical Pathology Report

DIAGNOSIS:

A. Periaortic and parahilar lymph nodes: Eight lymph nodes,
negative for malignancy (0/8).

B. Mass left kidney, resection: Papillary renal cell carcinoma,
Fuhrman nuclear grade 2 (of 4), multifocal, the largest tumor
measuring 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. The carcinoma focally bulges
perinephric adipose tissue, but no invasion of perinephric adipose
tissue is identified. The renal parenchymal margin of resection is
negative for malignancy. No lymphatic—vascular invasion is
identified (see Comment).

DIAGNOSIS COMMENT:

The specimen was inspected grossly with the assistance of

. The portion of kidney reveals a markedly dilated collecting
system (8-cm cyst), and a small amount of recognizable attached
kidney. The collecting system (large cyst) is lined by benign
urothelium. The surrounding renal parenchyma is atrophic and
contains several papillary renal cell carcinomas, the largest 2.0 cm
in greatest dimension. According to the surgeon, the resection
specimen was from a duplicated system, with this representing an
atrophic lower pole segment. The inked margin of resection contains
more functional kidney, which does not show evidence of papillary
renal cell carcinoma.

CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Left kidney mass, papillary renal cell on biopsy.

Intraoperative Pathologist(s):
A. Left periaortic, parahilar lymph nodes, FS:
FSAleAZ: Negative for carcinoma.
B. Mass, left kidney, FS: Papillary renal cell carcinoma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
Performed

A. Received fresh labeled and "left periaortic and
parahilar lymph nodes," are multiple pieces of adipose tissue, 5 x
2.5 x 1.2 cm. Within the fat are seven possible lymph nodes. All
the lymph nodes are submitted for frozen section in two cassettes
labeled -A2.

B. Received fresh labeled and "mass, left kidney,"
is a 283 g renal mass with attached fat, 14 x 13 x 5 cm. On one of
the surfaces is a portion of renal parenchyma, 4 x 3 x 1.2 cm.
Attached the renal parenchyma is a large dilated cystic structure, 8
x 8 cm. The cyst wall is tan and smooth. Adjacent to the cyst wall
are two separate, well-circumscribed, tan—yellow nodules, 2 x 1.5 x
1.5 cm and 2 x 2 x 1.5 cm. These tumors appear to be subcapsular
and do not show any evidence of invading into the fat or through the
capsule. No adrenal is identified. A portion of the tumor is
submitted for 7 Representative sections
are submitted in cassettes labeled : B1) Tissue tumor
submitted for frozen section; B2—B3) remainder of tumor #1 submitted
for frozen section; B4~BS) second tumor; B6—B8) attached renal

parenchyma; B9) vessel margins; BlO-Bl4) sections of dilated cystic
structure.

Support for the diagnosis in this case may have included the
use of immunohistochemistry tests that were developed and whose
performance characteristics were determined by

They have not been cleared
or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not
necessary. These tests should not be regarded as investigational
or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 ('CLIA') as qualified
to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.
