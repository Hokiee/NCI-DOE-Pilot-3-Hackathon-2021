Gross Description

Specimen A is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and medical record number and as "right level #9 lymph
node." It consists of multiple fragments of fibroadipose tissue measuring 3.0 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm in aggregate. Within the tissue.
multiple lymph nodes are found, the largest of which measures 3.0 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm. Lymph nodes are submitted as stated below.

Specimen B is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and medical record number and as "level #7 lymph node." It

consists of multiple fragments of fibroadi ose tissue measurin 2.5 x 1 x 0.7 cm in aggregate. The specimen is submitted
entirely in cassettes "B1" and "82." H

Specimen C is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and medical record number and as "right level #14 lymph
node." It consists of multiple fragments of ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm in aggregate. Within the tissue,

multipleWof which measures 1.7 x 0.9 x 0.6 cm. The lymph nodes are submitted as stated
below.

Specimen D is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and medical record number and as "right level #11 lymph
node." It consists of multiple fragments, 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. Multiple lymph nodes are identiﬁed within the tissue,

the lar est of which measures 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. The lymph nodes are submitted entirely in cassettes '01" and "D2." Dictated
by _

Specimen E is received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and as "right lower lobe." The specimen
consists ofa lobectomy specimen which measures 20.0 x 11.0 x 5.5 cm and weighs 289.5 grams. There is a ﬁrm, white, gritty
mass that measures 3.5 x 3.1 x 2.1 cm. The mass puckers the overlying pleura. The mass is 2.3 from the bronchial margin.
The mass does not invade the vasculature or bronchus. The remainder of the lung is unremarkable. The puckered pleura is
inked blue. The bronchial margin is submitted for frozen section diagnosis and the contents ofthe cryoblock are transferred to

cassette "E1FS." A representative of the mass is submitted for frozen section dia n ' of the cryoblock are
transferred to cassette "E2FS." Sections are submitted as stated below. M
