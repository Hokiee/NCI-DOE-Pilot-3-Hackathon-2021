********** Addendum - Please See End of Report **********

Reason for Addendum #1: Additional studies/stainsiopinion(s)
DIAGNOSIS:
A. BRAIN, LEFT PARIETAL, EXCISIONAL BIOPSY: I
- Glioblastoma multiforme, WHO grade 1V
B. BRAIN, LEFT PARIETAL SUPERIOR, BIOPSY: -

 

- Cortex and white matter

C. BRAIN, LEFT PARIETAL, EXCISIONAL BIOPSY:
- Glioblastoma multiforme, WHO grade IV

COMMENT:

Recent studies indicated an adverse prognostic significance of increased expression of laininin beta 1 and decreased
expression of laminin beta 2 predicting a worse survival of patients with g '
between laminin-S and giial tumor grade, recurrence, and patient survival.
-5iccordingiy, elevated expression of beta 1 and suppressed expression of beta 2 in this tumor predict more
aggressive behavior.

  

The use of these tests in guiding therapy has limitations. Review of the relevant literature and clinical correlation is
advised. These test results do not obligate or preclude use of the relevant therapeutic agents.

iDCZa: Selected slides were reviewed in consultation wit-

HlSTORY: Benign neopiasm of the brain

MICROSCOPIC:

As best revealed on slide Ci this high-grade astrooytoma in addition to densely cellular proliferation of pleomorphie
tumor cells as revealed on a previous excisional biopsy _ now also contains foci of microvascular
proliferation and necrosis with paiisading. The ﬁndings are of gliobiastoma muitiforine. Slide B1 shows cortex and
underlying white matter with no definitive tumor celis.

IMMUNOSTAINS:

Laminin beta 1 (C1): Up-regulated (3+ in endotheiial cells)

Laminin beta 2 (9/421) (C1): Up-regulation in ectatic and smaller capillaries with down-regulation in some of the
foci with microvascular proliferation

GROSS:
A. LEFT PARIETAL TUMOR

Patient Case(s}: 7;
