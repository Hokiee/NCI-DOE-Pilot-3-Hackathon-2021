Intraoperative Consultation:

An intraoperative non—microscopic consultation was obtained and interpreted as: “Called to
pick—up 'uterus/cervix/right and left tubes and ovaries' consisting of a 102 gram corpus
uteri and cervix with bilateral attached fallopian tubes and ovaries. The ovaries are
sectioned and tissue is procured for — request. The uterus measures 6.8 cm
from ﬁundus to cervix, 3 cm from cornu to cornu, and 4 cm from anterior to posterior. All
for permanents,”

Microscopic Description and Comment:

History:

The patient is a — of unstated race, with ovarian cancer. Operative
procedure: Evalua ion un er anesthesia, exploratory laparotomy, transabdominal hysterectomy
« bilateral salpingoeoophorectomy, tumor debulking, and appendectomy.

Gross Description

The specimens are received in five containers of formalin, each labelled with the patient's
name. The first container is labelled "uterus/cervix/right and left tubes and ovaries." It
consists of a uterus, with dimensions consistent with those in intraoperative consultation,
attached cervix, measuring 3 X 3 x 2.5 cm, left and right fallopian tubes, measuring 6.5
cm and 6 cm, respectively, and left and right ovaries measuring 3 x 2.5 x 1 cm each. The
specimen has been previously bivalved for fixation. The external surface of cervix and
uterus shoWs irregular adhesions. No recognizable vaginal cuff or parametrial tissue is
present. The ectocervix measures 3 x 1 cm anteriorly, and 3.5 X 1.5 cm posteriorly. The
reconstituted os is somewhat irregular, measuring 0.5 cm. An area of hemorrhage, otherwise
smooth is noted along the posterior ectocervix measuring 1 x 1 cm in extent. The cervical
canal measuring 2.5 cm in length shows mucus. A slight irregularity is noted along the
anterior endocervical canal with attached mucus, measuring 1 x 1.2 cm. The endometrial

cavity is triangular and measures 2.5 x 2 cm. The anterior and posterior endomyometrium
is diffusely thickened with a smooth, trabeculated appearance. The anterior endomyometrium
measures 2.3 cm in thickness and the posterior endomyometrium measures 2.7 cm in the
maximally thickened area. The endometrial~myometrial interface is grossly obliterated. The
left adnexal structures are congested and edematous in appearance. Adhesions are grossly
identified with some firm areas. The fimbriated end of the left fallopian tube is grossly
obliterated and shows a soft, grey—white nodule, measuring 0.3 cm in immediate vicinity.
The left ovary, although not grossly enlarged, has a nodular, granular outer surface with
areas showing exudate. The cut surface is also somewhat nodular and firm. No gross extension
of tumor into the me30wovarian or adjacent, middle—third of fallopian tube is noted. The
right fallopian tube is thickened along the middlehthird with serosal congestion and exudate
on the surface. The fimbriated end is obliterated and somewhat firm. There are areas of
congestion and firmness with exudate—like deposits in the left adnexal soft tissue. The
right ovary is similar in gross appearance to the left oVary. Labelled Al—AS, anterior
______ cervix with Alvand_A2 contaimingmthe_nodularithickeningima6eaﬁiiposterior,cervix;.A9 and iii
A10, synchronous sections of anterior endomyometrium; All and A12, synchronous sections of
posterior endomyometrium; A13, posterior serosal adhesions on uterine corpus; A14, anterior
serosal adhesions; A15—A17, left ovary and fallopian tube; AlB—AZG, right ovary, right
adnexa and fallopian tube; A21—A25, the remaining entire cervix; A26 —A33, the remaining
entire endometrium.

The second container is labelled “bladder serosa“ and contains an irregular fragment of
congested, soft, membranous tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 0.3 cm. Attached adipose tissue
is noted on the smooth surface. The opposite surface is somewhat rough and hemorrhagic.
Serially sectioned. Labelled El and B2.

The third container is labelled "appendix" and contains an appendix with attached fat,
measuring 5 cm in length. The tip is swollen and congested and shows grey—white exudate on
the surface. It measures 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. The cut surface in the swollen area
shows an obliterated lumen with no grOSS evidence of tumor involvement. Serial sectioning
through the remaining appendix shows a thin, 0.3 cm appendix with obliterated lumen. The
adjacent adipose tissue is grossly unremarkable. Labelled C1 and C2, entire firm area around
putative tip; CS, random appendix. —

The fourth container is labelled "gastro—colic omentum.“ It consists of a stretch of
omentum, measuring 40 x 18 x 3.5 cm in maximum dimensions. There are geographic areas of
thickening and omental caking, involving the edges of the omentum. Cut sections of these
areas show greywwhite, firm cut surface with areas of necrosis. Random representative
sections labelled Bil—134.—

The fifth container is labelled "rectal plaque” and contains multiple plaque—like,
hemorrhagic fragments measuring 1.5 cc in aggregate. Labelled El. Jar 0.
