GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. SENTINEL NODES RIGHT AXILLA
Received fresh are four tan pink lymph nodes ranging from 0.4cm to 20m. Four touch preps are taken.
A1: 1 lymph node
A2: 1 lymph node
A3: 1 lymph node
A4: 1 lymph node
B. RIGHT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and 'WLE right breast needle localization" is a previously
inked oriented 2049, 12.5 x 10 x 7.5cm needle localized lumpectomy with radiograph. Ink code: anterior-yellow,
posterior-black, superior-blue, inferior—orange. medial-green. lateral—red. Specimen is serially sectioned from lateral
to medial into 11 slices revealing 4 masses:
Mass #1- 0.4cm, 1.3cm from the anterior margin in slice 5
Mass #2- 0.3cm, 1.5cm from mass #1 and 2.5cm from anterior margin in slice 5
Mass #3- 3.5 x 2.6 x 2cm. 0.5cm from the anterior and posterior margins in slice 6-9.
Mass #4- 1cm, 2cm from mass #3 and 2cm from the deep margin in slice 6
A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representatively submitted:
B1: lateral margin slice 1
32: slice 2
B3: biopsy site slice 2
B4: slice 2
35-89: slice 4
B10: mass #1 with anterior margin slice 5
811: superior margin slice 5
B12: area in between mass #1 and mass #2 slice 5
B13: slice 5
B14: slice 5
B15: inferior margin slice 5
B16: deep margin slice 5
317-819: mass #3 slice 6
820: mass #4 slice 6
BZ1: deep margin slice 6
322-825: mass #3 slice 7
326-327: mass #3 slice 8
828-330: mass #3 with clip ID in 328 slice 9
331-832: slice 10
833-334: medial margin slice 11

DIAGNOSIS:
A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODES, RIGHT AXILLA. BIOPSY:
— ONE OF FOUR LYMPH NODES WITH ISOLATED TUMOR CELLS (0/4).

NOTE: Cytokeratin AE1/3 stains were performed on A1 and A4 and is negative in A1 and positive in A4. highlighting
scattered tumor cells. On the cytokeratin AE1/3 stain. ~ 100 cytokeratin positive cells are seen, a feature that would
be consistent with isolated tumor cells versus a micrometastasis. The touch prep of A4 was reviewed and tumor cells
were not seen.

8. BREAST/RLG’I'LLINEEDLE LOCALIZATION WIDE LOCAL EXCISION:
- INyASIME LOBULAR CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 2.
- TUMOR MEASURES AT LEAST 3.5 CM.
- TUMOR IS PRESENT AT THE ANTERIOR MARGIN.
- LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU (LCIS) AND COLUMNAR CELL CHANGE.
- ONE INTRAMAMMARY LYMPH NODE, NO TUMOR SEEN (0/1).
- SKELETAL MUSCLE, NO TUMOR SEEN.

NOTE: Grossly. several lesions were noted that microscopically correspond to invasive carcinoma. The size of the
tumor is difﬁcult to determine. While the single largest focus of tumor grossly is 3.5 cm, microscopically. invasive
carcinoma is present in 6 of 11 slices of a 12.5 cm specimen and therefore may span ~ 6 cm. Clinical-radiologic
correlation is recommended. A 0.5cm intramammary lymph node was also identiﬁed.
