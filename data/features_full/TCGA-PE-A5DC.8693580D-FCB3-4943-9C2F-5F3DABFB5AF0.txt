extending to less than 0.1 mm of the inferior and posterior margins and
0.2 cm from the anterior margin.

- Other margins negative for tumor.

- Previous biopsy site changes.

- Extensive angiolymphatic invasion is present.

3. Right breast, ﬁnal inferior margin, excision:

- Residual invaSive and in situ carcinoma with angiolymphatic invasion.
— New margin negative for tumor.

4. Right axillary contents, regional resection:
