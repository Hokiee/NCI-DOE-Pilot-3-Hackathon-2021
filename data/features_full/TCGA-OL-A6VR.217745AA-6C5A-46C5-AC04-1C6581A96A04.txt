C. Right breast simple mastectomy:

- Invasive ductal carcinoma, SBR grade I, with micropapillary features, see
comment.

- Ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate nuclear grade, cribriform, papillary
and micropapillary type, associated with microcalcifications and necrosis.

- Margins of excision are negative for invasive carcinoma, DCIS is 1.5 mm from
the anterior-inferior margin.

- Previous biopsy site identiﬁed.

- Fibroadenoma.

— lntraductal hyperplasia, usual type.

— Apocrine metaplasia.

- Sclerosing adenosis, focally associated with microcalcification.

— Microcalciﬁcations in benign ductules.

Breast Pathologic Parameters

10. pTNM (AICC, 7th edition, 2010): pT1b(m), N0(sn), Mx

Effective January 1, 2010 this Checklist utilizes the 7th edition TNM staging
system for breast of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the

International Union Against Cancer (UICC).

Clinical History:

The patient is a —year~old female with recent breast cancer (DCIS) undergoing

mm- lax—w: 1M M...W.

a right breast simple mastectomy and right breast sentinel lymph node biopsy.

Comment
Immunohistochemical stain for p63 supports absence of a myoepithelial cell

layer.
