GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled "uterus, right and left
fallopian tubes

and ovaries" is an 85.0 gram uterus with attached
bilateral tubes

and ovaries. The uterine serosa smooth. There is a 2.9 x
2.1 x 0.7

cm mass on the anterior wall of the endometrial cavity
which grossly

appears to invade 0.4 cm into the 1.9 cm thick myometrium.
There

are multiple (2) intramural leiomyomata ranging from 0.3
cm to 0.5

cm. There is a 2.7 x 1.9 x 1.6 cm right ovary with smooth
outer

surface and a cystic and solid cut surface with an 8.2 x
0.5 cm

right fallopian tube. There is a 2.4 x 1.9 x 1.8 cm left
ovary with

a smooth outer surface and a cystic and solid cut surface
with an

8.4 x 0.6 cm left fallopian tube. Representative sections
are

submitted.

B. Received fresh labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes" is a
9.0 x 8.5

x 1.7 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. All
lymphatic

tissue submitted.

C. Received fresh labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes" is a
7.5 x 5.3

x 1.7 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. All
lymphatic

tissue submitted.
