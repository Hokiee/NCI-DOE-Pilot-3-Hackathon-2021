ADDENDUM

This modiﬁed report is being issued to provide additional information/results.

Addendum completed by .

DIAGNOSIS

(E) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 9 (4+5). (SEE COMMENT).
TUMOR EXTENDING INTO EXTRAPROSTATIC TISSUE.
TUMOR INVADING RIGHT AND LEFT SEMINAL VESICLES AND PERIVESICULAR SOFT TISSUE.
TUMOR EXTENDING TO THE CAUTERIZED MARGIN OF RESECTION.
LYMPHOVASCULAR AND PERINEURAL INVASION PRESENT.
PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH GRADE.

COMMENT

The prostate gland contains two foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma. Both tumor foci are located in the peripheral zone. The
dominant tumor focus is located in the left lateral, left posterolateral, left posterior, mid-posterior, right posterior. right posterolateral
and right lateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 3.8 x 1.8 cm in largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in
the two cross-sections of the prostate and extensively in the apex and base. The tumor exhibits extraprostatic extension on the left
posterolateral surface of the prostate and right and left superior neurovascular bundle regions. The tumor extends to the right
bladder neck margin of resection. The area of the positive margin is cauterized and the added length of the cauterized margin on
the right base is 4.0 mm. The second tumor focus is located in the right anterolateral and right lateral peripheral zone. This tumor
focus measures less than 0.1 x less than 0.1 cm in largest cross—sectional dimension and it is present in the ﬁrst cross-section and
focally in the apex. The non-dominant tumor focus is of lower histologic grade and confined to the prostate with negative margins.

GROSS. DESCRIPTION

(E) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate. attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (5.0 x 2.5 x 4.0 cm, 28.0 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
left posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the right side. A palpable nodule is present on the left
mid and base regions of the prostate. Serial cross-sections after fixation demonstrate an area consistent with tumor in the right
and left sides of the two cross-sections of the prostate.

The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

SECTION CODE: E1-E2, base of right seminal vesicle and right vas deferens; E3-E4, base of left seminal vesicle and left
vas deferens; E5, prostatic base. right border; E6-E8, prostatic base, right posterior border; E9—E16, prostatic base, central portion;
E17, prostatic base, left border; E18-E21, prostatic base, left posterior border; E22-E23, apex anterior; E24—E25, apex left;

E26-E27, apex posterior; E28-E29, apex right; E30-E37, sections of the two cross-sections of the prostate according to the
specimen radiograph.

The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in
black.
