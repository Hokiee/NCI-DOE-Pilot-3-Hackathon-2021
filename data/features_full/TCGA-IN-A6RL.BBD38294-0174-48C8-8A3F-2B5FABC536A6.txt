INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES AND PROBE/CLONE INFORMATION:

FISH:

Probe: HER2 DNA Probe

Probe Description; The HER2 DNA probe Is a 190 Kb , directly labeled ﬂuorescent DNA probe
speciﬁc for the HER2 . gene locus The CEP 17 DNA probe is a 5.4 Kb directly labeled

fluorescent DNA probe speciﬁc for the alpha satellite DNA sequence at the centromeric region of chromosome 17
The probes are pro-mixed and pro-denatured in hybridization butter.

Interpretation:
HER2 negative: HER2 gene/chromosome 1? ratio less than 2.0
HER2 positive: HER2 gene/chromosome 17 ratio greater than 2.0

Results should be considered along with other clinical information.

has modiﬁed the suggested manufacturer protocol for HER2 FISH testing.
The modiﬁcations have been tested and validated. The modiﬁcations are as follows: Slides are deperal'finized in Tissue is
digested in protease 31 minutes; Tissue and probe are tie-denatured at 90 C for 12 minutes; Parafﬁn pretreatment reagents and
control slides are prepared In house. Ampliﬁed. non-ampliﬁed, and internal (centromere 17) controls were used in the testing. The
laboratory takes responsibility for the test performance.

FISH analysis was manually performed and quantitatively assessed by analysis of a minimum of 60 cells using the HER2
and the CEP17 probes. '
IHC:
anti-HER—Z/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody
Tumors are considered POSITIVE it they show HER2 protein over-expression (3+) by IHC.
