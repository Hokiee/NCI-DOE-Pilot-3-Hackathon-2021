sentinel lymph node #2." Received is a single, unoriented,
brown/tan fibroadipose tissue fragment, 3.4 x 2.3 x 1.3 cm. A
single, possibly two, lymph node candidates matted together are
identified, 2.3 x 2.3 x 0.8 cm. The lymph node candidate is
serially sectioned at approximately 2 mm intervals and is
entirely submitted in blocks C1—C3. Adipose tissue remains in
the container.

sentinel lymph node #3." Received is a single, unoriented,
brown/tan fibroadipose tissue fragment, 1.8 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm. A
single lymph node candidate, 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm is identified,
is serially sectioned at approximately 2 mm intervals and

entirely submitted in blocks D1 and D2. Adipose tissue remains
in the container.
