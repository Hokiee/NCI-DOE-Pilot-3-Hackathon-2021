GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. GALLBLADDER
Received fresh in a single container labeled and designated "gallbladder" and consists of gallbladder
measuring 7.0 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm. The external surface of the gallbladder is pink-tan and grossly looks
unremarkable. Cystic duct remnant measures 0.4 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter. Gallbladder is
opened to reveal large brown to yellow mucosa. A small amount of yellow bile is in the gallbladder
lumen. No mass lesions or calculi are identified. Gallbladder wall measures up to 0.2 cm in thickness.
Representative sections of gallbladder wall and cystic duct are submitted in cassette A1 .

Received fresh in a single container labeled and designated "falciform" and consists of piece of yellow-
red fibroadipose tissue measuring 11.5 x 10.0 x 1.3 cm and weighs 80 gm. The specimen is serially
sectioned and examined. No mass lesions or lymph node candidates are identified. Representative
sections are submitted in cassette Bf and B2.

C. LEFT LOBE LIVER
Received fresh in a single container labeled and designated "left lobe liver" and consists of partial
hepatectomy specimen weighing 290 gm and measuring 15.0 x 14.5 x 6.5 cm. The liver external
surface is dark red. The surgical margin is grossly free of lesions. It is inked in black. Specimen is
