FINAL DIAGNOSIS: /
1. LEFT FRONTAL TUMOR: ANAPLASTIC ASTROCYTOMA , WHO G 'ADE lll, SEE
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION.

2. LEFT FRONTAL TUMOR: ATYPICAL GLIAL CELLS CONSISTENT WITH PORTION
OF INFILTRATING ASTROCYTOMA, SEE DIAGNOSIS FOR SPECIMEN #1.

 

This diagnostic report has been personally interpreted by the signatory
of record.

Microscopic Description:

The tumor consists of pleomorphic glial cells with eosinophilic
cytoplasm and moderately pleomorphic nuclei with ovoid to angular
contours. Multiple mitotic figures are identified in tumor cells
(slide TB). The proliferation index as determined by nuclear staining
with the Ki67 (MIB-l) immunohistochemical stain is focally 10% in
areas of tumor on slide 1 B.

Frozen Section Diagnosis:
1. LEFT FRONTAL TUMOR: Glial neoplasm, final grading deferred to
permanents. .

2. LEFT FRONTAL TUMOR: Glial neoplasm. No Clear anaplastic features
identified in this material. Frozen section diagnosi

Lunical History and Diagnosis:
Left frontal tumor consistent with glioma. Nonenhancing lesion.
