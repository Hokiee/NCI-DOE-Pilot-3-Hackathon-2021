Gross Description: i , A

W
1).The specimen is received fresh. labeled "left paratracheai lymph node, thyroid gland and central compartment lymph nodes” and
consists of a thyroid weighing 11 g. The right lobe measures 3.5 x 2.5 x 1 cm . the left lobe measures 4 x 2 x 1.5 cm, the isthmus
measures 1 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm, and a pyramidal lobe measures 2 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The external surface is covered by a thin fibrous
capsule. The posterior surface of the specimen is inked black, and the anterior is inked blue. Sectioning reveals a 1.2 cm tan
nodule with central papillary excrescences in the inferior left lobe. Sections through the remaining tissue reveal multiple bilateral
colloid nodules. The remainlng thyroid parenchyma is red tan and beefy. There are multiple lymph nodes identiﬁed including a
grossly positive node attached to the inferior pole. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for The remaining
tissue is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:

NL - nodule left lobe
