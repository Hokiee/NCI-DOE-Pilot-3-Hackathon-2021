GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. LEFT KIDNEY
Received fresh labeled with patient’s identiﬁcation and "left kidney" is a 815 g kidney with attached
perinephric fat, 21.5 x 12 x 7.8 cm. The kidney is 14.8 x 10.3 x 6.2 cm. Extending from the renal pelvis
are a ureter (2.3 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter), renal vein (0.8 cm in length and 3.1 cm in
diameter), and renal artery (0.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter). The tumor does not extend into
the ureter. artery, or vein and is not present at the resection margin. The kidney is inked black and is
bivalved revealing a 9.7 x 7.8 x 5.7 cm well—circumscribed, solid, golden orange mass with areas of
hemorrhage and possible ﬁbrosis located in the mid kidney. It pushes on the anterior and lateral
capsule but does not grossly appear to invade through the capsule. The uninvolved renal parenchyma
is tan-brown with well deﬁned cortical medullary junction and orderly cortical striations and medullary
rays. The pelvis and calyces appear smooth. There is a 6.2 x 4.1 x 0.8 cm adrenal gland; it is

unremarkable. No lymph nodes or stones are identiﬁed. A photograph is taken and tissue is procured;
representatively submitted:

A1: shave of ureter margin

A2: shave of vasculature margins

A3-A4: mass and relationship to perinephric fat

A5-A8: mass in relationship to pelvis and normal appearing parenchyma
A9-A10: mass in relationship to capsule

A11: normal appearing parenchyma

A12: adrenal gland

CLINICAL HISTORY:
None Given

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
