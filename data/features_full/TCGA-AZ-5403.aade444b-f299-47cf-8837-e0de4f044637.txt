 

PATIENT HISTORY: l

 
 

. A colonoscopy Showed partially obstructing
fungating tumor 0 the In icolon close to splenicf tire. No other abnormalities seen. Bowel prep was suboptimal 33 a result of
partial obstruction 0f poor bowel prep, evaluation as net! continued. Biopsy of this lesion revealed adenocarcinoma

PRE OP DIAGNOSIS: Colon cancer) N
POST op DIAGNOSIS: Same.
PROCEDURE: Not given“

 

ADDENDA:
Addendum .
At the request MW EGFR imm ostaining was performed on a section of the colon cancer (slide 1H).

The immunohistochemidal stéin for EGFR is ative, but this interpretation is based on an altered method (an original
HMS stained slide from this case had to be de tained in order to he stained for EGFR, a process that could potentially

interfere with the ' ethical reacti ). Thus, an additional EGFR stain has been requested on this ati nt’s
metastatic tumorWand is pendi :the results will be restarted as an addendum 0d
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
PART 1 ‘
AND 2: LARGE INTESTINE, PARTIAL RESEC ON WITH SUBSEQUENT REVISION OF “NEW PROXIMAL MARGIN” —
A. INVASIVE MODERATELY DIFFIE NTIATED COLONIC ADENOCARCINOMA EXTENDING THROUGH THE

ANGIOLYMFHATIC INVASION. F’ RINEURAL INVASION IDENTIFIED. ALL MARGINS FREE. PATHOLOGIC
STAGE T3NOMX, DUKESl B, AST R COLLIER B2.

B. TWELVE (1:2) PERICOLONIC LYM H NODES WITH NO EVIDENCE OF METASTATIC CARCINOMA.
