DIAGNOSIS
(A) RIGHT LOWER POLE TUMOR, PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY:
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR CELL TYPE), FUHRMAN'S
NUCLEAR GRADE 2.
TUMOR MEASURES 4.7 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION.
TUMOR PRESENT IN A VASCULAR SPACE AT THE MARGIN OF RESECTION. (SEE
COMMENT)
(B) 11TH RIB:
Segment of rib for gross inspection only.
(C) PERINEPHRIC FAT:
Adipose tissue, no tumor present.

COMMENT

The tumor is present as a bulging nodule in a large caliber vascular
space at the parenchymal margin of resection extending to the inked
surface indicated by the surgeon. The immunohistochemical stain for
CD31 (vascular marker) highlights the endothelial surface of the
vascular structure. This histologic finding is not diagnostic of renal
vein involvement. Additional sections prepared from the frozen section
block (A1FS) demonstrate a minute amount of adipose tissue adjacent to
the vascular structure consistent with renal sinus adipose tissue. The
tumor does not invade this adipose tissue or the perinephric adipose
tissue.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) RIGHT LOWER POLE TUMOR, INK AT MARGIN - A partial nephrectomy
specimen (7.7 x 5.3 x 4.2 cm) including a portion of kidney and

surrounding adipose. At the margin of resection is a protruding area of
orange-yellow tumor (0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm) marked with que surgical ink.

This area is re-inked que. The remaining resection margin is tan-gray.

A 4.7 x 4.3 x 3.6 cm orange-yellow, partially cystic and
hemorrhagic tumor is present. FocaIIy within the tumor are small areas
of gray mucoid material. The tumor is encapsulated by a rim of tan
ﬁbrous tissue. The tumor bulges into the adjacent perinephric adipose
without gross inﬁltration.

The surrounding uninvolved renal parenchyma is unremarkable.
Representative sections of tumor and normal are submitted for tumor
bank. A portion of the tumor is sequestered for potential electron
microscopy.

INK CODE: Blue - reinked surgical ink, yellow - surgical
parenchymal margin, and black - Gerota's fascia.

SECTION CODE: A1, frozen section of protruding tumor nodule; A2,
additional close margin, frozen; A3, nodule protruding at margin (mirror
image to A1); A4, tumor and nearest fascia; A5-A6, tumor and surrounding
normal kidney; A7, gray mucoid area of tumor; A8, cystic area of tumor;
A9-A10, representative sections of tumor.

*FS/DX: CARCINOMA PRESENT AT INKED MARGIN OF RESECTION. NO
APPARENT CAPSULE AT SITE OF POSITIVE MARGIN. PT:SM/msm
(B) 11TH RIB, GROSS ONLY - An irregular fragment of rib (3.5 x 1.0 x
0.5 cm). The specimen is entirely submitted for gross only.

(C) PERINEPHRIC FAT - An irregular fragment of adipose tissue (7.5 x

1

 

6.0 x 1.0 cm). The specimen is serially sectioned and grossly
unremarkable. Representative sections in C1 and CZ. -
