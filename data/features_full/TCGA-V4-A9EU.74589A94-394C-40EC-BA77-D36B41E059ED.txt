Enucleation of the left eye

Macroscopy
The eyeball mesures 27X24 mm main lines with a segment of optic nerve of 5 mm.

At the section, a tumor nodule is observed at the postero—Iateral part of the eyeball,
measuring 16 mm main line. Tissue specimens are taken for cryopreservation prior
ﬁxaﬁon.

Microscopy

The tumor nodule observed macroscopically presents the microscopic appearance of
an uveal melanoma. This tumor is composed exclusively of epithelioid cells. The cell
atypias are severe. About 60% of the cells are pigmented with melanin. The mitotic
activity is low (4 mitoses per 10 HPF). The tumor measures 16 main line and 10 mm
in thickness at its median part.

There is an infiltration of the ciliary body and of the sclera, with tumor endovascular
embolisms and extra-scleral extension forming a nodule of 3 mm. The optic nerve on
its entire course and the meningeal sheaths are free of tumor.

Conclusion
Uveal melanoma composed of epithelioid cells.
Tumor size: 16 mm main line.

inﬁltration of the ciliary body and of the sclera with a focal extra-scleral tumor nodule
measuring 3 mm.

Mitotic activity: moderate.

Optic nerve on its entire course including the cut end and meningeal sheaths free of
tumor.
