#5 Received fresh labeled R4 lymph node #2 are fragments of yellow to black
material in aggregate 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. Completely submitted as a single
frozen section.

#6 Labeled level 10 lymph node is a 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm aggregate of
black—gray lymphoid tissue, entirely submitted in one cassette.

#7 Labeled level 11 lymph node are two fragments of black—gray lymphoid
tissuei 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm in aggregate. Completely submitted in one cassette.

#8 Received fresh for Frozen Section, labeled right upper lobe, short single
stitch superior margin, long double stitch posterior margin, freeze bronchial
and superior margins, is an 18.3 cm (superior to inferior) x 12.5 cm (anterior
to posterior) x 6.5 cm (medial to lateral) en bloc right upper lobectomy/chest
wall resection with three ribs. The specimen is oriented as stated above.
Within the superior aspect of the lung is a 4.9 x 4.7 x 4.5 cm infiltrative
white tan, firm mass which grossly invades through the pleura into the adherent
medial aspect of the chest wall. It grossly comes to within less than 0.1 cm of
the superior soft tissue margin, is approximately 0.7 cm from the inferior soft
tissue margin, is 0.3 cm from the anterior soft tissue/rib margin, approximately
3.5 cm from the posterior soft tissue/rib margin and 0.7 cm from the lateral
soft tissue margin. The bronchial margin and superior soft tissue margin at the
suture are each submitted for Frozen Section. After decalcification, the mass
grossly appears to invade into the bone of the two superior—most ribs. The
inferior—most rib grossly appears free of tumor. The bronchial and vascular
margins are at least 3.5 cm from the mass. The remainder of the lung is
composed of dark red, spongy parenchyma without additional mass lesions.
Representative fresh tumor and normal lung are procured for the Genome Atlas
Tissue Project. Block summary: "A", vascular margin, tangential; "B", lobar
lymph nodes; "C,D", lung mass with respect to chest wall superior soft tissue
margin, perpendicular; "E", anterior chest wall soft tissue margin, tangential;
"F", posterior soft tissue margin, tangential; "G", inferior soft tissue margin,
tangential; "H", lateral soft tissue margin, tangential; "I,J", mass with
respect to uninvolved lung parenchyma; "K", normal lung; "L", anterior rib
margins; "M", posterior rib margins; "N", two superior—most ribs with tumor;
"0", inferior-most rib with respect to tumor."L"—"O" are following
decalcification.

 

#9 Labeled 5th posterior rib is a 2.4 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm aggregate of multiple
fragments of pink—tan bony tissue. Representative (approximately 50%) of the
tissue is submitted in one cassette.

#10 Labeled 4R lymph node is a 3.0 x 1.6 x 1.4 cm aggregate of adipose
tissue and black—gray lymphoid tissue. It is entirely submitted in two:
"A", "B" .

#11 Labeled R2 lymph node is a 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm aggregate of three

fragments of black-gray lymphoid tissue, entirely submitted in one cassette.

#12 Labeled level 7 lymph node is a 2.4 x 1.6 x 0.8 cm aggregate of

black—gray lymphoid tissue and adipose tissue. It is entirely submitted as six
fragments in one cassette.

#13 Labeled right lower lobe nodule is a 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm firm, white,
focally calcified nodule. It is sectioned and entirel 'tted as four
sections in one cassette following decalcification. “I

#14 Labeled new posterior soft tissue margin, short stitch marked superior
margin, long stitch marks posterior margin, is a 3.3 cm long x 1.5 cm in
diameter segment of rib with scant attached adipose tissue. It is oriented as
stated above and is also received with blue ink at the posterior margin. The
posterior margin is entirely submitted and sectioning through the rib

demonstrates grossly unremarkable bone. Two sections are submitted in two:
"A,B", following decalcification. Block summary: "A", posterior margin,
tangential; "B", uninvolved cross section of rib.

#15 Labeled new soft tissue margin, per requisition new soft tissue posterior
margin, is a 1.8 x 1.4 x 0.8 cm portion of red brown soft tissue. There is a
suture on one surface. The surface is inked black. It is grossly unremarkable
on sectioning. It is entirely sequentially submitted as six perpendicular
section in "A,B".
