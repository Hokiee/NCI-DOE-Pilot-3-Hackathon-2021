Histopathoiogy Report

HISTORY
SCC ieit lingula segment.
Lingula. segmentectomy, left lower lobe lymph. nodes,left hilar lymph nodes.

MACROSCOPIC
Three specimens submitted.

1. The ﬁrst specimen is labelled ‘left lingula lobe‘ and consists of a piece

of lung measuring 110 x 65 x 29 mm. The visceral pleural surface is smooth and
unremarkabie, and does not show evidence of puckering. A stapied margin
measuring 83 mm in length is identiﬁed at one edge. Serial slicing shows a
solitary tumour deposit within the lung. It measures 23 x 20 x 22 mm. It is
located 4 mm from the pleural surface, 20 mm from the stapled surgical
resection margin, and 15 mm from the hilar resection margin. The cut surface of
the tumour is firm and solid with no evidence of cavitation. The tumour appears
to arise from the airways. The lung tissue distai to the tumour and remaining-
lung parenchyma shows no macroscopically identiﬁable pathology. No lymph nodes
are identiﬁed. [1A, shave bronchial resection margin; 18, shave vascular
resection margin; 1C, rep TS of tumour showing its relationship to the

2. The second specimen is iabelled ‘ leﬁ hilar lymph node' and consists of a
fragment of brown to black tissue measuring 10 x 5 x 5 mm. [BIT, 2A.]

3. The third specimen is labelled ‘ ieft iower lobe lymph node‘ and consists of
two fragments of black tissue measuring 6 x 6 x 5 mm and 6 x 4 x 4 mm. [BIT,
3A.]

MICROSCOPIC

1: Sections reveal a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with a
central irreguiar zone of necrosis. The tumour crosses an apparent ﬁssure
with focal invasion of adjacent surface visceral pleura. No tumour is seen on
the pleural surface. The tumour is clear of the bronchial resection margin.
Focal change suspicious for perineoral invasion is identiﬁed. within the
confines of the tumour. No unequivocal lymphatic or vascular invasion is
identiﬁed. No iymph nodes are identiﬁed. Lung parenchyma immediately
adjacent to the tumour shows focal change of obstructive pneumonitls. More
distant lung parenchyma shows emphysema.

2&3: Sections of iymph nodes show reactive changes with sinus histiocytosis,
carbon pigment deposition, scattered ﬂecks of birefringent material in keeping
with silicate and focal mild reactive follicular hyperplasia. No tumour is
identified.

SUMMARY

1-3: Left lingula with separately submitted left hilar and left lower lobe
lymph nodes:

Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.

Tumour size 23 mm.

Tumour crosses an apparent ﬁssure with focal invasion of adjacent surface
visceral pleura; no tumour seen on the pleural surface.

Bronchial resection margin clear; intraparenchymai stapled margins
macroscopically clear.

Focal change suspicious for pen‘neural invasion within conﬁnes of tumour.
No lymphatic or vascular invasion identiﬁed.

Separately submitted left hilar and left lower lobe lymph nodes not involved by
tumour.

Pathological stage: pTZa N0.

Emphysema.
