 

DIAGNOSIS
(A) PART OF 12TH RIB:
Segment of rib for gross inspection only.
(B) LEFT KIDNEY:
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (60% CLEAR CELLS AND 40% EOSINOPHILIC CELLS), FUHRMAN'S
NUCLEAR GRADE 4. (SEE COMMENT)
TUMOR MEASURES 6.5 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION.
Vascular, urethral and soft tissue margins of resection are free of tumor.
Renal cortical (simple) cysts, multiple (ranging from 0.1 to 6.0 cm in maximum dimension).

COMMENT

The tumor is within a vascular space in the renal sinus but does not
invade the renal sinus adipose tissue. The tumor focally bulges into
the perinephric adipose tissue; however, it does not inﬁltrate it.
Multiple additional deeper sections were examined.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) PART OF 12TH RIB, GROSS ONLY - A tan-pink irregular fragment of rib
(5.0 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm). The specimen is entirely submitted for gross

only.

(B) LEFT KIDNEY- A nephrectomy specimen (23.5 x 13.5 x 7.5 cm)
including the left kidney (13.0 x 7.5 x 7.3 cm), a segment of renal

artery, renal vein, and ureter (7.8 cm in length and 0.4 cm in average
diameter). Also present are three detached fragments of adipose tissue
(16 x 12 x 4.5 cm in aggregate).

There is a 6.5 x 4.5 x 2.5 cm well-circumscribed tumor in the upper
pole/mid portion of the kidney. The tumor is yellow, with focal areas

of hemorrhage and necrosis, which are within the center of the tumor and
solid tan areas. The tumor does appear to invade the renal sinus;
however, it does not invade the perinephric adipose tissue and renal

vein. The tumor does not extend into Gerota's fascia.

The adjacent kidney parenchyma demonstrates multiple cysts with the
largest cyst measuring up to 6 cm in greatest dimension. The
pelvicalyceal system is smooth and contains two brown-tan stones, which
measure approximately 0.3 cm in greatest dimension. No lymph nodes are
identiﬁed within the hilum of the kidney.

Portions of the tumor have been submitted for possible electron
microscopy as well as other research protocols.

INK CODE: Blue - Gerota's fascia.

SECTION CODE: B1, ureter, renal vein, and renal artery margins;
B2-B7, tumor with capsule and adipose tissue; B8-B11, tumor with sinus
and pelvis; B12-B13, cysts; B14-B15, representative sections through
adipose tissue.

CLINICAL HISTORY
None given.
