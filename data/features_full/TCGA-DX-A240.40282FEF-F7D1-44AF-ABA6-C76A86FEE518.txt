Clinical Diagnosis 5 History:
51 y/o male with left inguinal mass; positive for spindle cell sarcoma.

Specimens Submitted:
1: SP: Spermatic cord liposarcoma with testis

DIAGNOSIS:

1) SOFT TISSUE, SPERMATIC ”CORD AND TESTIS; EXCISION:

- DEDIFFERENTIATEP_LIPOSARCOMA “““““““

- WELL DIFFERENTIATED COMPONENT (SCLEROSING SUBTYPE) MAKES UP LESS THAN
10% OF THE TUMOR; NONLIPOGENIC ELEMENT HAS THE APPEARANCE OF A LOW GRADE
SPINDLE CELL SARCOMA WITH HIGH MITOTIC RATE BUT NO PLEOMORPHISM OR NECROSIS.
- TUMOR MEASURES 13.5 CM GREATEST DIMENSION, INVOLVES FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE
INCLUDING SPERMATIC CORD, AND ABUTS VAS DEFERENS (TESTIS IS NOT INVOLVED BY
TUMOR).

- TUMOR IS 0.08 CM FROM AN UNDESIGNATED INKED MARGIN.

- CUTANEOUS SCAR; SYNTHETIC MESH WITH ASSOCIATED FOREIGN BODY REACTION.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

Gross Description:

) M.D.

1.) The specimen is received fresh, labeled 'spermatic cord liposarcoma
with testis", and consists of a small ellipse of tan skin with underlying
subcutaneous tissue and mass with attached testicle. The skin ellipse
measures 10.3 x 1.1 cm and contains a 5.1 cm elongated scar. There is a
large ovoid firm mass present in subcutaneous tissues measuring 13.5 x 6.1 x
5.5 cm. The mass appears to be completely covered by pink-tan delicate
pseudocapsule. Serial sectioning through the mass reveals lobulated
homogeneous white tan whorled cut surfaces with focal hemorrhage. No

necrosis is identified. Attached to the mass is a synthetic mesh measuring
6.0 x 3.0 x 0.3 cm, which is partially surrounded by the tumor. The
testicle is present measuring 5.5 x 4.0 x 3.0 cm. There is a hydrocele
containing approximately 10 ml of clear fluid. Serial sectioning through
the testicle reveals unremarkable tan-brown parenchyma. The attached vas
deferens measures 6.5 cm in length and average diameter of 0.3 cm and is
involved by the tumor at the proximal end. Representative sections are
submitted. Portions of the specimen are submitted for TPS. The specimen
photographs are taken.
