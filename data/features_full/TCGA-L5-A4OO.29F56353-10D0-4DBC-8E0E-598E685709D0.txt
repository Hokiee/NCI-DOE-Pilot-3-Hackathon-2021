1'. ”Liver biopsy.” Received fresh for frozen section in a small container is a /0/9//J'

1.1 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm, brown, irregular, soft tissue fragmnt. Frozen section
control. (1 cocaine

2. 'Fmdic nodule.” Received in formalin in a small container is a 1.1. x.1.0 x
0.7 cm. tan, partially encapsulated, soft tissue fragment. A possible
resection margin is identified and inked blue. Sectioning reveals gray-yellow,
solid and focally calcified cut surfaces. (1 cassette

3. ”Cervical esophageal margin! Received in formalin in a small container is
a 1.8 cm in length x 3.3 cm in diameter, unoriented segment of esophagus. The
specimen contains one opened and and one stapled end. Both the adventitial and
weasel surfaces are unremarkable. Bisected.

3A. Opened end submitted, en face.

33. Stapled and shaved and submitted en face. Staple line retained.

4. mid right periesophageal lymph node." Received in formalin in a small
container are two anthracotic lynph nodea (0.7 and 0.9 cm), both of which are
partially covered by adipose tissue. Both bisected and one inked blue. (1
cassette ) Fat retained.

5. 'Proximal staunch distal esophagus! Received in formalin in a small
container is on esophagectow specimen consisting of: Distal esophagus (7.1 cm
in length), proximal stomach (5.6 cm in length) and attached
periesophageal/porigastric adipose. There is a 4 1 x 3. 6 cm flat, ulcerated

 

mm located H1 thin the LWMW 1- 0

cm from the distal margin. The mass occupies BOX of the lunen'e circuirference
and invades through the adventitia, 0. 2 cm away iron: the inked adipose
margin. The esophageal and gastric malls surrounding the man are focally
indurated and thickened up to 1.!» cm. Found within the distal esophagus is a
1.5 x 1.2 cm ill-defined area of ulcerated nucoea, located 1.2 cm proximal to
the man and 3.4 cm from the nearest margin (proximal). Sectioning of this
area reveals unremarkable cut surfaces. The remaining GE junction, esophageal
and gastric mucosa are all unremarkable. Multiple possible lymph nodes are
identified up to 2.1 cm in greatest dimension.
