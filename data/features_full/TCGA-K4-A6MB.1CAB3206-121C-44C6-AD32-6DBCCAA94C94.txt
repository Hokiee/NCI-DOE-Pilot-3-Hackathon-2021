BLADDER CANCER

Gross Description

A. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"left pelvic lymph nodes" are two nodules of ten, fatty tissue.
The largest has an elongated configuration measuring 6 x 1 x 1
cm and the second measuring 0.5 cm. The excess fat is trimmed
and the two nodes are submitted in Al-Az, each containing one
lymph ncdes that has been bisected.

B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"right lvic lymph nodes" are four nodules of ten, fatty tissue
consist t with lymphoid tissue meaSuring from 1 em down to 1.5
cm. Excess fat is trimmed and all four nodes are submitted as
follows: Bl—Bz=one lymph node; 33=two lymph nodes.

C. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, and vas deferens” is a
radical :ystectomy specimen with attached fat. Overall
dimensions measure 15 x.B x 6.5 cm. The attached prostate
measures 4 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm and has a shaggy capsule. The
specimen is inked black on the left and blue on the right. The
right seminal vesicle measures 4 x 1 x 1 cm. The left vas
deferens measures 10 cm in length. The right seminal vesicle
measures 4 x 1 x 1 cm. The right vas deferens measures 11 cm in
length. The left and right ureters are retracted in the fat and
have been previously taken for frozen section evaluation. The
bladder is opened anteriorly. and in the left trigone the mucosa
is remarkable for a 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm deep ulcerated mass. The
remainder of the bladder mucosa has a cobblestoned, edematous
appearance. The cut surface of the mass has an indurated. firm
appearance and grossly appears to have invaded into the fat.

The left.1ateral wall is sectioned to reveal a normal-appearing
parenoh a. The right lateral wall on cut surface also has a
grossly remarkable appearance. The cut surface of the
prostate eveals a tan-pink, nodular appearance, with the right
side par' chyma also revealing embedded, calcified structures.
Represent tive sections of the specimen are submitted as
follows: Claprostatic urethral margin; CZ-CSzentire lesion left
trigone; C6—C7=left posterior wall; C8-C9=left lateral wall;
Closleft dome; Cll-C12=right trigone; C13—C14=right posterior
wall; C15-Clﬁ=right lateral wall; C17=right dome; C18~C21=full
thickness cross sections of upper, mid, and lower one—third of
prostate left side; C22—C25=representative sections of upper mid
and lower one—third of prostate right side.

D. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"left upper ureter margin F3" is a 1 cm frozen section tissue
remnant, entirely submitted in D1.

E, Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"right ureter margin FS“ is a 1 cm frozen section tissue
