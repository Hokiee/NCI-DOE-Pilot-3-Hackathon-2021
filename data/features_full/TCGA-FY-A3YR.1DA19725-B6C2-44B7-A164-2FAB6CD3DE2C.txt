Source of Specimen:

A. Thyrold;Right thyroid lobe
B. Thyroidgleﬂ lobe thyroid
C. Thyroid;central node (thyroid)

Clinical HistoglOgerative Dx:

Thyroid cancer

Gross Description:

A. Single specimen designated as right thyroid lobe. initially received in the fresh state for
Oncogenotyping studies is a 6 gram lobe ofthyroid. 2.7 x 2.6 x 1.5 cm. The surface of the thyroid is
partially glistening. lobular, deep red with adhesions. The posterior and anterior margins are now
differentially inked black and blue, respectively. The specimen is serially sectioned perpendicularly
sectioned through the medial-lateral long axis to reveal a fairly circumscribed, dense, pink-gray nodular
lesion abutting the superior pole and the anterior and posterior margins, measuring 1.7 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm.
Representative portions of tumor are retrieved centrally from the mass and submitted for Oncogenotyping
studies. Notably. the lesion does not appear to have a capsular margin. Examination of the remaining cut
sections demonstrates meaty deep red-tan parenchyma with a 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm gelatinous nodule near
the inferior pole. The lobe of thyroid is entirely submitted for microscopic evaluation in a sequential
fashion. superior to inferior in A1-A6.

B. Part B designated lett lobe of thyroid. Received in formalin is a 6 gram lobe of thyroid. 3.8 x 2.2 x 1.7
cm. Attached to the lobe of thyroid is a 2.7 x 1.8 x 0.3 cm pad of fat containing three lymph node
candidates ranging from 0.2 cm to 0.6 cm each. The lobe of thyroid demonstrates a glistening lobular
surface with moderate adhesions. The posterior and anterior margins are now differentially inked black
and blue. respectively. The lobe is serially sectioned perpendicular through the superior-inferior long axis
revealing a predominantly deep red meaty thyroid parenchyma. with a single discrete pinkgray nodule,
0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm, within 0.1 cm of the anterior thyroid margin. within 1.2 cm of the superior apex (B4).
The thyroid is entirely submitted for microscopic evaluation in sequential fashion superior to inferior,
including entire submission of th lymph node lissue candidacy and remaining fat.

Cassette summary: B1) small lymph node candidate and residual tat submitted. BZ) two lymph node
candidates, 83-88) thyroid lobe entirely submitted superior to infen’or, lesion demonstrated in 84.

C. Part C designated as central node thyroid. Received in formalin are multiple fragments of yellow-tan
