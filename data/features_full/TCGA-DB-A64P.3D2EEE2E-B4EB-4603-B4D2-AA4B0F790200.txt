A- C. Brain, left frontal masses #l—#3 and CUSA, resection: Oligodendroglioma with early anaplastic
transformation (WHO grade I'll”).

lmmunohistochemical stains were performed on parafﬁn embedded tissue using antibodies to [DI-l1 (Rl3ll-l) p53
and Ki67 Neoplastic cells are positive with antibodies to [DHI (R132H) consistent with IDHI mutation. p53
protein is positive in scattered cells. Ki67 labeling index varies from low to moderate The ﬁndings support the
above diagnosis

Fiuorescence' In situ hybridization (FISH) studies for inl9q deletion have been ordered on parafﬁn sections and
WI“ be nerfonned hv the F‘m- intgrpmmﬁon SOB
