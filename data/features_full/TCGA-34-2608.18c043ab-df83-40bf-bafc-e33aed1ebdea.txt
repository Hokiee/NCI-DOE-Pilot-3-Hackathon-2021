GROSS DESCRIPTION
The specimen is received in four parts.

Part 1 is labeled "lymph node near lingular artery". Received ﬁve anthracotic irregular pieces of tissue ranging
in size from 0.4 x 0.2 cm to 1.1 x 0.8 x 0.2 cm. Alt live pieces are submitted entirely in a single cassette labeled
1A.

Part 2 is labeled "left upper lobe, segmental lymph node". Received in saline is a single anthracotic irregular
piece of tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.3 cm. Submitted entirely in a cassette labeled 2A.

Part 3 is labeled "left level 5 lymph node in blood stained ﬂuid". It consists of a single piece of tissue
measuring 6.0 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm. Submitted entirely in a cassette labeled 3A.

Part 4 is labeted "left upper lobe". it consists of a grayish-pink, anthracotic lobe of lung measuring 15.0 x 11.0 x
0.9 cm. There is puckering oi the pleural sun‘ace corresponding to which there is a ﬁrm mass on palpation.
The bronchial (stapled) and vascular margin is identiﬁed. There is no additional parenchyma stapled margin.
The specimen is inked and serially sectioned and shows a grayish white tumor measuring 2.4 x 2.1 x 0.4 cm.
The tumor seems to be close to the pleural surface but does not extend up to the pleural surface grossly. The
lung parenchyma appears normal. Sections are submitted as follows:

4A - hilar lymph nodes

48 - vascular margin

40 - bronchial margin

4D - parenchyma adjacent to the bronchial margin.

4E through 4H - tumor (sections including tumor with pleura and adjacent non-neoplastic lung)

4i - non-neOpiastic lung
