rear-old with chest pain and dysphagia. Clinical Diagnosis: Positive adeno
of the CEGA, J~tube, esophagoscopy.

1. "Left cervical mass.” A 2 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm tan-red soft tissue nodule with
glistening Lobular tan parenchyma. Bisected.

1A. Frozen section control.

13. Rest of specimen.

2. ”Esophagus.’ Received in formalin in a large container is a 6.1 cm long,
3.2 cm wide and approximately 0.6 cm deep. Esophagus is attached to a 7 x k x
3 cm portion of stomach and attached fibroadipose tissue. The esophageal
mucosa is pink to grey and folded. At the gastroesophageal junction is a 2 x 2
cm fine, white-tan, ulcer. This Lies 5 cm from the esophageal margin and 2 cm
from the gastric margins of resection. The radial margin is inked black. The
rest of the gastric mucosa is tan-brown with appropriate rugae. cut sections
reveal a uhite~tan tumor which abuts the inked black radial margin. At this
point, the tumor is 0.7 cm thick. At least two lymph nodes are identified in
the paraeeophagesl fat up to 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm.

2A through 2E. Tumor and esonhaous.

2F. Tumor to stomach.

2G. Gastric margin of resection.

2H. Possible Lymph node.

21 s ZJ. One bisected lymph node each.

3. "Proximal cervical esophageal margin.” Received in formalin in a small

' container is a 1 cm length of proximal esophagus, 1.5 x 1.5 cm. Surgical

staples present.

6. 'Paraesophageal lymph node. Received in formalin in a small container is a
0.5 cm tan bit.

5. "Celiac assess lymph node.” Received in formalin in a small container is a
1 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm ten-white lymph node.
