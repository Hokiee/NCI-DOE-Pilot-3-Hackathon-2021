(B) BILATERAL NECK DISSECTION, TOTAL LARYNGECTOMY, TOTAL GLOSSECTOMY AND
SEGMENTAL MANDIBULECTOMY — A tota1 tongue resection (12.8 x 4.5 x 4.2 cm),
attached segmental resection of right mandible (9.6 x 2.8 x 0.8 cm), and
intact larynx (5.0 x 3.3 x 2.5 cm) with epiglottis and hyoid bone. Bilateral

lymph nodes grossly involved by tumor are identified. The left level III
t

region contains mu iple lymph nodes rangin from 0.3 to 0.7 cm in greatest
dimension. No gross tumor is identified. T e left level IV region contains
multiple lymph nodes, ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. No
gross tumor is identified. The right level I region contains a unremarkable
salivary gland measuring 3.8 x 2.3 x 1.3 cm. No lym h nodes are identified.
The rig t level II region contain an unremarkable sa ivary gland measuring 3.0
cm. TWO additional lymph nodes are ﬁresent, measuring 0.3 to 0.5 cm in
greatest dimension, respectively. T e right level III and IV regions contains
multiple lymph nodes, ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. NO
gross tumor is identified.

A tan- ink, rubber circumscribed mass (8.5 x 4.0 x 3.0 cm), occu ies the
entire rig t side of t e tongue. An area of ulceration (4.7 x 2.4 cm is
present overlying the mass on the right lateral aspect of the tongue. The
remaining mucosa on the tongue is intact. The mass is 0.5 cm from the closest
right lateral mucosal margin, 1.1 cm from the closest anterior mucosal margin
and 1.4 cm from the closest left lateral mucosal margin. The tumor approachs
within 1.0 mm of the deep soft tissue in the region overlying the tumor in the
tongue base and anterior tongue.

Mucosa with ulceration and tumor is adherent to the medial portion of the
mandibular segment. This bone segment is submitted to the Bone Lab for further
sections and processing.

The largynx is grossly unremarkable with the base of the epiglottis
approximate y 1.0 cm from the closest tumor and bone base.

Portions of tumor and normal tissue are submitted for research protocol
and flow cytometry.
