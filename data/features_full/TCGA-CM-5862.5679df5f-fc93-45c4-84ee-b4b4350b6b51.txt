Gross Description: ,

1) .The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right hemioolectomy colon" and
consists of a. segment oi terminal ileum, cecum with attRChed aspendix and
ascending colon. The terminal ileum measures 7.5 cm in length and 3.5 cm in
circumference at the proximal resected margin. The remaining colon measures
19 in length with a circumference of E on at the distal resected margin.

The attached appendix measures 6.5 cm in length and averages 0.7 cm in
diameter. The appendiceal and intestinal seross. is pink tan and smooth.
Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length 05
the specimen measuring up to 5 on in thickness. The specimen is opened to
reveal a circumferential, centrally ulcerative, fungating, brown tan tumor
measuring 5.5 cm in length. 6.5 cm in width. and 2.0 cm in height. 011 out
section of the tumor, it measures 2.5 cm in maximum dapth and shuts the
black inked radial margin. The tumor is IOcated 6.3 cm ﬁrom the ileocecal
valve and 6 cm from the distal resected margin. Also identified. 4.0 cm from
the ileoceoa}. valve and 4.2 cm from the main tumor mass, there is a
brownutan polypoid structure measuring 1.5 x 0.8 x 9.7 cm. The remaining
mucosa shows brown—tan folded appearance and several polypoid areas
measuring up to 0.4 x 0.3 cm in greatest dimensions. which are entirely
submitted. The specimen is submitted for lymph node dissection. The
attached adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all identified lymph
nodes are submitted. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted

Test rerformed: ‘w
KRAS Gene Bxcn 2 mutation analysis (codons 12 and 13)
DNA quality: good.

Methodology:

PCR was performed to amplify exon 2 oi the KRAS gene from genomic DNA
prepared from the submitted tissue. The ?CR product was analyzed on an AB:
3730 DNA sequencer and the sequences were compared to control sequences.r

nIAGNOSTIC INTsnsaarnTION:
Negative for KRAS exon 2 mutation.

Technical sensitivity: This assay’cannot detect a ERAS exon 2 mutation if
the proportion 05 tumor cells in the sample studied is less than 25%.

1. This result cannot be used as sole evidence for or against cancer and has
to be interpreted
in the context of all available clinical and pathological information.

2. This test was developed and its periormance characteristics determined by
the Laboratory of

Diagnostic Molecular Pathology. It has not been cleared or approved by the
5.5. Food and Drug

Administration (FDA). The EDA has determined that such clearance is not
necessary. This test

is used for clinical purposes. Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA ' 88,
our laboratory has

established the acourac and precision of this test. This test has been
mm... by d
as a laboratory specific assay.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY ?ERSONAL EXAMENATION 0P

Diagnostic sensitivity: This finding does not exclude the possibility of
other mutations.

Technical sensitivity: This test may not detect certain mutations if the
proportion of tumor cells in the sample studied is less than 10%.

Test Performed:
Sequenom massvspectrometry gonotyping for specific mutations in 8 genes:
AKTl. 13W; EGFR, E11932. KRAS, MEKl (MAPZKI), m5, and PIK3CA

Methodology:

The specific mutations are detected by amplification of the corresponding
axons by polymerase chain reaction {PCR). followed by a single base
extension at the site of the point mutation. The single base extension
product is detected by tandem massmspectrometry on a Sequenom MassArray
Spectrometer.
