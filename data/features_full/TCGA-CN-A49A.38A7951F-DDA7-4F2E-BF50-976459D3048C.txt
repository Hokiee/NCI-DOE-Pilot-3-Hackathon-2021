GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received unfixed in 15 parts.

Part 1 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and "right
maxillectomy". The specimen consists of a 8.0 x 7.5 x 3.5 cm right
maxillectomy consisting of 5.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm of maxillectomy bone with
two

carious teeth and two additional portions of root. Also received is
5.0 x 2.0

portion of nasoseptum with right and left nasal cavities and a 3.0 x
2.0 x 1.0

cm segment of right ethmoid.

There is a 5.5 x 5.5 x 3.5 cm tan-gray, firm, ulcerated lesion present
on the

palate. The lesion extends to 0.2 cm of the anterior gingival margin,
0.6 cm

of the posterior soft tissue 0.4 cm of the medial soft tissue and 0.3
cm of

the lateral soft tissue. The lesion extends to the deep soft tissue
and

presses into the right nasal cavity and abuts the right turbinate. The
lesion

does not grossly appear to extend into bone of the maxilla.

Also received are 5 tan-gray, soft to firm fragments of soft tissue
ranging in

size from 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. Digital images are taken and tissue is
procured

for the head and neck spore tissue bank.
