1. Deep to cyst wall: White matter with cyst wall lined by moderately cellular, viable tumor.

Comment: This astrocytoma diffusely inﬁltrates white and gray matter. In some areas, especially the cyst
wall, the cells are associated with prominent microcystic change. Tumor cells have moderately
pleomorphic astrocytic nuclei, some naked and others with gemistocytic cytoplasm; other areas have a
more round, monotonous pattern suggestive of an oligodendroglioma component. Immunostain for p53 is
diffusely positive, however, arguing against an oligodendroglioma. Perineuronal satellitosis is seen. No
evidence of an underlying grade 1 tumor is seen (i.e. no EGBs, Rosethal ﬁbers or noninﬁltrative areas).
No mitoses are present. Though the cellularity and pleomorphism are in some areas pronounced, no
mitoses, vascular endothelial proliferation or necrosis are present. Immunostain for MIB-l (slide C3)
shows a nuclear labeling rate of up to 6% (rates of greater than 3% are considered likely to represent
anaplastic change by Burger et al., Surgical Pathology of the Nervous System and its Coverings, 4‘“ ed.).
Thus the tumor is WHO grade 2, but is likely to represent early anaplastic change. Molecular testing for
MGMT, lpl9q are in progress.

MGMT Methylatlon Assay
Specimen Type
Parafﬁn Block

Result

Gene Methylatlon DETECTED.

Methylation of the MGMT (O(6)-melhylguanine—DNA methyltransferase) gene was detected using melhylation speciﬁc PCR technologies.
Methylatian Score: 5.67

unmethylated <2.00

methylated >=2.00

Background

MGMT (O(6)-methylguanine—DNA methyltransferase) is a DNA repair enzyme that is involved in the repair of damage caused by a variety of
DNA crossllnking compounds, including alkylallng agents. Increased methylation of the MGMT gene promoter region causes diminished or
silenced expression of the gene. making calls more sensitive to DNA damage. This relationship has been shown for glloblastomas and
alkylating agents such as Temodar(R)(temozolomide).

Approximately 40% to 45% of glioblastoma multifonne (GEM) tumors exhibit MGMT gene methylation. Retrospective studies have shown that
detection of MGMT promoter methylation in tumor samples is associated with an increased likelihood of a favorable response to temozolomide.

Methodology

DNA is isolated from fonnalln-fixed. parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) specimen. Molecular analysis of the MGMT gene is performed by methylatlon-
speciﬁc PCR and detected on ABI7900. The MGMT and beta-Actin copy numbers will be used to calculate the ratio of MGMT/beta-Actln x1000.
Molecular-based testing is highly accurate, but as in any laboratory test, rare diagnostic errors may occur.

Results of this test are for lnvestlgational Purposes Only. The perfonnanos characteristic of this assay have been detennlned by The

result should not be used as a diagnostic procedure without conﬁrmation of the diagnosis by another medically established diagnostic product
or procedure.
