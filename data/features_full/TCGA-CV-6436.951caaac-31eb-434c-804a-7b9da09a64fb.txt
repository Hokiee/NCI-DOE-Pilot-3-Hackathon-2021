GROSS DESCRIPTION

 

 

(A) TEETH - Multiple fragments of white-tan teeth. The specimen is for gross examination only.-- . .
(B LEFT NECK DlSSECTION, LEVEL | "A" - A 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm lymph node. The specrmen Is submitted entirely In cassette

B

(C) LEFT PARTIAL GLOSSECTOMY - Specimen consists of a portion of tongue (7.5 x 6.7 x 4.5 cm) with a centrally placed
exophytic verrucous tumor (7.2 x 6.3 x 2.5 cm). The closest mucosal margin is posteriorly towards the base of tongue (0.4 cm).
The tumor appears to possibly superficially invade the muscle of the tongue, but the deep margin IS wndely free of tumor. The

lingual nerve is identified by the surgeon and is grossly unremarkable.
INK CODE: Black - deep margin.
