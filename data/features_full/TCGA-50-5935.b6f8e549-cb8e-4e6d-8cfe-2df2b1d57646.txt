ADDENDA:

Addendum

Fluorescence iri~situ hybridization studiee performed on the adenocarcinoma shows a ratio of EGFR gene to the Centromere of
chromosome 7 of 1.0 indicating no EGFR amplification in the targeted region. The rate of hyperploidy for the centromere of
chromoerme 7‘ was ?.1% ofthe analyzed cells. The signal to nucleus ratio (SNR) for the EGFR‘ gene was 1.6.

Interpretation guidelines for EGFR Gene Copy Number by FISH:
Ratio of EGFR’ to the centromere of chromosome 7:
Less than 2.0: No EGFR amplification
Greater than 2.0: EGFR amplification
Hyperploidy: Greater than two centromere copies/cell.
SNR: The average number of EGFR signals not analyzed cell within the targeted region.
Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy number by FISH analysis to be associated with favorable clinical beneﬁt (clinical

reeponee. Stable disease, time to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced non~5mal| cell lung cancer treated with
EGFR tyrosine kinese inhibitors.

Interpretation

Molecular Anatomic Pathology testing:
A. KRAS Exon 1 mutation not identified
B. EGFR Exon 19 mutation IDENTIFIED (15 hp deletion)
C. EGFR Exon 21 mutation not identified

Note:

EGFR mutetions are present in about 10% oand up to 40% in the- population. lEGFR mutations are not
thought to occur in high prevalence in other types of to , 1 .- KRAS mutations are also found in approximately 30% lung
adenocarcrnomas, but not in combination with EGFR mutations. which implies different pathogenic mechanisms (23). The

preeence of these mutetlms may have prognostic and or therapeutic implications (1,5,6).

Results

Sample Preparation -
For cytologyeemples. extraction of DNA was performed from the fluid or sample provided. For Surgical specimens.
microdissection was performed to include neoplastic tisoue and normal adjacent tissue. Optical density readings were obtained.

Geno Seguencing
POI? was performed using primers that flank exon I in the KRAS gene and exon IQ and 21 of the EGFR gene. Analysis of the
PCR productc was first performed for the EOFR 19 to detect aberrant length PCR product. A sequencing analysis, using the

BigDye Terminator Kit (Applied Biosystems, inc.) was then performed. The known hotspote were analyzed for the presence of
mutations. Both forward end the reverse sequencing was oerformed.
