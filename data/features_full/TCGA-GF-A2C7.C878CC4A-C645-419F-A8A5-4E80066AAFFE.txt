Final Pathologic Diagnosis:

A. Skin, upper back, punch biopsy:
Combined nevus (intradermal nevus and blue nevus)

The examination of this case material and the preparation of this report were
performed by the staff pathologist.

Gross Description:
The specimens are received in five containers labeled with the patient name.

Part A is received in formalin labeled "upper back biopsy" and consists of a
punch biopsy that is 4 mm. The specimen is inked, bisected and submitted in
cassette A.

B is received in formalin labeled "vortex scalp, short suture is left margin,

long suture is superior margin" and consists of a ovoid skin excision 2.7 x 2.1
cm excised to a depth of 0.7 cm. There are two sutures present, the short
suture designated left and the long suture superior. The long suture will now
be designated 12 o'clock and the short suture 9 o'clock. The specimen is inked
as follows: 9 to 12 to 3 black, 3 to 6 to 9 blue. The 9 o'clock edge is
submitted in cassette B1, the 3 o'clock edge in cassette B2, the remaining
specimen is submitted sequentially from 9 to 3 o'clock in cassettes B3 through
B7.

Part C is labeled "left posterior triangle node“ and consists of a single
pink-tan possible lymph node 1.8 x 1.2 x 0.7' cm. The specimen is sectioned and
entirely submitted in cassette C1 and C2.

D is labeled "possible sentinel node left posterior ear" and consists of a
yellow-tan possible lymph node 1.5 x 1.1 x 1 cm. The specimen is sectioned and
entirely submitted in cassette D1 through D3. Four unstained slides requested
on cassettes D1 and D2.

Part E is received fresh for Tissue Procurement subsequently placed In formalin
labeled "scalp melanoma, short suture superior, long suture left lateral" and
consists of a roughly ovoid skin excision 7 x 6.2 cm excised to the depth of 1.1
cm. There are two sutures present, the short designated superior and the long
left lateral. The short suture will now be designated 12 o'clock and the long
suture 9 o'clock. The surface of the skin is remarkable for a pink-tan to
gray-tan exophytic lesion 2.5 x 1.7 x 0.8 cm. The remaining skin is remarkable
for blue surgical dye. The specimen is inked as follows: 9 to 12 to 3 black,
3 to 6 to 9 blue. The specimen is sectioned and entirely submitted as follows:

E1 9 o'clock edge;

E2,3 full-thickness cross-sections;

E4,5 one contiguous cross-section bisected;

E6,7 one contiguous cross-section bisected;
