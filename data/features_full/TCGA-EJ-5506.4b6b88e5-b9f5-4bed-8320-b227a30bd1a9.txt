PART 3: '
PROSTATE AND BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES. RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY — '

A. PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA. ACINAR TYPE. GLEASON SCORE 5+3: 8 WITH TERTIARY GLEASON GRADE

0F 4. GLEASON GRADES 415 REPRESENT 50-30% OF THE EXAMINED CARCINOMA.

B. THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT LOBES AND HAS A GREATEST NODULAR DIAMETER

OF 2.0 cm.

c. THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES 30% OF THE EXAMINED PROSTATE VOLUME.

D. MULTIFOCAL ESTABLISHED EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IS PRESENT IN THE RIGHT AND LEFT PERI

POSTERIOR LEFT APEX. POSTERIOR LEFT MID AND POSTERIOR LEFT BASE (SLIDES 3A, 3c, 3R, 38, 3U, 3V,

ABUNDANT PERINEURAL INVASION IS IDENTIFIED. .

ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IS IDENTIFIED (SLIDES 3A, SC).

FOCAL HIGH GRADE PROSTATIC INTRAEPITI-IELIAL NEOPLASIA IS IDENTIFIED.

PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT3b N1 MX.

NON-NEOPLASTIC PROSTATE TISSUE WITH NODULAR HYPERPLASIA.

COMMENT:

Part 3:

There is multifocal. extensive extracapsuiar extension of the oarcInoma both in the prostate and seminal vesIcIes.
Carcinoma extends very close to severai pertoapsular surgical resection margins and aIso close to the left posterior
distal (apical) urethral resection margin (sticie 3L]. No Intact carcinoma cells are present at an inked margin. Close
clinical {serum PSA follow up is recommended. ‘

Part 4:
There Is a small focus of prostatlo adenooaroinoma present in the right posterior base. It is not ctear if this Is a soft
tissue margin or not.
