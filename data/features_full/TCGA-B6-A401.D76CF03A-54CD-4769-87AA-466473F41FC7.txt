CLINICAL HISTORY:

GROSS EXAMINATION:.

A. "Sentinel node #1, hot (AF1-3)", received for frozen section are three
lymph node candidates. One lymph node is bisected and submitted for frozen
section as AFl—AFZ, and the remnant sections are submitted in blocks A1-2.
Two additional lymph nodes are submitted for frozen section as AF3, and the
remnant is submitted as block A3.

B. "Axillary fat", received in formalin is a 11.3 x 4 x 1.5 cm fragment of
yellowetan adipose tissue which is dissected to reveal one lymph node
candidate measuring 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm, which is submitted entirely in block

Bl.

C. "Left breast cancer, two clips medial, one clip inferior, long stitch
lateral, short stitch superior", received in formalin is a 8 cm medial to
lateral, 7 cm superior to inferior, 2.7 cm anterior to posterior lumpectomy
specimen inked as follows: superior—yellow, inferior—red, anterior-blue and
posterior—black. The specimen is sectioned from medial to lateral to reveal a
2.0 x 1.5 x 1 cm mass lesion located 0.4 cm from the posterior margin, 0.7 cm
from the anterior margin, 2.7 cm from the medial margin, 2.7 cm from the
lateral margin, 1.3 cm from the superior margin and 3.2 cm from the superior
margin. The remainder of the breast tissue demonstrates fibrofatty lobulated
adipose tissue that is otherwise grossly unremarkable. Sections are submitted
as follows per the block diagram:

D. "Superior medial margin", received in formalin is a 7.2 x 6.4 x 2.3 cm
fragment of adipose tissue with a stitch marking final margin. The final
margin is inked blue and the opposite margin is inked black. Every other
section is submitted in blocks D1—10.

E. "Medial and superior margin", received in formalin is a 5.5 x 3.5 x 2.2 cm
fragment of yellow-tan adipose tissue with a stitch in place marking the final
margin. The stitched margin is inked blue, and the opposite margin is inked
black. The specimen is sectioned to reveal no focal lesions. Every other
section is submitted in blocks E1—12.

F. "Inferior to lateral margin", received in formalin is a 6.5 x 5.2 x 2.1 cm
fragment of yellow—tan adipose tissue with a suture marking the final

margin. The final margin is inked blue and the opposite margin is inked
black. The specimen is sectioned to reveal no focal lesions. Every other
section is submitted in blocks F1—11.

G. "Anterior skin", received in formalin is a 7.5 x 5 x 2 cm unoriented
aggregate of brown skin with subcutaneous tissue that is grossly
unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted in blocks G1—3.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
A. "Sentinel node #1, hot and blue":

AFl-Z (one lymph node candidate, bisected)—positive for carcinoma.
AF3 (two lymph node candidates)—negative for malignancy

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: Partial mastectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC Edition): pTlc pN1a(sn) pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.
