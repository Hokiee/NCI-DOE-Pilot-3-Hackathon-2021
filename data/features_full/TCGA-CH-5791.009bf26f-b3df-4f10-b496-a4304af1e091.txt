Diagnosis

1. Poorly differentiated, max. 2.3 cm, acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate in both lobes with
marked perineural growth along major nerves, limited to the prostate and with tumor—free
seminal vesicles and seminal ducts.

2. Tumor-free fatty connective tissue. No malignancy.
3. Three tumor-free lipomatous lymph nodes. No malignancy.

4. Two tumor—free lipomatous lymph nodes. No malignancy.

predominance in those parts of the prostate close to the apex. The preparation margin labeled
green and blue is tumor—free.

in summary, the tumor classiﬁcation is as follows: pTZc, pNG (0/5), Gleason 3+4 = 7, Gleason 4:
approx. 10%, G3, L0, V0.
