GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) RIGHT VALLECULA, RIGHT PYRIFORM MARGIN — One tan—tissue fragment (2.6 x
0.2 x 0.3 cm). The iaterai portion of the specimen is marked with biack ink.
Submitted entireiy for frozen section diagnosis.

(3) TOTAL WIDEFIELD LARYNGECTOMY — (9.0 x 7.0 x 4.5 cm), overa , consisting
of a Tarynx, right Tobe of thyroid (2.5 x 2.4 x 0.4 cm), hyoid bone and soft
tissue.

There is an uTcerated, sTightiy firm supragiottic tumor (3.0 x 2.5 x 2.0
cm) which infringes on both the midTine and the right pyriform sinus. The
mucosa surrounding the tumor is irreguiariy thickened. The mucosai
abnormaiities extend the midiine and Taryngeai surface of the epigiottis.

Four Iymph nodes (ranging from 0.5 x 1.2 cm are present in the pretracheai
midiine. N0 additionai nodes are identified.
