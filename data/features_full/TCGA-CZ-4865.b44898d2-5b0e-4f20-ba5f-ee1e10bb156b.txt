Tumor is confined to the kidney and does not involve perihilar or
perinephric adipose tissue.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh, in two parts,
name and unit number.

each labeled with the patients

Part A, "1. L kidney", consists of 4759 nephrectomy specimen, consisting of a
left kidney (18.2 x 9.0 x 5.9 cm) including a thin~walled cyst(10 x 9.5 x 5.9
cm) in the lower pole (lined by smooth walls and filled with a thin, serous
fluid), the ureter (6.0 cm length, 0.3 cm diameter), the renal artery (1.2 cm
length, 0.9 cm diameter), and the renal vein (0.5 cm length, 1.1 cm diameter).
The specimen has been previously inked and bivalved, revealing a circumscribed,
tan/yellow, focally hemorrhagic mass (3.0 x 2.6 x 2.5 cm) in the upper/mid
kidney abutting the renal pelvis. The mass is 1.2 cm from the renal vein
resection margin, 1.0 cm from the renal artery resection margin, 8.3 cm from
the ureteral resection margin, and 0.3 cm from the closest black«inked deep
margin (hilar fat). The mass does not appear to grosely invade the renal
pelvis. The remaining renal parenchyma is unremarkable. The corticomedullary
junction is distinct. A representative section of tumor has been submitted to
Cytogenetice, the Tissue Bank, and for quick—fix, and a representative section
of normal tissue has been submitted to the Tissue Bank (cortex and medulla}.

ADDENDUM

RENAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION OF KIDNEY PARENCHYMA:

LEFT KIDNEY, NEPHRECTOMY:

SIMPLE CYSTS (approximately 5; up to 10 cm), MOST LIKELY RESULTING FROM
URINARY OBSTRUCTION AND RETENTION, WITH COMPRESSION-RELATED CHANGES OF

THE ADJACENT KIDNEY PARENCHYMA

MILD CHRONIC CHANGES OF THE KIDNEY PARENCHYMA, INCLUDING
- FOCAL GLOBAL AND SEGMENTAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS, MILD (9% OF GLOMERULI},
MOST LIKELY SECONDARY TO FUNCTIONAL ADAPTATIONS FROM NEPHRON LOSS
- TUBULAR ATROPHY AND INTERSTITIAL FIBROSIS, MILD (10—15% OF CORTEX)
~ ARTERIAL AND ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS, MODERATE

{SEE NOTE)

PAPILLARY ADENOMA (0.1 cm)

NOTE:
Mild chronic changes are present in the kidney parenchyma, not including the

loss of nephrons from cyst and tumor-related compression. Because these
changes are a result of functional adaptations to nephron loss from any
glomerular, tubular, interstitial, vascular, or mass~replacing process, a
similar degree of chronic damage would be expected in the contralateral kidney.

Incidental note is made of a papillary adenoma.

The kidney parenchyma has been reviewed b_ Renal P51310109?

Service.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
Sections of formalin—fixed, paraffin—embedded tissue (block A6) were evaluated

using HE, PAS, Jones silver methenamine, and AFOG (trichrome) stains.

The sample consists of cortex and medulla. There are 157 glomeruli present
away from the cyst wall, of which 12 are globally sclerosed and 2 are
segmentally sclerosed. Extensive glomerulosclerosis is present adjacent to the
cyst wall; the parenchyma in this area also shows compression—related changes
and entrapped tubules, vessels with smooth muscle hypertrophy, and glomeruli.
The remaining glomeruli show no significant expansion of the mesangial areas.

There are no discernible craters or spikes, but a few double contours of the
glomerular capillary wall basement membranes are seen. Approximately 10—15% of
the cortical parenchyma shows tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis.
Arteries and arterioles exhibit a moderate degree of sclerosis.

METAPHASES COUNTED: 10 ANALYZED: 7 SCORED: 3 BANDING: GTG

INTERPRETATION:
All metaphases contained clonal aberrations including loss of the short arm of
chromosome 3, which is a characteristic finding in renal cell carcinoma, clear

cell type.

COMMENTS:
Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the

standard methods employed. Chromosome analysis was performed at a level of 400
bands or greater.
