CLINICAL HISTORY: "'"m
Cervical cancer and breast cancer.

GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. "True cut breast biopsy", AFl. Frozen tissue remnant labeled AFl submitted
in toto in block A1.

B. "Cervical tumor", tissue fragment labeled BFl in submitted in toto in block
Bl. A 4.2 x 3 x 2.3 cm aggregate of tan tissue containing multiple edematous

papillary structures. Representative sections are submitted in blocks 82 and

B3. A representative sample of the specimen is placed in a tea bag for gross

photography.

C. "Right breast and axillary nodes", received unfixed and placed in
formalin. A sample of fresh tissue has been sent for ER/PR. A 580 gm,

28.4 x 15.3 x 3.9 cm modified radical mastectomy specimen containing a 22.0 x
15.3 x 3.9 cm breast with an 8.5 x 5.8 x 2 cm axillary tail, and a 2 cm nipple
within a 5.5 cm areola. The specimen is remarkable for a 4.1 x 2.6 x 4 cm

white hard mass located Within the upper inner portion of the breast 1.1 cm
from the inked deep margin and 1.7'cm“f235 the skin surface. The axillary
tail contains multiple firm matted lymph nodes within the proximal mid and
distal portions, the largest measuring 3.5 x 1.4 x 1 cm. The breast also
contains a soft pale pink 5 x 1.2 x 1.5 cm. The axillary tail is removed and

dissected for lymph nodes.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

C1—C2 — tumor with soft tissue margins.

C3—C4 — random soft tissue margins

C5—C7 - tumor

C8—C9 - unremarkable breast tissue

Clo—C11 - representative sections of skin

C12 — section of areola

C13 — section of nipple

C14 — one bisected lymph node candidate from the proximal axillary lymph

C15 — three lymph node candidates from the proximal axillary lymph nodes
C16 - six lymph node candidates from the mid axillary lymph nodes

C17 — one bisected lymph node candidate from mid axillary lymph nodes

C18 — two lymph node candidates from the distal axillary lymph nodes

C19 — one bisected lymph node candidate from the distal portion of axillary

COMMENT: The lesion displays in—situ form of cancer that architecturally
resembles the papillary transitional cell cancer, grade 1, commonly seen in
the bladder. In multiple areas, the base of the epithelium is cut on a bais,
so that it cannot be determined whether the few cells seen in the superficial
stroma are artifactual or the earliest form of microinvasion. While such a
lesion, if seen7in‘tHEmBIEHHEETMﬁoﬁId“BeWcaIIEd‘low grade, t ere is no
recorded experience with such a neoplasm in the cervix.

Dr. has reviewed the slides of the cervical tumor and concurs with the
diagnosis.
