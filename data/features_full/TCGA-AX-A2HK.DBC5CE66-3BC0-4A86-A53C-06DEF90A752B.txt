0.9 cm), right fallopian tube (6.0 cm long x 0.8 cm in diameter), left ovary (2,0.x
1.5 x 1.0 cm) and left fallopian tube (4.0 cm long x 0.7 cm in diameter). The ‘ ‘ .
ectocervix is distorted, irregular (3.8 x 2.0 cm)_with a brown-gray dull mucosa. The -;-
external as is slit—like, 2.0 cm in diameter. The endocervical canal is a.o emulong
and is covered by a shaggy mucosal surface. The endometrial cavity. 2.5 cm from-cornu .
to cornu, 4.5 cm long contains a 4.0 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm heaped friable tan polypoid tumorﬂ«~
mass arising from the anterior endomyometrium and appears to extend into the lower A;

uterine segment. There is a 1.8 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm tan, well-circumscribed nodule ah'tﬁo ': 3

surfaces in the anterior myometrium ranging from 0.5 to 0.6 cm in diameter.
