Specimen
#1 Pleural peel
#2 Level 7 lymph node
#3 10R lymph node
#4 Right upper lobe with superior segment of lower lobe with stitch
marking upper lobe, freeze for margins
#5 Level 2R lymph node
#6 4R lymph node

Gross Examination

#1 Labeled pleural peel is a 6.5 x 5.5 x up to 1.5 cm aggregate of multiple
irregular fragments of pink-tan to gray glistening fibrous soft tissue. The
tissue ranges from 0.1 cm up to 0.6 cm thick. There is a small amount of
attached tan—yellow adipose tissue. Six representative sections submitted in
three: "A"—"C".

#2 Labeled level 7 lymph node is a 2.2 x 1.7 x up to 0.4 cm aggregate of four
irregular fragments of dark red to tan soft tissue, entirely submitted in one
cassette.

#3 Labeled level 10R lymph node is a 1.3 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm ovoid portion of dark

ﬂay soft tissue, bisected, and entirely submitted in one cassette.

#4 Received fresh designated right upper lobe, superior segment of lower lobe,
is one complex lobectomy specimen measuring 16.0 x 8.0 x 3.5 cm. There is a
palpable mass present that is well defined with a tan cut surface and measuring
2.7 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. The mass crosses the interlobar fissure and is 1.5 cm from
the nearest bronchial margin, which is shaved as Frozen Section A. There is a
2.0 white pleural plaque in the apex, remote from the tumor. Representative
sections of submitted for permanent section per the block summary. Block

summary: "A", hilar nodes; " " essels; "C,D", tumor with pleura; "E,F",
tumor; "G", pleural plaque.

#5 Labeled level 2R lymph node is a 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm aggregate of multiple

irregular fragments of gray—tan soft tissue and tan—yellow fibroadipose tissue.
The tissue is entirely submitted in two: "A", "B".

#6 Labeled 4R lymph node is a 3.0 x 2.5 x up to 0.8 cm aggregate of multiple

irregular fragments of dark gray-tan soft tissue and tan-yellow fibroadi ose
tissue. The tissue is entirely submitted in three: "A"—"C". —>
