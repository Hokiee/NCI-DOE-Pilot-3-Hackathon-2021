Frozen Diagnosis
Report : GROSS EXAMINATION.

A. The specimen is received in a container labeled with the
name of the patient and labeled as lung tissue, right. The
specimen consists of a great tan rubbery irregular piece of
tissue which measures 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm. The specimen is
bisected and totally submitted.

B. The specimen is received in a container labeled with the
name of the patient and labeled as lung, right upper lobe.
The specimen consists of a lobe of lung which measures 14.5
x 11.5 x 3.5 cm. The bronchial margins are submitted in
block one. Near the bronchial margins is an anthracotic
lymph node which is submitted in block two. The serosal‘
surface is pink tan with anthracotic stippling. Sectioning
through the specimen reveals pink to red brown crepitant
lung tissue. Located 1.5 cm from the bronchial margins is a
gray tan nodular lesion which measures 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm.
The tumor approaches to within 0.7 cm of the pleural
surface. No other areas of lesion are grossly identified.
Sections of tumor are submitted in block's three through six
and a section of lung tissue distance from the area of
lesion is submitt ' block seven. A portion of this tumor
is submitted for

C. The specimen is received in a container labeled with the
name of the patient and labeled as lymph node station eight,
paraesophageal. The specimen consists of a gray tan to
black anthracotic lymph node which measures 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.3
cm. The specimen is bisected in totally submitted.

D. The specimen is received in a container labeled with the
name of the patient and labeled as lymph node, station 4R,
lower paratracheal. The specimen cons1sts of two tan

fragments of rubbery tissue measuring in aggre te 1.2 x 0.6
x 0. 3 cm. The specimen is totally submitted. gt

 

DIAGNOSIS BASED ON GROSS AND MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

A. Right pulmonary lymph node (excisional biopsy):
Metastatic papillary adenocarcinoma.
[T— C4000 M— 81406 196. 9 P3- 44050]

B. LUNG resection.

SPECIMEN TYPE: Lobectomy.

LATERALITY: Right.

TUMOR SITE: Upper lobe.

TUMOR SIZE: 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm

HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Adenocarcinoma, predominately papillary
variant.

HISTOLOGIC GRADE: GZ: Moderately differentiated.

PRIMARY TUMOR (PT): pT2: Tumor greater than 3 cm in greatest
dimension.

REGIONAL LYMPH NODES (PN): pN2: Metastases in ipsilateral
mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes.

Metastatic adenocarcinoma in one right pulmonary lymph node
(specimen A, one peribronchial lymph node), and one of two
lower paratracheal lymph nodes at station 8 (specimen D)/
DISTANT METASTASIS: pMX: Cannot be assessed.

MARGINS: Bronchial margin is involved by invasive carcinoma
with papillary adenocarcinoma extensively involving
lymphatics of submucosa and bronchial wall.

DIRECT EXTENSION OF TUMOR: None identified.

VENOUS (LARGE VESSEL) INVASION (V): Absent.

ARTERIAL (LARGE VESSEL) INVASION: Absent.

LYMPHATIC (SMALL VESSEL) INVASION (L): Present and extensive.

ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: None.
[T~ZBOOO M—81403 162.9 P3—44090]

C. Paraesophageal lymph node at station 8 (excisional
biopsy): One lymph node negative for tumor.
[TuC4000 M-09470 V71.1 P3— —44050]

D. Right lower paratracheal lymph node at station 8
(excision): Metastatic papillary adenocarcinoma in one of
two lymph nodes.

[T-C4000 M—80006 196.9 P3—44070]

Intradepartmental consultation was obtained.

Pathologic stage: pTZNZMXGZ.
