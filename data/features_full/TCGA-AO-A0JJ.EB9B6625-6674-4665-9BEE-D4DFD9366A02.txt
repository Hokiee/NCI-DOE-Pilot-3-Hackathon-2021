5) The specimen is received fresh labeled, "Left breast, stitch marked
axillary tail" and consists of a breast with attached axillary tail. The
breast measures 35.5 x 24.0 x 3.8 cm with overlying skin ellipse measuring
13.5 x 7.5 cm. situated centrally on the skin surface is an unremarkable
nipple measuring 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm and areola measuring 3.9 x 3.9 cm. The
skin shows a linear scar measuring 8.0 cm, situated vertically near the
nipple. A suture demarcates the axillary tail which measures 4.5 x 3.5 x
3.5 cm. Sectioning the breast reveals a biopsy cavity, measuring 4.2 x 3.5
x 4.0 cm with a fibrotic area superior to the cavity. One ill-defined tan
mass is present, measuring 4.5 x 4.5 x 2.7 cm, loceted lateral to the nipple
in U09 and 3.5 cm from the deep surgical margin. The remaining breast
tissue shows unremarkable intermingling of fatty and fibrotic areas. The
axillary tissue is dissected to reveal one lymph node, measuring 1.1 x 0.5 x
0.5 cm. Representative sections are submitted. A portion of tumor is
submitted to
