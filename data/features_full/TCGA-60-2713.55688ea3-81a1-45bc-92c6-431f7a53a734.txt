NOTE: Immunoperoxidase stains are performed on this tumor tissue sections. The carcinoma is
negative for synaptophysin, chromogranin A, and CD56. The histomorphology (focal squamous
differentiation) and the immunophenotype (including the previously report stains,

-) are in support of squamous cell carcinoma subtype.
