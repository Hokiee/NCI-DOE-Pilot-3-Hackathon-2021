2. ”Lou pereesophegeel left lymh node F5” Received fresh in e small
container is a lynph node, 1.1 cm, bisected.

Frozen section control.

3. ”Thoracic esophagus" Received in s small container is a 7.2 cm segment of
distal esophagus with an attached 7.0 x 4.0' x 3.5 cm stomach. Attached to the
distal portion of the stomach is a 4.8 cm segment of bowel, stapled at the-
margin. The GE junction is remarkable for a 3.1 x 2.3 cm fungeting lesion
extending 1.6 cm to involve the esophagus, and 2.8 cm to involve the stomach,
it is tan-red and centrally ulcerated. The mass extending to within 6.0 cm of
the esophageal margin. and 7.8 cm of the bowel margin. The surface
corresponding this area is inked black. Sectioning of the mass reveals
ill-defined. tan-white cut surfaces grossly abutting the msculsris, with a
minus thickness of 1.9' cm. The remaining esophageal moss is pink-tan
grossly unremarkable with an internal circueference of 4.5 cm and .e wall
thickness of 1.0 cm. The gastric mucosa is tan, with grossly unremarkable
rugel folds. At the junction of the onastomosis betueen the bowel and the
stomach is, e 0.8 x 0.5 cm full-thickness defect. The bouel moose is
redvbroun, hemorrhagic. Attached adipose tissue has ten possible lymph nodes
ranging from 0 .Z to 0.8 cm. 3A. honor to esophageal moose.
