PART #1: FS: 4R LYMPH NODE
Resident Pathologist:

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:
Staff Pathologist:
Other Pathologists / PAS:

4R Lymph Node: Twelve (12) fragments of lymphoid tissue, negative for
tumor on representative frozen sections.

Dictated by:

The s ecimen is received fresh labeled with the patient's name,’

and designated “4R lymph node". It consists of twelve (12) '
pieces of pale tan white pink fragmented soft tissue measuring in
aggregate approximately from 0.1 to 0.2 cm x 0.1 x 0.2 cm. The
specimen is submitted in its entirety.

SUMMARY OF SECTIONS:

PART #2: 9—L LYMPH NODE
Resident Pathologist:

Dictated by:

The specimen is received fresh, labeled Md designated
as 9L lymph node. The specimen consists of one piece of pale tan,

red—brown soft tissue, measuring approximately 2.2 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm.

Approximately 50% of this specimen is submitted for possible future
studies and 50% is submitted for histology.

PART #3: L—10 LYMPH NODE
Resident Pathologist:

Dictated by:

The specimen is received fresh, labeled "and designated
as level 10 lymph node. The specimen consists of 3 pieces of
red—tan-brown soft tissue, measuring 2.2 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm. Three
possible lymph nodes are identified, after serial sectioning. The
largest possible lymph node is serially sectioned to reveal a pale tan
cut surface. 25% of this is submitted for possible future studies and
75% of the specimen is submitted for histology.

SUMMARY OF SECTIONS:
1 — A - 1 (1/2 LARGEST LYMPH NODE)

Resident Pathologist:

Dictated by:

The specimen is received fresh, labeled‘ and designated
as station 7. The specimen consists of one piece of red—tan-brown soft

tissue. measuring approximately 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm. The tissue

representative possible lymph nodes. 50% of it is submitted for future
possible studies, and 50% of it is submitted for histology.

PART #5: LEFT LOWER LOBE
Resident Pathologist:

Dictated by:

The specimen is received fresh, labeled ”and designated
left lower lobe. The specimen consists of a 14.5 x 0.0 x 3.5 cm piece
of pale pink, tan soft tissue that grossly is identifiable is a lobe
of lung. The specimen weighes 152 grams. The specimen is perfused with
formalin and the pleural surfaces are inked black. The specimen
contains one staple line, measuring approximately 2 cm and one
vascular margin that is stapled, that measures approximately 2.5 cm.
The bronchial margins, vascular margins and the staple margins are
removed and submitted. Serial sectioning through the specimen reveals
a pale tan firm, pink colored lesion, that measures approximately 7.0
x 6.5 x 3.5 cm. This lesions appears to be approximately 3 mm from the
nearest pleural surface. Approximately 8 possible lymph nodes ar
identified, and representative sections are submitted.
