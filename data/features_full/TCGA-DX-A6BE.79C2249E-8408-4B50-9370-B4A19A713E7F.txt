SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Patient:

 

clinical Diagnosis 8 History:
Retroperitoneel mass, likely sarcoma.

Specimens Submitted:

1: Radical resection left retroperitoneal 1e£t radical nephrectomy and lett
adrenalectomy

2: Spleen

DIAGNOSIS:
1. Retroperitoneum, left kidney and adrenal gland, mass, radical resection
with left nephrectomy and adrenalectomy:
— Deditferentieted Liposarcoma, in a background of well—ditterentiated
liposercoma.
- The tumor measures 21.0 cm in greatest dimension.
- The dedizﬂerentiated component is a high grade spindle cell sarcoma.
- Well-ditferentietad Liposarcoma, lipoma-like and eclerosing type.

— Well-diﬂterentiated Liposercoma component extends to the renal
capsule but does not involve the renal psrenchyma.

— Adrenal gland is uninvolved.

— Resection margins are uninvolved.

2. Spleen, spelenectomy:
- Spleen (152 gm) with no significant pathologic changes.

I ATTBST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

tan/yellow well-circumscribed mass within the adipose tissue measuring in
aggregate 42 x 29 x 8.5 cm. The kidney measures 12 x 5 x 2.5 cm. The
attached ureter measures 7.0 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. The ureter
is not grossly associated with the mass. The attached renal vein measures
1.5 cm in length and 0.8 cm in diameter. The renal vessels and ureter
margins are grossly unremarkable. An adrenal gland is identified measuring
3.0 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm. There are multiple, well-circumscribed, tan/yellow
masses measuring 21 x 10 x 6.5 cm in aggregate. The mass grossly does not
infiltrate into the kidney. The mass is serially sectioned, revealing a
partially tan/yellow myxoid cut-surface with other areas having a tan/white
soft to firm cut-surface. The mass is enveloped by a thin fibrous tissue.
Representative sections of the different areas of the mass are submitted for
TPS and culture. Specimen photographs are taken. Representative sections are
submitted.

 

Summary of sections:

2). The specimen is received in formalin labeled, 'Spleen' and consists of
a splenectomy specimen weighing 152 g and measuring 12.5 x 6.5 x 2.5 Cm. The
splenic capsule is gray tan slightly nodular and glistening. Hilar area is
markedly hemorrhagic and disrupted containing areas of blood clot. Hilar
lymph nodes are grossly not identified. The specimen sectioned to reveal a
glistening fleshy beefy red cut surface. Representative section submitted.

Summary of sections:
H-hilum (containing possible hilar vessels and nodes)
U-undesignated sectioning of the splenic parenchyma and capsule
