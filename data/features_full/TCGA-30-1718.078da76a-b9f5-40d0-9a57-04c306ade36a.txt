‘O.R. CONSULTATION:
SPECIMEN LABELED "#2 OMENTAL TUMOR" (FSA):

Papillary serous carcinoma.
GROSS DESCRIPTION: .
The specimen is received fresh in eight parts, each labeled with the patient's

name and unit number.

Part one, "rectus muscle", consists of a fragment of red/tan soft tissue {1.8 x
1.2 x 1.0 cm) . The specimen is entirely submitted for special studies to

Part two, "omental tumor", consists of a fragment of adipose tissue which is
extensive involved by confluent white/tan firm tissue. Representative sections
are submitted as FSA and special studies and tissue bank. Omental tumor is
oriented. Representative sections are submitted.

Micro sections: IEEA—3D-17E8
Micro 1: frozen section A remnant.

Micro 2—5: representative sections of omentum tumor, 4 frags,-

Part three, "tumor from edge of gallbladder", consists of a fragment of
white/yellow/tan soft tissue (6.0 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm). The soft tissue is
uncriented and representative sections of this soft tissue are submitted.

Micro 6~7: tumor from edge of gallbladder, 3 frags, -

Part four, "tumor from transverse colon", consists of a fragment of
white/yellow/tan soft tissue (8.0 x 8.0 x 1.2 cm). The specimen is unoriented
and representative sections are submitted.

Micro 8—9: tumor from transverse colon, 2 frags,-

Part five, "right tube & ovary", consists of an ovary (1.0 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm) and
a fallopian tube (5.0 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter). The fallopian tube
is patent and has fimbriated end. The gross exam of fallopian

tube is unremarkable. The ovary has a smooth, white surface and is sectioned
at approximately 3 mm intervals revealing white/yellow/tan resection surface
with no hemorrhage or necrotic areas or nodules.

Micro 10: representative sections of the ovary, 2 frags,- -

Micro 11: representative sections of right falIOpian tube, 3 frags

Part six, "left tube & ovary", consists of an ovary (3.8 x 2.2 x 1.8 cm) and a
fallopian tube (4.5 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter). The fallopian tube
is patent and has a fimbriated end. The gross exam of fallopian tube is
unremarkable. The left ovary has a smooth white surface and is sectioned at
approximately 0.3 cm interval revealing white/tan yellow resection surface
with multiple lobulated cystic lesions which are filled with clear fluid.

Micro 12—13: left ovary, 3 frags,_
Micro 14: left fallopian tube, 3 frags,-

Part seven, "uterus & cervix", consists of a 10'? gm uterus (11 x 7.5 x 3.0 cm) .
The exocervix (4 x 3.5 cm) is covered by smooth glistening white mucosa. The
external os is slit and measures 2.0 cm. The endocervical canal (2.5 cm) has a
tan herringbone mucosa. The endometrial cavity (2.5 cm from cornu to cornu,
3.7 cm in length) has a tan/pink endometrium (0.4 cm in average thickness).

The myometrium measures 2.2 cm in maximum thickness. The serosa is smooth and

glistening .

Micro 1647.- posterior cervix, 2 frags, -.

Micro 18: anterior lower uterine segment, 1 frag,-
Micro 19: posterior lower uterine segment, 1 frag,
Micro 20: anterior endometrium, 1 frag,

Micro 21: posterior endometrium, 1 frag

Part eight, "tumor from bladder", consists of an unoriented red/pink/white soft
tissue (8 x 5 x 0.9 cm).

Both sides of the soft tissue of irregular shaped and
with multiple possible adhesions. Representative sections of the mass are
submitted.

Micro 22—24: representative sections of tumor from bladder, 6 frags, I.
