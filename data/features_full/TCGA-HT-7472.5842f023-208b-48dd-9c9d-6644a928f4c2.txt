Addendum Discussion:

The calculated MIB-l Labeling Index overall appears low with focal regions increased at
4.9%. Overall, the histologic features of this tumor are consistent with a low grade
oligodendroglioma; however, the MIB-l Labeling index is borderline for a low grade
oligodendroglioma (<5%; WHO, - Close followup for recurrence and/or anaplastic
progression may be warranted.

Brain Tumor, Biopsy and Resection:

Oligodendroglioma (Who grade II)

MIB-l Labeling Index = 4.9%

Microscopic Description:

1,2 Sections of gray and white matter demonstrate a diffusely infiltrating glioma. The
tumor is mildly to moderately hypercellular. It is composed of cells with round to

somewhat irregular nuclei and scant processes. Most have pernicuclear halos. Only a rare
mitotic figure is seen. No microvascular proliferation or necrosis is present.
