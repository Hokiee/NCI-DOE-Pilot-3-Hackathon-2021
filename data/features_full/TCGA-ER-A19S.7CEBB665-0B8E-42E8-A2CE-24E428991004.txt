COMMENT:

#1. There is no evidence of malignancy.

#2. This diagnosis is supported by interpretation of immunoperoxidase stains (S100 and Melon-A).

#3. These changes are not diagnostic but suggestive of regression. if this is a site of prior biopsy. then the changes
could be explained as “peri-cicatricial melanocyﬁo hyperpiasia". This diagnosis is supported by interpretation of
immunoperoxldase stains (S100, and Meian-A).
