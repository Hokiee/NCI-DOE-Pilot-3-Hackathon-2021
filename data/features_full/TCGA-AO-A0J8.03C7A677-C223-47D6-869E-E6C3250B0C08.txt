DIAGNOSIS :
Summary of findings in this case:

Invasive lobular carcinoma spans 2.2 cm and does not involve the separately
submitted margins.

Sentinel lymph nodes: 1/2.

Non-sentinel lymph nodes: 0

Total lymph nodes: 1/2.

Type of metastasis: ITC

1. LYMPH NODE SENTINEL #1, LEVEL 1, RIGHT AXILLA; EXCISION:

— ONE BENIGN LYMPH NUDE (0/1).

~ADDITIONIL H/E STAINED SECTIONS AND IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINS FOR
CYTOKERATINS (AE1:AE3) SHOW NO EVIDENCE OF NETASTATIC TUMOR.

2. LYMPH NUDE. SENTINEL #2 LEVEL I RIGHT AXILLA; EXCISION:

- RARE CYTOKERATIN-POSITIVE CELLS (ABOUT 10 CELLS) ARE PRESENT IN 1 OF
1 LYMPH NODE(S). THESE CELLS ARE NOT IDENTIFIED ON THE CORRESPONDING H/E
STAINED SECTIONS OR IN THE FROZEN SECTION SLIDE OR IN THE FROZEN SECTION
CONTROL SLIDE.

Comment: Controls are satisfactory. m PATHWAY anti-HER-z/neu is an
FDA-approved rabbit monoclonal primary antibody (clone 435) directed against
the internal domain of the c-eth—Z oncoprotein (HERZ) for
immunohistochemical detection of HERZ protein overexpression in breast
cancer tissue routinely processed for histologic evaluation. The HERZ test
results are reported in accordance with the ASCO/CAP guideline
recommendations for HRRZ testing in breast cancer (J clin Oncol 2007;
25(1):118-145).

l) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation labeled
"sentinel node #1, level 1, right axilla" and consists of a single lymph
node measuring 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph node is bisected and
entirely submitted for frozen section consultation.

Summary of sections:
FSC-frozen section control

2) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation labeled
"Sentinel node #2, level 1, right axilla' and consists of a single lymph
node measuring 1.9 cm in greatest dimension, which is bisected and entirely
submitted for frozen section consultation.

sunmary of sections:
FSC-frozen section control

3) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right breast tissue" and
consists of an unoriented, 7.2 x 5.5 x 3.3 cm, piece of fibrofatty breast
tissue with a needle localization wire. The company specimen radiograph
displays the needle localization wire in place and a Bar-clip located at
coordinates: F,G-5,6. The specimen is entirely inked black. Serial
sectioning reveals the Bar-clip situated within a 2.3 x 2.3 x 2.1 cm, poorly
defined, lobular bordered, fatty infiltrating, pink-white mass with fine
tan-yellow reticulations, located 0.1 cm from the closest inked resection
margin. Partially surrounding the mass is a 4.8 x 4.1 x 3.0 on area of
moderately dense, focally nodular, tan-white fibrous tissue which is
separated by scant lobules of yellow-orange adipose. A representative
section of the tumor is submitted to TPS. Representative sections are
submitted for permanent.

summary of sections:

MT - tumor and closest tissue edge
FPT -- full face of tumor

T - tumor

Rs -- representative sections

4) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Medial margin, right breast" and
consists of a piece of fibrofatty breast tissue measuring 3.8 x 2.1 cm, and
1.0 cm thick. A clip marks the new margin of excision, which is inked black.
The tissue is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:

and consists of a piece of fibrofatty breast tissue measuring 3.0 x 2.5 cm,
and 1.0 cm thick. A clip marks the new margin of excision, which is inked
black. The tissue is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
SS - sequential sections

6) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Inferior margin, right breast“
and consists of a piece of fibrofatty breast tissue measuring 2.8 x 1.7 cm,
and 0.8 cm thick. A clip marks the new margin of excision, which is inked
black. The tissue is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
SS - sequential sections

7) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Lateral margin, right breast"
and consists of a piece of fibrofatty breast tissue measuring 5.1 x 2.1 cm,
and 1.3 cm thick. A clip marks the new margin of excision, which is inked
black. The tissue is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
SS - sequential sections

8) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Posterior margin, right breast"
and consists of a piece of fibrofatty breast tissue measuring 2.3 x 1.7 cm,
and 0.5 cm thick. A clip marks the new margin of excision, which is inked
black. The tissue is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.
