Diagnosis:

Block A shows an invasive adenocarcinoma of the colon (cecal carcinoma G3), with a marked
tendency toward infiltration into the adjoining fatty connective tissue and vascular infiltration
(G3, pT3, L1, V1), while Block B shows an additional polyp, here of tubular adenoma type with
focal severe dysplasia and transition to a circumscribed adenocarcinoma with infiltration of the
submucosa (here G2, pT1), with regard to the resection margins these are free resection margins,
orally of the ileum type and distally of the colon type, as well as - with regard to the
circumferential margin - free fatty connective tissue and - with regard to the lymph nodes - free
lymph nodes (0 to 17).

Tumor classiﬁcation:

ICDO-DA M 8140/3

G3 — pT3 L1, v1, (1st tumor)

G2 — pT1 L0, V0, (polypoid lesion)

Free lymph nodes (0 of 17), free resection margins, locally R0
