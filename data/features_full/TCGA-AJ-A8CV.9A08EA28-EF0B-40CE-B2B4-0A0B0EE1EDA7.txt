pink tan to slightly violaceous mucosa. The uterine serosa is

smooth and tan brown. The endocervical canal is tan and corrugated.
The endometn'al cavity is 3.5 cm in width and 3.5 cm in length and
gives rise to a 4.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm exophytic friable tan white

tumor. The tumor does not grossly involve the low uterine segment.
On section. the tumor extends approximately 0.7 cm into the
myometrium where the myometrium is 1.7 cm thick.

The right adnexa consists of a 4.5 cm long x 0.3 cm diameter
previously fallopian tube attached to the mesovarium of a 2.4 x 1.2

x 1 .1 cm smooth ten white ovary. On section the ovarian strorna‘ is
homogeneously yellow tan. The left adnexa consists of a 4.4 cm long
x 0.5 cm diameter fallopian tube attached to the mesovarium of a 2.3
x 1.0 x 1.0 cm smooth yellow tan ovary. The ovarian stroma is
homogeneously yellow tan. Separate in the container there is a 0.9
x 0.7 x 0.5 cm encapsulated yellow tan nodule. 0n section the
nodule is centrally ascitic. Representative sections are submitted

for genomic studies in two cassettes labeled '

Representative sections of the remaining tissue are submitted in
cassettes labeled ‘ ‘ as follows: A - representative anterior
cervix, B - representative posterior cervix, C - representative
