Gross Qescrigtlon:

A. Part A is designated as peritoneal biopsy. initially received in the fresh state for frozen section
evaluation is a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm red-tan noduiar piece of soft tissue. The specimen is bisected and one
half is submitted for frozen section evaluation. The residual frozen tissue is submitted in A1 for permanent
sections and the remaining half is submitted in A2 for routine histology. -

53. Part B is designated as umbilical biopsy. initially received in the fresh state for frozen section
evaluation is a tubular and tattered portion of fatty soft tissue measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. Sectioning
reveals a red-tan nodule, 1.7 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. One half of the nodule is submitted for frozen section
evaluation. The residual frozen tissue is submitted in at for permanent sections and the remaining half of
the nodule including attached fat is submitted in 82 for routine histology. -

C. Part C is designated as liver biopsy. Received in formalin is an irregular fragment of deep tan-brown

Sectioning through the stapled proximal margin of resection reveals tan pancreatic parenchyma without
gross tumor involvement. Upon sectioning transversely, reveals a well-demarcated tumor mass, grossly 1.8
cm from the pancreatic surgical margin and measuring upwards of 8.0 x 4.3 x 3.5 cm. The tumor mass is
dense, light gray and demonstrates obvious involvement into the peripanoreatic soft tissue within 0.2 cm

of the anterior and posterior radial surfaces. The apparent adrenal gland is slightly distorted. measures
upwards of 4.0 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm. and is partially encased and involved by tumor grossly (011012). The
remaining length of the pancreas is grossly involved with tumor with the likely distal end of the tail

A smaller piece of attached stomach is 4.3 x 1.3 x 0.6 cm, deep red—tan and is incised to reveal
prominently wrinkled, deep tan mucosa without gross tumor involvement (013); A larger wedge-like piece
of stomach is 5.9 x 2.0 cm and is red-tan with eubmucosai tumor involvement {016). The grossly involved
area is greater than 1.0 cm away from the stapled surgical margin. The tumor grossly invades the hilar fat
up to the Spleen and encasing the spienic vessels. The spleen is 8.? x 7.6 x 3.3 cm with a glistening. deep
purple-tan intact capsule. The spleen is serially sectioned revealing deep red parenchyma without discrete
nodularity or grossly invasive tumor component. Lymph nodes searched within the hilar region and

superior penpancreatic fat is hindered by tumor replacement. Representative sections are submitted for
microscopic evaluation.

FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

microscopic evaluation in E1 and 52 with additional representation of the fat in E:-

Microscopic Description:

A. Sections of the peritoneal biopsy show peritoneum with attached skeletal muscle partially involved by
metastatic adenocarcinoma forming irregular glands with surrounding desmoplastic stroma. No
lymphovascular invasion is identiﬁed.

B. Sections of the umbilical nodule show adenocarcinoma involving ﬁbroadipose tissue. The tumor is at
the cauterized edge of the fragment. No lymphovascular invasion is identiﬁed.

C. Sections of the liver biopsy show a subcapsular focus of metastatic adenocerclnoma. A portion of
benign liver tissue is present. No lymphovascular invasion is identiﬁed.

D. Sections of the pancreaticosplenectomy show an invasive adenocarcinoma involving the tail of the
pancreas. The tumor forms irregular small glands with a surrounding desmoplastlc stroma. There is a
minor cord and single cell pattern. The nuclei are enlarged with prominent nucleoli and there is
cytoplasmic mucin. Penneural invasion is present and there is a focus suspicious for lymphovascular
invasion. There are some dilated pancreatic ducts with severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ. The
invasive tumor invades into the surrounding penpancreatic soft tissue with involvement of the left adrenal
gland and ﬁbrovascular bundle of the splenic hilum without direct invasion into the splenic parenchyma.
The larger wedge of attached stomach has tumor invading through the well up to the mucosa. It cannot
be determined if this focus is due to direct extension or metastatic spread. A single benign peripancreatic
lymph node is present. The pancreatic margin is uninvolved.

E. Sections show mesenteric tissue with foci of adenocarcinoma composed of irregular small glands
surrounded by desmoplastic stroma. No lymphovascular invasion is identiﬁed.
