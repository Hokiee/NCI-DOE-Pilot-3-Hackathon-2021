FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
SEGMENT 0F TERMINAL ILEUM AND RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY .—
A. INVASIVE WELL-DIFFERENTIATED COLON ADENOCARCINOMA
a. 0.9 CM INVASIVE TUMOR INTO SUB-MUCOSA
b. INVASIVE CARCINOMA ARISING IN A 2.5 OM GREATEST DIMENSION TUBULOVILLOUS ADENOMA
WITH SERRATED FEATURES.
ADDITIONAL NON-INVASIVE ADENOMAS: 2 TUBULOVILLOUS ADENDMAS (2.9 CM AND 1.5 GM) AND 1
TUBULAR ADENOMA (1.0 CM).
RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA AND ADENOMA.
No ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IS SEEN.
SIxTEEN' BENIGN LYMPH NODES (0118).
PATHOLOGIC STAGE; T1 N0 MX.
TERMINAL ILEUM WITH No SIGNIFICANT PATHOLOGIC CHANGE.
APPENDIX WITH TUBULAR CARGINOID TUMOR.
a. TUBULAR CARCINOID ARISES IN THE APPENDIX TIP.
b. TUBULAR CARCINOID MEASURES 3MM.

- C. (seecomment).

COMMENT:

Immunohistochemical stains were performed on the appendix (Slide I3). Appendix tumor cells are weakly positive for
glucagon and positive for CDXZ, mCEA, pancytbkeratin, and synaptophysin. It to negative for estrogen receptor,
progesterone receptor, chromogranin , and [353. These findings are compatible with a tubular carcinoid.

SPECIAL PROCEDURES:
MicrodiSSection Genotyping

Intergretation
Molecular Anatomic Pathology testing for Microsatelllte Instability:

A. No microsatollite instability detected (Microsatellite stable)

B. Immunohistochemistry for the hMLH1, 'hMSHP. and hMSHt-i Showed preserved gene expression

Note:

The Specimen WEIS Analyzed by PCR for microsatellite instability because the patient met one or more of the recently
recommendod criteria‘for‘ testing (1). The five ecommended dinucleotide and mononucleotide polymorphioms were utilized to
assess for microsatellite Instability (MSI). ZERO Of five markers Showed evidence of microsatollito instability.

Additionally, the immunohistochemistry for hMLHl, hMSH; and hMSHB demonstrated preserved nuclear staining in the neoplastic
