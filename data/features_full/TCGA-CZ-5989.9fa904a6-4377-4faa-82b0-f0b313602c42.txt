 

PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:

A. RIGHT KIDNEY, REDICAL NEPHRECTOMY
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, clear cell type, Fuhrman nuclear grade II/IV (9.0 cm).
Tumor is located in the upper pole and limited to kidney.
No lymphovascular invasion is present.
The vascular and ureteral margins are negative for tumor.

The non-neoplastic kidney will be evaluated by Renal Pathology, and the
findings will be reported in an addendum.

B. RIGHT REGIONAL NODES:
One (1) lymph node, negative for tumor.

AJCC Classification (6th Edition): T2 No Mx

CLINICAL DATA:

History: None given.

Operation: Right radical nephrectomy.
Operative Findings: None given.
Clinical Diagnosis: Right renal mass.

TISSUE SUBMITTED:
A/1. Right kidney -
B/2. Right regional nodes.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh, in two parts, each labeled with the patient's

name and unit number.

Part A, "#1. Rt kidney“, consists of a 549 gram radical nephrectomy specimen,
comprised of right kidney (15.0 x 8.5 x 8.0 cm), with contiguous 7.0 cm ureter
(diameter is 0.7 cm), 2.1 cm renal artery (diameter 0.6 cm), and 1.2 cm renal
vein (diameter 1.8 cm). Specimen has been previously inked and sectioned,
revealing a 9.0 x 8.0 x 8.0 cm well—circumscribed tan/yellow to tan/red
irregular, encapsulated mass, which is located in the upper pole and abuts the
renal capsule as well as the inked surgical margin. Mass is 11.2 cm from the
ureteral margin, 2.8 cm from the renal artery margin and 0.6 cm from the renal
vein margin. Representative mass has been previously sent for cytogenetics,
quick fix and tissue bank. Representative normal renal parenchyma has been
sent to tissue bank, EM, IF. Mass occupies at least 60% of the renal
parenchyma, the remaining of which is unremarkable. Corticomedullary junctions
are distinct. Urothelium is tan/white and unremarkable. Gerota's fascia is
not seen grossly. Adrenal gland is not identified within the specimen.

Micro A1: Artery, ureter, vein margins, 3 frais, -

Micro A2: Tumor, quick fix section, 1 frag,

Micro A3-A4: Tumor and renal capsule, black - in e margin, 4 frags
total,

Micro A5: Tumor and adjacent renal vein, 2 frags, RSS.

Micro A6: Tumor with respect to uninvolved renal parenchyma, 1 frag,
RSS.

Micro A7: Uninvolved renal parenchyma, 1 frag, -

Part B, "#2. Rt regional lymph node", consists of 1.4 cm lymph node, bisected

 

 

 

 

 

ADDENDUM #1

RENAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION OF KIDNEY PARENCHYMA:
RIGHT KIDNEY, NEPHRECTOMY:
MINIMAL CHRONIC CHANGES OF THE KIDNEY PARENCHYMA (SEE NOTE)

ARTERIAL AND ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS, MILD (SEE NOTE)

NOTE :

The kidney parenchyma shows minimal chronic changes, within the expected range
for a sixty year-old man. There is isolated focal global glomerulosclerosis
(0.77% of glomeruli) and minimal tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis
(less than 5% of the parenchyma). The arteries and arterioles show a mild
degree of vascular Sclerosis.

PatEoIogist.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin—embedded tissue (block A7) were evaluated
using H&E, PAS, - silver methenamine, and AFOG (trichrome) stains.

The sample consists of cortex and medulla. There are 129 glomeruli present, of
which one (0.77%) is globally sclerosed. The glomeruli show no significant
pathologic changes. There are only isolated irregularities of the glomerular
capillary wall basement membranes. Rare distal tubules contain PAS-positive
hyaline casts. Less than 5% of the cortical parenchyma shows tubular atrophy
and interstitial fibrosis. Arteries and arterioles exhibit a mild degree of
subintimal sclerosis.

 

 

KARYOTYPE: 46,XY,ins(2;3) (q33;p13p23) [5]

METAPHASES COUNTED: S ANALYZED: 5 SCORED: 0 BANDING:

INTERPRETATION:

All five metaphases contained an insertion between chromosomes 2 and 3.
Rearrangements involving chromosome 3p are common findings in clear cell
carcinoma.

COMMENTS:
Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the

GTG

standard methods employed. Chromosome analysis was performed at a level of 400

bands or greater.

INDICATION FOR TEST:
RCC; Kidney tumor
