POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
right renal mass

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
Received fresh is a 112.3 g, 5.8 x 5.3 x 4.7 cm partial nephrectomy
specime displaying moderate amounts of attached peinephric fat. The
renal resection margin is tan-red and scabrous. The capsular margin
is tan—white and smooth. The renal resection margin is inked blue,
and the capsular margin is inked black. The specimen is serially
sectioned to reveal a 5.2 x 3.9 x 3.5 cm, tan~yellow to red, to
orange, variegated, well—circumscribed mass that is 0.3 cm from the
renal resection margin, and less than 0.1 cm from the capsular
resection margin. Grossly the mass is confined to the renal capsule.
The rim of uninvolved renal parenchyma is tan—brown and unremarkable.
Sectioning through the attached fat does not reveal any obvious lymph
nodes. No adrenal gland is identified.

Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1—5- mass to renal
resection margin; 6-8- mass to capsule resection margin.
