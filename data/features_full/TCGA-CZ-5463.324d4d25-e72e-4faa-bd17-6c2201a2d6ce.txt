PATIENT I

Cytogel’lbuicicc:

KARYOTYPE: Tl:42,X,-Y,-3,-8,-l4[5] T3 :42,-Y,-3,-8,~14[5}

METAPHASES COUNTED: 10 ANALYZED: 10 SCORED: 0 BANDING: GTG
INTERPRETATION:

Three different specimens from this tumor were received.

All metaphases from specimens labeled T1 and T3 contained clonal aberrations
including monosomy for chromosome 3, which is a typical finding in renal cell
carcinoma, clear cell type.

COMMENTS:
Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the

standard methods employed. Chromosome analysis was performed at a level of 400
bands or greater.

No metaphases were available from specimen T2, therefore the cytogenetic
analysis could not be performed.

INDICATION FOR TEST:
? RCC; Kidney Tumor #1—#3
