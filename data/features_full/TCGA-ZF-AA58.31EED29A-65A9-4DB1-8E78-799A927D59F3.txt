CLINICAL DETAILS

Muscle invasive bladder cancer. Cystectomy. Specimen is bladder, ovaries,

uterus. Palpable right obturator nodes ? mets.

MACROSCOPY

l - Specimen comprises bladder, uterus, both tubes and ovaries. Bladder

measures 95 mm supero-inferiorly x 65 mm medio—lateral and 30 mm anterior-

posterior. On opening, the bladder shows a grey/white ulcerated tumour on

posterior and right lateral walls measuring 25 mm x 20 mm x 10 mm. The tumour

is seen inﬁltrating into the muscle.

Uterus 60 mm supero-inferiorly x 35 mm medic-lateral and 50 mm anterior-

posterior. On slicing, it is unremarkable. Right tube 35 x 4 mm, right ovary

20 x 8 mm. Left tube 45 x 3 mm, left ovary 18 x 10 mm.

2 - Fatty piece of tissue measuring 40 x 22 x 10 mm, containing two lymph nodes,

the larger measures 15 mm.

3 - Fatty piece of tissue measuring 40 x 20 x 10 mm. Slicing shows multiple

nodes, the largest 15 mm diameter.

4 - Fatty piece of tissue measuring 70 x 35 x 20 mm. Multiple lymph nodes

identiﬁed, the largest is probably an involved node measuring 25 mm.

5 — Tubular piece of tissue measuring 7 x 6 mm.

MICROSCOPY
1 - This bladder shows a Grade 3, poorly differentiated transitional cell
carcinoma. The tumour is solid with no papillary areas and is composed of PW 7,35

pleomorphic cells. It inﬁltrates into the muscularis propria and focally

through it into the fat (pT3a). The background epithelium shows squamous 0 5“ SW
metaplasia, but no dysplasia or carcinoma-in-situ is identiﬁed. There is no
vascular invasion. The urethral and right ureteric resection margins do not

show any evidence of malignancy. The cervix is unremarkable. The endometrium
shows cystic atrophy. The myometrium, both tubes and ovaries are unremarkable.
No evidence of metastatic tumour is identiﬁed.

2 - One out of two lymph nodes shows metastatic transitional cell carcinoma.

3 - Three lymph nodes without metastatic deposits identiﬁed.

4 - One out of six lymph nodes shows metastatic transitional cell carcinoma.

5 - The right ureteric margin does not show any evidence of malignancy.
SUMMARY

Cystectomy - transitional cell carcinoma G3 pT3a, N2.
