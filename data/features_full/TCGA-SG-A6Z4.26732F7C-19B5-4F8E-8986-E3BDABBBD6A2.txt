GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. Received in formalin is an unoriented segment of bone with attached soft
tissue measuring 22 x 12 x 9.5 cm. The bone measures 22 cm in length x 3.2
cm in greatest diameter. The bone has been previously cut with a bone saw
longitudinally. Situated within the soft tissue on top of the bone is a
mass measuring 11 x 6 x 5 cm. The mass has a yellow firm cut surface with
areas of cystic and necrotic degeneration (approximately 30%). The soft
tissue margin overlying the mass (anterior) is 0.6 cm from the tumor, and
is inked in black. The mass is situated 4.5 cm from the proximal line of
resection and 6.5 cm from the distal line of resection. The mass is greater
than 1.8cm from the lateral margins. The mass closely approximates but does
not appear to involve the underlying bone. Representative sections are
submitted as follows: A1—A3 mass with nearest soft tissue line of
resection, A4—A7 representative sections of tumor, A8 tumor with nearest
underlying bone following decalcification, AB-Alo proximal line of
resection following decalcification, A11~A12 distal line of resection
following decalcification.
