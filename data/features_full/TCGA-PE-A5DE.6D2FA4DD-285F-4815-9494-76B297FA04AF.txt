1: Sentinel Nodes—left axilla Cit.) 6/ I

2: left breast lumpectomy

3: Margin-ﬁnal medial

Gross Description:
Received in three parts.
Source of Tissue: l. Labeled # l, "sentinel node left axilla"

Touch Preparation Evaluation: lTP- NO TUMOR SEEN PER
(VERIFIED).

Gross Description: Received fresh for intraoperative consultation/ touch

impression in a container labeled "sentinel node left axilla". It consists of a tan to light
brown rubbery lymph node measuring 1.6 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm. There is a stitch at one end
marking the bluest portion. The node is sectioned. Touch impression of the bluest

end was submitted as lTPA and the tissue is subsequently submitted in l A.

Touch impression of the opposite end was submitted as 1 TPB and

subsequently the tissue is submitted in 1 B.

Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled # 2, "left breast lumpectomy"

Gross Description: Received ﬂesh in a container labeled "left breast lumpectomy". It
consists of a 7.4 x 7 .4 x 3.5 cm ovoid rubbery fragment of ﬁbroadipose tissue. There is a
short stitch marking the superior and a long marking the lateral. The anterior is
inked blue and the remaining margins are inked black. The specimen is

sectioned disclosing a large ﬁrm tan lesion with moderately deﬁned

borders measuring 3.8 x 2.6 x 1.9 cm. The lesion occupies an appreciable

amount of the lumpectomy specimen. Laterally in the tumor there is

inspissated blood consistent with previous biopsy site changes. The

lesion comes very close to the medial, superior, and anterior resection

margins. Also adjacently the breast parenchyma is ﬁbrous and there is a

0.4 cm blue dome cyst noted. Representative sections are submitted in

2A-K.

 

Designation of Sections: 2A-ZC- breast tissue with tumor in relationship

to anterior margin, 2D‘2F- breast tissue with tumor in relationship to

posterior margin, 2G- additional sections of tumor, no margins are

represented with biopsy site, 2H~ perpendicular sections of superior

resection margin, 21- perpendicular sections of medial resection margin

[Notez specimen 3 presumably supercedes this margin], 2]— perpendicular

sections of inferior margin, ZK- perpendicular sections of lateral margin

Source of Tissue: 3. Labeled # 3, "ﬁnal medial margin"

Gross Description: Received fresh in a container labeled " ﬁnal medial margin". It
consists of a fragment of ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. There is a
stitch marking the ﬁnal margin which is inked black prior to sectioning.

Sections disclose no obvious residual lesional tissue. Entirely submitted

in 3A and 33.

*****************************************$******************************
Final Diagnosis:

1. Sentinel lymph node, left axilla, excision:

— One lymph node with no tumor seen (0/ l).

- Negative immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin AEl/AE3.

2. Left breast, lumpectomy:

Invasive and in situ lobular carcinoma

- Invasive lobular carcinoma, 3.8 cm in greatest dimension grossly, grade
II-III.

- Lobular carcinoma in situ, nuclear grade ll-III, comprising
approximately 5% of the tumor mass.

- Lymphovascular invasion is not identiﬁed.

- Invasive carcinoma is less than 1m to the inked closest medial margin
(see specimen 3 for ﬁnal medial margin status), and remaining margins
with no tumor seen.

- Changes consistent with prior biopsy site seen.

- Non-neoplastic breast tissue shows ﬁbrocystic changes with
microcalciﬁcations.

3. Left breast, ﬁnal medial margin, excision:

- Benign breast tissue, no tumor seen.

Note: Case reviewed with who concurs with the
diagnosis.
