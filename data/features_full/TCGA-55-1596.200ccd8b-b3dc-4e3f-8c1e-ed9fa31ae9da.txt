ee== GROSS DESCRIPTION: ====================

A. Received in_formalin are three irregular. partially cauterized fragments
of tan—brown possible lymphoid tissue, ranging from 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm to 1.0
x.0.7 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.

B. Received in formalin is a 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm black-brown lymph node. The
specimen is bisected. On sectioning, the cut surface is dark black and
friable. The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.

C. Received in formalin are multiple irregular fragments of black-brown to
yellow-tan soft tissue, ranging from 0.1 cm in greatest dimension to 1.0 x 0.5
x 0.3 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.

D. Received in formalin is a black—brown irregular lymph node. measuring 1.5
x 1.0 x 0.3 cm. On sectioning, the cut surface is gray—black and friable. The
specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.

E/EPC. The specimen is received in formalin and consists of a single lobe_of
lung. weighing 212 grams and measuring 15 x 14 x 14 cm in overall dimensions.
The hilar region consists of two portions of bronchus. measuring 1.5 cm in
length x 1.0 cm in diameter and 0.5 cm in length x 1.0 cm in diameter. There
is also a 0.5 cm portion of vessel {the hilum). The structures are surrounded
by six gray—black lymph nodes, ranging from 0.5 cm to 1.5 cm in greatest
dimension. There are also two stapled resection margins at the hilum.
measuring 7.5 cm in length and 2.0 cm in length; .The stapled margins are
trimmed and inked green.‘ The hilar region is inked black. The pleural
surface is purple—black with moderate anthracotic pigmentation. The surface
is smooth with the exception of the 0.5 cm area of puckering on the lateral
aspect. The pleural surface in this area is inked black. On sectioning.
there is a well—circumscribed mass adjacent to the puckered area which
measures 5 x 5 x 4.5 cm. The cut surface of the mass is yellow—tan soft and .
‘gritty-with anthracotic pigmentation. The borders of the mass are.rounded,
serpiginous. The mass involves 40% of the cut surface and comes to within 1.0
cm of the vascular resection margin, 1.5 cm from the stapled resection margin,.
and 1.8 cm from the bronchial resection margin. The mass surrounds vascular
and bronchial structures. On sectioning through the bronchus. the vessels are
yellow-tan and smooth. There is no obvious involvement of the bronchial and
vascular structures by the aforementioned mass. The mass abuts the inked
pleural surface. The remainder of the specimen consists of mildly crepitant
pink-red parenchyma. There is minimal anthracotic pigmentation. 0n
sectioning, scattered gray-black intraparenchymal lymph nodes are identified
(cassette 8). No additional masses or lesions are identified. Representative'
sections are submitted in ten cassettes as follows: cassette 1 - bronchial
and vascular margins: cassette 2 - mass and portion of bronchus; cassette 3 -
mass with vessel; cassette 4 — mass with inked pleural surface; cassette 5 -
mass with surrounding uninvolved parenchyma; cassettes 6 through 8 —
uninvolved parenchyma w1th’the stapled resection margin in cassette 6:

F. Received in formalin is a 0.8 x 0 5 x 0.3 cm -irregular gray-black lymph
node. On sectioning, the cut surface is friable. The specimen is entirely

==== DESCRIPTION: =======e==ew==

A. One slide is evaluated, demonstrating fragments of a lymph_node with
extensive anthracosis (O/l). There is no evidenCe of malignancy.

8. One slide is evaluated, demonstrating fragments of five lymph nodes with
extensive anthracosis (0/5)u There is no evidence of malignancy.

C. One slide is evaluated, demonstrating fragments of four lymph nodes With
extensive anthracosis (0/4). There is no evidence of malignancy. In
addition, there is a fragment of normal—appearing skeletal muscle present.

0. One slide is evaluated demonstrating a bisected lymph node with extensive
areas of anthracosis (0/1). There is no evidence of malignancy.

E/EPC. Ten slides are evaluated showing sections from a lobe of lung with
evidence of a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma carcinoma, which
measures 5.0 x 5.0 x 4.5 cm. The tumor shows diffuse areas of gland formation
with prominent tumor necrosis, with evidence of lymphovascular Space
invasion. The vascular and bronchial margins are free of tumbr. and the
lesion is present approximately 1.0 mm beneath the inked pleural surface
(slide E4). The surrounding lung parenChyma shows emphysematous_changes with
areas of congestion. In addition. two intraparenchymal lymph nodes are
evaluated with no evidence of malignancy. However. evaluation of six hilar
lymph nodes demonstrates evidence of metastatic carcinoma in one of_ the six
lymph nodes evaluated.

F. One slide -is evaluated, demonstrating fragments of two lymph nodes with
'v a eas of anthracosis (0/2) There is no evidence of malignancy.
