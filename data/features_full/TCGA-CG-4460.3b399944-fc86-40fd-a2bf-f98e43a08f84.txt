Diagnosis:

Total gastrectomy preparation with an ulcerated gastric carcinoma located on the side of the
greater curvature, extending to within a maximum of 7 cm of the oral resection margin and
with a maximum diameter of 16 cm encompassing the corpus segment of the stomach in an
almost circular growth, with a prominent exophytic component characterized histologically as
a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (gastric carcinoma of the intestinal type).
Invasive tumor spread within all the parietal layers of the stomach extending into the adjacent
subserous fatty tissue and encroaching on the peritoneal side of the atrophic gastritis (type A).
Antrum mucosa with discrete non-ï¬‚orid chronic gastritis and foveolar hyperplasia. No
evidence of Helicobacter pylori.

Oral and aboral resection margin and also greater omentum and diaphragm in the section
levels presented are tumor-free.

After acetone clarification 33 lymph nodes measuring up to 1.5 cm in the perigastric fatty
tissue are prepared.

Of these, two show metastatic infiltrates of the previously diagnosed adenocarcinoma or
gastric carcinoma.

In conclusion and in summary, taking into account the infiltration of the diaphragm and with
the correction of the data given in the first set of findings, the following stage is arrived at:
