Diagnosis

1. Prostate: poorly differentiated bilateral adenocarcinoma of the prostate across the organ,
mainly in the peripheral zone (Gleason 4+5=9 with minimal Gleason 3 portion; Gleason 4:
approx. 90%, Gleason 5: 5%, Gleason 3: <5%). Maximum tumor diameter 33 mm. Tumor
involves approx. 80% of total gland. Tumor inﬁltration of right basai periprostatic fatty
tissue (inﬁltration front 1 mm wide, 0.5mm deep). Extensive bilateral seminal vesicle
involvement. Extensive perineum] tumor inﬁltration. Tumor contact with the color-labeled
surgical resection margin in the left anterior region on a block level (contact line 1.5 mm;
Gleason pattern 4 here). Lymph vessel invasion by the tumor in places.

Additional foci of a prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (high-grade PIN) and signs of
myoglandular prostatic hyperplasia. Urothelium of prostatic urethra without dysplasia.

2. Right external iymph nodes: a lymph node with a 1.2 cm carcinoma metastasis.

Three turnor»ii'ee lymph nodes (1/4).

3. Right obdurator fossa: a tumor—free lymph node (0/1).

4. Right internal lymph nodes: tumor—free fatty tissue resection materiai with a tumor—free
microscopic lymph node (0/ i).

5. Left external lymph nodes: two tumor—free lymph nodes (0/2).

6. Lymph nodes of left obdnrator fossa: two lymph node carcinoma metastases

measuring up to 3.5 cm and extending over the capsule (2/2).

7. Left internai lymph nodes: tumor—free fatty tissue with tumor—free parts of a
microscopic lymph node (0/1).

 

Tumor classiﬁcation

pT3b, maximum tumor diameter 33 mm. Tumor involving approx. 80% of the total prostate,
Gleason 4+5=9 with minimal Gleason 3 portions (Gleason 4: approx. 90%, Gleason 5: 5%,
Gleason 3: <5%), L1, R1, le (3/11)

Remark

In the prior punch biopsies carcinoma tissue was obtained at all sampling sites with an overail
Gleason pattern of 4+3=7 with tertiary grade 5. This prostatectomy preparation thus shows an
overall pattern of 4+5=9 with small Gleason 3 portions on the basis of the larger Gleason 5
portion, as described above.

Follow-up report
1mmtmohistochemistry: 2x CD240 and CD3i (BR4, BL2).

The reported immunohistochemical investigation of the adenocarcinoma of the prostate showed
lymph vessel invasion. There was no evidence of blood vessel invasion.

Final tumor classiﬁcation:

pT3b, maximum tumor diameter 3.3 cm, tumor invoives 80% of the prostate in total, Gleason
446:9 minimal Gleason 3 tumor (Gleason 4: 90%, Gleason S: 5%, Gleason 3: < 5%), Li, V0,
le (3/11), Rl.
