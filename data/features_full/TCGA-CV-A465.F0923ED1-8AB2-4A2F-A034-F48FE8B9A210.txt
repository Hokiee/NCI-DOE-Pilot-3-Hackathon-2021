(B) RIGHT PARTIAL GLOSSECTOMY — An elliptical portion of mucosa and underlying soft tissue (3.4 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm) is oriented
with a long stitch for anterior and a short stitch for floor of mouth. The mucosa is disrupted by an ulcer (1.0 x 0.8 cm) centrally
corresponding to a tumor which fills the majority of the specimen (2.8 x 1.1 x 1.3 cm deep). Grossly the tumor extends to within 2
mm of the deep soft tissue near the anterior floor of mouth on this specimen.

serially sectioned; J4. one possible lymph node. serially sectioned; J5. one possible lymph node, serially sectioned; J6,
representative section of gland.

(K) RIGHT NECK DISSECTION. LEVEL II — Received is a 4.3 x 4.2 x 1.0 cm aggregate of fibroadipose tissue. The tissue is
dissected to reveal sixteen possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm - 2.5 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm.
