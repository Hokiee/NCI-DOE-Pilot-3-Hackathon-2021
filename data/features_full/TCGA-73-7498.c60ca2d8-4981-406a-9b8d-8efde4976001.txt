DIAGNOSIS:
A. LYMPH NODE, RIGHT PARATRACHEAL — 4R, EXCISION:
- NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED IN ONE LYMPH NODE (0/1).

B. LYMPH NODE, LEVEL 7, EXCISION:
- NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED IN ONE LYMPH NODE (0/1).

C. LUNG, RIGHT LOWER LOBE, WEDGE RESECTION:

- ADENOCARCINOMA, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED WITH BRONCHIOLOALVEOLAR
FEATURES

- 2.5 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION

- 1.8 X 1.0 CM IN ADDITIONAL DIMENSIONS

- THE PLEURAL SURFACE IS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR

- NO ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IDENTIFIED

- MILD EMPHYSEMATOUS CHANGES

D. LYMPH NODE, LEVEL 8, EXCISION:
- NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED IN ONE LYMPH NODE (0/1).

E. LYMPH NODE, LEVEL 9, EXCISION:
- NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED IN ONE LYMPH NODE (0/1).

F. LUNG, RIGHT LOWER LOBE, COMPLETION LOBECTOMY:

- SEPARATE MICROSCOPIC FOCUS OF ADENOCARCINOMA, BRONCHIOLOALVEOLAR TYPE
- 0.9 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION (MEASURED MICROSCOPICALLY)

- THE PLEURAL SURFACE IS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

- THE BRONCHIAL MARGIN IS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

- NO ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IDENTIFIED

- PLEURAL PLAQUE

- NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED IN TWO LYMPH NODES (0/2).

- MILD EMPHYSEMATOUS CHANGES

COMMENT: Two tumors are identified. The tumor in part C was identified grossly, and the tumor in part
F was only identified microscopically. These tumors are consistent with synchronous rimary tumors,
and the tumor in part C will be used for the synoptic report. This case was shown to and he agrees.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. 4R RIGHT PARATRACHEAL LYMPH NODE
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "4R right paratracheal lymph
node" is a fragment of tan-pink to anthracotic soft tissue measuring 1 x 0.5 and 0.2-cm. Specimen is
bisected. Touch preparation performed. Submitted entirely for frozen section, FSA.

B. LEVEL 7 LYMPH NODE

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "level 7 lymph node" is a
fragment of tan-pink soft tissue measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. Specimen is bisected. Touch
preparation performed. Submitted entirely for frozen section, FSB.

C. RIGHT LOWER LOBE WEDGE

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "right lower lobe wedge" is a
stapled wedge of lung tissue weighing 15 g and measuring 6.5 x 3 x 2 cm. The pleural surface inked
black, staple line inked blue. Sectioning shows a firm ill-defined tan mass measuring 2.5 x 1.8 x 1 cm,
located 0.5-cm from the stapled margin. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement.
The specimen representatively submitted:

FSCf: Mass, frozen section sample

C2: Remainder of mass and pleural surface

C3: Uninvolved lung parenchyma

D. LEVEL 8 LYMPH NODE
Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and designated "level 8 lymph node" is a
fragment of yellow-tan soft tissue measuring 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted, D1.

E. LEVEL 9 LYMPH NODE
Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and designated "level 9 lymph node" is a
fragment of red-tan soft tissue measuring 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted, E1 .

F. RIGHT LOWER LOBE
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "right lower lobe" it the resected
lobectomy specimen weighing 182 g and measuring 13.5 x 11 x 3 cm. The pleural surface

TSS:-

demonstrates two 0.3-cm plaque like areas, both located approximately 4-cm from the bronchial margin.
