Macroscopy

Fresh: adrenal gland with a weight of 22 grams and dimensions of 7 x 4 x 2 cm. The adrenal gland is

completely encapsulated. At one place a spherical lesion of 3.5 cm. A fragment of the tumor is frozen.
Also normal adrenal fragment is frozen.

Cassette 1-2: 2 number of sections of the tumor.

Cassette 3: normal adrenal.

Partially 3b.

Microscopy

Intersected trough lesion with on the edge pro-existing adrenal tissue.

The lesion is moderately sharply deﬁned by a pseudo-capsule and exists partly from groups. partly
trabecular located moderately polymorphic cells with occasional zellballen and areas of hemorrhage.
The cells have round oval nuclei with a ﬁne chromatin pattern and prominent nucleolus surrounded by
what large granular basophilic cytoplasm. Also a spread of highly polymorphic regions of cells with
large hyperchromatic. irregular nuclei with little cytoplasm. No striking mitotic activity, no necrosis. No
growth in the peri-adrenal fat. Local suspected vascular invasion. intersected by normal adrenal
showing mild hepatic architecture and construction.

Conclusion

Laparoscopic right adrenalectomy: pheochromocytoma.
Resection borders free.
