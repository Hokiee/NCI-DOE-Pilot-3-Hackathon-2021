Received in formalin and labeledqevel 10 lymph node are 5 pieces of
anthracotic and tan soft tissue ranging in Size cm .6 to 1.8cm. The largest piece is bisected
and contains 2 possible lymph nodes measuring 0.8 and 1.30111. Specimen is submitted in toto as
follows: -

Cl: 3 possible lymph nodes

C2: 2 bisected lymph nodes
D. LEVEL 7 LYMPH NODE
Received in formalin and labele level 7 lymph node are 4 pieces of mottled
black and pink- tan soft tissue, ranging in size from 0. 9 to 2. 7cm. The largest lymph node is
bisected and has a central tan— —gray coloration. with the cortical region having a black— tan
coloration. Specimen is submitted in toto as-follows:

D1 : 2 lymph nodes

D2: an aggregate of multiple lymph nodes

D3: large bisected lymph node
E. LEFT LUNG r
Received fresh for tissue procurement and'iabeled as left lung is a 405gm left lung measuring
21x15x5.80m with attached bronchus measuring 3.0 cm in length 1.50m in diameter. A ﬁrm
subpleural, central mass is palpable with unremarkable overlying pleura. This pieural surface is
inked black. Cut section shows a yellow—tan necrotic mass measuring 4.5x3.0x2.50m. Sectioning
through the bronchial tree shows the tumor invading the bronchus at 1.50m from the bronchial
margin. This mass is seen involving both upper and lower lobes of the lung. The bronchial
margin is shaved and submitted for frozen section. An enlarged lymph node is seen adjacent to
the bronchus and the mass It measures 2. 7x2. 1x0. 50m and has a necrotic tan-black discoloration
and appears to be partially replaced by tumor. On further sectioning, approximately 2. 3cm from
this lymph node, a 2nd lymph node 13 seen measuring 1.70m in greatest dimensmn. It has a black
and tan dlscoloration. The remainder of the lung shows dark red congested parenchyma with no
additional lesions. Representative sections are submitted as follows.

FSBl: shaved bronchial margin

E2-E7: mass and bronchi from the lower lobe of lung

E8-E9: unremarkable lower lobe of lung

E10: lymph nodes from lower lobe of lung

Ell-E15: mass and bronchi item the upper lobe of lung

E1 6-El 8: lymph nodes from upper lobe of lung

E19—E21 : remainder of Viable appearing mass

E22-E23: unremarkable upper lobe of lung

F. LEVEL 5 & 6 LYMPH NOD
Received in formalin and labels vol 5 lymph node is a piece of yellow-tan
soft tissue measuring 3.0xl .7X0. . nd contains 2 lymph nodes measuring 1.4

and 1.50m. Central region of the lymph node has a red~black coloration with the periphery
having a yellow—tan coloration. Specimen is submitted in toto in blocks F1-F2.
G. LEVEL 9 LYMPH NODE

Received in formalin and labels-evel 9 lymph node are tWO pieces of pink—tan
soft tissue measuring 1.2 and 1.70m in greatest dimension. The larger specimen is bisected and

Iontains a lymph node which is 0.50m in length. Specimen is submitted in toto in block Gt.
