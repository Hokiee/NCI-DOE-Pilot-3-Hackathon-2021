********** Addendum - Please See End of Report **********
Reason for Addendum #1: Additional studies/stains/opinion(s)
DIAGNOSIS:

A. BRAIN, LEFT PARIETAL, CORE BIOPSY:
- Involved by glioma, part of a glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV)

B. SKULL, SURGICAL HARDWARE REMOVAL:
- Expianted hardware (plates, screws)
- Dense ﬁbrous connective tissue with reactive changes, bone dust and organizing
hematoma '

C. BRAIN, LEFT PARIETAL, EXCISIONAL BIOPSY:
- Glioblastoma multlforme, WHOgrade IV

COMMENT: ' ' ‘

A high percentage of tumor ceils (greater than 20% immunostainin for MGMT has been reported to be associated
with a relatively diminished response to Temodar # Hence, the low 5% result in
this case suggests a likelihood of this tumor being responsrve to emo ar. x

Recent studies have shown that co-expression of EGFRvIII and PTEN as'detected by immunostainini was

si niﬁcantl correlated with a clinicai response of glioblastomas to EGFR kinase inhibitors
h Hence the loss of PTEN in this case suggests a diminished probabiiity of response to
EGFR-itinase inhibitors.

Retained expression of PTEN was found to be associated with a more favorable prognosis in patients with high
grade giiomas

Recent studies indicated an adverse prognostic signiﬁcance of increased expression of laminin beta 1 and decreased
expression of iaminin beta 2 predicting a worse survival of patients with gliomas.

between laminin-S and glial tumor grade, recurrence, and patient survivai.

Accordingly, elevated expression of beta 1 and suppressed expression of beta 2 in this tumor predict more
aggressive behavior.

Presence of activated (phosphoryiated) {342/44 Nitrogen-Activated Protein Kinase (pMAPK) has been shown to be
associated with a reiative resistance of giioblastoma multiforme to radiation therapy.
