Thymoma, predominately epithelioid, with microscopic extension beyond 63> M115

capsule.

Maximum tumor dimension is 6 cm.

Tumor comes to within 0.5 mm of resection margin focally but is not identified

at inked margin.

No lymphovascular channel invasion identified.

This case material was reviewed by the pathologist of record and represents the

diagnosis of the staff pathologist.

Gross Description:

Received fresh and subsequently submitted in formalin, after obtaining a portion
for tissue procurement, is an 11 x 8 x 2 cm and 91 g piece of fatty tissue.

There is a palpable 6 x 4 x 2 cm mass. The lesion is bisected to reveal a

tan-pink fleshy mass weighing 51 g. The mass appears to be encapsulated. The
fatty tissue is palpated and step-sectioned to reveal no other masses. Sample
sections of the mass and surrounding capsule, as well as a sample of the

apparently normal fatty tissue are submitted in cassettes 1—8.

Microscopic Description:

A microscopic examination of the thymic mass reveals confluent nests of
neoplastic cells with mildly pleomorphic nuclei with open chromatin and small
nucleoli. A variable amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm is present, and some tumor
cells appear slightly spindled. Small lymphocytes are interspersed among the
nests of tumor. The tumor is surrounded by a fibrous capsule, but microscopic
extension of the tumor through the capsule is identified. Mitotic figures are

not readily identiﬁed. Foci of necrotic material with cholesterol clefts are

present. At the periphery there is unremarkable fibrofatty tissue with benign
thymic remnants. The tumor comes to within 0.5 mm of the surgical margin focally

but is not present at the inked margin.
