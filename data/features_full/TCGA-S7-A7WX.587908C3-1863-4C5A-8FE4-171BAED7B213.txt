Gross:

Right adrenal with ovoid ﬁbrously encapsulated tumor (60x50x38 mm, 55 g). On cut, grey-
pink tumor with soft consistency. Adrenal cortex remnants with pressure atrophy are seen
subcapsularly on periphery.

Micro:

Solid, diffusively growing pheochromocytoma consisting from large polygonal cells with
focal hemorrhages. On periphery, adrenal cortex remnants were conﬁrmed
histopathologically. Focally, they are completely eroded. In examined excisions, no invasion
behind the capsule was found.

Imunohistochemic examination:

Staining with $100 protein conﬁrmed sustentacular cells in a tumor part, some tumor parts
showed negative staing for 8100 protein. Proliferation acitivty (MIB-l) was minimal — less
than 1% ‘
