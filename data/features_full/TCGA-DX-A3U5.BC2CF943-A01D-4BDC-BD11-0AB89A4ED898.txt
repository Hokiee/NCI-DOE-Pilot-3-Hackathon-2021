DIAGNOSIS:
l. Retroperitoneal mass and portion of right colon, radical resection and
right hemicolectomy:

— Deditterentiated Liposarcoma arising in background of
well-differentiated liposarcoma.

- The tumor measures 10.6 cm in greatest dimension.

- Dediffsrentiated component is high—grade spindle cell sarcoma.

- Separate nodules of well-differentiated liposercoma (largest nodule -
1.5 cm).

- The tumor shows loci of necrosis (40% a! tumor).

- Well-difterentiated liposarcoma component extends to the resection
margin.

- Foci suspicious for vascular invasion.

— Benign portion of terminal ileum, appendix and colon.

1). The specimen is received fresh labeled llradical resection 0! right
retroperitoneal sarcoma with right hemicolectomy', and consists of a 10.6 x
9.8 x 9.4 cm, encapsulated, soft tissue mass with an attached portion of
right colectomy specimen including a 3 cm in length 3.5 cm in circumference
segment of ileum. 7 x 0.5 cm appendix and a 12.5 cm in length and 7.5 cm in
maximum circumference colon. Grossly there is no direct tumor extension to
the bowel. The mucosa surface a! the ileum and colon is tan red and
uninvolved by the tumor. The outer surface of sott tissue mass is inked in
black. Serial sectioning reveals a tan—yellow pink. soft. smooth and
glistening cut surface with multifocal necrosis (necrosis is approximately
40% of the tumor). TPS is performed and photograph is taken.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Summary of sections:

T — tumor (cassettes 6 to 10 are tumor with capsular margin)
TB - tumor towards bowel (consecutive sections in 2 cassettes)
PM - proximal ileum margin

Du - distal colonic margin

AP - appendix

M - representative mucosa

L - lymph node, bisected
