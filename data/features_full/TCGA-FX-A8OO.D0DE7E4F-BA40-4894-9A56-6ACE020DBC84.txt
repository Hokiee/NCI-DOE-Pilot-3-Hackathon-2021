COMMENTS:

The background morphology is of a monophasic spinﬁle cell type of synovlal sarcoma. Approximately 75% of the tumor shows hypercellularity. increased
nuclear atypia, greater than 2 mitotic figures per hpf, and patchy round cell features consistent with a poorly differentiated type of synovial sarcoma.

Immunohlstochemlcal stains show that the tumor cells are positive for 3612 and C099. Only rare cells stain for EMA. The cells are negative for AE1 f3.

GROSS DESCRH’TION:

 

Received in a container of fom'xalin labeled right pleural tumor with and block chest wall, is a 16.0 x 19.0 x 7.8 cm chest wall resection
consisting of an i813 ,x 16.5 x 5.5 cm portion of lung with ﬁve attached ribs- ranging from 9.8 cm long by i .2 cm in width to 1 9.8 cm long by 1 .7 cm in
width. The anterior rib surfaces are inked blue. The lung gives rise to a focal pleural defect with an underlying, ill deﬁned, 15.2 x 12.3 x 5.0 cm shaggy,
orange-tan tumor. The identiﬁable pleural surfaces surrounding the tumor are inked black. At one aspect of the lung. there is a 13.0 cm long stapled
resection margin. The staples are removed and the underlying parenchyma is inked blue. On section, tumor extends to within 1.0 cm of the nearest lung
