CLINICAL INFORMATION
Right testicular mass

SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPTION

A) SOURCE: Right testicle and cord

The specimen is received fresh labeled "right testicle and cord." It

consists of a 46 gram. 5.9 x 3.6 x 3.1 cm testicle with attached 15.5 cm of
spermatic cord. The specimen is inked. The spermatic cord is serially
sectioned. No areas of suspicion are appreciated. Representative sections
of the margin and additional random are sampled.

The tunica vaginalis is opened. It is not adherent to the white smooth
tunica albuginea. The epididymis measures 5.5 x 1 x 0.5 cm.

The testicle is opened. There is a 4.9 x 3.4 x 3 cm Iobulated mass that
occupies the majority of the testicular parenchyma. Approximately 75% of
the mass has a ﬁrm tan—white appearance. The remainder of the mass has a
tan, markedly soft cut surface. Within these soft areas are multiple

ﬁbrous strands. A representative section of each area is submitted for
frozen.

INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: "Seminoma -

additional se ' ing to rule out additional germ cell elements" ls
rendered b

The mass extends up to but not through the tunica albuginea. It extends up
to but does not appear to involve the rete testis.

The remaining testicular parenchyma is pink and slightly lobulated. The
seminiferous tubules do not string with ease.

The epididymis is sectioned. The majority of the cut surfaces are pink.
There is a 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm area of orange discoloration in the head.

Representative sections are submitted in 14 cassettes labeled:

1. Frozen section residue

2. Spermatic cord margin

3. Tissue adjacent to spermatic cord margin

4. Additional random spermatic cord

5-6. Testicular mass in head of epididymis, includes entire head of
epididymis

7-8 Mass and rete testis

9-14. Additional sections of mass (cassette 14 also includes area of
uninvolved testicle parenchyma)
