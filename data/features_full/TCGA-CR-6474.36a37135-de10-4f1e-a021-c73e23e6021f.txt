SPECIMEN EDGE; INVASION OF LYMPHATIC VESSELS AND NERVES IS PRESENT;
NEGATIVE FOR FIXATION OF VOCAL CORDS; TWO OF THIRTEEN (2/13) LYMPH NODES
INVOLVED BY SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA; (SEE COMMENT).

SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA, 2.5 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION (SEE COMMENT).

17-19) SOFT TISSUE, ORAL CAVITY, BIOPSY: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.
COMMENT: The tumor lesion in the pyriform sinus corresponds to AJCC stage

IVA (pT 2, N2b, MX). Assuming the tumor in the base of the tongue
represents a separate lesion, it corresponds to AJCC stage II (pT 2).

Although the lesion in specimen 9 is noted to extend to an inked edge, the
final surgical margins of resection, represented separately, are negative
for malignancy.

9) SOURCE: Larynx, Pharynx, Thyroid, Level 6 Nodes

Received fresh labeled, "larynx, pharynx, thyroid, level 6 lymph nodes," is
a 9.0 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm laryngeal specimen. The specimen is inked as follows:
left-blue, right-black. After inking the specimen, the anterior larynx is
opened to reveal all structures described. Within the specimen, there is a
5.5 x 3.4 x 2.5 cm left pharynx. The epiglottis measures 3.5 x 3.0 x 0.2 cm
with a pink-tan mucosal surface. Distal to the epiglottis are the bilateral
arytenoids, which measure 2.1 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm on the left and 1.5 x 0.9 x

0.5 cm on the right. Both arytenoids are pink-tan and soft with no gross
abnormalities. The false vocal cords measure 2.0 cm on the left and 1.5 cm
on the right. Distal to the false vocal cords are the bilateral ventricles

and true vocal cords. The true vocal cords measure 1.8 cm on the left and
2.0 cm on the right. Bilateral false and true vocal cords are pink-tan in
color. Distal to the true vocal cords is the subglottis, which leads to the
trachea. There is a 2.6 cm portion of trachea removed with the specimen.
The posterior surface of the specimen contains the hyoid bone, which is
identified superiorly to the horns of the cricoid cartilage. The horn of

the left cricoid cartilage is not grossly visible. The left piriform sinus
contains a nodular pink-tan lesion that measures 3.5 x 3.0 cm. The lesion
involves the entire piriform sinus. On the posterior side of the specimen,
there is muscle tissue identified and a vein that measures 9.5 x 3.5 cm.

The vein is clipped at both ends. The left lobe of the thyroid is

identified and measures 3.5 x 2.6 x 0.8 cm. Also removed distal to the
thyroid gland are the level 6 lymph nodes. The level 6 tissue is removed
from the specimen and thoroughly examined for lymph nodes. There are
multiple palpable lymph nodes. Approximately 12 possible lymph nodes are
identified and entirely submitted. The largest presumed lymph node measures
2.0 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm. It is bisected to reveal a cystic cavity filled with

thick white ﬂuid. The thyroid is removed from the specimen and serially
sectioned to reveal a red-brown, gritty parenchyma with a mucoid surface.
There is a 0.1 cm firm, white nodule within the parenchyma approaching the
isthmus. There is no gross evidence of tumor. Representative sections of
the thyroid are submitted. The soft tissue on the posterior aspect of the
specimen is removed. The identified vein prior to inking is removed and the
remaining tissue is serially sectioned to reveal grossly normal muscle and
cartilage tissue. While sectioning the specimen, a lymph node is identified
that measures 2.0 x 1.1 x 0.2 cm. The remaining tissue on the possible
posterior larynx is thoroughly examined and one additional presumed lymph
node is identified. The remaining tissue is grossly normal. Both lymph
nodes are entirely submitted. The piriform sinus is serially sectioned

while attached to the remaining specimen. The tumor is less than 0.1 cm to
the posterior margin, 0.1 cm from the superior margin, and 1.5 cm from the
inferior margin. The lesion is 2.0 cm thick. Representative sections of the
tumor and remaining specimen are submitted.
