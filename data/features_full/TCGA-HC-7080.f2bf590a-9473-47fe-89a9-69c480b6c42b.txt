GROSS DESCRlPTtON: ‘
Container A, labeled _ and "prostate, 8V, VD"
is a 39 gm radical prostatectomy specimen previously inked
and sampled for research, 4.7 x 4.5 x 4.1 cm. The right
side is inked green, the left side black; The specimen is
further sectioned to posterior” to show a O.6_:‘cm, pink area
of discoloration in the right posterior aspectfot the distal
to mid level, 0.1 cm from the inked margin. Additional
abnormalities are not identiﬁed. The seminal vesicles
together measure 4.5 x 3.5 x 0.7 cm. Each is uninvolved by
lesion. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
1—2 apical margin; 3 vesicle margin; 4 distal left lateral;
5 distal right lateral; 6 distal right posterior; 7 distal
left posterior; 8 mid left laterai; 9 mid right lateral; 10
right posterior; 11 left posterior; 12 proximal left
lateral; 13 proximal right lateral; 14 proximal right
posterior; 15 proximai left posterior; 16 origin of seminal
vesicle; 17‘ representative left and right seminal vesicles;

M ~17. Two cassettes for research
labele
Container 8, labeled I and "bilateral pelvic
LN” is a 4.5 x 3.8 x 0.9 cm mass of nodular yellow adipose
tissue. On section and palpation two lymph nodes are
identiﬁed, 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm and 4.5 x 1.8 X 0.5 cm. Each
is sectioned. The nodes are entirely submitted as follows:
1—2 one node bisected; 3-6 one node sectioned;
