GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is receiVed fresh, in four parts, labelled with the patient's
name and unit number.

Part one, "omental tumor", consists of an irregular fragment of fibrofatty
tissue measuring 21 x 12 x 6.5 cm. The external surface of the specimen is
irregular, bosselated, focally hemorrhagic. The cut surface of the Specimen
shows a 12.5 x 11 x ’1 cm yellow/tan soft, extensively hemorrhagic and necrotic
tumor mass. The central portion of the lesion shows a glistening area of
possible degeneration. The tumor mass is surrounded by a rim of mature adipose
tissue. A representative section of the tumor mass is submitted for

Part two, "right adnexa", consists of a fragmented irregular ovary measuring
8.5 x B x 2.5 cm with attached non—fimbriated fallopian tube measuring 8 cm in
length and ranging in diameter from 2.5 cm to 0.5 cm. The external surface

of the fallopian tube is red/tan, focally hemorrhagic. The distal portion 0f
the fallopian shows a 3 x 2.5 x 2 cm firm nodule. The cut surface of the
nodule is yellow/tan, focally hemorrhagic and necrotic. The mid—portion of the
fallopian tube is dilated up to 1.5 cm in diameter. The area of dilatation

is filled with hemorrhagic fluid. The external surface of the the ovary is
irregular, focally hemorrhagic. Multiple yellow/tan, raised soft nodules are
identified, the largest of which measures 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm. The cut surface of
the ovary {previously opened) shows few cavities. The internal surface of one
of the cavities identified shows a 1.2 x l x 0.2 cm area of yellow/tan soft
papillary projections. The internal surface of the other cavities is
predominantly smooth and glistening with focal areas of hemorrhage.
also is a 5.5 x 3.5 x 3.2 cm irregular nodule of yellow/tan soft tissue,
detached from the rest of the specimen. The cut surface of the nodules is
pink/grey, fleshy with focal areas of hemorrhage. A representative section of
one of the ovarian is submitted for

Part three, "left adnexa", consists of a 6 x 4 x 3 cm fragment of tissue with
an irregular surface. A fallopian tube with a fimbriated end is identified and
measures 4.5 cm in length x 0.8 cm in largest diameter. The attached adnexal
mass consists mostly of a nodule with a papillary/irregular surface and a cyst
containing both cystic and solid elements. Both the solid nodule and the
cystic nodules have been cut. The solid nodule measures 3.2 x 2.5 x 2.8 cm and
the cystic mass measures 2.5 cm in the largest diameter.

Part four, "uterus with cervix“, consists of a 50 gm hysterectomy. The uterus
and cervix measures 7 x 5 x 3 cm in overall dimensions having a smooth,
glistening and focally hemorrhagic serosal surface. The tan, smooth and
glistening exocervix (3.3 cm in diameter) has a slit—like cs (1.5 cm in
diameter). The specimen is inked prior to processing. The endocervix (2.1 cm
in length x 1.4 cm in width) has a smooth and glistening surface with a 0.6 cm
fluid filled cyst. The endometrium (2.1 cm from cornu to cornu x 3.8 cm in
length x 0.1 cm in thickness) is smooth and glistening with focal mucosal
hemorrhages. The myometrium (1.4 cm in maximal thickness) contains a single
small intramural white nodule measuring 0.3 cm in diameter.
