Sections show a partly pigmented choroidal melanoma composed
of mixed cells in which the epithelioid component amounts to
approximately 25% and appears to correspond to most of the
amelanotic component described macroscclpically. Tumour cells

is approximately 7/40 high power fields. The
microvasculature of the melanoma is prominent, and closed
loops are present in the planes of section. The lymphocytic
infiltrate within the tumour is moderate, and scattered
macrophages are also present. Tumour necrosis is not seen.
There is no tumour extension through the optic nerve or its
resection margin. There is, however, tumour extending into
the sclera. In addition, sections of vortex veins reveal
focal tumour infiltration in at least one vessel.

Elsewhere, the cornea shows oedema of basal epithelial
cells. The anterior chamber angles are focally closed and
the anterior chamber is filled with proteinaceous fluid. The
ciliary body appears atrophic with hyalinisation of ciliary
processes. Focal pigmented iris epithelium is adherent to
the anterior surface of the lens. There is extensive retinal
detachment. Bruch's membrane adjacent to the tumour is
disrupted in the sections examined. Vitreous is
haemorrhagic.

DIAGNOSIS

Left enucleation - choroidal melanoma of mixed cell type
with infiltration into sclera and vortex vein.

Molecular genetic examination of DNA extracted from the
tumour cells will be performed using multiplex-ligation
dependent probe amplification (MLPA), looking at chromosomes
1, 3, 6 and 8.

A supplementary report will follow in due course.

MOLECULAR ANALYSIS

In the meantime, molecular genetic analysis of tumour DNA
extracted from the fresh uveal melanoma tissue (from both
melanotic and amelanotic areas) was performed using the
technique termed multiplex ligation-dependent probe
amplification (MLPA) . These investigations were performed in
the ‘ '

The kit P027 from _ which examines for gains or
losses in 31 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8, was used.
The DNA concentration was measured using ‘ and the
quality assessed using multiplex—PCR prior to the MLPA
reaction.

The DNA concentration was high and of good quality on
assessment. The MLPA reaction was run at least twice on
differing occasions, resulting in similar results.

The results of the sequence analysis of the MLPA products is
printed on a separate report. In summary, sequence analysis
demonstrated:

Taken together with the histomorphological features of the
tumour, these molecular data would place the patient in the
high risk group with respect to the development of
metastatic melanoma.

Consideration of clinical features of the tumour is,
however, also required.
