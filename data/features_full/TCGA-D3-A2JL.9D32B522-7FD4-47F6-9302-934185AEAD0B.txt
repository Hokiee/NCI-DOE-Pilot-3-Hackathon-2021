(A) LEFT lNGUINAL SUPERFICIAL AND FEMORAL LYMPH NODES, EXCISION: W 1'
CONSISTENT WITH METASTATIC MELANOMA. " may-d.
Tumor measures 10 x 20 x 35 mm in gross description. /gq/n

 

Eight deﬁnite lymph nodes negative for metastatic melanoma.
COMMENT

It is possible that this metastatic focus of melanoma represents a completely effaced lymph node and thus one of nine lymph
nodes would be positive. Immunohistochemistry will be performed to confirm this diagnosis and reported as an addendum. No
pigment is noted in tumor cells.
