COMMENTS. '

Sections of the adrenal gland demonstrate adrenal corticalhyperplesia with extensive hemorrhage and focal necrosis within the medullary component A l
single nodule of clear cell proliferation which‘ Is well vascularized Is noted and because of the histologic features lmmunohlstochemlcal stains are I

perfumed with the following results

RCC: Positive
CD‘l'O: Positive.
VImentin: Positive.

Based on the immunohistochemical results and the H85 ﬁndings the leatmes of the adrenal nodule are mad consistent with those of metastatic rene. :e
wcinome.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: . s, ' . ' .

The specimen is received labeled ' ~ ' ...~« ll kidney and adrenal gland. The specimenconsisls of a kidney with attached perinephric fat that
measures 20x 14x 10 cm. weighs. 1,045 grams. There is a portion cladrenai gland sheared la the specimen as well as a detsehed piece of an
adrenal gland within the container. The adrenal gland together measures 4.5 x 2 x 2 cm. The cut surface is golden yellow with areas of hemorrhage
The ureter measures 9.5 cm. in length. 0.3 cm. in diameter, The surface is gray in mm The ureter is opened. The mucosal surface is right lan.
There is no material within the lumen or lesions identiﬁed. The renal-artery measures 1.5 cm. in length, 0.5 cm. in diameter. ll is grossly unremarkable.
The renal vein measures 1.5 cm. in diameter. Sectioning there is lumor visible within the lumen. it is 0.6 cm. from lhe resected margin.

Al thehilum there is a yellow—tan nodule measuring 1 x 1 x 0.5 cm. possible lymph node. The soft tissue reseclion margin is yellow-tan slightly shaggy.
The receded margin has been inked. The kidney is bisected and reveals a» yellow to brownelan variegated soft friable shaggy mess measuring 7.5 x G x
5.8 an. within the upper pets that on sectioning is grossly «zoomed in lire capsule and does not show evidence of invasion into the perinephric let. it
comes within 0.1 cm. of the inked resented margin. The mass does not involve the surrounding renal oalices pelvis. The canoes, pelvis are gray-tan.
The surrounding renal cortex is brownJlen and measures 0.5 cm. and shows a Well demarcated corticomeduliary'luncllon. No other lesions are identiﬁed
grossly. , ‘ ' - .

Received with the specimen are three cassetes - one green, one yellow. one blue labeled Mith the yellow cassette additionally labeled.-
15. The green cassette additionally labeled - 17: and the blue cassette additioneﬂy labeled — l8. *

Representalm sections are submitted in cassettes labeled ... inﬂows: sections from mass in blocks 1 through 4; ureter block 5; renal
arterxgnd vein in block 6; surrounding. uninvolved kidney in block 7; possible hilar lymph node bisected in block 8; adrenal gland in block 9.
