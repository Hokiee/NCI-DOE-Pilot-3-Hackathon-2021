Lobe mass

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1. Received fresh for frozen section are two portions of tan—pink to red soft
tissue aggregating to 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm. A smear preparation is performed.
The specimen is entirely frozen on one chuck.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:
— PREDOMINANTLY NECROSIS WITH CLUSTER OF VIABLE CELLS.
— MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, FAVOR GLIOBLASTOMA.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The previously frozen tissue is subsequently submitted for permanent

sections.

2. Received fresh for frozen section is a portion of tan—pink soft tissue
measuring 0.8 x 0.6 cm. A smear preparation is performed. The specimen is
entirely frozen on one chuck.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:
POORLY DIFFERENTIATED NEOPLASM CONSISTENT WITH GLIOBLASTOMA. -

The previously frozen tissue is subsequently submitted for permanent
sections.

3. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "left frontal
brain tumor" are multiple fragments of tan~white to pink—red soft tissue
aiireiating to 1.8 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:

1—3. Sections demonstrate a high grade glial neoplasm consisting of a
proliferation of atypical cells which resemble astrocytes. The tumor cells
demonstrate oval to elongated hyperchromatic nuclei with moderate to marked
atypia and prominent fibrillary processes. They diffusely infiltrate the
adjacent brain parenchyma. Prominent necrosis. including serpentine
pseudopalisading necrosis are present throughout the tumor. Robust
microvascular proliferation is seen. There is a background of acute
hemorrhage.

DIAGNOSIS:
(PROVISIONAL)

1-3. LEFT FRONTAL BRAIN TUMOR, BIOPSY AND RESECTION:
GLIOBLASTOMA (WHO GRADE IV), PENDING IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STUDIES.

 

 

 

 

 

 

ADDENDUM DISCUSSION:
MGMT highlights numerous tumor vasculature. Overall. approximately 10—25% of
the tumor cells express MGMT.
ADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS:
1-3. LEFT FRONTAL BRAIN TUMOR, BIOPSY AND RESECTION:
GLIOBLASTOMA (WHO GRADE IV).

- 10-25% OF TUMOR CELLS WITH MGMT EXPRESSION.
