(A) RIGHT NECK DISSECTION, LEVEL II B - One possible lymph node, 1.5 x 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted in A.
(B) RIGHT NECK DISSECTION, LEVEL III B - Fibroadipose tissue, 2.2 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm. Four possible lymph nodes are
identiﬁed ranging from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm to 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm.

SECTION CODE: B1, four possible lymph nodes; 32, remainder of fibroadipose tissue entirely submitted.

(C) RIGHT NECK DISSECTION, LEVEL II A - Fibroadipose tissue, 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm. Six lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging
from 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 to 1.2 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm.

SECTION CODE: C1, two lymph nodes; C2, three lymph nodes; 03, one lymph node serially sectioned.

(D) RIGHT NECK DISSECTION, LEVEL III A - Fibroadipose tissue and muscle, 4.5 x 2.8 x 1.3 cm. Two lymph nodes (0.7 x
0.4 x 0.3 and 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm) are identified and submitted in D.

(E) TOTAL LARYNGECTOMY AND THYROIDECTOMY — The specimen (overall measuring 12.1 x 9.5 x 3.5 cm) consists of
hyoid bone, larynx and trachea (11.5 cm in length, 4.5 cm in circumference), anterior soft tissue (9.7 x 5.5 x 1.2 cm, including
skeletal muscle and ﬁbroconnective tissue), and right thyroid lobe (4.2 x 3.7 x 1.5 cm).

Centrally located at ventricle is an ulcerated circumferential tumor (3.9 in length, 4.5 cm in circumference). The tumor
extends 2.5 cm superior to supraepiglottis and 1.3 cm inferior to subepiglottis. The tumor invades through the cricoid cartilage
with a maximum depth of 0.7 cm. The tumor appears to abut the thyroid cartilage. The anterior soft tissue and right thyroid are
not involved by the tumor. The tumor is 2.7 cm from the tracheal resection margin and 0.8 cm from the closest aryepiglottic
fold (left lateral). Sections of thyroid cartilage and cricoid cartilage are submitted for decalciﬁcation. The thyroid cartilage are
submitted to bone lab for decalcification and additional sections. Representative sections of the tumor and normal mucosa are
submitted to tissue bank.

SECTION CODE: E1-E5, frozen section (E1, left lateral mucosal margin; E2, posterior mucosal margin, E3, right
lateral mucosal margin, E4, E5, entire tracheal resection margin); E6, posterior, tumor and subglottis; E7, posterior, tumor and
supraglottis; E8, left, tumor and subglottis; E9, left, tumor and supraglottis; E10, anterior, tumor and subglottis; E11, anterior,
tumor and supraglottis; E12, right, tumor and subglottis; E13, right, tumor and supraglottis; E14, tumor and cricoid cartilage;
E15, thyroid cartilage; E16, representative section of thyroid and a possible parathyroid; E17, representative section of

anterior soft tissue; E18-E21 re res ' cross section of the bony and cartilaginous tissue associated with tumor,
submitted for decalciﬁcation
"FS/DX: LEFT LATERAL MUCOSAL MARGIN, RIGHT LATERAL MUCOSAL IGHT LATERAL MUCOSAL

MARGIN, ENTIRE TRACHEAL MARGIN. MARGINS NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.

(F) RIGHT PARATRACHEAL - Fibroadipose tissue, 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm. One lymph node, 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm is identified.
SECTION CODE: F1, one lymph node; F2, remainder of ﬁbroadipose tissue entirely submitted.

(G) RIGHT PARATRACHEAL MASS, EVALUATE FOR PARATHYROID - Two tan-pink soft tissue fragments, 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1

cm each and weigh 0.0011 g in toto. Submitted entirely in G for o n section. Touch preps are performed. -
'FS/DX: LYMPH NODE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

(H) DEEP NODES, RIGHT NECK DISSECTION, LEVEL l - w ymph nodes (0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 and 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm) are
identified and entirely submitted in H.
