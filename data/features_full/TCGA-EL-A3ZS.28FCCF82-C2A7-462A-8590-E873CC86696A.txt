GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) CONFIRM PARATHYROID — A fragment of tan-red soft tissue, measuring 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. Touch preparation has
been performed and the entire specimen is submitted for frozen section.

SECTION CODE: A, the entire specimen, for frozen section. ‘

'FS/DX: PARATHYROID TISSUE PRESENT.
(B) THYROID AND LEVEL 6 CONTENTS - The specimen has an overall measurement of 7.0 x 5.0 x 1.5 cm and consists of a
thyroid, including right lobe (5.5 x 2.2 x 1.1 cm), left lobe, (3.8 x 2.2 x 1.1 cm), a prominent isthmus (4.0 x 3.5 x 0.8 cm) and
ﬁbroadipose tissue (4.0 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm) attached to the inferior aspect of the thyroid (level 6 contents) .

A dominant nodule (1.6 x 1.1 x 0.7 cm) is found in the lower pole of the isthmus adjacent to the left lobe. The nodule is
composed of white-yellow homogeneous tissue and is well circumscribed.

The right lobe of the thyroid is unremarkable and composed of homogeneous red-brown tissue. The left lobe of the
thyroid is unremarkable and composed of homogeneous red-brown tissue. Attached to the lower portion of the isthmus, a
piece of adipose tissue admixed with several lymph nodes is identiﬁed. This area is dissected for lymph nodes.

SECTION CODE: 81-33, dominant nodule from the isthmus from medial to lateral; 84, left lobule, representative
sections, lower pole; 85, left lobule, representative sections, upper pole; 86, lower pole, right lobule; B7, upper pole, right
lobule, representative sections; BB, four possible lymph nodes; BS, four possible lymph nodes; B10, one lymph node; 811,
two lymph nodes; B12, one lymph node; B13, one lymph node; B14, one lymph node bisected; B15, one lymph node bisected;
B16, one lymph node bisected.

(C) RIGHT LEVEL 4 — A single fragment of ﬁbrofatty tissue measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm. Dissection reveals multiple
possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 up to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. Possible lymph nodes are entirely submitted.

SECTION CODE: C1, four possible lymph nodes; CZ, one sectioned possible lymph node.

(D) LEVEL 4 AND 5 B -— A single fragment of fatty tissue measuring 3.8 x 3.0 x 0.8 cm. Multiple possible lymph nodes are
identiﬁed ranging from 0.4 up to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. Possible lymph nodes are entirely submitted.

SECTION CODE: D1, ﬁve possible lymph nodes; DZ, ﬁve possible lymph nodes; 03, five possible lymph nodes; D4,
three possible lymph nodes; D5, one bisected possible lymph node.

CLINICAL HISTORY

Papillary thyroid cancer.
