GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received fresh for frozen section labeled with the patient's name and ”liver biopsy” is

a 1 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm linear biopsy of tan tissue totally submitted in block A for frozen
section evaluation.

B. Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and “splenic flexure colon lesion” with
tissue bank coordinator in attendance is a 12 cm segmental resection of large bowel which
measures 4 cm in diameter. requests gross evaluation for margins. Both the
surgical margins are stapled and not clinically designated. Tattoo pigment is noted which
abuts one staple line. The adipose tissue is wrapped around the serosa in the mid portion.
Blue ink is applied to this area. The tattoo stapled margin measures 5 cm in length and
opposite margin measures 3.5 cm in length. The mesenteric margin measures 3 cm. Blue ink
is applied to this margin. In trying to separate the mesentery from the bowel, it is found
to be adherent to the bowel surface. There is some fatty tissue present on the opposite
side which may be inclusive of some omental type tissue. The margins are removed and the
lumen probed revealing an obstructing mass present. The tumor measures 6 cm in length, it
involves the entire circumference of the bowel wall. It lies 2.5 cm from the tattooed
margin and 2 cm from the opposite margin. A portion of the edge of the tumor and
non—neoplastic mucosa is provided to the tissue bank coordinator. The specimen is pinned
out onto a corkboard for several hours of formalin fixation. The partial fixed specimen is
serially sectioned revealing that the tumor extends deep into the muscle wall. possibly
extending through the muscle wall. A subjacent lymph node is identified measuring 1 cm.
The pericolic/mesenteric adipose tissue was placed in a 50/50 solution of lymph node
revealing solution and formalin. On cross section. several lymph nodes are identified
which range from 0.4 to 1 cm in greatest dimension each. No omental nodules are
identified.

lymph node
B9 ~ omental tissue
811-13— two lymph nodes each bisected and totally submitted. one inked
314 _ largest lymph node sectioned and totally submitted

C. In formalin labeled with the patient's name and "left lobe liver biopsy" is a 0.7 x 1 x
0.3 cm biopsy of liver tissue. There is a 0.5 x 0.4 cm pale area on the surface. The
biopsy is trisected and entirely submitted in block C.

D. In formalin labeled with the patient‘s name and ”pelvic peritoneal nodule“ is a 1 x 1 x
0,5 cm triangular shaped portion of gray fatty tissue. There is a 3 mm whitish nodule on
the surface. The specimen is bisected revealing this to be a partially calcified
hemorrhagic nodule possibly representing fat necrosis. The specimen is entirely submitted
in block D.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:

A&C. These biopsies of the left lobe of the liver show focal granulomatous inflammation
with fibrosis. The granulomas are mostly noncaseating. composed of epithelioid
histiocytes. multinucleated giant cells and a sprinkling of small lymphocytes. These
granulomas are set in a fibrous stroma. A few of the granulomas have scant central
necrosis but most are noncaseating. AFB and GMS stains are obtained on both biopsies. No
organisms are seen.

D. This is a piece of adipose tissue containing a sclerotic, partially calcified nodule
compatible with fat necrosis. There is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma.

B. Sections of the obstructing tumor demonstrate a moderately differentiated
adenocarcinoma which invades through the bowel wall. not quite reaching the subjacent
mesenteric lymph node. Discontinuous invasion is noted. No metastasis are identified in
10 regional lymph nodes.
