HlSTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

flLlNlCAL NOTES :
PSA i4, Gleason 7. T2b —— tissue banking. Previous biopsy

MACROSCOPIC :
A {54 g radical proslaie, 70 x 45 x 40 mm
Block designation:

Block ABC Right apex Block D to H Loft apex

Block i to L Right base Block MNOP Loft base

Blocks Q to V Apex to base right, side blue Blocks W to BB Apex to base left side green Sl
MlCROSCOPlC :

The sections show multiiocai, bilateral adenocarcinorna. ‘l’he index tumour is in the right transition
zone Gleason patterns 4+5=9 . This tumour is organ confined. The tumour in the left peripheral zone
is Gleason patterns 4 (80%)+3=7 and partly cribriiorm. This tumour shows a <1 mm focus of
extraprostatic extension which is within a vein. The overlying pathological margin is clear.

The seminal vesicles and pathological margins are uninvolved. Tissue banking w both tumours
identified.

CONCLUSION:

Robotic radical prostatectomy —- multifooai. bilateral adenocarcinoma. Index tumour right
transition zone Gleason 4+5=9, organ confined. Left sided tumour Gleason 4(80%)+3==7 with
sxtraprostatic vascular extension, seminal vesicles and pathological margins ciear, pTBa.
