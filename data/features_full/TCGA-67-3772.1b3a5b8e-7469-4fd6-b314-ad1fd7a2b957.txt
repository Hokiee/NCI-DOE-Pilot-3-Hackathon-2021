A4 The specimen is submitted fresh for frozen section as ”right
diaphramatic nodule" and consists of five tan tissue fragments ranging
from 0.2 to 0.3 cm in dimension; submitted 5 {1) labeled "FSP" for frozen

section.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: Focal cluster of atypical cells of uncertain
nature; ? mesothelial cells, dissimilar to

irimary lung adenoca in recent aspiration

B. The specimen is submitted fresh for frozen section as "right superior
hilar node 10R" and consists of three red black nodes ranging from 0.7 to
1.1 cm in dimension. Each is sectioned and the specimen submitted in
toto, 5 (1) labeled "FSP" for frozen section.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: Negative for tumor. -

C. The specimen is submitted fresh as "right upper lobe" and consists of
a 131 gram (416), 16 X 7 x 3 cm lung lobe. The pleural surface shows a
2.2 x 2 cm firm puckered indurated area. The pleural surface overlying
this area is inked blue. The pleural surface also shows four ill—defined
tan white firm subpleural nodules measuring 0.3 to 0.4 cm with the closest
located 6.5 cm from the puckered area. The specimen is received with
multiple stapled margins measuring 3.5 to 7 cm in length along with a
stapled bronchial margin measuring 2.5 cm in diameter and several adjacent
stapled vascular margins measuring 0.2 cm in length X 0.5 cm in diameter
to 0.5 cm in length x 1 cm in diameter. The stapled margins are removed
and the underlying parenchyma inked black. Sectioning reveals a 4.3 x 3 x
2.2 cm well circumscribed tan yellow to white firm, fooally hemorrhagic
mass corresponding to the previous described puckered and indurated area
on the pleural surface grossly appearing to abut the pleural surface
measuring 0.7 cm from the closest black inked parenchyma underlying the
stapled resection margin and 3 cm from the bronchial margin. The
remaining parenchyma is red to maroon, spongy, homogenous and grossly
unremarkable. No other discrete masses or nodularities are grossly
evident. Also identified at the hilum is a 1 cm in greatest dimension
gray black possible hilar lymph node which is trisected and submitted
entirely. Representative sections are submitted, multiple (7) as follows:

Cassette 1: Vasculature and bronchial margins submitted en face
Cassette 2: Subpleural nodules submitted entirely

Cassette 3: Mass with closest pleural surface

Cassette 4: Perpendicular section of mass to the closest stapled

resection margin

0.7 cm in dimension, the individual nodes separated and the specimen

submitted in toto, multiple (l).
