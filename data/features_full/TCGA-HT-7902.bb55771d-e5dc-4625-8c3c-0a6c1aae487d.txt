Pathology Report for Subiect-

Addendum Discussion:

The MIB-l labeling index is calculated at up to 5.1% in the most
proliferative regions. Although the MIB-l labeling index is relatively high for
a low grade oligodendroglioma, the lack of histological anaplastic features,
including necrosis, microvascular proliferation, hypercellularity and mitotic
figures, are more consistent with a low grade oligodendroglioma.
Nonetheless, the elevated MIB-l labeling index is worrisome and close
follow-up for recurrence and/or anaplastic progression is warranted.

Addendum Diagnosis:
Oligoastrocytoma, WHO grade II

Microscopic Description:

Sections demonstrate a mildly hypercellular glial neoplasm composed
predominantly of neoplastic cells with perinuclear halos and some
perineuronal satellitosis. Occasional scattered large atypical
hyperchromatic cells are noted. There is some edema, but no necrosis or
microvascular proliferation is seen. No mitotic figures are identified.
