DIAGNOSIS: ‘-

1) KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND, LEFT; NEPHRECTOMY AND
ADRENALECTOMY:
— RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR CELL) TYPE,
NUCLEAR GRADE II/IV. THE PATTERN OF GROWTH IS ACINAR. THE
TUMOR GREATEST DIAMETER IS 4.5 CM. THE TUMOR EXTENDS
THROUGH THE RENAL CAPSULE BUT IS CONFINED WITHIN GEROTA'S
FASCIA. NO INVASION OF THE RENAL VEIN IS IDENTIFIED. ALL
SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR. THE NON-NEOPLASTIC
KIDNEY IS UNREMARKABLE. THE ADRENAL GLAND SHOWS FOCAL

NODULAR HYPERPLASIA.

2) LYMPH NODES, PARAHAORTIC; EXCISION:
— THREE BENIGN LYMPH NODES (0/3).

Gross Descrigtion:
- _

l) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled
"Left kidney and adrenal gland". It consists of a left kidney,
segment of ureter, fragments of the renal blood vessel,
perinephric adiposa tissue and a portion of adrenal gland,
weighing 450 grams. The kidney measures 11.0 x 6.0 x 5.0 cm.
The portion of ureter measures 7.0 cm in length and 0.5 cm in
circumference. Sectioning of the kidney reveals a well—
circumscribed tumor which grossly breaks through the renal

capsule and extends to the perinephric adipose tissue, coming
within 0.1 cm from the inked Gerota's fascia. The tumor is
composed of pink~red to bright yellow, soft to focally fibrous
parenchyma. The dimension of the tumor is 4.5 x 3.0 x 0.5 cm and
it involves the mid-lower portion of the kidney. Grossly, the
collecting system is free of tumor. The urothelium of the pelvis
and ureter is pink—tan and smooth. The hilar region of the
kidney is.free of tumor. The renal vein is free of tumor. The
rest of the renal parenchyma is grossly unremarkable. The
portion of renal gland measures 3.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. Serial
sectioning of the adrenal gland reveals intramedullary
hemorrhage; otherwise, the parenchymal adrenal gland is
unremarkable. No lymph nodes are identified at the region of the
kidney. Representative sections are submitted. A small portion
of tumor is taken for TPS. Tumor is also fixed in glutaraldehyde
for EM studies. Gross photographs of the specimen are taken.

2) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Para—aortic
Lymph Nodes”. It consists of pieces of fibroadipose tissue
measuring 7 x 6 x 2.5 cm in aggregate. On sectioning, multiple
lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.6 to 4.5 cm are identified.
The largest lymph node is almost 99% replaced by the adipose
tissue. Lymph nodes are submitted in two blocks.
