specimen contains 2 needle localization wires and there is an accompanying
specimen mammogram, which is used to orient the specimen and select the
sections. The radiologist has circled two areas of concern marked 1 and 2,
both of which are associated with microcalciﬁcations. The margins are
inked blue for microscopic evaluation. Upon sectioning, area 1 is present
near the midpoint of the long axis and consists of a 2.4 x 1.9 x 1.4 cm
irregular mass. The cut surfaces of the mass are white-tan, smooth and have
well-deﬁned borders. The mass grossly abuts the inked margin. At one end
of the mass is a 0.7 x 0.3 cm biopsy cavity containing collagen material

and a small metal clip as well as adjacent focal hemorrhage. Area 2 is

 

present at one end of the specimen and consists of a 1.2 x 0.9 cm ovoid
portion of ﬁrm white fibrous tissue that is slightly more dense than the
adjacent white ﬁbrous tissue. This area comes to within 0.7 cm of the
nearest inked margin. The remaining cut surfaces are tan and lobulated with
interspersed areas of condensed white ﬁbrous tissue comprising
approximately 25% of the specimen. Poorly-defined areas of blue staining

are also present.
