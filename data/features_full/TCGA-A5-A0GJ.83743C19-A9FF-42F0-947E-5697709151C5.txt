Labeled with the patient's name, labeled "right ovary", and received fresh in the Operating Room for intraoperative
consultation and subsequently ﬁxed in formalin is an oophorectomy specimen measuring 17.5 x 15.0 x 10.0 cm.
The entire ovary is replaced by a multiloculated cystic mass. A portion of the cyst is replaced by a solid, tan—pink-
yellow, focally hemorrhagic, soﬁ mass measuring 10.0 x 10.0 x 8.0 cm. The remaining cyst is collapsed. The
serosal surface is variegated from tan to red, focally hemorrhagic, partially smooth and partially rough. The internal
lining of the cyst is mostly smooth and focally rough. Attached to the ovary, there is a segment of fallopian tube
with ﬁmbria at one end measuring 3.0 cm in maximum length and ranging in diameter from 0.5 up to 0.8 cm. Cut
section through the fallopian tube reveals a patent lumen measuring up to 0.1 cm. The serosal surface is tan—pink,
