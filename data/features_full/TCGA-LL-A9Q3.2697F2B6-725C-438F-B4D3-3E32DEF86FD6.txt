GROSS DESCRIPTION:
Received fresh for tissue banking. labeled with the patient's name and "left modified
radical mastectomy" is a 1758 gram. 28.0 x 25.0 x 6.5 cm iibrofatty breast. The breast is
received with an 11.0 x 8.5 X 4.0 cm axillary tail consistent with a modified radical
mastectomy specimen. There is a 22.0 x 9.0 cm tan—white skin ellipse which has a centrally
located. 5.5 x 4.5 cm ovoid steels and central 1.5 cm nipple. No scars or lesions are
identified on the skin's surface. The deep fascial margin is smooth with delicate strands
of fibroskeletal muscle. The breast is sectioned to have diffuse. ill defined indurated
nodularity. This area of indurated nodularity is ill defined and is central to interior.
The nodule extends to covar a region which is 10.0 x 7.0 x 7.0 cm. Central within this
region is a 4.0 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm solid mass. The tumor is sampled for tissue banking from the
solid mass. The more solid appearing mass is 4 cm from the deep margin: however the
indurated modularity is 2.3 cm from the deep margin with focal nodules being 2.0 cm. The
measurable mass is 2.5 cm from inferior and approximately 11 cm from superior. the mass is
approximately 8 cm from medial and 9 cm from lateral. There is focal petechial hemorrhage
associated with the mass and consistent with a previous biopsy. The dense. white-fibrous
tissue makes up approximately 40% of the parenchyma. The tumor appears to be predominantly
central and inferior within the breast with finger—like, indurated extensions into each
quadrant. There are two large lymph nodes present in the upper outer quadrant. The axilla
is sectioned to have multiple. indurated nodular lymph nodes. The largest lymph node is a
linear 5.0 X 2.0 x 1.0 cm. Representative sections are sampled as labeled:

1 — nipple trisected

2 _ on face section of areola

3 — deep margin overlying more solid appearing tumor mass sampled

4—7 — sections of described. solid tumor mass

8 ~ section of possible tumor extension abutting inked. inferior.

10 — sections from upper outer quadrant

associated with upper outer quadrant
