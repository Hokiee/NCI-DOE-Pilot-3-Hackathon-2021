 

DIAGNOSIS

(A) THROMBUS, RIGHT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND:
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (6.0 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION), CONVENTIONAL TYPE (40% CLEAR CELLS, 60%
EOSINOPHILIC CELLS), FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3, INVASIVE INTO RENAL VEIN, PERINEPHRIC
ADIPOSE TISSUE AND RENAL SINUS ADIPOSE TISSUE.
Margins of resection free of tumor. (See comment)
Adrenal gland, no tumor present.

COMMENT

The renal cell carcinoma bulges from the lumen of the renal vein at the margin, however, the wall of the renal vein at the margin is
free of tumor. The tumor pushes against the renal pelvicalyceal system, but does not invade into it.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) THROMBUS, RIGHT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND - A radical nephrectomy specimen (25.0 x 10.0 x 5.0 cm), with kidney
(14.0 x 7.0 x 5.0 cm), and adrenal gland (3.0 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm).

A 6.0 x 5.0 x 5.0 cm irregular, Iobulated tumor is present in the mid portion of the kidney. The tumor involves the renal
vein and bulges from the lumen of the vein, however, the margin of the wall of the renal vein is free of tumor. Tumor involves the
renal sinus fat, and pushes against but does not penetrate through the renal pelvis. The tumor is 0.5 cm from the soft tissue
(adipose tissue) edge. Cut sections reveal a heterogeneous, orange-yellow (80%) and hemorrhagic (20%) appearance. Areas of
necrosis and hyalinization are not identiﬁed. The tumor does not grossly invade into the perinephric fat. The rest of the
pelvicalyceal system and kidney parenchyma are unremarkable. No perihilar lymph nodes are identiﬁed.

The adrenal gland has an unremarkable cortex and medulla, and no nodules are present.

The renal vein margin is submitted for frozen section. Sections of the tumor are submitted for possible electron
microscopy studies, and for the renal vaccine protocol.

INK CODE: Blue, soft tissue margin nearest the tumor.

SECTION CODE: A1, renal vein margin, en face for frozen section; A2, ureteral and vascular margins, en face; A3-A6,
tumor in renal vein; A7, A8, tumor with nearest soft tissue margin; A9-A13, tumor with adjacent renal pelvis and renal sinus; A14-
A19, tumor with adjacent renal sinus fat; A20-A22, tumor and adjacent perinephric fat; A23, A24, tumor and normal kidney; A25,
A26, additional representative sections of tumor; A27, A28, normal kidney, representative sections; A29, adrenal gland,
representative sections.

*FS/DX: RENAL VEIN MARGIN IS NEGATIVE. -

CLINICAL HISTORY
Right renal mass.
