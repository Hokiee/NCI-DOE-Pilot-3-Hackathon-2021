MACROSCOPY

Received 02 identified vials.

Vial 1. Tumor - 06 irregular, soft and grayish-white fragments measuring together 1.8 x
1 3 x 0.7 cm.

Vial 2. Amygdala — nodular, soft and whitish structure previously sectioned along the
longest axis measuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm

MICROSCOPY .

The histological sections stained with H&E show fragments of neuroepithelial neoplasia
composed of cells of convoluted nuclei, sometimes rounded, with dense chromatin and
inconspicuous nucleoli. The cytoplasm is scarce, with imprecise limits. Such cells are
disposed on ﬁbrillar background, sometimes microvacuolized. Mitotic figures are rare (1
mitosis per 20 contiguous high power fields). Calls attention the the presence of some
cells with increased nuclear pleomorphism, forming small clusters of neoplastic cells.
The tumor diffusely inﬁltrates mesial structures in the form of isolated cells, including the
amygdala.

DIAGNOSTIC

- Diffuse astrocytoma with focal areas of anaplasia, grade II according to the WHO
