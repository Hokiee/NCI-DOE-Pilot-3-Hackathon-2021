SPECIMENS:
A. LEFT COLON

DIAGNOSIS:
A. LEFT COLON, HEMICOLECTOMY:

- INVASIVE MODERATE TO POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA.
- TUMOR IS 6.0 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION.
- TUMOR INVADES TRANSMURALLY TO INVOLVE SUBSEROSA.
- SURGICAL MARGINS FREE OF TUMOR.
- SEE NOTE.
- SEE TEMPLATE.

- EIGHT OF SEVENTEEN PERICOLONIC LYMPH NODES POSITIVE FOR

METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA (8/17).

- FOCAL EXTRANODAL EXTENSION IS IDENTIFIED.

NOTE: This tumor extends well beyond muscularis propria (>5 mm) into the subserosal soft tissue.
Focally the tumor closely approaches the inked peritoneal and radial surfaces, but does not quite reach
them in the sections examined.

SPECIMEN(S):

A. LEFT COLON

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. LEFT COLON:
Received fresh for tissue procurement labeled with the patient's name and “left colon”, and “distal
margin-double, single-proximal margin”, is a segment of colon, 21.5 cm. in length, with an indurated
serosal surface involving 8.5 cm. of its length, and a puckering in the region of a large mass bulging
from the colonic surface. The staples closing the proximal and distal ends are removed, and the colon
is opened to reveal a circumferential tumor 4 cm in length, 6 cm in circumference, and 2.3 cm maximum
height. The tumor is centrally ulcerated with heaped-up borders that are approximately 1 cm. above the
mucosal surface. The tumor is 9.5 cm. from the proximal margin and 7.8 cm. from the distal margin.
The circumference of the proximal bowel is 10 cm, the distal bowel 5.5 cm, and the circumference is
narrowed to 3.7 cm. in the area of the tumor. The cut surface of the tumor is tan-white, and the central
ulcerated area is coated with purulent material. There is a polypoid projection of the mucosa at the
distal edge of the tumor measuring 0.4x0.6 cm., raised above the mucosal surface 0.7 cm. In the
region of serosal puckering, the tumor is 1.2 cm. deep, and appears to extend through the muscularis
and into the subserosal fat. Adjacent to this area there are three tan-white nodules in the subserosal
fat, 1.1 cm., 1 cm. and 0.7 cm. in maximum dimension. Two additional nodules are identified in the

subserosal fat 1.1 cm. in maximum dimension. The mucosa surrounding the tumor is tan-pink, normally
folded, with no masses or polyps identified. Multiple possible lymph nodes are identified in the attached
fat. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

A1 : proximal margin, 2 pieces

A2: distal margin

A3: deepest extent of tumor, 1 piece

A4,A5: three nodules in subserosal fat, A5 is adjacent to A4, 1 piece each
A6: tumor in adjacent proximal mucosa, 1 piece

A7: central ulceration adjacent to A6, 1 piece

A8: polypoid region, distal border of tumor, 1 piece

A9: deep continuation of A8, 1 piece

A10: normal mucosa adjacent to A9, 1 piece

A1 1 : tumor and adjacent proximal mucosa, 1 piece

A12: nodules in subserosal fat, 1 cm. in diameter, 1 piece

A13: 0.7 cm. diameter nodule and subserosal fat, 1 piece

A14: normal proximal mucosa, 2 pieces

A15: normal distal mucosa, 2 pieces

A16: four possible lymph nodes in fat proximal to tumor

A17: seven possible lymph nodes in fat proximal to tumor

A18: four possible lymph nodes in fat proximal to tumor

A19,A20, possible lymph nodes in fat proximal to tumor, 7 each

A21 ,A22: possible lymph nodes adjacent to tumor, 4 each

A23: five possible lymph nodes adjacent to tumor

A24: six possible lymph nodes distal to tumor

A25: five possible lymph nodes distal to tumor

A26: six possible lymph nodes, distal to tumor

A27: three possible lymph nodes, distal to tumor
