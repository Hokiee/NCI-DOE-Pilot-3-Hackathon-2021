CHIEF COMPLAINTIPRE-OPIPOSTOP DIAGNOSIS: Squamous ceII cancer right tongue
PROCEDURE: Partial gtossectomy

SPECIFIC CLINICAL QUESTION: Yes, squamous ceII carcinoma

OUTSIDE TISSUE DIAGNOSIS: No

PRIOR MALIGNANCY: No

CHEMOTHERAPY: No

ORGAN TRANSPLANT: No

IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: No

OTHER DISEASES: No

 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

PART 1: RIGHT PARTIAL GLOSSECTOMY —-
A. SQUAIVIOUS CELL CARCINOMA, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED WITH DEEP INVASION OF LINGUAL
MUSCULATURE (1.9 CM) (see comment). '
PERINEURAL INVASION IS SEEN.
MARGINS OF RESECTION ARE FREE OF TUMOR.
ALTHOUGH THE DEE}:| MARGIN OF RESECTION IS TECHNICALLY FREE OF TUMOR, THE TUMOR IS LESS
THAN 1 MM FROM THE MARGIN. I SEE PART 2FOR ADDITIONAL MARGINS).

Part 1 is identiﬁed as "right partial giossectomy, stitch anterior" and [S Iabeied with the patient's name and initials. Received as a
3. O x 3 5 x 1. 5 cm partial giossectomy. Suture marks anterior. The mucosal surface IS ﬁrm focaiiy ulcerated and pale tan white.
The deep surface IS red tan and roughened On cross- section the cut surface shows a poorly defined ﬁrm irregular soiid white
mass coming to within 0.2 cm of the deep margin. A shave cross section of the ventrai margin and radial cross-sections in relation
to deep margin are taken for intraoperative frozen section diagnostic evaluation.

Digitai imaging photographs are taken.

Part 2 is identiﬁed as ”dorsal and deep margin, stitch anterior" and is iabeled with the patients name and initiate. Received is a
