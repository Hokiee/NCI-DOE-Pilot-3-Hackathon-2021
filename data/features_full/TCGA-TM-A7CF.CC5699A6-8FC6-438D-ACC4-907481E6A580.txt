CLiNlCAL:

Grade ll insular glioma.

MACROSCOPIC:
A. Specimen labelled "t brain tumour“. consists of multiple pieces of light grey to tan

gliat tissue ranging in size between 3~16mm, with an aggregate measurement of 40 x
25 x 6mm. AE 2 blocks.

B. Specimen labelled "2 most aggressive tumour", consists of a 2 xtxtmm fragment
of ten tissue. AE 1 block. ‘

MlCROSCOPIC:

A, B. All tissue pieces are extensively inﬁltrated by a glioma. The cellularity varies
from moderate in the sample labelled ”1 brain tumour”. to more cellular in the 2nd
specimen labelled "2 most aggressive tumour". Moderate cellular pleomorphism is
noted. which is perhaps more prominent in specimen 1. Only very rare mitotic
ﬁgures are identiﬁed'in the "1 brain tumour“ and there are no mitotic ﬁgures in "2
most aggressive tumour“. There is no necrosis or perivescular proliferation.

lmmunogerogcjgase stains:
Ki«67 (proliferative index): is well under 1% in both specimens.

Despite the ﬁnding of very rare mitotic ﬁgures, the overall features are considered to
be within the spectrum of a diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade 2).

SUMMARY:
A. 3. Brain tumour. biopsies:
DIFFUSE‘ASTROCYTOMA (WHO grade 2).
