node #1, level 1, left axilla'. It consists of two lymph nodes measuring
1.0 and 0.5 cm. They are bisected and entirely frozen.

Summary of Sections:
PSC - Frozen section control

2) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled "Sentinel
node #2, level 1, left axilla". It consists of one large lymph node,
measuring 2.5 cm. The specimen is bisected and submitted in two cassettes.

Summary of Sections:
FSCA - Frozen section control A
FSCB - Frozen section control B

3) The specimen is received fresh, labeled l'I.eft breast. stitch marks
axillary tail". It consists of a 34 x 22 x 6 cm mastectomy with a 30 x 12
cm ellipse of skin and a 1.5 cm everted nipple. A mass is palpable in the
