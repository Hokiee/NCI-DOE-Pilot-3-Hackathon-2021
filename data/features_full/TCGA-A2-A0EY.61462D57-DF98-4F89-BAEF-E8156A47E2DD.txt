CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY:
y/o female with history of right breast carcinoma.

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
None provided.

POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
None provided.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh, labeled with the patient' s name, _ and
designated "RIGHT BREAST LUMPECTOMY" consists of a breast lumpectomy
specimen, measuring 9.0 cm from superior to inferior; 8. 8 cm from medial
to lateral; and 3.0 cm from superior to inferior. The specimen is
oriented with a long suture marking the lateral margin; and a short suture
marking the superior margin. The overlying ellipse of tan skin measures
6.0 x 1.8 cm. The specimen is differentially inked as follows: blue —
superior; green - inferior; orange - anterior; black - posterior; red —
lateral; and yellow — medial. The specimen is serially sectioned from

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
Patient: _ __ _ Specimen #: 1 -- -.1.

GROSS DESCRIPTION (continued):

anterior to posterior to reveal a sharply—circumscribed, firm, ovoid mass
with a homgenous tan cut surface, measuring 2.8 x 2.6 x 1.6 cm in overall
dimensions. This mass is located in the posterior half of the specimen,
and measures 0.4 cm from the nearest margin (inferior). The remaining
tissue is mostly fatty with admixed areas of fibrosis, especially
posteriorly. Skin, tumor, and grossly unremarkable fibrous tissue are
sampled for the CBCP Protocol with matching paraffin sections in cassettes
A1,A2-A6 and A7. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1-
skin; A2~tumor; A3-6 — tumor with inferior margin; A7—fibrous tissue
with posterior and superior margins; AB-fibrous tissue with superior
margin; A9—10— anterior margin; A11-12— lateral margin; A13—14—medial
margin. "“’

B: Received in formalin, labeled with the patient’s name,
ad designated "ADDITIONAL INFERIOR MARGIN" consists of an irregular

fragment of tan—yellow, lobulated adipose tissue, measuring 5.5 x 1.9 x
0.8 cm in overall dimensions. The specimen is received oriented with
steel surgical clips marking the true new margin. This new margin is
inked blue, and the opposing surface is inked orange. The specimen is
serially sectioned to reveal a tan—yellow, fatty cut surface without
evidence of residual tumor. The specimen is entirely submitted in six
cassettes. _
C: Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name,

d designated "ADDITIONAL DEEP MARGINS" consists of an irregular
portion of tan—yellow, lobulated adipose tissue measuring 4.7 x 3.9 x 1.1
cm in overall dimensions. The true new margin is marked with surgical
clips, this margin is inked blue, and the opposing surface is inked
orange. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a homogenous
tan-yellow, fatty cut surface without exidence of residual tumor.
Representative sections are submitted in six cassettes. ' '

D: Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, _ .
designated "SENTINEL NODE #1" consists of a single irregular fragment of
tan-yellow adipose tissue, measuring 2.0 x 1.8 x 0.5 cm in overall
dimensions. Palpation of the specimen reveals a single tan-pink lymph
node, measuring 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm in overall dimensions. A small portion
of the lymph node is sampled for the CBCP Protocol with matching paraffin
section in D1, and the remainder of the specimen is submitted in cassette

D2.

E: Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name,
and designated “SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2" consists of a similar irregular
