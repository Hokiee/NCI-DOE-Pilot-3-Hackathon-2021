A. The specimen received in formalin is a product of segmentectomv of liver.
measuring i615x8x4.50m and weighing ZBOgm. the capsular sortaoe-and
parenchymat resection margin are clear. On serial sections. there is a muttinodular
contluent expanding nodular typo mass. measuring 2.5x2.5x2.4om. The mass

'greenish mass, measuring 1 5xt.5xi 4cm. The mass is abutting capsule and is
O.iom apart from parenohymal resection margin. This mass is Sam apart from the
larger mass. Remaining parenohyma is unremarkable. Representative sections
are embeoded in 7 cassettes. (AtenoQLlaroer mass one ptane, ASand4-larger
