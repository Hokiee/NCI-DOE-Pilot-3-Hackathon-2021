FINAL DIAGNOSIS

LEFT KIDNEY NEPHRECTOMY -
A. RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR) CELL TYPE WITH SARCOMATOID FEATURES WITH

LARGE “RHABDOID”-TYPE CELLS WITH BIZARRE ATYPIA (See Comment).

B. FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE IS 414.

C. RENAL CELL CARCINOMA GROWS IN ACINAR. PAPILLARY AND TUBULAR PATTERNS OF GROWTH.

D. THE GREATEST DIAMETER OF THE NEOPLASM IS 10.5 CM.

E. THE NEOPLASM EXTENDS THROUGH THE RENAL CAPSULE WITH MULTIPLE SATELLITE NODULES, BUT IS
CONFINED WITHIN GEROTA FASCIA.

F. NO INVASION OF THE RENAL VEIN IS IDENTIFIED.

G. ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

H. ALL SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF THE NEOPLASM. ,1

I. THE NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY IS UNREMARKABLE.

J. THE ADRENAL GLAND IS NOT SUBMITTED.

K. N0 LYMPH NODES ARE IDENTIFIED.

L. TNM STAGE: pT3 NX MX.

  

LOGIC GRADE = G4.

COMMENT:
This tumor has an unusal morphology with areas closely resembling clear cell type carcinoma which are admixed with

additional more high grade spindle cell components including those with tumor nuclei that are markedly enlarged, with
macronuclei. irregular nuclear shapes and pleomorphism. In addition, there are areas with glanduiar formation,
remniscent of an “intestinal" type morphology. Taken together, these are unusual histological findings.
