FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS N

. F)
Soﬁe.- W 03 dbl grades/19

A. Anterior prostatic fat, biopsy: Benign vascular ﬁbroadipose tissue, no tumor, no
epithelium.

B. Posterior bladder margin, biopsy: Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score
4+4=8, in ﬁbroadipose tissue, nerve, ganglia and suspicious for lymphatic invasion.

C. Posterior peritoneum, biopsy: Benign peritoneal tissue and fibroadipose tissue, no
tumor.

D. Right pelvic lymph nodes, dissection: Two benign lymph nodes, no tumor (0/2).
E. Left pelvic lymph nodes, dissection: No tumor in ﬁve lymph nodes (0/5).

F. Prostate gland, bilateral seminal vesicles, prostatectomy: Prostatic
adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 5+4 = 9, with florid extraprostatic extension and
bilateral seminal vesicle invasion, at three different inked resection margins; see
comment.

COMMENT:

This case was amended on * to add results of additional tissue submitted for part D. At the
request of the clinician, the remainder of parts 0 and E were submitted to evaluate for the presence of
additional lymph nodes, and one additional lymph node without tumor was identiﬁed. This is now
reﬂected in the gross description (all material of parts D and E now submitted, with additional blocks DZ
and D3, and E2), and in the final diagnosis where and additional lymph node of part D is without tumor,
and in the comment where total number of lymph nodes present in changed from 6 to 7. No other
changes were made to this report.

The majority of the prostatic tissue (>85%) is involved by high-grade small acinar adenocarcinoma.

Only scant residual benign prostate is seen, and while all of this appears atrophic suggestive of
preoperative hormone deprivation therapy, the tumor shows recognizable areas of Gleason patterns 3, 4
and 5 tumor, and therefore a grade is still reported. Three different margins have tumor at ink that are
all in areas of extraprostatic extension; left anterior apex (at lest 3mm, slides F4, F14), left posterior
quadrant along posterior seminal vesicle (scattered microscopic foci, slides F13, F20), and right bladder
resection margin (1mm slide F17). However, extensive cautery artifact precludes the grading of the
carcinoma at these margins. in addition, tumor is present in adipose tissue and nerve of the separate
specimen named ”posterior bladder margin" (Slide 31), but no tumor is seen in the smooth (detrusor)
muscle of this specimen. Extensive involvement of both the right and left seminal vesicles is also
observed, as well as ﬂorid extraprostatic extension, the largest contiguous of such being at least 2cm
(left Base).

Synoptic Comment for Prostate Tumors

- Type of tumor: Small acinar adenocarcinoma.

- Location of tumor: Throughout entire prostate, most extensive posteriorly, and on the left (right
anterior base apparently contains less tumor).

- Estimated volume of tumor: As tumor is almost completely replacing (at least 85%) this 40 gram
prostate, tumor volume is at least 30cc.

- Gleason score: 5+4; primary pattern 5, secondary pattern 4.

- Estimated volume > Gleason pattern 3: Greater than 90%.

- Involvement of capsule: Present, numerous areas.

- Extraprostatlc extension: Present, extensive, multiple areas, largest contiguous area at least 2cm
(left base).

- Margin status for tumor: Positive (at least 3mm left anterior apex, slides F4, F14; left posterior
base, slides F13, F20 right bladder margin (slide F17). Gleason pattern at largest positive margin:
Grading is precluded by extensive cautery artifact, but appears high grade (4 or 5).

- Margin status for benign prostate glands: None present.

- High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasla (HG-PIN): Present; focally.

- Tumor involvement of seminal vesicle: Present; both sides.

- Perineural infiltration: Present, extensive.

- Lymph node status: Negative; total number of nodes examined: 7.

- AJCC/UICC stage: pT3bNOR1 (If the patient did receive adequate/appropriate neoadjuvant ADT
course, the grade would be ypT3bNOR1; correlate with clinical history).

Clinical History
The patient is a ‘year-old man who per the electronic medical record _ has a PSA of
ho was found to have prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason 4 + 4 ( see prior report

( . He now undergoes a robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and bilateral
pelvrc lymph node dissection.

Gross Description

The specimen is received in six parts, each labeled with the patient‘s name and medical record number.
Parts A-E are all received in formalin. Part F is received fresh.

Part A is additionally labeled “anterior prostatic fat.“ and consists of two soft, irregular, unoriented,
tan-yellow fibrofatty tissue fragments (4.5 x 3.7 x 0.6 cm in aggregate). No nodules or masses are
palpated. Representative sections are submitted in cassette A1.

 

Part B is additionally labeled “posterior bladder margin," and consists of a single ﬁrm, unoriented,
tan-white tissue fragment (1.3 x1 x 0.4 cm). The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette B1. ‘

Part C is additionally labeled "posterior peritoneum," and consists of a single soft, irregular, unoriented
tan-white to yellow-brown tissue fragment (3.1 x 1.6 x 0.3 cm). One side is smooth, shiny and
white-tan, while the opposite side is roughened and tan-brown. The roughened side is inked blue and
the entire specimen is submitted in cassette C1.

Part D is additionally labeled "right pelvic lymph node," and consists of a single soft to ﬁrm, irregular,
unoriented tan-yellow/brown fibrofatty tissue fragment (4.8 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm). A single candidate lymph
node (3.3 cm in greatest dimension) is round and submitted in cassette D1. The remainder of the
tissue is entirely submitted in cassettes DZ and D3.

Part E is additionally labeled “left pelvic lymph node," and consists of three soft to firm, irregular,
unoriented, tan-yellow fibrofatty tissue fragments (3.2 x 1.7 x 0.7 cm in aggregate). Four candidate

lymph nodes (0.5 - 2.7 cm in greatest dimension) are found and submitted in cassette E1. The
remaining tissue is entirely submitted in cassette E2.

Part F is additionally labeled "prostate and seminal vesicles," and consists of a radical prostatectomy
specimen (39.5 gm ; 4 cm from apex to base x 4 cm in width x 3.5 cm from anterior to posterior).
GROSS PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: Making up approximately 85% of the prostate is a tan-yellow, ﬁrm,
rubbery area (4 x 3.3 x 2 cm). It extends from the left posterior apex and spreads into both the left
and right sides, stopping 0.2 cm from the bladder margin. The anterior ﬁbrous stroma is red,
roughened and is opened. The remaining capsule is intact. The remaining prostatic parenchyma is tan.

The seminal vesicle/yes deferens bundles (right 3.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm; left 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm) are soft,
lobulated, red~tan without obvious lesion or mass. Some of the prostate is taken by the

ORIENTED BY: Anatomic landmarks, seminal vesicles, urethra.
