TWP?!”

PART 4: LYMPH NODE, LEVEL 4, BIOPSY —
ONE (1) LYMPH NODE WITH ANTHRACOTIC PIGMENT DEPOSITS, FREE OF TUMOR (011)..

PART 5: LYMPH NODE LEVEL 10, BIOPSY - '
ONE (1) BENIGN LYMPH NODE, FREE OF TUMOR (011).

PART 6: LYMPH NODE, LEVEL 7, BIOPSY -
ONE (1) BENIGN LYMPH NODE, FREE OF TUMOR (011).

COMMENT: ‘
Special elastic stains performed on slides 3A and 33 with adequate controls are negative for tumor invasion of visceral
pleura.
Molecular studies were performed on the previous right upper lobe FNA mops-hey are EGFR,
_ KRAS‘ and BRAF negative. ALK FISH studies positive.
