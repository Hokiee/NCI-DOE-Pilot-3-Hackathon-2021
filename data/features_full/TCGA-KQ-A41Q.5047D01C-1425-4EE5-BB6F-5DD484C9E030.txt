GROSS DESCRIPTION:

Invasive urothelial carcinoma, high grade.

The carcinoma invades through the muscularis propria into the
perivesieal fat.

Lymphovaseular invasion is not identiﬁed.

All surgical resection margins are negative for carcinoma.

Carcinoma in-situ is identiﬁed.

The remaining bladder shows chronic inﬂammation and focal biopsy site
changes.

Two lymph nodes, negative for metastatic carcinoma (ll/2).

TNM: T31), N0, MX

Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3+4=7.

The tumor involves the right lobe and is organ conﬁned.
Lymphovascular and perineum! invasion are not identiﬁed.
Seminal vesicles and all surgical margins are negative [or tumor.
Seminal vesicles show amyloid deposition (conﬁrmed with congo red
stain).

TNM: T2a, N0, MX

Eleven lymph nodes, negative for metastch carcinoma (0111).
Fifteen lymph nodes, negative for metastatic carcinoma (0115).
Benign segment of ureter with chronic inflammation.

Benign segment of ureter with chronic inﬂammation.

A. Received fresh, the specimen is labeled “bladder." and consists of a 24.0 x l6.0 x 6.0 cm specimen which includes a 9.0 x 8.0 x
5.5 cM bladder, a 5.0 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm prostate , a LS x 0.7 cm right ureter. and LO x 0.5 cm lcﬁ ureter. The right seminal vesicle

measures 4.0 x l.2 x 0.9 cm and the left seminal vesicle measures 4.5 x l.5 x 0.8 cm. The right vas deferens measures 13.0 x 0.4
cm and the left vas deferens measures [4.5 x 0.5 cm. The perivesical fat is inked green. The right side of the prostate is inked green
and the leﬂ side black. Go cut section, there is a 7.0 x 5.5 cm fungating necrotic mass with raised edematous borders involving the
right anterior and lateral walls and grossly invading the perivesicle fat. The remainder of the bladder is trabeculated with multiple
diverticula. There is a bladder neck polypoid mass measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. The prostate and is serially sectioned and shows
grossly unremarkable cut surfaces. Representative sections are submitted. Summary of sections: Al-right ureter margin: A2-leﬂ
ureter margin; Ali-urethral margin; A4 through A l 3-representative tumor; A l4-anterior bladder. A l S-posterior bladder; A I 6-leﬂ

prostate: A26-LPC prostate; A27-RC prostate; A28-LAE prostate; A29-LPE prostate; AJO-RAE prostate; A3l-RPE prostate;
A32—LG prostate: A33-LG prostate; A34-RG prostate; A36-RG prostate; A37-lcfl seminal vesicle; A38-right seminal vesicle.

lymph nodes. The specimen is submitted entirely. Summary of sections: Cl and C2-one lymph node bisected; C3 and C4-one
lymph node; CS- l O—remaining tissue.

and stitch. The specimen is submitted entirely. Summary of sections: Di.
