Gross: The specimens are received in two formalin—filled containers, each labeled with the
patient's name.

The first cantainer, designated "bladder biopsy, " holds six minute, pale white to glistening
yellow tissue fragments. The largest fragment measures 0.7 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm. The tissue is
entirely submitted in cassette A. Jar 0.

The second container, designated "vaginal-cervical biopsy,“ holds a 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm
tan-brown tissue fragment with a roughened, friable surface. The tissue is bisected and
entirely submitted in B. Jar 0. "
