The examination of this case material and the preparation of this report were
performed by the staff pathologist.

Note:

Biopsies of this thymoma, including both H\T\E and immunohistochemical stains,

were previously reviewed. The tumor was classified as Thymoma WHO type mixed A/B.
lmmunohistochemical stains are not repeated at this time.

Gross Description:

A. Received fresh, labeled "thymus and tumor," is a

17.5 x 11.5 x 4.4 cm tan, lobulated, irregular fatty tissue partially surfaced

by a tan-pink, smooth, glistening serosa. Sectioning reveals a 5.3 x 5.1 x 3.7

cm tan-white, homogeneous, rubbery, faintly nodular mass which abuts the serosa
and inked resection margin. Within the fat adjacent to the mass are multiple
smooth walled, uni/multilobulated cysts, up to 3 cm. A 0.7 cm tan-black,
anthracotic lymph node is present in the attached fat. Representative sections

to include mass and nearest inked resection margin are submitted for frozen
section microscopy, now in cassette A1.

Representative sections of the remaining tissue are submitted as follows:
2 mass to inked resection margin;
3 mass to serosa;
4 mass to adjacent fat;
5-6 cysts adjacent to mass;
7 one whole lymph node bisected.

B. Received in formalin, labeled "superior thymus

margin," is a 4.4 x 2.6 x 0.8 cm tan, lobulated, irregular fatty tissue.
Sectioning reveals a tan, lobulated cut surface with no discrete lesions.
Representative sections are submitted in two cassettes.

C. Received in formalin, labeled "lateral thymus," is a
2.4 x 1.9 x 0.5 cm tan, lobulated, irregular fatty tissue. The cut surface is

tan, lobulated, with no discrete lesions. The specimen is entirely submitted in
two cassettes.

D. Received fresh, labeled "pericardial phrenic
margin," is a 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm tan, irregular soft tissue, submitted in toto
for frozen section microscopy, now in cassette D.
