6)The specimen is received fresh, labeled ”thyroid gland and centralycorhp‘o‘nent lymph nodes“ and consists of a thyroid weighing
20.5 g. The right lobe measures 5.5x2.3x1 cm . the left lobe measures 3x2.5x1.5 cm and the isthmus measures 1x2.2x0.6 cm.
The external surface is covered by a thin ﬁbrous capsule. The posterior surface of the specimen is inked black. and the anterior is
inked blue. Sectioning reveals 7 well circumscribed nodules (3 in right lobe and 4 in left lobe) ranging from 0.4 cm to 1.6 cm in
greatest dimension. The largest nodule has ten brown ﬂeshy cut surface and is located within the right lobe. Other nodules have
yellowish cut surface. No lymph node is identified. Representative sections of the largest nodule is submitted for TPS. The
remaining tissue is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.
