Procedure: q -S ’12
Reason for revision: Removal of voice recognition error in the “Qt;
diagnosis.

Diagnosis

A. Lung, posterior apical segment right upper lobe, resection:
Scattered clusters of atypical cells compatible with moderately
differentiated adenocarcinoma. Emphysema and subpleural elastosis.

B. Lymph node, level XI, biopsy: A single lymph node is negative for

malignancy.

C. Lymph node, level VII, biopsy: A single lymph node is negative for
malignancy

D. Lymph node, level X, biopsy: A single lymph node is negative for
malignancy

E. Lung, right upper lobe, resection: Moderately differentiated
adenocarcinoma

F. 2R fat, biopsy: There is no evidence of malignancy in either of 2
lymph nodes

Microscopic Description:

E

Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma

Histologic grade: 2

Tumor size: 1 cm

Bronchial resection margin: Negative for malignancy

Pulmonary margin of resection: Negative for malignancy

Pleura: Negative for malignancy

Vascular invasion: Absent

Attached lymph nodes: There is no evidence of malignancy in any of 3

peribronchial lymph nodes.

pTNM stage: T1 (parts of the tumor were in specimens A and B, so the
size of the tumor is difficult to determine).

Non~tumorous lung: Emphysema and subpleural elastosis. Arteriolar

medial hypertrophy.

Specimen

A Lung, posterior apical segment right upper lobe
B. Level XI
C. Level VII
D. Level X node

E. Right upper lobe
F. 2R fat

Intraoperative Consultation
A. Posterior apical segment right upper lobe, wedge biopsy: Non small
cell carcinoma at stapled margin.

Gross Description

A. Received fresh for frozen section labeled "A. right posterior
apical segment right upper lobe" is a 7 x 2.5 I2 0.0 cm wedge biopsy of
lung with 8 cm stapled resection margin. The pleura appears red smooth
and unremarkable. A vaguely palpable nodule is present in the center
of the specimen. The stapled resection margins are removed the
pulmonary parenchyma deep to the stapled margin is inked black. The
specimen is sectioned to reveal a red spongy cut surface without a
definitive mass. A representative sections are frozen as frozen
section AFB 1 and 2. The remainder of the tissue except for the
stapled margin is entirely submitted for permanent sections AS— 10

Specimen B. is received unfixed labeled level XI and consists of a
piece of black soft tissue measuring 0.2 cm in greatest dimension. AS—l

Specimen C. is received unfixed labeled level VII and consists of a
piece of black soft tissue measuring 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. AS—l

Specimen D. is received unfixed labeled level X node and consists of a
piece of red and black soft tissue measuring 1 cm in greatest
dimension. AS-l

Specimen E. is received unfixed in the right upper lobe and consists of
a red and black lung lobe measuring 14 by 11 point by 4 cm. Received is
additional small irregular piece of stapled lung tissue measuring 2.5 x
1.5 x 0.6 7 cm.l lobe is sectioned at 1 cm intervals. There is a
relatively central defect in the pleural surface that may represent the
site of the previous biopsy . There is a small tan—white areas of
subpleural an adjacent to the defect that is compatible with tumor and
measures 1 cm diameter. A portion of tumor is taken for research
purposes. Sections after fixation.

Block summary: 1 bronchial/vascular margins; 2,3 pulmonary margins: 4—6
tumor; 7,8 normal lung.

Specimen F. is received unfixed labeled "2R fat pad" and consists of
multiple pieces of yellow and red soft tissue occupying approximately
one mL in volume. AS—l
