left renal mass Operative Findings: large left renal mass

SPECIMENS SUBMITTED: 1. KIDNEY, LEFT

GROSS DESCRIPTION: One specimen is received fresh with the patient's name, medical record number and
further speciﬁed as “left kidney". It consists of a radical nephrectomy specimen weighing 323 grams and
measuring 16 x 9.5 x 4 cm with surrounding fat. During procurement. a cut is made in the center to reveal a tan-
red mass measuring 7 x 5.5 x 3.5 cm occupyin the center of the kidney and involving the hilum. Approximately
2.5 x 2 x 2 cm of tumor tissue is procured for h Approximately 1.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm of normal tissue is

procured for the q A 1 x 1 x 1 cm of norma issue was rocured for them The
procurement was pe ormed WW In the ross oom, especimen
matches the above description. e a ipose Issue an Iar region IS Inked in black. The ureter is identiﬁed and

measures 6 cm in length and up to 0.4 cm in diameter. Upon sectioning, it appears that the tumor has invaded
the hilum and the perirenal, perihilar fat. Large vessels and ureter appear grossly free of tumor. In the anterior
aspect of the kidney, there is an area of adhesion between the capsule and the tumor, suspicious for invasion of
perirenal fat. Very small amounts of adrenal tissue measuring 2 x 0.3 cm is identiﬁed in the upper pole.
Sectioning the tumor appears to have a central necrosis. On further sectioning, It appears that the mass is away
from the periphery of the kidney and involves the primary the hilar region. The tumor appears to abut a dilated
calyx and the pelvic ureter without invading it

Representative sections are submitted as follow:
A vascular margin, '
B adrenal tissue,

C-F tumor and hilar region, .

G tumor and dilated pelvic region,

H kidney with adhesion on capsule

L ureter margin
