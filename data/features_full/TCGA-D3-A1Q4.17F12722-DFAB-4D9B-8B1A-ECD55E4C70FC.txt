GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) WLE LEFT CALF - A skin ellipse (8.0 x 3.4 x 2.8 cm) with underlying subcutaneous tissue. On the
epidermal surface is a 1.5 cm irregular scar, located at the central portion of the specimen. A short stitch
designates superior; a long stitch designates posterior. The specimen is serially sectioned from anterior to
posterior. No lesions are identified.

SECTION CODE: A1, anterior tip e face; A2, posterior tip en face; A3—A5, one Slice divided in
three cassettes (scar); A6-A11, one Slice divided into six cassettes (scar). The scar is entirely submitted.

INK CODE: Blue - superior - deep; black - tip; blue - inferior - _. .

(B) LEFT SUPERFICIAL INGUINAL LYMPH NODES - A unremarkable skin ellipse (14.0 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm
and underlying soft tissue 30.0 x 9.0 x 4.0 cm). Both lymph nodes are dissected and range in size from
0.5 cm to 4.0 cm in diameter. The larger lymph node iS grossly affected by metastatic disease.

SECTION CODE: B1, one lymph node bisected; 82, one lymph node bisected; B3, one lymph
node trisected; B4-B5, multiple lymph nodes per cassette; B6, B7, larger lymph node (representative
sections); B8, skin. Half portion of the larger lymph node is submitted for Tissue Bank.

(C) RIGHT TOE PLANTAR NEST - A 0.8 cm tan-firm and tan-brown firm lymph node. Submitted in toto
in cassette C.

(D) LEFT ILIAC AND OBTURATOR LYMPH NODE - A 7.0 x 4.0 x 1.2 cm portion of fibroadipose tissue.
Multiple lymph nodes are dissected and excised from 0.3 cm to 2.1 cm in diameter.

SECTION CODE: D1, one lymph node dissected; DZ, one lymph node; DB, one lymph node; D4,
one lymph node; D5, one lymph node; D6, one lymph node. ‘ ‘ ‘
