portion of the tumor is rough. hemorrhagic, and somewhat shaggy and has a
necrotic appearance. The necrosis involves 80% olthe surface of the
tumor. There are ten-gray. nodular. viable areas at the peripheral margin of
the tumor. On section. this tumor can be seen to deeply Invade the bladder wall

additional lesions noted. Sectioning through the prostate reveals a normal
