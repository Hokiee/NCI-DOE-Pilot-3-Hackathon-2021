museum
Specimen is received in 4 parts:

A. The specimen is labeled “LEFT HIGHEST AXILLARY NODE" and is received unﬁxed. It consists of one nodule of fatty yellow-
tan tissue with staples measuring 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. 0n sectioning. there is one lymph node identified measuring 0.7 cm in maximum
dimensions. The lymph node is biSected and entirely submitted in cassette A1.

Time Specimen was removed from the patient
Time specimen was sectioned and placed in formalin:
Ischemic time: 30 minutes

13. The specimen is labeled "LEFT BREAST AND AXIILARY CONTENTS" and is received in formalin. (The specimen is in the
formalin more than It consist of mastectomy specimen with lymph nodes weighing 480 grams and
measuring 24 x 18 x 5 cm with brown skin ellipse measuring 17 x 4 cm, containing grossly unremarkable 1.5 cm in diameter nipple.
[The skin is tagged with a black stitch designating 12:00]. The posterior margin is composed of smooth fascia which is inked black.
The anterior margin of resection is inked with blue ink. The breast is slices in sagittal planes revealing 3 x 3 x 2.5 cm an illsdeﬁned
white-tan mass which is 1.5 cm away from the deep fascia] margin of resection. This mass is located in the upper outer quadrant
(approximately 2:00 position). The remaining portions reveal unremarkable yellow mammary fat with streaks of white-gray
mammary parerichyma. An axillary fat pad measuring 7 x 5 x 3 cm. On sectioning multiple lymph nodes are identiﬁed. Some lymph
nodes are white in and ﬁrm in consistency. The largest lymph node measuring 2 cm in greatest diameter. Representative sections are
submitted as follows:

B1 = nipple

32-85 = mass

so = mass closest deep fascial margin of resection

B7 = upper inner quadrant

BS = lower inner quadrant

89 = lower outer quadrant

BIO = 6 lymph nodes

Bll = bisection of a single lymph node

BIZ = bisection of a single lymph node

B13 = representative sections of 3 lymph nodes

314 = bisection of a single lymph node

B15 = representative section of the single lymph node

B. 16 = bisection of a single lymph node

3-1? = two small lymph nodes

maximum dimensions. On sectioning, there is a ﬁrm white area measuring 1.0 x 1.0 cm in maximum dimensions beneath the scar.
Representative sections are submitted in cassettes Dl-DZ scar with ﬁrm white area.
