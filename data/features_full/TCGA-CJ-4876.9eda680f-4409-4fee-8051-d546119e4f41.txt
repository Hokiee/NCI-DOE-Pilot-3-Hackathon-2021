DIAGNOSIS
(A) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND:

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTiONAL (70% CLEAR CELLS AND 30%
EOSINOPHILIC CELLS),

FUHRMAN'S NUCLEAR GRADE 3. (SEE COMMENT)

NO EXTENSION INTO THE PERINEPHRIC ADIPOSE TISSUE.

TUMOR MEASURES 10.5 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION.

Ureterai and vascular margins of resection, free of tumor.

Adrenal gland, no tumor present.

COMMENT
The tumor focally bulges into the renal sinus adipose tissue but does

not infiltrate it. ‘

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND - A nephrectomy specimen (23.5 x 15.0
x 6.8 cm), including the kidney (13.5 x 5.0 x 5.0 cm), attached segment

of unremarkable ureter (15.0 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter) and

attached unremarkable previously opened adrenal gland (6.5 x 1.5 x 0.3

cm).

A well-circumscribed tan-yeilow tumor with central gelatinous
areas, focal calcification and hemorrhage is present in the lower pole
of the kidney (10.5 x 9.0 x 5.5 cm) compressing the normal parenchyma
and pushing into the peri-nephric fat. However, the tumor is limited by
the capsule. The tumor is 5.0 cm away from the upper pole and 7.0 cm
from the adrenal glands. The tumor is close, but does not grossly
involve the pelvis, calyx or renal vein.

The pelvis, calyx, and ureter are not dilated. The remaining renal
parenchyma is unremarkable. The adrenal gland is previously opened and
unremarkable.

INK CODE: black, external surface of the specimen close to the
tumor.

SECTION CODE: A1, ureteral resection margin; A2, vascular
resection margins at hiium, A3~A5, tumor with adjacent pelvis and calyx,
and renal vein; A6, tumor with calyx; A7, tumor with closest serosal
surface; AB, tumor; A9, tumor with adjacent normal kidney and
perinephric fat; A10, A11, tumor with perinephric fat; A12, tumor with
adjacent kidney; A13, adrenal gland; A14, unremarkable kidney. -

CLINICAL HISTORY
Left renat mass.
