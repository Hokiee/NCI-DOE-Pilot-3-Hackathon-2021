GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. SLN #1

Received fresh is a tan pink lymph node 2.0 x 0.8 x 0.70m. The specimen is sectioned and a touch prep
is taken. Toto A1.

B. SLN #2

Received fresh is a tan pink lymph node 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.50m. The specimen is sectioned and a touch prep
is taken. Toto B1.

0. LEFT BREAST WLE

Received fresh is an oriented (short-superior, long-lateral, looped—anterior) 2669, 7.00m anterior to
posterior, 10.5cm superior to inferior and 12.0cm medial to lateral, lumpectomy with needle localization
wire. The specimen is inked as follows: Anterior—Blue, Posterior-Black, Superior-Red, Inferior-Orange.
Medial-Green, Lateral-Yellow. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 7 slices,
slice 1 being most medial, slice 7 being most lateral to reveal a gray white stellate ﬁrm mass 2.6 x 1.8 x
1.40m, 1 cm from the closest deep margin in slices 5 and 6. A 0.5 cm nodule is identiﬁed, 0.40m from
the deep margin and 1.5cm from the mass in slice 6. A 0.6 cm nodule is also identiﬁed, 0.5cm from the
deep/lateral margin in slice 7. A surgical clip is identiﬁed in slice 6. A portion of the specimen ls
submmitted for tissue procurement. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

D. ADDTIONAL LATERAL MARGIN-Stitch at ﬁnal margin

Received fresh is an oriented 539 fragment of ﬁbrofatty tissue 10.0 x 6.0 x 3.00m. The new true margin
is Inked Blue and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal grossly unremarkable breast parenchyma.
Renresentative sections are submitted In D1-D10.

E. MEDIAL LEFT BREAST TISSUE

Received In formalin is a 321 g, 25 x 9 x 4 cm yellow-tan ﬁbrofatty breast tissue with 17 x 5 cm skin.
The breast parenchyma consists primarily of fatty breast tissue with few ﬁbrous areas identiﬁed. No
masses or lesions are seen. Representatively submitted in cassettes E1-E5.

F. LATERAL LEFT BREAST TISSUE

Received In formalin Is a 238 g, 12 x 10 x 2.5 cm yellow-tan ﬁbrofatty breast tissue with 12 x 8 cm skin.
On sectioning no masses or lesions are observed. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes
F1-F3.

G. RIGHT BREAST TISSUE

Received in formalin and are multiple pieces of yellow-tan ﬁbrofatty breast tissue with the largest portion
having attached tan skin. The specimen weighs 961 g; the intact tissue measures 40 x 11 x 4.5 cm. On
the surface are two irregularly shaped pieces of tan skin measuring 16 cm in length and 6.5 cm In width
and 12 cm In length by 4 cm in width. The skin surface is unremarkable. The detached ﬁbroadipose
tissue in aggregate measures 12.5 x 8.5 x 3.5 cm. On sectioning the specimen is comprised primarily
Of adipose tissue. No masses or lesions are observed. Representative sections are submitted in
cassettes G1-GtO.

called to Dr. at . . . by Dr.,

ADDENDUM:
NOTE: This addendum Is issued to give the results of lHC as well as to correct an error In the diagnosis
for part G. In part G, it says "(SEE NOTE)"; however, there is no note and therefore, the "(SEE NOTE)"
