MACROSCOPIC
Specimen Type: Pleural resection

Endothoracic fascia

Venous/Lymphatic (Large/ Small Vessel) Invasion (V/L): Absent

Margins: Cannot be assessed
*Pathologic Staging (pTNM): pT3, N0

Primary Tumor (pT): pT3: Tumor (locally advanced but potentially
resectable) involves any of the ipsilateral pleural surfaces, with at least lof
the following: invasion of the endothoracic fascia, invasion into mediastinal
fat, solitary completely resectable focus of tumor invading the soft tissues of
the chest wall, non—transmural involvement of the pericardium

Regional Lymph Nodes (pN): pNO: No regional lymph node metastasis

Comment

This is a biphasic tumor. The majority of the stromal component is highly
cellular with spindle—type hyperchromatic cells that frequently overlap with one
another. There is focally more ﬁbrotic stroma. The spindle cell component
extends into polypoid masses that are covered with single layer of epithelioid
cells. The epithelioid cells are cuboidal to columnar with well—deﬁned cell
borders and clear-to-eosinophilic cytoplasm. This is not classic for
mesothelioma. Therefore the differential diagnosis including synovial sarcoma,
solitary ﬁbrous tumor, carcinosarcoma, metastatic renal cell carcinoma and
malignant peripheral nerve cell tumor was considered.

Immunohistochemistry (controls appropriate): Epithelioid component and
focally the sarcomatoid component are positive for calretinin, WT—l, cytokeratin
(CAM 5.2), EMA, CAIX, B012, D2-40, CK5/6. Sarcomatoid component is focally
positive for SMA with very weak focal positivity for TLE—l. There is very focal
epithelial positivity for MOC31. Tumor is negative for MIC2, Chromogranin, Pax8,
Desmin, BerEP4, CEA, Beta-Catenin, Synaptophysin, TTF-l, CD34 and S-100.
Because the morphology is suggestive of synovial sarcoma, the specimen was
sent for genetic testing for t(x,18) which was negative. The ofﬁcial report is
included below.

Overall, although the morphology is slightly unusual for mesothelioma, and

the loss of keratin staining in a large part of the sarcomatoid tumor is also
unusual, positivity for other mesothelial markers (calretinin, WT-l , CAIX, and
D2-40) supports this diagnosis. Dr. [] has reviewed the case and concurs

with the diagnosis.

Clinical History:
The patient is a -year-old male with malignant spindle cell neoplasm
undergoing pleurectomy, decortication, thoracotomy.

Specimens Received:

A: Right chest wall mass
B: R4 lymph node

C: Number 7

D: Pleural peel

Gross Description:

The specimens are received in four containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.

A. The ﬁrst container is additionally identiﬁed as, "right chest wall mass".
Received fresh and placed in formalin are 4 soft, rubbery, pink-tan tissue
fragments measuring 6.0 x 4.8 x 1.6 cm in aggregate, all of which are'serially
sectioned and representative section submitted as A1 and A2.

B. The second container is additionally identiﬁed as, "R4 lymph node".
Received fresh and placed in formalin are 2 soft, yellow-tan tissue fragments
measuring 4.5 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm and 1.0 x 1.1 x 0.3 cm which are submitted entirely
as follows:

Bl-B2: One lymph node candidate, bisected, a one half in each cassette

B3: 2 lymph node candidates

C. The third container is additionally identiﬁed as, "#7". Received fresh and
placed in formalin are multiple soft, rubbery, pink-tan tissue fragments
measuring 2.7 x 4.5 X 0.9 cm in aggregate are submitted entirely as follows:
Cl: 2 lymph node candidates, bisected

C2: 5 lymph node candidates

C3: 2 lymph node candidates

C4: 5 lymph node candidates

C5: One lymph node candidate, bisected

C6: One lymph node candidate, bisected

D. The fourth container is additionally identiﬁed as, "right pleural".

Received fresh and placed in formalin is a right pleurectomy specimen with a
volumetric measurement of 1250 ml. The specimen is received in 2 large
portions, a tumor mass and a pleura with multiple thickened areas, with a
combined weight of 1105 gm. The tumor mass measures 18.5 x 18.5 x 11.0 cm and
the thickened pleura measures 18.0 x 17.0 x 0.9 cm. According to the

requisition form, there is a stitch designating the diaphragm, which is

identiﬁed. The diaphragm measures 16.0 x 11.0 cm and the abdominal surface of
the diaphragm is inked blue. At this site, the tissue is rubbery, ﬁrm, tan.

There is no adherent pericardium. The parietal pleura is thickened, white—tan,
nodular, rubbery, ﬁbrotic and is intact surrounding the lung. 90% of parietal
pleura received is encased in ﬁrm, yellow-gray tumor nodules measuring up to
5.8 x 2.1 cm located predominantly along the anterolateral aspect of the chest.
The visceral and parietal pleura are thickened up to 0.7 cm and fused. The

diaphragmatic margin is actively involved with tumor and tumor is within 0.2 cm
of the inked resection margin.

Block Summary:

D 1 -D5: diaphragm margin

D6-D7: sections of largest pleura tumor deposits
D8—Dl 2: tumor abutting visceral surface/side
D13—Dl 7: Tumor abutting the chest wall

D1 8—D2l: sections from thickened pleura

D22: thickened piece of adipose tissue
