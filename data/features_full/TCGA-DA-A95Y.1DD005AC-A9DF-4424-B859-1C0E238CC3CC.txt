* Report Electronically Signed Out *

This electronic signature Indicates that the pathologist has personally reviewed the available gross and/or microscopic material and has
based the diagnosis on that evaluation.

 

Gross Specimen

Gross Description.

Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and "right axillary melanoma" Is a 15. O x 11.0 x 8 0 cm irregular portion of
hemorrhagic lobulated f brofatty tissue with a minimal amount of attached skeletal muscle. Multiple lymph nodes are

identiﬁed, some of which are pigmented and matted, ranging from 0.3 cm to 13.0 cm in greatest dimension. A gross
photograph is taken of the 2 largest positive nodes. The lymph nodes are submitted as follows: Cassettes 1-3-multiple
intact nodes, cassettes 4—8-one bisected node in each, cassette 9-one trisected node, Cassettes 10-11-representative
sections of 2 positive nodes in each (4 total), cassette 12-skeletal muscle.

Note: Mutations are described at the protein level using the single-letter amino acid code. X indicates the absence of an amino acid (i.e..
a nonsense mutation, caused by creation of a stop codon in the DNA), and "ts" indicates a frameshift mutation. Mutations are described
at the DNA level using the numbering of the reference gene's coding sequence (rather than the genomic sequence). Standard mutation
nomenclature is used. according to guidelines of the Human Genome Variation Society (http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomenl).

Methodology ,
The patient sample was enriched for tumor by manual or laser-assisted dissection of formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. DNA was
extracted using a commercially available kit (" and quantitated on a spectrophotometer. Mutation detection was perionned using

assays run on a Real-Time PCR instrument " ' Assay sensitivities were determined using serial dilutions (with normal

DNA) OLDNA from positive control samples. Whenever possible, positive controls consisted of DNA from human cell lines bearing the particular mutation being
assayed. For those mutations not present in any available cell line, assay sensitivity testing was performed on positive control FFPE tumor tissues or DNA
