Case Number: —\ 2 ._ _

Diagnosis: "mi/"J 4/63/14
A: Gallbladder, cholecystectomy

— Benign gallbladder with no significant pathologic abnormality
— No carcinoma identified

5552;- Main N93
5770/3

B: Liver and adherent ascending colon and retroperitoneal soft
tissue, segments 5 and 6, partial hepatectomy and en block resection

Histologic tumor type/subtype: hepatocellular carcinoma
Histologic grade: Grade 3 (Edmondson and Steiner)

Number of tumors: 1 primary lesion with multiple subcentimeter
satellite lesions

Tumor size: 11 cm
Tumor location: Segments 5 and 6

Tumor necrosis: present (involves approximately 20% of
microscopically examined tumor)

Worst tumor differentiation: grade 3 (Edmondson and Steiner)
Vascular invasion: present, macrovascular

Perineural invasion: not identified

Capsular invasion: Present

Margins: uninvolved by carcinoma; tumor is 8 mm from the closest
inked retroperitoneal soft tissue margin and 1.7 cm from the hepatic

resection margin (colonic and vascular en face margins negative for
tumor)

Lymph nodes: 11 benign lymph nodes present within pericolonic
adipose tissue (0/11)

Satellite lesions: present (multiple subcentimeter lesions)

Background liver: chronic hepatitis, etiology unknown, grade 1,
stage 2 (see comment)

Other extrahepatic spread: present, tumor focally extends through
the capsule/visceral peritoneum to involve fibrous adhesions (no

microscopic evidence of tumor involvement within underlying colon
and soft tissue)

Additional findings:
- Eleven benign colonic lymph nodes (O/ll)

AJCC Pathologic TNM stage: pT4 pNx

NOTE: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information
available at the time of this report, and is subject to change
pending clinical review and additional information.

C: Bowel, ileum, resection
- Benign small bowel with fibrous serosal adhesions, acute

serositis, and serosal hemorrhage with hemosiderin laden macrophages
- No carcinoma identified

Comment:

Microscopic examination of non—neoplastic liver reveals fibrotic
portal tracts with mild bile ductular proliferation and an
associated chronic lymphocytic infiltrate consisting almost entirely
of lymphocytes. No prominent plasma cell infiltrate is identified.
No piecemeal necrosis is identified. There is mixed macrovesicular
and microvesicular steatosis involving less than 5% of the hepatic

parenchyma and no features are present to suggest involvement by
steatohepatitis.

A trichrome stain highlights areas of periportal fibrosis with no
evidence of bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis. A reticulin stain also
highlights periportal fibrosis but shows an otherwise normal hepatic
plate thickness. A DPAS stain shows no evidence of alpha—l—
antitrypsin deficiency (no DPAS positive globules identified within
hepatocytes). An iron stain shows a mild increase in hepatic

iron (grade 1 of 4). The findings are consistent with chronic
hepatitis, grade 1, stage 2. The differential diagnosis includes
viral hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis. Correlation with clinical
history and laboratory studies is recommended to determine the
etiology of the chronic hepatitis.

Clinical History:

The patient is a —year—old female with a clinical diagnosis of
HCC.

Gross Description:

Specimen A is received with one appropriately labeled container
additionally labeled "gallbladder".

Previously opened or disrupted: No

Measurements: 4.6 x 3.1 x 0.9 cm

External surface: Yellow/green, smooth and glistening
Luminal contents: Green viscous fluid

Stones present: No

Mucosa: Green and velvety

Wall thickness: 1 mm

Other comments: No

Block #: A1 - Cystic duct margin and representative section
Tissue remains in formalin.

Specimen B is received in formalin appropriately labeled "segments 5
and 6".

Specimen Type: Segmentectomy and right hemicolectomy

Specimen Weight: 745 grams

Measurement: 12.5 x 11 x 7 cm segment of liver with attached right
hemicolectomy consisting of 3 cm of terminal ileum and 14 cm of
cecum and ascending colon.

Orientation: Anatomical. The liver resection margin is inked blue.

Capsule: There is a 14.5 cm yellow bulging defect with adherent
mesenteric fat and colon. Where the tumor is adherent to the
mesentery, the surface margin is inked green. The remainder of the
capsule is tan/brown and smooth. Beneath the capsular defect there
is an 11 x 9 x 6.5 cm white to tan nodular partially
circumscribed mass with multiple adjacent budding nodules.

Mass: Further sectioning reveals a blood vessel that is plugged
with tumor thrombus. Additionally, the mass extends through the
capsule to within 1.1 cm of the green inked mesenteric margin. Where
the mass is adherent to the bowel, it appears to extend to but not
grossly invade the capsule. The tumor is 1.7 cm from the blue inked
hepatic resection margin, and widely free of the distal margin.
Adjacent liver tissue: Tan/brown and unremarkable.

The colonic mucosa is pink/tan with normal folding.

The appendix is surgically absent.

Major portal vein/ hepatic vein:

Gallbladder: See specimen A.

Block Summary:

Bl — Closest blue inked resection margin, perpendicular
82 — Proximal colonic margin, en face

B3 — Distal colonic margin, en face

B4 — Tumor in relationship to the capsule and adjacent uninvolved
tissue

B5 - Tumor within a blood vessel

B6 - Representative sections of multiple adjacent tumor nodules
B7 - Additional tumor nodule

B8 ~ Uninvolved liver away

BQ—BlO — Tumor in relationship to the green soft tissue margin,
perpendicular

B11 — Tumor in relationship to the bowel

B12 — Tumor in relationship to lateral sidewall muscle

B13 — Vascular margin with thrombus, en face

B14—BlS — Multiple colonic lymph nodes

Container C is additionally labeled "ileum." It holds a 6 cm in
length x 2.1 cm in diameter segment of small bowel. There is a 2.5 x
1.8 cm area of hemorrhagic adhesions 0.5 cm from the closest mucosal
margin. The serosal surface is pink/tan and smooth. Opening reveals
pink/tan mucosa with normal folding. Beneath the hemorrhagic
adhesions, the cut surface is yellow fat.

Block summary:

C1—C2 — unoriented mucosal margins, en face
C3 - hemorrhagic adhesions, en face
