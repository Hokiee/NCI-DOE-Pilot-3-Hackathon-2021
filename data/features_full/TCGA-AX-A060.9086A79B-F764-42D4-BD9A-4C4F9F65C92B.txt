GROSS DESCRIPTION:

I) Received fresh, labeled with the patient's mane, medical unit number anc "right
adnexa", is a salplngo—oophorectomy specimen including an ovary (3.0 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm)
and attached segment ot fallopian tube with fimbriated end (8.0 cm long and 0.4 cm in
diameter). There are multiple paratubal cysts filled with white to yellow ViSCuS
material (ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 cm in greatest dimension). Upon sectioning of the
ovary, there are multiple corpora albicantia in the parenchyma and a thin smooth
walled cyst (0.7 cm in diameter) filled with white fluid.

CASSETTE SUMMARY:

. cassette 1A: Representative sections of the ovary.
@ Cassette 13: Representative sections of fallopian tube.
2; Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, medical unit number and "left

adnexa", is a salpingo~oophorectomy specimen including an ovary (3.0 x 1.6 x 1.6 cm),
atLached sequent of fallopian tube with fimbriated end (6.2 cm long and 0.4 cm in
diameter). A small segment of fallopian tube is taken by the surgeon for research.
There are multiple white to yellow paratubal cysts (0.1 to 1.0 cm in greatest
dimension). Upon sectioning, there are multiple corpora albicantia in the parenchyma
at the ovary, and also ~ thin~walled cyst (0.7 cm in diameter) with clear fluid

in the parenchynm. The surface of the ovary is white and smooth without papillary

projections.

CASSETTE SUMMARY:
Cassette 2A: Representative sections of the ovary.
Cassette 28: Representative sections of the fallopian tube.

3) Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, medical unit number and "uterus", is
a 128 gram total hysterectomy specimen, consisting of an opened uterus (10.5 x 6.0 x
3.8 cm). The uterus is opened by the surgeon and a superficial portion of endometridl
tumor and uninvolved fallopian tube is taken for research. The orientation of the
uterus is difficult to determine. The presumed anterior surface of the uterus is

inked black and possible posterior external surface of the uterus is inked blue.

The ectocervix (2.5 x 1.8 cm) is covered by white smooth glistening mucosa with focal
submucosa hemorrhage. The external 08 is oval and measures 1.0 x 0.7 cm. The
endoccrvical canal is 2.5 cm long and covered by pink tan mucosa with multiple cysts,
which is consistent with Nabothian cyst. There is an elevated pale tan finn
cndometrial tumor (6.0 x 5.5 cm and 1.0 cm above the surface) with irregular friable
surface involving the anterior surface and part of right posterior surface of the
endometrial cavity. Tumor grossly appears to involve the lower uterine segment at
the presumed twelve o'clock position. Grossly, tumor does not appear to involve the
cndo~ectocervical canal. Upon sectioning, the maximum thickness of the tumor is

1.2 cm. The area of deepest invasion of tumor is located in the lower anterior
uterine wall; in this area tumor appears to invade at least the inner half of the
myometrium. The myometrium measures approximately 1.4 cm at the location with deepest
tumor invasion. The endometrium uninvolved by tumor (posterior surface of the
endometrial cavity) measures 0.1 cm in thickness. The maximum thickness of the
myometrium is 1.6 cm. The serosal surface of the uterus is pink tan smooth without

adhesions.

CASSETTE SUMMARY:

Cassettes BA—BB: Representative section anterior ectocervix, endocervical canal and
lower uterine segment at 12 o'clock, contiguous section.

Cassettes 3C~3D: Representative section of posterior ectocervix, endocervlcal canal
and lower uterine segment at 6 o'clock, adjacent section.

Cassettes 33—3J: Representative sections of the anterior uterine wall with tumor
(Cassette 38 with possible deepest tumor invasion).

Cassettes 3K—3N: Representative sections of posterior uterine wall from lower

portion to the fundus.
