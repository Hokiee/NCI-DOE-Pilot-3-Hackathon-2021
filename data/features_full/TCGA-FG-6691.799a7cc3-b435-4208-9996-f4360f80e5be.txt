Gross Description:
A: Received fresh for intraoperative consultation, labelled with the patient's name and number, are multiple, irregular

fragments of pink-tan, soft tissue, 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm in aggregate. A portion of the specimen is submitted for touch
imprint. A portion of the specimen is submitted for frozen section. The specimen is submitted entirely in two cassettes.

B: Received fresh for intraoperative consultation, labeled with patient's name, hospital number and "right temporal
brain lesion", are multiple pink-white soft tissue fragments, 1.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm in aggregate. Representative tissue is
submitted for touch imprint and frozen section. The reminder of the specimen is submitted entirely for permanent in 2
cassettes.

C: Received fresh for intraoperative consultation, labeled with patient's name, hospital number and "superior tumor",
are multiple pink-white soft tissue fragments, 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm in aggregate. Representative tissue is submitted for
touch imprint and frozen section. The reminder of the specimen is submitted entirely for permanent in 2 cassettes.

are two light tan to tan-gray irregular soft tissue fragments measuring 1.9 x 1.3 x 1.1 cm and 2.0 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm. On
section, the fragments are tan-gray to focally red-brown. Submitted entirely in two cassettes.

E: Received fresh, post fixed in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, number, and "B-intermediate post of tumor",

tan-gray to focally red-brown irregular soft tissue fragments measuring 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm and 1.9 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm. On
section, the fragments are tan-gray. Submitted entirely in two cassettes.

G: Received fresh, post fixed in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, number, and "D-post inf tumor", is one tan-
gray irregular soft tissue fragment measuring 2.2 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm. On section, the fragment is tan-gray. Submitted
entirely in one cassette.

H: Received fresh, post fixed in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, number, and "E-assc acd tumor for perm",
are multiple tan-gray to focally red-brown irre ular soft tissue fragments measuring 5.0 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm. On section, the
