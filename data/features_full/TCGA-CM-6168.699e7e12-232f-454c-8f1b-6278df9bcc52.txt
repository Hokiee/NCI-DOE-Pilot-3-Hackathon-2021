1). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right colon" and consists of a
segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and ascending colon.
The terminal ileum measures 12.0 cm in length and 3.6 cm in circumference

at the proximal resected margin. The remaining colon measures 14.0 in
length with a circumference of 5.4 cm at the distal resected margin. The
attached appendix measures 5.8 cm in length and averages 0.7 cm in diameter.

The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth. Focally
hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the
specimen measuring up to the 3.8 cm in thickness. The specimen is opened to
reveal a mass lesion measuring 2.1 cm in length and 2.8 cm in width. The
mass is located in the right colon, 3.8 cm distal to the ileocecal valve,
17.0 cm from the proximal margin and 6.5 cm from the distal margin.
Sectioning shows that the tumor invades the underlying muscularis. The depth
of invasion is 0.5 cm grossly. The remaining mucosa is remarkable for a 0.7
x 0.1 to 0.4 cm sessile polyp 1.0 cm distal to the tumor. The attached
adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all identified lymph nodes are
submitted. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for
permanent sections and for TPS.

Summary of sections:

P - proximal margin shave

D - distal margin shave

T - tumor

A - appendix representative sections
