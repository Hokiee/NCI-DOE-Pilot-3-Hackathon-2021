Gross Description

Six specimens are received fresh for intraoperative consultation, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record
number.

Specimen A is further labeled "left lower lobe wedge." It consists of a wedge of lung measuring 6.8 x 2.5 x 2.1 cm and weighing
12.7 grams. The pleural surface has been previously opened to reveal a 1.4 x 1.2 x 1.1 cm ﬁrm yellow mass that is 0.3 cm from
the stapled surgical resection margin. The remaining lung parenchyma is unremarkable. A representative section of the mass
and of normal lung is submitted for Tumor Bank. The specimen is inked as follows: pleural surface blue, surgical resection

margin underneath staple line green. A portion of the mass is submitted for intrao ' ' n and transferred to
cassette "A1FS." The remaining cassette summary is as follows.

Specimen B is labeled as "#9 lymph node" and consists of three lymph nodes that measure 1.2 to 2.2 cm in greatest dimension.
Two lymph nodes are submitted for intraoperative consultation and transferred to " One lymph node is submitted
for intraoperative consultation and transferred to cassette "BZFS."

Specimen C is labeled as "lymph node #7" and consists of a fragment of tissue that measures 2.2 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm. One lymph

node is identiﬁed. The lymph node is submitted for intrao erativ onsultation and transferred to cassette "C1FS." Additional
tissue is submitted in cassette "CZ." d

Specimen D is received fresh for intraoperative consultation and is labeled "lymph nodes #6." It consists of three lymph nodes

ranging iMs are submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis in cassettes "D1FS" and
"D2FS."

Specimen E is received fresh for intraoperative consultation and is labeled "lymph nodes #1OL." It consists of two lymph nodes

Specimen F is received in formalin and labeled' 'extended wedge, left lower lobe. " It consists of a portion of lung measuring 4.0 x
3. 9 x 1.9 cm and weighing 13.0 grams. A ring of stapled margin entirely encircles the specimen The lung parenchyma is

unremarkable with no lesions identified. The specimen i gin green pleura blue. Representative
sections are submitted in cassettes "F1" through "F4. "
