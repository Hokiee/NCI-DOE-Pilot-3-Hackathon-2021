oligoastrocytoma operated on

, followed by XRT and Temodar. Current MRI demonstrates possible recurrent

tumor.
OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
Recurrent brain tumor.

Operation/Specimen: A: Brain,recurrent tumor, excision biopsy

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:

Brain, site not specified, excision:
1. Mixed oligoastrocytoma, anaplastic.
2. MIB—l proliferation index: \R\ 50%.
See Comment.

COMMENT

The specimen is portions of cerebrum extensively and heavily infiltrated by a
glial neoplastic proliferation that has a mixed oligoastrocytic phenotype,
predominantly astrocytic. The neoplastic cells have nuclear anaplastic
features, and there is brisk mitotic activity. There is no appreciable
microvascular cellular proliferation or necrosis.

The neoplasm has morphology similar to the original resection; in the current
resection, however, there is distinct cellular anaplasia, with a very high

proliferation index of about 50%.

LOH testing of the neoplasm is being performed, and result will be reported

in
an addendum.

PROCEDURES/ADDENDA

Loss of Heterozygosity 1p, 19q Assay (LOH)

Date Ordered:
Interpretation

Date Reported:

POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 19q is detected.
There is no evidence of allelic loss on chromosome lp.

Informative loci are: DlSS48, D18552, D19SZl9, D1951182
Results—Comments
Test performed on paraffin block —A3 and peripheral blood for
germline comparison.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both lp and l9q. The 3 markers
on 1p are DlSS48, D151592, and D15552 (with D15468, D181612, and D15496 as
backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D198219, D195412, and PLA2G4C
(with D195606 and D1951182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or
4
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat)
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score,
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used if the
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or otherwise
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1p
and 19q deletion.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a
stand—alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its performance
characteristics determined by the. as
required by CLIA ' 88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for
specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results
are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.
TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non—neoplastic cells in the
sample
may preclude the detection of allelic loss.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

SPECIMEN: Recurrent brain tumor.

FIXATIVE: Formalin.

GENERAL: Received are three irregular, pink-tan to gray—white fragments of
brain tissue, ranging from .5 cm. in greatest dimension to 2.0 x 1.2 x 1.0
cm.

Two smaller fragments of brain tissue are bisected.

SECTIONS: All submitted; A1 — one fragment bisected, A2 — second fragment
bisected, A3—A5 — largest fragment sectioned.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates tumor cells in a gliofibrillary
background; many cells, however, appear as naked nuclei. A great majority of
cells over express the p53 protein. With the M131 there is a proliferation
index of about 50% in the denser white matter zones. The NeuN demonstrates
the diffusely infiltrating character of the neoplasm.
