Gross Description:

1). The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "sigmoid and upper
rectum". It consists of a rectosigmoid colon that measure 20 x 12 x 8 cm.
The radial resection margin is inked black and the serosa is inked blue.
The serosa shows a large area of retraction 7 cm from the distal margin.
The specimen is opened to reveal a circumferential, constricting tumor that
is located 11 cm from the proximal margin and 7 cm from the distal margin.
The tumor measures 5.5 cm in length and 3.5 cm in width. Serial sectioning
reveals tumor invasion to a depth of 2.5 cm, which is 0.5 cm from the
closest radial margin. The remaining mucosa shows no abnormality.
Pericolic and peri-rectal adipose tissue is submitted for lymph node
dissection, and all possible nodes are submitted. Also received is a

separate portion of omentum with dimensions of 15 x 9 x 2 cm. The omentum
is diffusely involved by firm white tumor. Representative sections are
submitted. TPS is submitted.

Summary of sections:

PM - proximal margin

DM - distal margin

TS- tumor to serosa

TR- tumor to radial margin
T - tumor

U - uninvolved mucosa

0- omentum

LN - lymph nodes

BLN - bisected lymph node

2). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Proximal ring" and
consists of a silver metal anastomotic pin measuring 7.5 x 2.8 x 1.5 cm. At
the center of the pin, a white plastic piece is noted. A ring of pink tan
soft tissue is attached measuring 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The mucosal surface is
pink tan and focally hemorrhagic and the serosal surface is pink tan and
smooth. Several sutures and staples are noted. The sutures and staples are
removed and the soft tissue is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U undesignated

3). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Distal ring" and consists
of a ring of pink tan soft tissue measuring 2.2 x 2 x 1 cm. Multiple
sutures and staples are attached. The mucosal surface is pink tan and
focally hemorrhagic. The sutures and staples are removed and the soft
tissue is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U undesignated

4). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "umbilical hernia sac" and
consists of a pink tan fibromembranous tissue measuring 5.5 x 3.5 x 0.6 cm.
Serial sectioning reveals a white-tan firm mass measuring 1.1 x 1.0 x 0.7
cm. Representative sections are submitted.

Summary of sections:

M - mass
RS - remaining specimen, representatively
