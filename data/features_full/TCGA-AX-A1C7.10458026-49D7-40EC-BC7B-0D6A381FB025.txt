Specimen "No. 1" labeled "Uterus, Cervix, Bilateral Tubes and Ovaries"
consists of the aforementioned structures. The uterus measures 7.5 cm from

serosal surface is smooth and free of nodules. Upon opening the uterus, the
uterine cavity measures 2 cm in width by 0.5 cm anterior to posterior by 3

a fungating mass measuring 2.5x1.8xl.5 cm. It is immediately adjacent to

1x0.8x0.3 cm each. The myometrium contains two gross leiomyomata measuring

Specimen "No. 3" labeled "Omentum" consists of glistening yellow adipose
tissue measuring 4x3x2 cm in aggregate. Serial sectioning and palpation
does not reveal masses, nodules or other lesions. Representative sections

GROSS:
Specimen "No. 1" labeled "Uterus, Cervix, Bilateral Tubes and Ovaries"
consists of the aforementioned structures. The uterus measures 7.5 cm from
superior to inferior by 4 cm in width by 2.5 cm anterior to posterior. The
serosal surface is smooth and free of nodules. Upon opening the uterus, the
uterine cavity measures 2 cm in width by 0.5 cm anterior to posterior by 3
cm superior to inferior. The posterior wall of the uterine cavity contains
a fungating mass measuring 2.5x1.8xl.5 cm. It is immediately adjacent to
the cervical canal. At the thickest point, the uterine mass and underlying

are seen attached to the anterior wall of the uterine canal and measure
le.8x0.3 cm each. The myometrium contains two gross leiomyomata measuring
0.8 cm and 1.9 cm in greatest dimension. The underlying myometrium alone
measures 1.7 cm. Cervical canal is 3.5 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter.
The cervical 05 is slit like. The ectocervix is smooth with multifocal mild
acute hemorrhage. Summary of sections: "1A" - "1C", one continuous full
thickness section from superior to inferior of the uterus including the
dominant lesion; "ID" and "1E", additional sections through the largest
mass; "1F", a section through the smaller anterior wall lesions; "1G",
sections through two leiomyomata. The left uterine tube measures 7 cm in
length by 0.3 cm in diameter. The fimbriated end is identified. The
serosal surface does not contain nodules. The serosal surface does contain
multiple small cystic structures. The left ovary measures 1.5x0.8x0.5 cm.
It is light yellow and firm. Representative section of the left ovary and
adjacent soft tissue is submitted in "in". The fimbriated end of the
uterine tube is amputated, serially sectioned and entirely submitted in
cassette "lI" along with sections from mid uterine tube and the uterine end
of the tube. The right uterine tube measures 6 cm in length by 0.3 cm in
diameter. The fimbriated end is not identified grossly. The right ovary is
yellow firm and measures 1.6x1x0.6 cm. The outer surface of the tube
contains multiple white cystic structures. Representative section of the
right ovary as well as adjacent soft tissue is submitted in cassette "1J".
Representative sections of right uterine tube are submitted in "IR".
Sections of parovarian soft tissue submitted in cassette "1L".

 

Specimen "No. 2” labeled "Abdominal Scar" consists of an ellipse of skin and
underlying adipose tissue. The skin ellipse measures 8.5x4x0.2 cm. The
underlying adipose measures 9x5.5x2.5 cm. No skin based lesions are
appreciated grossly. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes
"2A" _ "2D" .

Specimen "No. 3" labeled "Omentum" consists of glistening yellow adipose
tissue measuring 4x3x2 cm in aggregate. Serial sectioning and palpation
does not reveal masses, nodules or other lesions. Representative sections
are submitted in cassettes "3A" - "3D".
