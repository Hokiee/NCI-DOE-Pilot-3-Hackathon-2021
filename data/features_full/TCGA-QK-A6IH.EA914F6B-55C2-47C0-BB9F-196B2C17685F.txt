Comment

Part F: Chronic granulomatous inﬂammation is noted in several lymph nodes (Part A. J) as well as in association with
the squamous cell carcinoma in the main specimen (Part N). In retrospective review of the frozen section of Part F.
intraoperatively diagnosed as 'atypical focus cells surrounded by chronic inﬂammation - focus disappears on deeper
frozen sections', most likely represents a focus of granulomatous inﬂammation.
