Gross Description:

1
1). The specimen is received fresh, labeled “total thyroid" and consists of a thyroid weighing 74.5 G. The right lobe measures 5 x
3.8 x 1 .5‘ Cm , the left lobe measures 6.5 x 3 x 1 Cm and the isthmus measures 2.2, x 2 x 0.8 Cm. A 5 x 4.5 x 4'crn mass is
attached to the right lobe by a ﬁbrous "stalk" measuring 2.2 x 1.8 x 0.3 cm. The mass is covered by a thin fibrous capsule. The
external surface is covered by a thin ﬁbrous capsule. The posterior surface of the thyroid, the mass and the posterior surface of
the stalk are inked black and the anterior surface of the thyroid and the stalk is inked blue. Sectioning reveals that the mass is not
connected through the thyroid parenchyma. The cut surface of the mass is tan with focal hemorrhage, homogeneous and fleshy.
Sections through the remaining tissue reveal diffuse vague tan nodularlty without a dominant nodule. Representative sections of
the specimen are submitted for TPS, cytogenetics and flow cytometry and a photograph has been taken. The remaining tissue is
serially sectioned. The thyroid is submitted entirely from superior to inferior. The tumor is representatively submitted.
