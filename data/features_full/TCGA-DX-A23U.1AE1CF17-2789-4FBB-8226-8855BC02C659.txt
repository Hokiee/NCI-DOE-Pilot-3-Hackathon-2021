Gross Dnncrintion:

1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled 'Tru-cut
biopsy to left groin“. It consists of a core biopsy of tan soft tissue
measuring 1.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. Entirely frozen.

Summary of sections:
FSC _ Frau-n section control

2) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Sarcoma right groin“. It
consists of a fragment of soft tissue, received unoriented, measuring 11 x 6
x 3.5 cm covered by an ellipse of white wrinkled skin measuring 5.5 x 2 cm
showing two old healed scars measuing 2 on each. The specimen is inked
black and bisected. The cut surface reveals multinodular ill-defined mass
approaching the margin of resection and measuring approximately 8 x 6 x 2.5
cm, present in the subcutaneous tissue. The mass has a rubbery tan-yellow
cut surface. Representative sections are submitted. A portion is submitted
for

3) The specimen is received fresh, labeled ILeft groin sarcoma'. It
consists of a fragment of soft tissue, received unoriented, measuring 12 x 9
x 6 cm covered by a skeletal muscle measuring approximately 9 x 7 x 0.5 cm.
The specimen is inked and serially sectioned. The cut section reveal
multinodular tan-yellow, hamogenous. There is no area of necrosis or
hemorrhage identified. The tumor appears to be entirely surrounded by
