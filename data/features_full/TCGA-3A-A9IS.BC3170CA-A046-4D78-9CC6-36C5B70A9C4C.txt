Gross Description

A. Specimen A is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled “distal pancreas and
spleen‘ and consists ot a 571 .3 gram distal pancreas with attached spleen. The pancreas is 14.5 x
SD in 4.0 cm. The spleen is m: x 12.0 x 4-7 cm- Wimm the pancreas in an 8.0 x 4.? x 3.0 cm,
partially encapsulated, soft tan and orange, lobulated mass. The mass extends the full length of the
pancreas and in 8.? cm 33mm the pancreatic malgin. The mass has a sunoundhg. thin membranous
lining, which is "mired blue, There is a small amount of norm 8! pancreatic lissue surrounding the mass.
The remaining pancreas is yellow, lobu'lated, admixed with thick, white ﬁbrous stroma. The spleen is
homogeneous, dark red, and slightly nodular. No mass or other lesions are identiﬁed. The pancreatic
margin is sectioned tangentially, frozen and eniirely submitted in FSAl. Additional representative
sections are submitted as follows:

A2: Mass perpendi user to rn argin.

A34“: Mass will: adjacent norm 3! pancreas.
