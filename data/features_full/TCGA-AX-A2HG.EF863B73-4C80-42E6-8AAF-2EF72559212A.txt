Gross Description
The specimen is received in five parts.

Part A. is labeled with the patient‘s name. designated “left periaortic node". Received in formalin and
consists of one lymph node and attached ﬁbroadipose tissue that measure in aggregate 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.3
cm. The lymph node measure 1.3 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette A1.

Part B. is labeled with the patient's name. designated "right periaortic node". Received in formalin and
consists of one lymph node and a fragment of adipose tissue that measure together 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.5
cm. The lymph node measure 1.4 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette 81.

Part C. is labeled with the patient's name. designated "right pelvic node”. Received in formalin and
consists of several fragments of adipose tissue and lymph nodes that measure in aggregate 8.0 x 7.0
1.5 cm. The specimen is dissected to identify several lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.3 cm in
maximum dimension to 2.3 cm in maximum dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as
follows:

C1 - One lymph node bisected

C2 - One lymph node bisected

C3- One lymph node bisected

C4 - C6 Remainder of lymph nodes

Part D, is labeled with the patient's name "left pelvic nodes". Received in formalin and consists of
several fragments of adipose tissue and lymph nodes that measure in aggregate 6.5 x 4.5 x 1.0 cm.
The specimen is dissected to identify several lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.3 to 2.5 cm in
maximum dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows:

D1 - D5 One lymph node in each cassette

06 - remainder of the specimen

Part E. is labeled with the patient's name “uterus, cervix, 880". Received fresh for intraoperative
consultation, and consists of a uterus with attached cervix and bilateral adnexa. It weighs 207 gm. The
uterus measures 9.0 x 6.0 x 6.0 cm. it is covered by a tan/pink smooth serosa. The exocerle
measures 3.0 x 2.3 x 0.7 cm and has a 1.3 cm slit-like as. The endometrlai cavity measures 6.0 x 6.0
cm. The endometrial cavity is almost entirely replaced by a polypold tumor that measures 6.0 x 6.0 x
2.0 cm and involves entirely the anterior wall and 70% of the posterior wall. The tumor extends to the
lower uterine segment in the anterior wall of the uterus. Cross section shows invasion of 1.3 cm into
the myometrlum. The average thickness of the myometrlum is 2.4 cm. The left fallopian tube
measures 3.5 cm in length x 0.7 cm in diameter. The serosal surface is tan/pink and smooth. The
flmbria are present and appear unremarkable. The left ovary measures 1.8 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm, is
tan/yellow and smooth and appear not involved by tumor. The cut surface is yellow and pink and

unremarkable. The right fallopian tube measures 3.5 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter. The ﬁmbria
are present and appear unremarkable. The fallopian tube is covered by a tan/pink, smooth serosa.
The right ovary measures 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm, is pink/yellow and smooth. The cut surface is pink and
yellow and appear not involved by tumor. The endocervical canal measures 3.0 cm in length x 1.0 cm
in diameter and has a herring bone appearance of the mucosa. There is no tumor involvement of the
endocervical canal. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

E1 - E2 Anterior and posterior cervix

E3 - E4 Anterior and posterior lower uterine segment
E5 - E7 Anterior endomyometrium

E8 - E10 Posterior endomyometrium

Intra-Operative Consultation
Uterus, cervix and 880 (IOC):
- invasive endometrial carcinoma. about 40-50% invasion with lower uterine segment
involvement. Cervix is not involved.
- Benign 880.

Diagnosis
A. Lymph node, left periaortic, excision:
- One lymph node negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/1).
Lymph node, right periaortic, excision:
- One lymph node negative for metastatic carcinoma (0”).
Lymph node, right pelvic, excision:
- Nineteen lymph nodes negative for malignancy (0/19).

Uterus with cervix and bilateral adnexa. total hysterectomy and bilateral
saipingo-oophorectomy:
- Poorly-differentiated endometrioid adenocarclnoma of the
endometrium with extensive necrosis (FlGO 3).

- Focal secretory change and stromal declduallzatlon consistent
with progestin effect.
- Small leiomyoma.
- Focal serosal endosalpingiosis.
