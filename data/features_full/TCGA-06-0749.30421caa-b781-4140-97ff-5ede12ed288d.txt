Wraith past history of migraine headaches and small strokes,

has a large right temporal necrotic tumor with irregular enhancement and
restricted central diffusion.

OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
Not Given

Operation/Specimen: A: Right temporal brain tumor

B: Brain, excision biopsy

C: Brain, medial and inferior temporal, excision biopsy
D: Brain, posterior margin, excision biopsy

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:

A, B, C, and D: Brain, temporal lobe, excision:
l. Glioblastoma.

2. MIB—l proliferation index: 22%.

See Microscopy Description and Comment.

COMMENT .
In all the specimens there is a glial neoplastic proliferation that

extensively infiltrates and focally effaces the cerebral tissue. The neoplasm
has anaplastic features, i.e. nuclear atypia, mitotic activity, microvascular
cellular proliferation, and zones of necrosis with vascular thrombosis.
Focally, the tumor has extensively infiltrated the leptomeningeal space.

The neoplasm has a predominantly astrocytic phenotype, but in some
infiltrative areas there is a capillary vascular network with focal
mineralization. This feature suggests an oligodendroglial component.

This neoplasm may probably be better classified as a glioblastoma, with
possibly an oligodendroglial component (WHO IV/IV).

The neoplasm is present in all specimens. In specimen D (”posterior”), the
tumor is only moderately cellular and is devoid of necrosis.

Molecular-genetic data may better characterize this tumor.

Interpretation

NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected.

Testing was done on block

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA followed
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight} of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a

stand alone diagnostic test. This test was develo ed and its performance
characteristics determined by the# laboratory as
required by CLIA ' .regulations. as no een c eared or approved for

specific uses by the 0.3. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.

 

NEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1p and chromosome arm l9q is NOT
detected.

Informative loci are: 018548, D181592, D13468, 0181612, 018496, D198412,
PLAZGéC, 0198606, D1981182

Results—Comments

Test performed on paraffin tumor block ' and peripheral blood for
germline comparison.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA
{baseline}/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19g. The 3 markers
on lp are 018548, D181592, and D18552 (with D18468, D181612, and D18496 as
backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are 0198219, 0198412, and PLA2G4C
(with D19SGO6 and D1981182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4
nt repeats) except PLAZG4C which is a minisatellite {26 nt repeat)
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score,
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used if the
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or otherwise
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1p
and 19g deletion.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a
stand—alone diagnostic test. This test was develo ed and its performance
characteristics det 'ned by the laboratory as
required by CLIA ' regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for
specific uses by the 0.8. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in

 

 

 

 

the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.

TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non—neoplastic cells in the sample
may preclude the detection of allelic loss.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A.

Received fresh, two portions of cerebrum; one is falciform, 6.5 x 2.0 x 1.5
cm, and consists of cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter that appear to
surround a central cystic cavity; the lesional tissue obliterates land marks,
and is semi firm, homogeneous, and gray—glistening; The other fragment is
somewhat lobulated, purplish—grey, and homogeneously glistening.

Received fresh, one fragment, 2.0 cm. across. Semi firm, creamy—white. In

total, El and 82.

SPECIMEN: Medial and inferior temporal.

FIXATIVE: None.

GENERAL: Received is a 4.5 x 3 x 1.5 cm. aggregate of semi—firm homogeneous,
gray—tan hemorrhagic glistening soft tissue. Arborizing vessels are
identified on some of the surfaces. Sectioning reveals gray—white fleshy cut
surfaces.

SECTIONS: Entirely submitted in five cassettes.

D.
SPECIMEN: Posterior.

FIXATIVE: None.

GENERAL: Received is a 4.5 x 3.5 x 1.2 cm. aggregate of seminfirm homogeneous
tan—gray glistening, hemorrhagic soft tissue fragments. Sectioning reveals
pale gray—white fleshy glistening out surfaces.

SECTIONS: Entirely submitted in five cassettes.

 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The CPA? demonstrates overall gliofibrillogenesis by
the neoplastic cells, with focal areas of sparse glial background. The tumor
cells do not over express the p53 protein. With the MIBul there is a
proliferation index of about 22% in the more active areas. The NeuN depicts
neurons in the infiltrated cerebral cortex. The NFP demonstrates a handful of
cortical neurons containing perikaryal phosphorylated NFP, but these cells are
not morphologically atypical. The CD163 depicts a large population of

positive cells, some with granular cytoplasm.

 

The immunophenotype is consistent with a high histological grade,
predominantly astrocytic glioma.
