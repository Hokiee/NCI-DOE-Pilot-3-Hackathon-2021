8) SOURCE: Left EJ Lymph Node

Received in saline labeled with the patient's name, MR#, and "left EJ lymph
node" is a fragment of yellow-pink fibrofatty tissue that is 2.5 X 1.5 X

0.7 cm and partially cauterized. One possible lymph node is identified and
is 0.9 cm in greatest eXtent. It is bisected from the surrounding fatty

tissue and entirely submitted along with the remainder of the soft tissue.

levels 2 & 3" is a fragment of yellow-pink fibrofatty tissue that is 7.5 X

4.5 X 0.9 cm. The specimen is comprised of dense fibrous tissue involving
lymph nodes that range in size from 0.3-2.3 cm in greatest eXtent. The
specimen is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections: 9A, two possibly contiguous lymph nodes bisected, 2/ 1;
9B, 1 bisected lymph node, 2/ 1; 9C, node candidates, M/ 1; 9D, node

13) SOURCE: Floor of Mouth Cancer

Received fresh labeled with patient's name, medical record number and
"ﬂoor of mouth cancer" is a complex resection of the mandible with bone
that is 5.5 cm posterior to anterior, 8.5 cm transversely, 8 cm from
superficial to deep. The specimen is inked as follows: Posterior green,
anterior at the midline orange strip, left blue, right black (left and

right anterior), and deep purple. There is a deep ulcer between two teeth
on the left ﬂoor of the mouth that is 2.0 X 2.0 X 1.5 cm and limited
anteriorly by left anterior soft tissue and the left mandible, posteriorly

by the tongue, and by the molar tooth and incisors medially and laterally.
The left anterior surface of the mandible is resected off the mandible

bone. The cut surface shows an ill defined hemorrhagic tissue right
underneath the ulcer. This comprises less than 5% of the section. The inner
portion of the mouth (ﬂoor of the mouth) is also resected off the bone to
reveal a well delineated soft white lesion that rises from the ulcer and
invades deeply and is 3.4 X 3.2 X 3.5 cm. This lesion is 1 cm approximately
from deep margin (is shaved and entirely submitted) purple; 0.6 cm from the
left bone and soft tissue margin (blue, shaved and entirely submitted);
approximately 2.5 cm from the right bone and soft tissue margin (shaved and
entirely submitted; less than 0.1 cm from posterior soft tissue margin

inked green; 0.5 cm from the overlying tongue. Representative sections are
submitted following decalcification.

The mandible is sectioned to reveal normal cortical bone and bone marrow.
The tumor does not appear to be infiltrating the bone. Mid section
represents the mandible in relation to tumor is submitted. The left and

right bone margins are submitted.

Summary of sections: 13A-13B, left soft tissue margin, 3/1 and 2/1;
13C-13E, deep margin, M/1 each; 13F-13G, right soft tissue margin, M/1;
13H-13K, left anterior soft tissue margin adjacent to ulcer, 1/1 each;
13L-13T, tumor, ﬂoor of the mouth in relation to ulcer and posterior
margin, 1/1 each; 13U, left bone margin, 1/ 1; 13V, shaved right bone
margin, 1/ 1; 13W-13X, section of tumor and bone, 1/1 each.
