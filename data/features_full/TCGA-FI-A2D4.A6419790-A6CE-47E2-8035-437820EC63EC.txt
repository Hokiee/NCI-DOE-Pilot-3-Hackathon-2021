A dendu C
Immunostalns of the andometrial edenooeru‘norna show an abnormal expression pattern, with loss of expression oi

MLH1 and PM82 in the tumor. with preserved expression of MSH2 and MSH6.

These antibodies are directed against the DNA mismatch repair enzymes MLHt, MSi-i2, W82, and MSl-ls. These
targets are expressed in normal cells. When expression is lost. the result ls often micro-satellite irtsteblttty. Thus. one
may lmmunostain for these mismatch repair enzymes, as a surrogate for MSI testing. In cases where the
irnmunostahs show a normal pattern of expression. MSl is very unlikely. One can then reasonably strip the more
expensive and time consuming process at MSI analysis in such cases. in contrast. tumors such as the current case.
with loss of expression alone or more oi these proteins. are likely to manilast MSl.

in this case. tissue will be sent for conﬁrmatory PCR tasting lor MSI.

TUMOR MICROSATEUJTE INSTABILITY

Method

A PCR based assay is used to test for tumor microsstellite instability (MS!) with the use of!» mononucleotide
repeat markers (BATZS, BAT26, Max:027, NR24, and NRZI). The tumor tissue is classiﬁed as MSS/MSI-L
(instability detected in 0 or 1 out ofS matters). or MSi-H (instability in 2 or more of!) markers tested).

Results
Tumor type: endomctrisi adenocarcinoma MS]: MSl-H (instability observed in 3 of 3 informative markers)

Interpretation

High levels of microsatelllte instability (MSl-H) are indicative of defective DNA mismatch repair function.
These results increase the Lighthm this individual has an inherited colon cancer syndrome due to defective
DNA mismatch repair (HNPCC). However. MS! testing does not distinguish between a somatic and a
gcnnline defect in one of the DNA mismatch repair genes, nor does it provide infomtatiOn as to which gene
might be involved. The use of immunohistochemistry, followed by germline mutational analysis. can further
evaluate the possibility of HNPCC in this individual.

Genetic counseling is suggested prior to proceeding with genetic testing to discuss the risks and beneﬁts of
testing with this individual.

CAUTIONS: Test results should be interpreted in context of clinical ﬁndings. family history. and other
laboratory data. if results obtained do not match other clinical or laboratory ﬁndings, please contact the
