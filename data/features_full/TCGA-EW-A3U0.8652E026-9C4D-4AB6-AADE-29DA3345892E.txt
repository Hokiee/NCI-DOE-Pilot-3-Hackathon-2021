Gross Description:

A. Received fresh labeled "Sentinel node #1 Count - left breast". The specimen consists of a lymph
node with Surrounding ﬁbroadipose tissue which measures 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is submitted in
toto in cassette ‘

B. Received fresh labeled “Sentinel node # 2 count left breast”. The specimen consists of a lymph node
with surrouding fibroadlpose tissue which measures 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto in
cassette I

C. Received fresh labeled “Sentinel node # 3 count . left breast". The specimen consists of a lymph node
with surrounding ﬁbroadlpose tissue which measures 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto in
cassette 1

D. Received in formalin labeled "Non—sentinel lymph node - left breast". The specimen consists of a lymph
node with surrounding ﬁbroadlpose tissue which measures 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is bisected and
submitted in toto in one cassette.

E. Received fresh labeled “Left breast mass - one stitch short superior — long lateral". The specimen consists
of a left lumpectomy specimen which measures 9.0 cm from medial to lateral by 6.5 cm from inferior to
superior by 3.8 cm from anterior to posterior. There are two sutures; the long designating lateral and the
short is designating superior. There is a ﬁrm, white, irregularly shaped and poorly deﬁned mass located in
the center of the specimen with diffuse extension to the medial and lateral margin. The extensions are
surrounding by white indurated areas. The tumor appears to be less than 1mm from the superior margin
less than 1mm from the posterior margin. The tumor with indurated area appears to be less than 1mm from
the inferior margin. The tumor appears to be less than 1mm from the anterior margin, less than 1mm from
the medial margin’and less than 1mm from the lateral margin. The main part of the tumor measures 3.5
x 3.5 x 3.0 cm. But with the extensions and indurated areas the tumor measures 9.0 x 6.5 x 3.8 cm. The
specimen lslnked as follows:

Posterior black
Anterior yellow
Superior blue
Inferior green
Lateral orange
Medial red

F. Received in formalin labeled “Additional anterior margin". The specimen consists of a fragment of skin with
attached fibroadlpose tissue, skin measures 12.0 x 1.1 cm and is tan-brown in color. Adipose tissue
measures 1.5 x 0.8 cm. No lesions are identiﬁed. The specimen is sectioned and skin is submitted toto In
five cassettes.

measures 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm. The largest lymph node measures 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and is inked green. There

is one additional lymph node identiﬁed. The specimen is submittedin toto in cassette one. The largest lymph node
is bisected.

H. Received in formalin labeled “Left axillary contents". The specimen consists of a ﬁbroadlpose tissue which
measures 11.0 x 8.0 x 4.0 cm. The specimen is unoriented. No skeletal muscle is identiﬁed. The largest
lymph node measures 2.6 x‘ 1.5 x 0.7 cm. The sections are submitted as follows:

Cassette #2 One lymph node

Cassette #3 One lymph node

Cassette #4 One lymph node

Cassette #5 One possible lymph node

Cassette #6 Two lymph nodes

Cassette #7 Four possible lymph nodes
