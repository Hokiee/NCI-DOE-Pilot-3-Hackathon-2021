Specimen:

FSA subcarinal lymph node

FSB right lung for margin check and distribution
#1 portion of 6th right rib

FS Diagnosis:
FSA anthracotic node x2, one 0.3cm. in diameter and the other 0.5cm.
in diameter

BxB Specimen consists of a right lung measuring 21x17x8.5cm. The
hilum shows a grossly tumor replaced lymph node measuring 3.5x2x1.5cm.
adjacent to the bronchus which has a resection margin which is grossly
free of tumor. Cross section reveals a tumor mass which occupies
nearly the entire right middle lobe measuring 8x8cm. by approximately
5.5cm. The tumor obstructs the bronchi and causes mucus plugs
distally. Mucus plugging is observed in the right middle lobe and
right lower lobe. There are large areas of necrosis, yellow
coloration in addition to grey white coloration and the tumor has
pushing margins overall. It grows against branches of the pulmonary
artery and compresses them. 3cm. from the bronchial resection margin
it grows into the bronchial lumen. Areas of uninvolved lung appear to
be grossly unremarkable with no satellites observed. The main tumor
extends from central to peripheral, grows to the pleura but does not
extend through it grossly. However, there is extensive pleural
reaction with retraction and discoloration with fibrinoid exudate.

FSA Two anthracotic lymph nodes with measurements as abOVe. Submitted
in toto.

FSB A_cross sectional segment of bronchus with attached lymph node
measuring 2.4x1.6x0.3cm. Submitted in toto.

BxA An irregular brown and tan Segment of soft tissue measuring
0.7x0.3x0.2cm. Submitted in toto.

#1 Portion of 6th rib measuring 5.5x1.5x1.2cm. It shows a smooth
periosteum with attachments of skeletal muscle and fascia with
resection margins unremarkable showing cancellous bone. One section

 

submitted following decal.

SUMMARY: FSA-nodes; FEB-bronchial resection margin; BxA—subcarinal
nodes; BxBl-bronchial resection margin; Bsz a 3-hilar nodes; 3x34 &
S—tumor bronchial interface; BxBG-tumor lung interface; BxB? through
9—tumor pleural interface; BxBlo—non tumor lung.

HICROSCOP C DE 1? ION:

Sections from the lung show an infiltrating halfway differentiated
squamous cell carcinoma. The tumor infiltrates a segmental bronchus,
has penetrated it and ulcerated the mucosa. It is compressing the
segmental artery which is not infiltrated by the tumor. There are 5
para-arterial lymph nodes, one of which shows metastatic tumor. The
lung adjacent to the tumor shows interstitial follicular pneumonia and
early acute supporative pneumonia. The pleura is thick and hemorrahgic
and abutted, but not infiltrated by the tumor.

FSA Four small lymph nodes negative for tumr.

FSB Bronchus with chronic inflammation. A parabronchial lymph node
with metastatic tumor is present. Another one with no tumor is also
seen.

DIAGNOSIS;

1) RIGHT LUNG WITH HALFWAY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAHOUS CELL CARCINOMA
OF MIDDLE LOBE INFILTRATING SEGMENTAL BRONCHUS

2) METASTATIC SQUAHOUS CELL CARCINOMA TO ONE OUT OF FIVE HARA—
SEGMENTAL PULMONARY ARTERY LYHPH NODES, RIGHT MIDDLE LOBE

3) BRONCHIAL STUHP WITH NO TUMOR, BUT WITH METASTASIS TO ONE OUT
OF TWO PARABRONCHIAL LYMPH NODES

4) SUBCARINAL LYHPH MODE WITH NO TUMO

5) RIB SECTION ON DECALCIFICATION
