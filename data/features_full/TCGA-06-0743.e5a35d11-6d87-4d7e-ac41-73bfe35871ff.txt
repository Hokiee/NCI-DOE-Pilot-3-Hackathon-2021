Surgical Pathology Report

CLINICAL HISTORY
ith an episode of disorientation has a left
parieto-occipital, enhancing tumor that on biopsy proved to be a glioblastoma.
For total resection,

OPERAT IVE DIAGNOSES
Not Given

Operation/Specimen: A: Brain, excision biopsy
B: Brain, excision biopsy

PAT HOLOG T. CAL DIAGNOS IS:
A and B. Brain, sites not specified, exciSion: Glioblastoma.
See Comment.

COMMENT

The tumor is an astrocytic neoplastic proliferation of small naked nuclei,
abundantly fibrillary, with mitotic figures, microvascular cellular
proliferation, and necrosis, some with pseudopalisading.

Special stains to better characterize the tumor have been requested and will
be reported as an addendum..

Interpretation

Brain, MIB-l proliferation index: 12%.
See Results and Comment {below}.

Results-Comments

IMMUNOHISTOCHBMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates gliofibrillogenesis by the
neOplastic cells. About 8% of the tumor cells over express the p53 protein.
With the MIB-l, there is a proliferation index of about 12% in the more active

areas .

Comment: The immunophenotype is consistent with a high histological grade
glial neoplasm.

 

INTRA-OPERATIVE CONSULTATION
Brain, excision biopsy:
1. Frozen section: Glioma, 1 block, -

2. Smears: Glioma. -

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A.
Multiple tissue fragments, 0.4 cm, all in A1, A2

B.
SPECIMEN: Brain tumor.

FIXATIVE: None.

GENERAL: Received is a 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm. irregular portion of tan-pink
glistening, slightly convoluted tissue-

MAIN FINDING: The Specimen is serially sectioned to reveal unremarkable cut
surfaces.

SECTIONS: Bl-BZ entirely submitted.
