Gross Description:

1. The specimen is received fresh labeled. “spleen. left retroperitoneal
liposarcoma, left colectomy, and left nephrectomy', and consists of soft
tissue mass with attached left kidney and fragment of colon, separated
spleen. The soft tissue mass measures 33 x 20 x 15 cm. covered with thin
membrane with focal area of rupture measuring 10.0 x 0.0 cm. Serial
sectioning of the mass reveals myxoid (approximately 5‘), tan white solid
(approximately 10%) and the tan-yellow fleshy (approximately 80%) areas and
focal fat necrosis. The attached left kidney measures 10 x 6.0 x 0.0 cm.
Bisectioning of the kidney shows grossly and remarkable cortex and medulla.
The attached colon measures 45 cm in length. 6.0 cm in circumference and 0.2
cm in thickness. The mucosa and serosa of colon are grossly unremarkable.
There are multiple separated, well-circumscribed and tan yellow and fleshy
nodules in mesentery. measuring 2.0 cm to 10.0 cm in greatest dimension. The
necrotic cyst is identified in mesentery, measuring 10.0 x 3.0 cm. The
separated spleen measures 10.0 x 6.0 x 1.5 cm, and is grossly unremarkable.
Representative sections are submitted for TPS and permanent sections.
Photograph is taken.

3. The specimen is received fresh labeled, “deep pelvic sarcoma", and
consists of one fragment tan yellow fibroadipose tissue measuring 10 x 7 x 4
cm. Two well circumscribed adipose nodules are identified, measuring 5 x A x
3 cm and 4 x 2 x 2 on. Both nodules are entirely covered with thin membrane.
Series sectioning of the two nodules reveals tan yellow fleshy surface.
Surface of the nodules are inked black. Representative sections are
submitted.

i) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "distal sigmoid“. It consists of
an unoriented segment of colon that measures 11 cm in length. The specimen
has one stapled (4 cm in length) and one unstapled margin (2.7 cm in
diameter). The serosal surface is unremarkable. The radial resection margin
is inked black and the specimen is opened to reveal an unremarkable mucosa.
Serial sections reveal edema in the wall. Pericolic and peri-rectal adipose
tissue is thoroughly examined for lymph nodes, and all possible nodes are
submitted. Representative sections are submitted.

Pu - STAPLID margin

DN - UNSTAPLED margin

LN - possible lymph nodes

5). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled 'tissue from abdomen

for discard' and consists of a silver metal anastomotic pin measuring 7.5 x
2.8 x 1.5 cm. At the center of the pin, a plastic piece is noted. There are
two pink tan soft tissue rings measuring 2.0 x 1.8 x 0.5 and 1.8 x 1.8 x 0.5
cm. The mucosal surface is pink tan and focally hemorrhagic and the ssrosal
surface is pink tan and smooth. Several sutures and staples are noted. The
sutures and staples are removed and the soft tissue is entirely submitted.
