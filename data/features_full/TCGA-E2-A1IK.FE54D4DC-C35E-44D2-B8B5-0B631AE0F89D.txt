A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 LEFT AXILLA

Received fresh are 4 tan pink lymph nodes ranging from 0.5cm to 1.50m in greatest dimensions. Four
touch preps are taken.

A1: 1 lymph node

A2: 1 lymph node

A3: 1 lymph node

A4: 1 lymph node

B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 LEFT AXILLA

Received fresh are 2 tan pink lymph nodes 0.5cm and 1 ,2cm in greatest dimensions. Two touch preps
are taken.

B1: 1 lymph node

32: 1 lymph node

C. LEFT BREAST MEDIAL NEEDLE LOCALIZATION

Received fresh labeled with the patient’s identiﬁcation and "left breast medial needle localization" is an
oriented 38g. 8 x 5 x 2.2cm needle localized lumpectomy. lnk code: anterior-yellow, posterior-black,
superior-blue. inferior-orange, medial-green, lateral-red. Specimen is serially sectioned from medial to
lateral into 6 slices revealing a 1.3 x 1.3 x 1.20m tan pink well circumscribed ﬁrm mass, closest to the
posterior margin at 0.1cm and 0.2cm from the anterior margin in slices 3-4. Tissue is procured.
Representatively submitted:

01-02: medial margin slice 1

C3-C6: slice 2

07-010: slice 3 with mass in CS

C11-C15: slice 4 with mass in C13

D. LEFT BREAST LATERAL NEEDLE LOCALIZATION

Received fresh labeled with the patient’s identiﬁcation and ”left breast lateral needle localization" is an
oriented 119. 4.5 x 3.5 x 20m needle localized lumpectomy. Ink code: anterior-yellow, posterior-black,
superior-blue, inferior-orange, medial-green, lateral-red. Specimen is serially sectioned from medial to
lateral into 6 slices revealing a 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4cm tan pink well circumscribed ﬁrm mass. closest to the
inferior margin at 0.5cm in slice 3. Entirely submitted:

D1: medial margin slice 1

D2-03: slice 2

D4-DS: slice 3 with mass in 05

DIAGNOSIS:

A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 1. LEFT AXILLA, BIOPSY:
- MICROMETASTATIC CARCINOMA IN ONE OF FOUR LYMPH NODES (1/4).
- NO EXTRANODAL EXTENSION IS SEEN.

NOTE: Several foci of tumor are seen in one lymph node with the largest measuring 0.5 millimeters. A
cytokeratin AE1/3 stain is positive in tumor cells.

B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 2. LEFT AXILLA, BIOPSY:
- TWO LYMPH NODES, NO TUMOR SEEN (0/2).

TSS ID

C. BREAST, LEFT, MEDIAL, NEEDLE LOCALIZATION EXCISION:
- INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 2, WITH MUCINOUS
FEATURES AND SIGNET RING CELLS.
- TUMOR MEASURES 1.4 CM.
- TUMOR IS 0.1 CM FROM THE DEEP MARGIN.
- SEVERAL FOCI OF ATYPICAL DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA (ADH).

D. BREAST, LEFT, LATERAL, NEEDLE LOCALIZATION EXCISION:
- INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA. SBR GRADE 2. WITH MUCINOUS
FEATURES.
- TUMOR MEASURES 0.7 CM.
- MARGINS, FREE OF TUMOR.
- ATYPICAL DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA (ADH).

NOTE: The two tumors are morphologically similar.
