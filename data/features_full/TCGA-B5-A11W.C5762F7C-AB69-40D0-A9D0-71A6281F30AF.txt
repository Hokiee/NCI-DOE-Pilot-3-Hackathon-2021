CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm corpus uteri. Grade 1 endometrial cancer per endometrial

biopsy.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Uterus, cervix, tubes, ovaries and fibroid (AF1—4)", received fresh and
placed in formalin at is a 303 gram, 13 x 10 x 4.5 cm
didelphic uterus with attached bilateral tubes and ovaries (bilateral ovaries-
2.5 x 1.7 x 1.4 cm, bilateral fimbriated fallopian tube- 6_cm long x 0.6 cm in
diameter). The 3 cm in diameter cervix has one 1.5 cm in diameter patent 05
which leads into a septated endocervical canal, dividing the endocervical
canal and endometrial cavities into right and left separate structures. The 7
x 4 cm left endometrial cavity is 100% effaced and replaced by white—tan,
exophytic, soft and friable endometrial tumor (present on both anterior and
posterior endometrium), which grossly invades 1.5 cm into and up to 3.5 cm
thick myometrium. The tumor also extends to involve the left anterior and
posterior lower uterine segment, 3.8 and 2.9 cm from the external 05,
respectively. The 7 x 1.4 cm right endometrial cavity is compressed and
distorted by the aforementioned tumor in the left endometrial cavity as well
as by a large intramural nodule underlying the left endometrial cavity. The
right endometrium is 0.1 cm thick and contains two small, superficial tan
polyps, each 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm. These polyps are within the posterior right

endometrium.

There are three total myometrial nodules ranging from 1.5 cm in greatest
dimension- 4 x 3.5 x 3 cm. All three nodules are intramural without
hemorrhage or necrosis, with the two smallest within the anterior, right
myometrium and the largest within the posterior, left myometrium.

The bilateral ovaries are pink-yellow with a 0.4 cm in diameter simple
cortical cyst within the left ovary with smooth inner walls. The bilateral
fallopian tubes are also unremarkable.

Also received is a separate 92 gram (fixed weight), 7.6 x 5.5 x 5.4 cm
white-tan, smooth nodule which on sectioning is focally calcified with an
otherwise whorled cut surface without hemorrhage or necrosis.

Note: Uterus didelphys is present

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: Hysterosalpingo-oohporectomy and node dissection

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 7th Edition): ple pNO pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.

DIAGNOSIS:
0 " v A. UTERUS, CERVIX, FALLOPIAN TUBES AND OVARIES (AFl-4):
l

UTERUS: 303 GRAMs
CARCINOMA OF THE ENDOMETRIUM:
TUMOR SITE: LEFT EUNDUS, LEFT LOWER UTERINE SEGMENT, AND EOCAL
INVOLVEMENT OF RIGHT FUNDUS.
HISTOLOGIC TYPE: ENDOMETRIOID ADENOCARCINOMA. »///
FIGO GRADE: 2/3. , L, ‘
TUMOR SIZE: APPROXIMATELY 6 x 4 x 1.2 CM.
MAXIMUM DEPTH OE MYOMETRIAL INVASION: 1.5 CM, IN A 2.9 THICK WALL.
LYMPHATIC/VASCULAR INVASION: ABSENT.
ADJACENT NON—NEOPLASTIC ENDOMETRIUM: ENDOMETRIAL INTRAEPITHELIAL
NEOPLASIA (RIGHT AND LEFT). '
REMAINING MYOMETRIUM: LEIOMYOMATA.
CERVIX: NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.
SEROSA: NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.
SPECIMEN MARGINS: NOT INVOLVED.

OVARIES, RIGHT AND LEFT: NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.
FALLOPIAN TUBE, RIGHT AND LEFT: NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.
B. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE, DISSECTION:

EIGHT LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/8).

C. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE, DISSECTION:

NINE LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/9).

COMMENT: In part A, the adenocarcinoma involves mainly the left portion of
the fundus in this uterus didelphys, but also focally involves the right
fundus and an endometrial polyp in the right side. In most areas, the
myometrial invasion is limited to the inner half of the myometrium, but in one
area in the left posterior endomyometrium , myometrial invasion by
carcinoma is present just beyond the mid point of the myometrium.

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).
