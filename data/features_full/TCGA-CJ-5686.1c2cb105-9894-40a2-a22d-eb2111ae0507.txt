RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR CELL) TYPE, FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3.
TUMOR MEASURES 6.5 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION.
TUMOR IS CONFINED TO THE KIDNEY.
Margins of resection, negative for tumor.
Adrenal gland, no tumor present.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND - A radical nephrectomy specimen (15.2 x 14.1 x 6.2 cm) including the left kidney
(12.2 x 6.1 x 6.0 cm), a segment of renal artery, the renal vein, and ureter (9.0 cm in length by 0.8 cm average diameter), and the
adrenal gland (4.0 x 3.2 x 1.2 cm).

There is a 6.5 x 6.0 x 5.2 cm, well-circumscribed tumor in the upper pole of the kidney. The tumor is yellow-tan, with
extensive areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. The tumor is confined to the kidney, although it does abut the capsule. The tumor
does not invade into the perinephric adipose tissue, renal sinus, or renal vein. The tumor comes to within 0.3 cm of the renal sinus
and renal calyces. The tumor does not extend to Gerota's fascia.

The adjacent kidney parenchyma is unremarkable. The pelvicalyceal system is smooth, devoid of any lesions. No lymph
nodes are identified in the hilar area. Cross sections of the right adrenal gland show unremarkable cortex and medulla.

Portions of the tumor are submitted for possible electron microscopy, as well as other research protocols.

Tissue has been submitted to tissue bank.

INK CODE: Green - Gerota's fascia.

SECTION CODE: A1, ureter, renal vein margin; A2, A3, tumor abutting ink (stain); A4, A5, tumor in relationship to
pelvis/sinus; A6, A7, tumor in relationship to normal renal parenchyma; A8, sections of pale yellow tan tumor foci; A9, section of
normal renal parenchyma; A10, section of unremarkable adrenal gland. â€”

CLINICAL HISTORY
None given.
