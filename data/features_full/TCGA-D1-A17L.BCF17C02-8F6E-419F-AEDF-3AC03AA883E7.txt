Surgical Pathology

DIAGNOSIS:
A. Skin and subcutaneous tissue, abdomen, excision: Skin
and

subcutaneous tissue (2175 grams) with umbilicus identified
grossly.

B. Uterus, left and right ovaries and fallopian tubes,
hysterectomy

and bilateral salpingo—oophorectomies: FIGO grade I (of
III)

endometrial adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type arising in a
~ background ongomplex hypérplasia with agygia is
identified forming

a mass (4.8 x 3.5 x 1.8 cm) located in the
posterior/anterior

uterine wall. The tumor invades 0.4 cm into the
myometrium (total

wall thickness, 1.8 cm in greatest dimension) and also
involves

adenomyosis. The tumor does not involve the endocervix.

Lymphovascular space invasion is not identified. The
margins are

negative for tumor. There are multiple (2) intramural
leiomyomata

(ranging in size from 1.2 cm to 2.2 cm in greatest
dimension).

The bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes are not
involved.

[AJCCpleNOMX].

C. D. E. F. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, excision:
Multiple right

pelvic lymph nodes (1 internal iliac, 3 external iliac, 3
common

iliac, and 9 obturator) are negative for tumor.

G. H. I. J. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, excision:
Multiple left

pelvic lymph nodes (2 internal iliac, 4 external iliac, 5
common

iliac, and 7 obturator) are negative for tumor.

endometrial adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type is
identified forming

a mass (4.8 x 3.5 x 1.8 cm) located in the
posterior/anterior

uterine wall. The tumor invades 0.5 cm into the

and

subcutaneous tissue (2175 grams) with umbilicus identified
grossly.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled "pannus"is a 2175 gram portion
of skin

and subcutaneous tissue, # umbilicus. No lesions
identified. Gross

Only.

B. Received fresh labeled "uterus, left and right tubes
and

ovaries" is a 130.0 gram uterus with attached bilateral
tubes and

ovaries and an unremarkable cervix. The uterine serosa is
smooth.

 

 

 

 

 

There is a 4.8 X 3.5 x 1.8 cm mass in the
anterior/posterior fundus
of the endometrial cavity invading 0.4 cm with 1.8 cm

myometrial

thickness. There are multiple (2) uterine intramural
leiomyomas

measuring 1.2 cm to 2.2 cm. There is a 3.1 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm
right

ovary with a smooth outer surface and a solid cut surface
with a 9.0

x 0.5 cm right fallopian tube. There is a 3.8 x 2.5 x 1.0
cm left

ovary with a smooth outer surface and a solid cut surface
with an

8.1 x 0.5 cm left fallopian tube. Representative sections
are

submitted.

C. Received fresh labeled "right pelvic internal iliac"
is a 3.0 x

2.0 x 0.8 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.
All

lymphatic tissue submitted.

D. Received fresh labeled "right pelvic external iliac"
is a 3.0 x

2.5 x 0.8 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.
All

lymphatic tissue submitted.

E. Received fresh labeled "right common iliac" is a 4.0 x
3.0 x 1.0

cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. All
lymphatic tissue

submitted.

F. Received fresh labeled "right obturator" is an 8.0 x
3.5 x 1.2

cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue . All
lymphatic tissue

submitted.

G. Received fresh labeled "left pelvic internal iliac" is
a 1.5 x

1.0 x 1.0 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.
All

lymphatic tissue submitted.

H. Received fresh labeled "left pelvic external iliac" is
a 4.5 x

3.0 x 1.5 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.
All

lymphatic tissue submitted.

I. Received fresh labeled "left common iliac" is a 6.0 x
2.0 x 1.5

cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. All
lymphatic tissue

submitted.

J. Received fresh labeled "left obturator" is a 6.5 x 2.5
