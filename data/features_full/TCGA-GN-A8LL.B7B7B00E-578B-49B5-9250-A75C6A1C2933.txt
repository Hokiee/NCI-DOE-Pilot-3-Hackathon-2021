GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. SUPERFICIAL LEFT GROIN LYMPH NODE
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and ‘superficial left groin lymph node' is a tan
yellow fragment of lobulated adipose tissue 39 x 13 x 7cm. The specimen is partially surfaced with a tan
pink ellipse of skin 7 x 2cm. The skin surface is remarkable for a tan grey well healed scar 3.2cm.
Dissection reveals eight lymph nodes ranging from 5.5 x 4 x 3cm to 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.5cm. The two largest
lymph nodes are sen’ally sectioned to reveal a pigmented homogenous cut surface. A portion of the
largest lymph node is submitted for tissue procurement.
A1: skin
A2: three lymph nodes
A3: two lymph nodes
A4: one lymph node
A5—A6: one lymph node
A7—A10: representative sections of largest lymph node
B. HERNIA SAC
Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and "hernia sac" is a piece of ﬁbre-
encapsulated fat, 7.5 x 4.8 x 1.7 cm. Sectioned, it has a uniform yellow-tan cut surface. No discrete
lesions are identiﬁed; representatively submitted, 31-82.
C. MOST PROXIMAL LEFT EXTERNAL lLIAC LYMPH NODE

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "most proximal external iliac lymph node" is a
1.5 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm lymph node. It is sectioned and a touch prep is performed; lymph node is submitted

entirely. C1.

D. LEFT EXTERNAL ILIAC LYMPH NODES

Received in formalin labeled with patient's identiﬁcation and "left external iliac lymph node" is a piece of
yellow-tan soft tissue, 7.4 x 5.3 x 1.4 cm containing 3 lymph nodes, 2.7 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm, 3.1 x 20.9 cm.
and 3.4 x 2.2 x 1.3 cm. The lymph nodes are sectioned and have pink—tan cut surfaces; lymph node is

submitted entirely:

D1:1 bisected lymph node
D2-DS: 1 bisected lymph node
04-06: 1 sectioned lymph node

E. LEFT OBTURATOR LYMPH NODES

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "left obturator lymph node" is a piece of
yellow-tan soft tissue, 5.1 x 2.4 x 1.3 cm containing 3 lymph nodes. 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm. 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4
cm, and 5.3 x 1.7 x 1.1 cm. The largest lymph node is sectioned and has a yellow-tan cut surface;

lymph nodes are submitted entirely:
E1: 2 lymph nodes
E2-E6: 1 sectioned lymph node

CLINICAL HISTORY:
None Given

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
