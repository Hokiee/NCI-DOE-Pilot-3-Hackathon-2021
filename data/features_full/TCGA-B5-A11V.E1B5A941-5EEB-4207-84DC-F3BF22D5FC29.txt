CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neooorpus uteri.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries (AFl-2)", received fresh for
frozen section and placed in formalin at is a 368 gram,
11.1 x 7.5 x 7.2 cm uterus with attached left ovary (3 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm), left
fimbriated fallopian tube (8.6 cm long x 0.5 cm in diameter), right ovary (3.7
x 2.7 x 1.6 cm), and right fimbriated fallopian tube (7.1 cm long x 0.5 cm in
diameter). The uterus was received open from the OR, chiseled and grossly
distorted. Extending 0.4 cm into a 3.5 cm thick myometrium is a 3.4 x 1.4 x
0.5 cm (protruding into cavity) soft, tan, friable endometrial mass that
involves both the anterior and posterior endometrium. The mass is 3.5 cm from
the anterior and posterior lower uterine segment. A full—thickness section of
the mass and underlying myometrium was frozen as representative AFl-Z. The
uninvolved endometrium (0.1 cm thick) is smooth, tan, and is within a 3.1 cm
wide x 7.6 cm long endometrial cavity. The myometrium has eight homogenous,
white, whorled nodules ranging from 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm up to 4.3 x 3.5 x 3.5
cm, each of which bulge on cut section. At the posterior lower uterine
segment is a 3.8 x 3.1 x 2.5 cm full—thickness defect with surrounding
tattered soft tissue. The cervix is 2.8 cm in diameter and has a scant amount
of recognizable smooth, white ectocervix and a grossly distorted endocervical
canal. The serosa is tan and smooth with a single subserosal homogenous,
white, whorled nodule (2.2 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm).

0.9 x 0.8 cm smooth, well—circumscribed, rubbery, pink—purple nodule that is.
0.2 cm to the capsule. The right ovarian surface is smooth, tan-yellow. There
is a 1.2 x 1.1 x 1 cm smooth, rubbery, tan, lobulated nodule that is 0.1 cm to
the capsule. The remainder of the left and right ovarian parenchyma are
unremarkable. The right fimbria is dusky purple—red and the left and right
fallopian tube mucosa are each diffusely erythematous.

.‘ The left ovarian surface is smooth, yellow-tan. The parenchyma has a 0.9 x

Also received in the same container is a 52 gram (6.6 x 4.3 x 3.5 cm)
homogenous, white, whorled nodule without hemorrhage or necrosis.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL FINDINGS:
Imunohistochemical stains for inhibin and calretinin are performed on the
left ovarian nodule (slide A16) and are strongly positive supporting the
diagnosis of hilus cell tumor.

Immunohistochemical stains performed on the right ovarian nodule show strong
staining for inhibin and weak staining for actin. 5 negative. This
imunohistochemical profile supports cellular fibroma.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. UTERUS WITH CERVIX, BILATERAL OVARIES AND EALLOPIAN TUBES:

UTERUS: 368 GRAMS
CARCINOMA OF THE ENDOMETRIUM:
TUMOR SITE: CORPUS. ,
HISTOLOGIC TYPE: wyiL-DIFFERENTIATED«gNDOMETRIOID ADENOCARCINOMA.
FIGO GRADE:‘1j ““"““"

LYMPHATIC/VASCULAR INVASION: FEW FOCI SUSPICIOUS FOR LYMPHOVASCULAR
INVASION (SEE COMMENT).
ADJACENT N0N~NEOPLASTIC ENDOMETRIUM: INACTIVE.
REMAINING MYOMETRIUM: MULTIPLE LEIOMYOMAS MEASURING UP To 4.3 CM
IN GREATEST DIMENSION.
CERVIX: No PATHOLOGIC ABNORMALITY.
SEROSA: FREE or TUMOR.

OTHER FINDINGS: SEPARATE 6.6 CM LEIOMYOMA.

B. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE (EXCISION):

NO TUMOR SEEN IN ONE LYMPH NODE (0/1).

C. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE (EXCISION):
NO TUMOR SEEN IN TWO LYMPH NODES (0/2).
Comment: Within the hysterectomy specimen, there are a few foci suspicious for
lymphovascular invasion by tumor. The specimen is received disrupted and
artifactual displacement of tumor into lymphatic spaces is a possibility. Dr.
was consulted and concurs.

Sections of the right ovarian nodule show a cellular spindle cell neoplasm

with increased mitotic activity , and no cytologic atypia. The
spindle cells are positive for inhibin supporting a mitotically active
cellular fibroma. Dr. , as also reviewed sections from the right

ovary and concurs with this interpretation.

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(eS).
