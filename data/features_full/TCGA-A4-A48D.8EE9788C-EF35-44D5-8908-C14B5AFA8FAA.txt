FlNAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Source of Specimen:
Masswight renal mass

Clinical Histoglggerative Dx:
Right renal

Gross Descrigtjgg;

Single specimen designated as right renal mass. initially received in the fresh state for possible
Oncogenolyping studies is a 50 gram portion of renal tissue, 6.5 x 5.0 x 4.2 cm. The likely deep surgical
margin is now marked black. The renal capsular surface includes a discreet amount or Garcia's fascia. and
is now over-inked blue.

The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a welt-circumscribed encapsulated appearing tumor mass
measuring upwards of 4.2 cm and demonstrating a predominantly delicate. possibly non viable, deep-red.
hemorrhagic cut surface. The mass lesion grossly approaches within 0.3 cm of the nearest Surgical margin.
The grossly uninvolved renal tiesue along the deep surgical margin is dusky red and purple. The tumor
mass appears grossly confined and abuts the renal capsule.

A representative portion of the tumor mass along with "paranormal“ renal tissue is submitted tor
Oncogenotyping studies. Representative sectionslponlons of the mass lesion are submitted for routine
histology in Al and A2 (wrapped in ﬁlter paper) with the renal oapouleIGerota‘s fascia represented in
Ail-A4 and surgical margin and tumor relationship in A593.

Microscopic Degeription:
Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic ﬁndings are reﬂected in the diagnosis
