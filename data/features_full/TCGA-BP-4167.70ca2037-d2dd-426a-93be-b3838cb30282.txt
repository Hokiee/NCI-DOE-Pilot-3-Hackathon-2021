Laparoscopic right radical nephreotomy.

Specimens Submitted:
1: SP: Right kidney and partial adrenal .

 

 

DiAGNOSIS:

i) KIDNEY, RIGHT AND ADRENAL; NEPHRECTOMY:
— RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CLEAR CELL TYPE (CONVENTIONAL TYPE). NUCLEAR GRADE IIIIV.
- THE PATTERN OF GROWTH IS ACINAR AND SOLID.
. - THE TUMOR GREATEST DEAMETER IS 4.5 CM.
- THEITUMOR EXTENDS THROUGH THE RENAL CAPSULE BUT IS CONFINED WITHIN GEROTA‘S FASCIA.
— NO INVASION OF THE RENAL VEIN ES iDENTlFIED.
— ALL SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR.
— THE NON—NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY IS UNREMARKABLE.
— THE ADRENAL GLAND IS UNREMARKABLE.

i) The specimen is received fresh. labeled “Right Kidney and Partial Adrenal". It consists of a kidney with perinephric tat
measuring 24 x' 13 x 5 cm. Adrenal gland is Identiﬁed measuring 3.2 x 1.2 cm and is grossly unremarkable. On cut section, the
kidney measures it .8 x 6 cm. - A portion of ureter is attached measuring 6 x 0.3 cm and is grossly unremarkable. Cut surface of
the kidney reveals a rather well-deﬁned and lobulated tumor located In the outer quadrant of the lower pole of the kidney. The
tumor measures 4.5 x 4.3 cm and is composed of multiple yeiiow—tan, hemorrhagic iobules separated by white-tan, ﬁbrous bands.
The tumor grossly seems to extend outside the kidney into the perinephric fat. The tumor approaches upon the renal pelvis. The
fat is increased in the renal pelvis. The caiyces in the area of the tumor are destroyed. The surrounding caiyces are grossly

unremarkable. Renal parenchyma is unremarkable. The mucosa of the renal pelvis and'ureter is smooth and shiny. Cut section
of the perinephrie fat. except for the area of tumor, is also unremarkable. Tissue is submitted for. TPS and EM.
