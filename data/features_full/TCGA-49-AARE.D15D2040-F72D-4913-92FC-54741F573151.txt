INTERPRETATION AND DIAGNOSIS:

1. LUNG, RIGHT UPPER LOBE (LOBECTOMY): INFILTRATING POORLY
DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINDMA (2 CM) WITH EXTENSIVE NECROSIS.
PLEURAL, BRONCHIAL, VASCULAR AND ALL SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE

NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. SURROUNDING LUNG PARENCHYMA SHOWS FOCAL MILD
EMPHYSEMATOUS CHANGES. SEE NOTE.

2. LYMPH NODE, R-lO (EXCISION): ONE (1) LYMPH NODE AND ASSOCIATED
FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

3. LYMPH NODE, STATION 7 (EXCISION): ONE (1) LYMPH NODE AND
ASSOCIATED FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

4. LYMPH NODE, R-4 (EXCISION): ONE (1) LYMPH NUDE AND ASSOCIATED
FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

5. PLEURAL NODULES (EXCISION): DENSE FIBROUS TISSUE WITH FOCAL ACUTE
AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATION, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

PART #1: FS: RIGHT UPPER LOBE, RIGHT LUNG MASS
Resident Pathologist:

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS --

FS: RIGHT UPPER LOBE, RIGHT LUNG MASS: INFILTRATING NON-SMALL
CELL CARCINOMA (2.0 CM} WITH EXTENSIVE NECROSIS.

Dictated by

The specimen is received fresh, labeled with the patient's name,

and designated right upper lobe. It consists of an
upper o e of lung, weighing 160 gm and measuring 14.0 x 11.0 x 2.0
cm. A firm nodule is palpated on the surface opposite the hilum. The
pleura overlying this area is non-puckered and normal appearing. The
remaining pleura is focally hemorrhagic, glistening and with extensive
anthracotic pigmentation. Sectioning in the area of the palpated
mass, shows an ill—defined gray-white and gritty mass, measuring 2.0
cm in greatest dimension. Grossly, this mass is located 0.6 cm from
the pleura surface and does not appear to involve a bronchus. The
mass is well-defined and freely movable from the adjacent lung
parenchyma. The arteries and vessels at the hilum appear grossly
normal. The pleura overlying the tumor is inked black. A
representative frozen section is taken. Hilar lymph nodes are not
present in the Specimen. The remaining lung is pink—red with focal
hemorrhage and is crepitant. Representative tumor and normal tissue

are submitted for future studies to tumor bank. The remaining tumor
is submitted in its entirety.
