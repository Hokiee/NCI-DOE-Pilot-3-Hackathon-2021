Extensive, central to peripheral bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma of histologically mixed
differentiation (G3), comprising partly maturing tubuloglandular cells and partly medium to
large cells and also clear cells, with partial necrotic alteration, invasion of the large pulmonary
vessels and the pleura. Tumor classification according to these findings pT2 pN1 V2 RX,
stage IIB. C34.2; M 8255/3.

Comment/supplementary remark:

The tumor invasion of the large pulmonary vessels with formation of lumen-obstructing
thrombi of polypoid growth extending beyond the resection margin is very unusual.. The wall
adhesion of the carcinoma is minimally about 0.5 mm from the resection margin of the
vessels. The RX situation is likely explained by the fact that the tumor plug causing
intraluminal obstruction of the middle lobe also adheres to the wall at a site on the resection
margin. In addition, the tumor invasion in the pleura extends focally as far as the surface of
the pleura. The glandular maturation component is partly reminiscent of the fetal type of
bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma. The smoldering or recurrent pneumonia is likely to have
been of retrostenotic origin. The lymph node with tumor is located in the hilus region
immediately next to one of the tumor-infiltrated large pulmonary vessels
