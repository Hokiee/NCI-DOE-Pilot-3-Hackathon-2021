By Dr. called to Dr.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. NON-SENTINEL NODES RIGHT AXILLA
Received fresh and labeled with the patient name designated "A — non-sentinel nodes n‘ght axilla", are 2
portions of ﬁbroadipose tissue demonstrating 2 presumptive palpable lymph nodes; one lymph node
measures 3.5 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm, the second measures 2.0 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm. Both nodes are bisected.
Touch prep performed. One lymph node is submitted in cassette A1 and the second is submitted in
cassette A2.

B. RIGHT BREAST
Received fresh and labeled with the patient name designated ”B — right breast", is a resected
mastectomy specimen weighing 1,383 grams and measuring 29.5 x 22.0 x 4.0 cm. The attached
axillary tail measures 13.0 x 7.2 x 1.5 cm. A suture indicates the axillary region. The posterior margin
is inked black. The white-beige ellipse of overlying skin measures 21.8 x 11.0. The light beige areola
measures 3.5 cm in diameter. The inverted nipple measures 1.0 cm in diameter. The surface of the
skin is dense and wrinkled. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral. Cut section
shows two firm beige distinct lesions; the larger lesion is located in the lower inner quadrant in the
subareolar region and measures 3.6 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm located 4.4 cm from the smaller lesion. The smaller
lesion is ﬁrm present in the upper inner quadrant measuring 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm. The larger lesion is 5.1
cm from the deep margin. The smaller lesion approaches the deep margin at a distance of 2.0 cm. The
remainder of the specimen shows dark yellow Iobulated adipose tissue. Many firm lymph nodes are
demonstrated in the axillary tail ranging in size from 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm up to 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. A
portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representative sections are submitted as
follows:

81-82: The smaller lesion submitted entirely with overlying deep margin

83-39: Sections from the larger lesion

CLINICAL HISTORY:
A -year—old Caucasian female post menopausal abnormal mammogram. Biopsy showed an

adenocarcinoma, ER/PR-, Her2+, 2 masses at right breast seen. One at 12 o’clock position subareolar,

2nd mass at 1 o'clock posterior to 1st mass (3.0 cm).

COMMENT:

The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the
proportion score (0 = no staining. 1 = <1 % of cells staining. 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining. 3 = 11-30% of
cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak
intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring
range from 0 to 8.

ER/PR positive is deﬁned as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is deﬁned as an Allred score
of less than or equal to 2.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
lmmunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 105, 1:100) and PR (PGR
136, 1:100) provided by following the manufacturer 5 instructions. This
assay was not modiﬁed. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published
results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal
review of staining performance.

Interpretation: POSITIVE
Intensity: 3+
% Tumor Staining: 90%

 

Fish Ordered: No
METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved HercepTest (TM) test kit

using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modiﬁed. External kit-slides

provrded by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-
house known HER2 ampliﬁed control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well
preserved. clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identiﬁed for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2
immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided
by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.

This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from
A800 and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. Pathology
Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance.
