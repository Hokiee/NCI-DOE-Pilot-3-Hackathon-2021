Final Diagnosis lH lllllllllllllllllllllllllllHllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

Breast, left, simple mastectomy: Inﬁltrating pleomorphic lobular carcinoma with focal signet
ring cell features, Nottingham grade II (of III) [tubules 3/3, nuclei 2/3, mitoses 1/3; Nottingham
score 6/9], forming a mass (9.2 x 4.2 x 3.2 cm) located in the central region of the breast with a
separate nodule (0.8 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm) located adjacent to the main mass on the inferior aspect
[AJCC pT3]. Lobular carcinoma in situ is present within and outside the invasive component
(0.6 cm in greatest dimension). Angiolymphatic invasion is absent. The non-neoplastic breast
parenchyma shows proliferative ﬁbrocystic changes. Calciﬁcations are present in benign ducts
and acini. The tumor does not involve the nipple, skin, or underlying chest wall. All surgical
resection margins, including the deep margin, are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free
margin, 0.4 cm, deep margin).

Sentinel lymph nodes; left axillary Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4', sentinel biopsy: Multiple (4) left axillary
sentinel lymph nodes without blue dye are negative for metastatic carcinoma [AJCC pNO (i-)
(sn)]. Immunohistochemical cytokeratin stain was performed on the parafﬁn embedded sentinel
lymph node tissue and conﬁrms the H&E impression.

Her-2/Neu has been ordered on parafﬁn-embedded tissue.
