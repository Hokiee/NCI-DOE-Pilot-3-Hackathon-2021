III"IIIIIIIIIHIIIIIIIII l IIIHIIIIIII III IIIIH I IIIHII III
PART 1: LYMPH NODEs, RIGNT PELVIc. EXCISION —
No EVIDENCE OF NEOPLAsIA IN TWENTY (20) LYMPH MODES EXAMINED.

 

Collection Date: Ell

PART 2: LYMPH NODES. LEFT PELVIC, EXCISION -
NO EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASIA IN TWENTY EIGHT (23) LYMPI-I NODES EXAMINED.

PART 3: PROSTATE AND BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES. RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY -

INVASIVE POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA. GLEASON SCORE 3 + 4 I 7.

THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT LOBES AND HAS A GREATEST NODULAR
DIAMETER OF 1.4 CM.

THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THE EXAMINED PROSTATE VOLUME.

THE CARCINOMA SHOWS FOCAL EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION.

THE EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IS SEEN IN THE POSTERIOR LEFT BASE REGION (SLIDE 32).
BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA.

ALL EXAMINED SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA.

PERINEURAL INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

NO ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

HIGH-GRADE PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA IS IDENTIFIED.

PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: PT3a N0 MX.

TNM HISTOLOGIC GRADE I GS.

BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERTROPHY AND CHRONIC MODERATELY ACTIVE PROSTATITIS ARE NOTED.
