Pathology Report for Subject-

Discussion: The calculated MIB-l labeling index ranges up to 14.7%,
consistent with a high grade glial neoplasm.

Microscopic Description: Sections demonstrate a markedly hypercellular
glial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates both gray and white matter. The
majority of the tumor cells have round nuclei and well-formed perinuclear
halos. Others cells have small eosinophilic caps with cytoplasm or
microgemistocytic phenotype. The atypia is generally mild but many
scattered moderately, or even markedly, atypical nuclei are seen. Mitotic
activity is generally low, but in some areas up to 8 mitoses are seen in 10
high power fields. The tumor demonstrates both subpial condensation and
perineuronal satellitosis. Neither microvascular proliferation nor necrosis
are seen. Overall, the focally high proliferative activity suggests early
anaplastic transformation in the background of a low grade
oligodendroglioma.

Diagnosis: Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma (WHO grade III).
MIB-labeling index = 13.7%
