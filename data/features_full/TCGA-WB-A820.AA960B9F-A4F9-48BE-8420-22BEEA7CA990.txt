RIGHT ADRENALECTOMY
Macroscogz

The non oriented surgical specimen measures 90x75x60 mm. The mass contains a 5cm cavity with
necrotic material.

At periphery of the tumor there is an apparently normal adrenal tissue.

Separately it has been sent a lumbo-aortlc lymph node.

Microscopy

The histological aspects are suggestive of pheochromocytoma. The tumor cells have variable size with
flue limits, abundant and ﬁnely granular cytoplasm, with highly atypical nuclei, nuclear pleomorphisms
(PASS 1), and hyperchromasia (PASS 1). To note: the presence of frequent nuclear inclusions and
more rare intracytoplasmic hyaline globules. Fusiforrnis cells are also present (PASS 2). The mitoses
are rare (3 mitoses] 10 HPF) (PASS 0). but atypical (PASS 2).

Tumor cells are sometimes arranged in large nests (PASS 2), separated by a ﬁnely vascular stroma.
Many hemorrhagic alterations are observed in this tumor. The tumor invades in several points the

surrounding adrenal cortex without exceeding it. To note: the presence of vascular lymphatic invasion
(PASS 1).

A PASS score of 9 suggests a malignant pheochromocytoma.
The lumbo—aortic lymph node is normal.
Conclusions

Right adrenal pheochromocytoma with a PASS score of 9 suggestive of malignancy.

The lumbo-aortic lymph node is normal.
