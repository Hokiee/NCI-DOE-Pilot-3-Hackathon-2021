OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES

Not Given

Operation/Specimen: A: Brain, right temporal, excision biopsy
PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:

A. Brain, right temporal, excisional biopsies: Oligodendroglioma,

ana lastic. MIB—l proliferation index: 10%.
We

COMMENT

The specimen is fragments of cerebrum heavily infiltrated and focally effaced
by an oligodendroglial neoplastic proliferation. The neoplastic nuclei have
moderate anaplasia, and there are some mitotic figures. There are also
frequent gemistocytes, mostly mini gemistocytes. There is no appreciable
microvascular cellular proliferation or necrosis. The MIB—l proliferation
index is about 10% throughout the tumor. These features indicate the neoplasm
has undergone anaplastic transformation.

PROCEDURES/ADDENDA

MGMT Promoter Methylation
Date Ordered: Date Reported:
Interpretation

POSITIVE - Methylated MGMT promoter is detected.

Results—Comments

Testing was done on block (A2).

TEST DESCRIPTION: Bisulfite treatment of DNA followed by PCR amplification of
both methylated and unmethylated MGMT promoter sequences, with products
detected by gel electrophoresis.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a

stand—alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its performance
characteristics determined by the as

 

required by CLIA ' 88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for

INTRA—OPERATIVE CONSULTATION

A.
Brain, touch prep and smears: Glioma, C/W oligodendroglioma, atypical.
Frozen section performed at and results reported to the

Physician of Record.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A.

Received fresh, several fragments, 1.6 cm. in aggregate. Soft and semi firm,
tannish—purple. In total, Al—A3.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates many gemistocytes (mini— and
classical). About 5% of neoplastic cells over express the p53 protein. With

the MIB—l, there is a proliferation index of about 10% throughout the tumor.
