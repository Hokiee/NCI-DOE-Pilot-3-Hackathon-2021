GROSS DESCRIPTlON:
The specimen is received in eleven containers all labeled with the patients name

A. Container A is additionally labeled 1. Received fresh and placed in formalin aﬂer frozen section analysis is an approximately 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm
aggregate of while tan tissue, submitted entirely for frozen section analysis. The residual frozen section lissrie is received free ﬂoating within tho
spocmon container and partially within a white tissue cassette.

All tissue is submitted for permanent sections in cassettes labeled as follows: Al~residual frozen section tissue is received within a whita
tissue cassette; Aznlissue received free floating within the container.

B. Container B is labeled #2. Received in formalin is a 103 gram, 4.1 x 3.6 x 1.6 cm yellow tan. hemorrhagic. lobular portion of soft tissue consistent
with salivary gland; inked in blue. Sectioning revaals that the cut surfaces are diffusely yellow tan, lobular normal salivary gland parenchyma without
masses or other lesions. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes 81—85 labeled

C. Container C is labeled #3. Received in formalin is a 2.4 x 1.7 x 1.2 cm piece of focally oaulerlzed yellow tan lobular ﬁbroadlposa tissue. On out

section, the out surfaces are yellow tan. lobular, centrally ﬁbrotic, without discrete lymph nodes or mass lesions. All tissue is submitted in cassettes Cl-
02 labeled

D. Container D is labeled #4. Received in formalin is a 9.9 x 7 6 x 2.6 cm portion of yellow brown, lobular ﬁbroadiposo tissue. There is a suture to
designate loucl 2. The specimen is divided into three parts, with parll desrgnalad by the suture and further designated as the second part {mid portion)
and third part (distal to the suture). Careful sectioning within the sutured section/level 2 section reveals multiple tan brown ﬁrm possible lymph nodes
ranging from 0.2 to 3.0 cm in greatest dimansion. The largest lymph node is sort. dark brown on cut section, and involved by a 1.4 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm locus

Representative sections are subm ittod in cassettes labeled follows. level leutured area: Dt~threa intact lymph codes: 32423 gorse:

E. Container E is labeled #5. Received in formalin is a 2.9 x 2.1 x 1.6 cm portion of yellow tan lobular fatty ﬁbroadiposc tissue. Sectioning reveals three
pink tan ﬁrm possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.6 to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension.

All possible lymph node tissue is submitted in cassettes labelcr follows: Elmono lymph node sectioned and submitted entirely; E2---one
lymph node. lrisectsd; E3~one lymph node, bisected.

F. Container F is labeled #8. Received fresh and placed in formalin after frozen section analysis is a 2.1 x 1.1 x 0.2 cm piece of yellow tan ﬁbroadiposo
tissue submitted entirely for frozen section analysis. The residual frozen section tissue is received within a white tissue cassette and is resubmitted for
permanent sections in cassette F 1 labeled ‘

 

6. Container G is additionally labeled #7. Received in formalin is a 2.6 x 1.9 x 1.2 cm focally cauterized, hemorrhagic portion oftan yellow lobular
fibroadipose tissue Sectioning reveals a single 0.4 cm in greatest dimension firm possible lymoh node and a 1.8 cm in greatest dimension tan pink ﬁrm
lymph node. Each of these tissues are sectioned and submitted entirely in cassettes labeled as follows: Gl~possible lymph node.
bisected: 62 and (Ba-largo lymph node. sectioned and submitted entirely.

H. Container H is labeled #8. Received fresh and placed in formalin after frozen section analysis is a 0.4 cm in greatest dimension yellow tan wispy
tissue fragment received free ﬂoating in the specimen container. Also received in the container is an empty white tissue cassette. The tissue fragment
is submitted for permanent sections between sponges in cassette H1 labeled .

l. Containerl is labeled #9. Received fresh and placed in formalin after frozen section analysis is a 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm yellow tan soft tissue fragment
Submitted entirely for frozen section analysts. The residual frozen section tissue is received within a white tissue cassette and is resubmitted for
permanent sections between sponges in cassette ll labeled

J. Container .l is labeled #10. Received fresh and placed in formalin after genomic tissue collection and intraoperative inking and orientation. is a
portion of the loft mandible with attached soft tissue that is 8.9 cm from anterior to posterior, 4.1 cm laterally, and 4.6 cm from superior to inferior.
Superiorly. the specimen is surfawd by an irregular area of tan gray mucosa. 4.2 x 2.9 cm. The mucosal surface is centrally depressed/ulcerated and
remarkable for an ill deﬁned 3.2 x 1.4 cm tan roughened to friable tumor that is raised 1.1 cm from the surrounding mucosal surfaces. The surgical
margins have been previously inked as follows: inferior alveolar foreman on posterlon‘superior mandible - red; medial soft tissue margin - black. and
lateral soft tissue margin - yellow. Representative sections are submitted for genomic research and are received in yellow and green tissue cassettes.
labeled with the patients norm and and 7 respectively.

The specimen is transversely sectioned in an anterior to posterior fashion to reveal that the anterior 1.1 cm of the ragged ulcerated lesion consists of
exposed bone. The cut surfaces show white tan papillary tumor in the area of the mucosal mass and extending into the salt tissues on the lateral side.
Overall, the mass is 8.9 x 3.1 x 2.6 cm. Tumor grossly extends to the inferior alveolar foramen on the posterior/superior mandible margin. grossly
extends to the lateral soft tissue margin posteriorly. extends to the medial soft tiSSue margin grossly. and is 0.7 cm from the deep margin on use more
medial aspect The bone frankly invades the majority of the bone throughout the specimen.

The mass, hemorrhagic portions at the exposed ulcerated bone, also extend to the anterior bone and soft tissue margin.

No lymph nodes or additional discrete masses are identiﬁed on section.

 

Representative sections are submitted in cassettes labeled follows: J1 «inferior alveolar forsn‘ or: csszeconsupenor mandibular

K. Container K is labeled #11. Received in formalin is a 4.4 x 1.6 x 1.2 cm shave of lndurared. hemorrhagic cone with some attached ragged soft tissue
with blue ink to mark the new margin. This piece is grossly consistent with the anterior margin of mandible from the previous portion of this case. Along
one aspect, there is a portion of gray tan mucosa. 0.9 x 0.9 x {1.2 cm with the adjacent cons involved by crown roughened tissue; the rough area is 2.5 x
