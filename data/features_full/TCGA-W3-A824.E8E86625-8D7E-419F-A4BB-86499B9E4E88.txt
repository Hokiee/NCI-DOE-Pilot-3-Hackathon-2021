Metastatic me1anoma 1eft axi11a.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

1. .Labeied "1eft axi11ary nodes and contents, suture at apex": The specimen
conSists of a

531 gram, 19.5 x 15.5 x 5.5 cm segment of soft red and ye11ow fatty tissue.
Attached to

one sgrface is a 12.1 x 6.2 cm e11ipse of tan skin bearing a centra] 3.5 cm iong
suture

incision. The skin surrounding the incision is foca11y hemorrhagic and granuiar.
Beneath

the incision there is a previousiy bisected firm tan somewhat iobuiated 6.8 x 6.2 x
6.0 cm

tumor. A portion of the tumor appears to have been previousiy removed. Aiong the
apparent _ . _ _ _

deep surface the tumor is covered With an thin 1ayer of red tan tissue measuring
1ess than
0.1 cm in thickness. The deep margin surrounding the tumor focaiiy shows attached
red

brown muscie. The tumor does not appear to invade the overiying skin, which shows
a 3 cm

1on9 area of 1inear retraction which is iocated 1.6 cm from the sutured incision.
Beneath

the incision there is hemorrhage and ye110w tan fat necrosis adjacent to the tumor.
Additioga] rubbery firm purpie tan 1ymph nodes ranging up to 2.9 cm are found
within t e

soft tissue. Representative sections are submitted as fo11ows: 1A — tumor and
overiying . . . . . . .

skin and ciosest soft tissue margin, 18 — tumor and overiying skin inCiSion; 1C —
tumor and ' . _

ciosest soft tissue margin; 1D — Tymph node ciosest to suture, bisected; 1E — seven
nodes;

1F — 10 nodes; 16 — six nodes; 1H — five nodes; 11—13 — one node sectioned; 1K—1L —
one

1ymph node sectioned; lM—1N — one 1ymph node sectioned; 10 — two nodes each
bisected, one _ .

inked bTue; 1P — one Tymph node sectioned; 1Q — one 1ymph node sectioned; 1R — two
iymph

nodes each bisected, one inked biue; ls — two 1ymph nodes each bisected, one inked
blue; 1T

- two iymph nodes each bisected, one inked b1ue; 1U — two 1ymph nodes, one inked
biue and

not sectioned, one uninked and sectioned.

2. _Labe1ed "skin 1esion 1eft chest waii, ruie out in transit metastasis": The
speCimen

consists of a 0.4 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm pink tan tissue fragment.

Tota11y submitted in
2A.

Microscopic sections are prepared and interpreted.

DIAGNOSIS

1. “(LEFT AXILLARY LYMPH NODES AND AXILLARY CONTENTS.

— BULKY METASTASIS OF MALIGNANT MELANOMA (6.8 CM DIAMETER) COMPLETELY
REPLACING ONE

LYMPH NODE.
LMALIGNANT MELANOMA EXTENDS BEYOND LYMPH NODE CAPSULE INTO SOFT TISSUE OF

AND INTO DERMIS OF AXILLARY SKIN.
.METASTATIC MALIGNANT MELANOMA WITHIN 2 OF 44 ADDITIONAL LEFT AXILLARY

NODES.
— BIOPSY SITE REACTION AND SKIN SCAR.
- ~AJCC PATHOLOGIC STAGE T2 N2a (STAGE III).

AXILLA

LYMPH

2. SKIN BIOPSY OF LEFT CHEST WALL.
— BENIGN CAPILLARY HEMANGIOMA.
- NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.
