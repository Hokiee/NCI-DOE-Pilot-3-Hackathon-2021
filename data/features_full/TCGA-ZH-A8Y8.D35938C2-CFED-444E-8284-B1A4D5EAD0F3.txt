34a 4/15/14
Diagnosis:
A: Lymph node, hepatoduodenal, biopsy
— One benign lymph node, negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/1)
B: Liver, left lobe, partial hepatectomy
Histologic tumor type/subtype: cholangiocarcinoma (see comment)

Histologic grade: moderately differentiated
Tumor location: left lobe

Tumor size: 3.9 cm (gross measurement)
Focality: unifocal

‘Tumor growth pattern: mass forming

Tumor necrosis/treatment effect: scattered associated tumor necrosis
present (no known prior treatment)
Vascular invasion: not identified

Perineural invasion: focally present
Capsular invasion: not identified

Margins: parenchymal margin is uninvolved by tumor, 2.1 cm away

Lymph nodes: see specimen A

Background liver: scattered mild chronic inflammation, minimal
microvesicular steatosis involving less than 5% of the hepatic
parenchyma, and mildly increased portal fibrosis

AJCC Pathologic TNM Stage: pTl pNO

NOTE: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information
available at the time of this report, and is subject to change
pending clinical review and additional information.

Comment:

Based on the lack of clinical or radiologic evidence to support the
presence of a primary adenocarcinoma arising outside of the liver,
the presence of a 3.9 cm solitary mass in the left liver lobe
consisting of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma is consistent
with a diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma.

Special stains are performed on a section of liver parenchyma away
from the tumor mass. The liver is negative for significant iron
deposition. There is no evidence of alpha-l—antitrypsin deficiency
(no DPAS positive globules identified within hepatocytes). A
trichrome stain shows a mild increase in portal fibrosis. A
reticulin stain also highlights the mild increase in fibrosis with
an otherwise normal hepatic plate thickness.

Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis:

A frozen section consultation was reguested by Dr. in OR .
Specimen delivery time is

FSAl: Lymph node, hepatoduodenal, biopsy
— No tumor seen. Moderate number of MN giant cells, histiocytosis.

Drs. on at

Frozen Section Pathologist: , MD

Clinical History:

.—year—old male with a liver adenocarcinoma favoring
cholangiocarcinoma, questionable primary upper GI or biliary tree.

Gross Description:

Received are two appropriately labeled containers. Specimen A is
received fresh for frozen section.

Container A is additionally labeled "hepatoduodenal lymph node for
frozen section." It consist of a 2.2 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm green/brown
lymph node candidate. The specimen is serially sectioned and

entirely submitted for frozen section and resubmitted in block FSAl
and FSA2,

Container B:

Specimen Type: left lobectomy

Specimen Weight: 355 grams
Measurement: 15.0 x 14.4 x 3.5 cm

Orientation: The specimen is received with a stitch marking the
caudal cut margin. The surgical cut margin is inked blue.

Capsule: red/brown and smooth

Mass: 3.9 x 3.5 x 2.2 cm; The mass is within the specimen; it is
near the falciform ligament. The mass is tan/white and firm with
relatively circumscribed edges.

Distance from the capsule: 0.5 cm

Distance from the inked surgical margin: 2.2 cm; no necrosis is seen
Adjacent liver tissue: tan/brown, firm and unremarkable

Major portal vein/ hepatic vein: n/a

Gallbladder: n/a

Other comments: Tissue and normal tissue to Tissue Procurement.

Block Summary:

B1 - ductal structures, en face

B2 — mass with respect to capsule

B3 - mass with respect to surgical margin, bisected
B4,BS — sections of tumor with respect to bile duct
B6 — normal liver parenchyma

Tissue remains.
