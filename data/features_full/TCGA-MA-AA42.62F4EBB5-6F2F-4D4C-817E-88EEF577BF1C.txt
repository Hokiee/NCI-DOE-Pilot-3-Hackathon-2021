ADDENDUM— IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY

Results-Comments

negative. The squamous cell carcinoma appears poorly differentiated,
however, there are also features suggestive of a possible
lymphoepithelial— —like carcinoma, which is a subtype of squamous cell

carcinoma with a better prognosis than the typical poorly differentiated
squamous cell carcinoma.

Dr. has reviewed this case and agrees.

PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS

CERVIX, BIOPSY:
- FRAGMENTS OF INVASIVE SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA
- PENDING ADDITIONAL WORKUP (SEE COMMENT)

Comment

The biopsy is fragmented and the depth of invasion cannot be assessed. The

tumor spans the entirety of tissue fragments with the largest fragment of
tumor measuring 4.0 mm in greatest dimension.

Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumor cells are positive for CK
5/6, p63, and p16 and negative for CEA and $100. The morphologic and
immunohistochemical features support the diagnosis is squamous cell
carcinoma. The morphologic features, however, are unusual and further

classification is pending additional workup. The final diagnosis wil be
reported in an addendum.

Dr. was notified of the results on at

Dr. and Dr. 4 have reviewed this case and agree with the
diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma.
