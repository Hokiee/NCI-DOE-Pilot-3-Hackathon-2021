SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

SPECIMEN
Left hemicolectomy

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Descending colon cancer.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

Received fresh subsequently fixed in formalin labeled "left
hemicolectomy" is a 28 cm. long portion of colon. The specimen is
open at both ends, arbitrarily inked blue and black. There is
pink—tan smooth glistening serosa. The peritoneal reflections
cannot be grossly identified. The specimen shows an umbilication
midway through the specimen. This area of umbilication is inked
orange. The specimen is opened to show a pink-tan smooth,
glistening mucosa with normal to abundant folds with an average
circumference of 5 cm. Located near the umbilication is a 4.8 x 4.0
cm. circumferential ulcerated lesion. The cut surface of this
lesion shows invasion into the muscularis propria, coming within 7.5
cm. of the radial margin, contiguous with the umbilication
previously described. The cut surface shows multiple diverticula
present. No discrete gross evidence of submucosal abscess or
perforation identified. There is a firm nodule in the fatty tissue
on cut surface it is grossly consistent with a diverticula
containing firm formed fecal material. No other discrete gross
lesions identified. Multiple lymph nodes are grossly identified.
Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Representative luminal margins; 2 —
representative section of diverticula with firm fecal material; 3 —
tumor to umbilication; 4 - tumor to normal; 5 - tumor to fat; 6 -
representative section of radial margin; 7 - possible mottled lymph
node subjacent to tumor; 8 - 3 possible lymph nodes; 9 - 8 possible
lymph nodes; 10 - 9 possible lymph nodes; 11 - 10 possible lymph
nodes; 12-14 - 9 possible lymph nodes; 12-15 - 9 possible lymph
nodes; 16 - 6 possible lymph nodes; 17 - 6 possible lymph nod 18
- 3 possible lymph nodes. AS-l8.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma
Histologic grade: Moderately-differentiated
Primary tumor (pT3): Carcinoma into and through muscularis propria,
into the subserosal fat.
Proximal/distal/radial margins: Negative.
Vascular invasion: Not identified.
Regional lymph nodes (pN): Metastatic carcinoma in l of 65 lymph
nodes (1/65).
Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: One focus, in area of main tumor
mass (possibly a lymph node replaced by carcinoma).
Other findings: diverticuli, multiple.

DIAGNOSIS
Colon, left hemicolectomy:

Adenocarcinoma, moderately-differentiated, with invasion
through the muscularis propria into the subserosa.
Negative margins of excision.
Metastatic carcinoma in one of sixty-five lymph nodes (1/65).
One focus of pericolonic tumor (possible lymph node), adjacent
to main tumor mass.
