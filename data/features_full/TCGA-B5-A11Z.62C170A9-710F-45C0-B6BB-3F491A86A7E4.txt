CLINICAL HISTORY:—
Malignant neoplasm corpus uteri. Per 61-year-old with FIGO grade 1

endometrioid adenocarcinoma. , N \//////

GROSS EXAMINATION: .
A. "Uterus, tubes and ovaries (AF1)", received fresh for frozen section and
transferred to formalin at -on- is a 95 gram, 8.7 x 5.6 x 4.1 cm
uterus with attached 3.5 cm cervix with a 0.5 cm patent 05. The ectocervix is
tan-pink and smooth with no gross lesions identified. The specimen is opened
to reveal a 3.5 cm x 4 cm endometrial cavity which is fully covered by a
tan—brown friable lesion. The estimated tumor size of the lesion is 4 x 2.5
cm and demonstrates possible gross invasion of 0:2 cm into a 2 cm

myometrium. The tumor extends to 4 cm of the cervical opening and appears to
partially involve the lower uterine segment. The myometrium is tan and
partially trabeculated with no nodules identified. The left ovary; 2.9 x 1 x
0.8 cm and left fallopian tube, 6.5 cm long x 0.9 cm in diameter are grossly
unremarkable. The right ovary, 3 x 1.4 x 0.6 cm is grossly unremarkable. The
fimbriated right fallopian tube, 5.5 cm long x 0.9 cm in average diameter
demonstrates multiple paratubal cysts up to 1.5 cm. A representative section
of the posterior endomyometrial mass is frozen (remnant A1). The serosal
surface is tan-pink and smooth with no grossly identified lesions.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 7th Edition): pTla pNx pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,

findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon‘s operative report.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. UTERUS, FALLOPIAN TUBES AND OVARIES (AFl):

 

UTERUS: 95 GRAMS:
CARCINOMA OF THE ENDOMETRIUM:
TUMOR SITE: DIFFUSE.
HISTOLOGIC TYPE: ENDOMETRIOIU ADENOCARCINQMA
FIGQ CRADE: 1 3."““““““”’I’
TUMOR‘SIEEFI‘ x 2.5 CM
MAXIMUM DEPTH or MYOMETRIAL INVASION: 0.0 CM, IN A 2.0 CM THICK WALL.
LYMPHATIC/VASCULAR INVASION: ABSENT.
ADJACENT NON-NEOPLASTIC ENDOMETRIUM: ATROPHIC.
CERVIX: NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
SEROSA: NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
SPECIMEN MARGINS: NOT INVOLVED.

OVARIES, RIGHT AND LEFT: NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.
FALLOPIAN TUBE, RIGHT AND LEFT: NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.

COMMENT:-as reviewed this case. The tumor involves the lower

uterine segment, but not the cervix. No myometrial invasion is identified.

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es) .
