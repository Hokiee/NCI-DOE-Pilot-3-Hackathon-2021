SOURCE OF TISSUE: 4. Labeled #4, "left lower lobe".

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: 4FSA-4FSB - RESERVE CELL HYPERPLASIA. NO
TUMOR SEEN.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received fresh for frozen section evaluation is a 235 gram, 12.5 X
10.5 x 4.5 cm. left lower lobectomy of lung. It is covered by a pink to red-purple, focally
anthracotic-stained pleura. There is up to 0.6 cm. of attached bronchus. The bronchial
resection margin is entirely submitted for frozen section evaluation and the frozen section
residues are submitted in two blocks. In the anterior segment, there is a 1.5 cm. in greatest
dimension area where the pleura is umbilicated. On sectioning through this area, there is an
underlying 5.0 x 4.5 x 3.2 cmﬁrm mass. The cut surfaces are light tan, ﬁrm, having irregular
borders. The mass extends to the hilar structures surrounding the bronchus and vessels. The

remaining out surfaces of the lung range from being tan—pink, soft and crepitant to areas
which are red-purple and soft. There are few palpable hilar lymph nodes, 0.4 cm. in greatest
dimension. Each is gray-black and anthracotic— stained. A representative section of each
lymph node is submitted. Representative sections are submitted in eight blocks.

DESIGNATION OF SECTIONS: 4FSA—4F SB ~ frozen section bronchial resection margin,
4A — vascular resection margin, 4B-4C ~ tumor with inked pleural surface, 4D-4F — random
tumor sections, 4G — random sections of uninvolved lung, 4H - hilar lymph nodes,
