Gross Description:
A. Specimen is received fresh and labeled “Sentinel node #1 ( ), F8". The specimen consists of one lymph
node measuring 1.6 x 0.9 x 0.40m. Specimen is bisected and submitted in toto for frozen section.

B. Specimen is received fresh and labeled "Sentinel node #2 ( ), F8". The specimen consists of one lymph
node measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 0.3 cm. Specimen is bisected and submitted in toto for frozen section.

C. Specimen is received fresh and labeled “Sentinel node #3 ( ), F8". The specimen consists of one lymph
node measuring 1.1 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm. Specimen is bisected and submitted in toto for frozen section.

 

Specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right breast mass (1 stitch superior, 2 stitches lateral, 3
stitches deep". The specimen consists of an 8.0 x 8.0 x 4.0 cm lumpectomy specimen, oriented with one
stitch at superior, two stitches as lateral and three stitches as deep.

The specimen is inked for evaluation of margins:

Posterior black
Anterior yellow
Superior blue
Inferior green
Lateral orange
Medial red

Serial sections are white-gray, ill-deﬁned and ﬁrm. A mass is identiﬁed measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm; the
mass is 1.0 cm from the superior margin, 2.0 cm from the inferior margin. 1.0 cm from the anterior margin,
30 cm from the lateral margin, 1.5 cm from the medial margin and 1.0 cm from the deep margin. The

remainder of the specimen consists of yellow-white adipose tissue. No other lesions are identiﬁed. 90% of
the mass was submitted for microscopic examination.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Cassette #1 Superior margin perpendicular
Cassette #2 Inferior margin perpendicular
Cassette #3 Lateral margin perpendicular
Cassette #4 Medial margin perpendicular
Cassette #5 Anterior margin perpendicular
Cassette #6 Deep margin perpendicular
