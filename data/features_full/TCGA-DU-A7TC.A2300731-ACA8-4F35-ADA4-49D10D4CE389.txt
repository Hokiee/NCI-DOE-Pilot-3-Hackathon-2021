Operative Diagnoses
Operation I Specimen

A: Brain, probably tumor, biopsy
Pathologic Diagnosis

A. Brain, tumor, excision biopsy: Diffuse astrocytoma. WHO grade II (see comment).
Comment

Permanent sections conﬁrm the frozen section diagnosis. Sections show an infiltrating astrocytoma.

Mitotic ﬁgures

and/or vascular proliferation are not seen. The Ki-67 labeling index is approximately 3%. Positive and

negative

controls show appropriate immunoreactivity.

Additional studies will be reported below in procedure addenda.

MGMT Promoter Methylation

Date Ordered: Date Reported:

Interpretation

NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected.

Results-Comments

Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor parafﬁn block (A2)

H and E slide was examined and tumor DNA was enriched by microdissection

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
beneﬁt

from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite
treatment of

DNA followed by real-time PCR ampliﬁcation of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into

unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors

such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic
test. This test

was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLIA '88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for speciﬁc uses by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in the context of established
procedures
and/or diagnostic criteria.

Gross Description

A. Brain, tumor, biopsy:
FlXATlVE: None, delivered fresh.

DESCRIPTION: Fragments of brain tissue measuring 1 to 0.3 cm In largest dimension. Distinct white and
gray matter

is seen. Also, there are tan-gray gelatinous areas suspicious for glial neoplasm. Imprint slides, smears,
and frozen
section were performed.

SLIDES: A1: frozen section remnants; A2-3: rest of the tissue, entirely submitted.
