SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

DIAGNOSIS:

A. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE FROZEN SECTION:
- Metastatic poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. the size of the
metastasis is 2.5 cm, focally involving perinodai connective tissue

8. RlGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE:
- Two lymph nodes, no tissue present

C. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES:
~ Three lymph nodes, no tissue present

0. UTERUS. CERVIX:

~ Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma cervix inﬁltrating to a depth of

14.0 mm with extensive lymphatic invasion

- The anterior-posterior size of the tumor is 6.8 cm
The carcinoma extends to the posterior serosal surface and focally to
parametrium
The closest parametrial margin is at 3.0 mm from the carcinoma (right side)
All margins of excision are negative for tumor

Labeled with the patients name designated “right pelvic lymph node", and received
in formalin are three lymph node candidates ranging in size from 2.0 to 2.4 cm in greatest dimension and
aggregating to 2.9 x 2.4 x 0.7 cm. Entirely submitted.

D. UTERUS, CERVIX FOR RiI—LSEIlFilm

Labeled with the patients name . designated "uterus. cervix“. and received in
formalin is a 529.5 gram hysterectomy specimen. No attached adnexal structures are present. The
uterus is approximately 14.0 x 9.5 x 7.5 cm. The cervical portion of the uterus is approximately 4.6 cm in
diameter. 3.5 cm in length between the two of them. The cervical as measures 1.5 cm in diameter. The
posterior vaginal cull measures 4.5 cm x 1.1 x 0.2 cm. The endometrium is 5.0 cm long and 1.0 cm in
width and less than 0.1 cm throughout in thickness. The myometrial wall ranges in size from 1.5 to 3.0
cm in thickness.

The uterus is markedly distorted in shape due to the presence of a mass in the cervix and a large anterior
leiomyoma. The cervical mass is 6.8 x 5,5 x 4.5 cm in greatest dimension and is friable. diffusely necrotic
with areas of hemorrhage and with a wellucircumscribed but inﬂitrative border. The cervical mass comes
within 0.3 cm of the anterior inked surface and less than 0.1 cm of the posterior inked surface. Superiorly
the cervical mass does not appear to be grossly invasive or extend beyond the lower uterine segment.

The anterior leiomyoma measures 8.5 x 7.5 x 7.5 cm and is composed of solid while-tan tissue with a
whorled appearance. Additionally there are multiple {about ten) intramural leiomyomas ranging in size-
from 0.4 to 8.0 cm. one of which is subserosal. The myometrium is also suspicious for adenomyosis. No
other endometrial lesions are identiﬁed.

Representative sections are submitted.
Gross photographs are taken.

F. RtGHT TUBE AND OVARY

Labeled with the patient's name designated “right tube and ovary”, and received in
formalin is a 12.12 gram salpingooophorectomy specimen. The ovary measures 3.1 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm. The
fallopian tube measures 4.8 cm in length and ranges in diameter from 0.4 to 0.6 cm in greatest
dimension. Cut surfaces show a hemorrhagic area within the ovary and a mucosa-tilled fallopian tube
lumen. Representative sections are submitted.
