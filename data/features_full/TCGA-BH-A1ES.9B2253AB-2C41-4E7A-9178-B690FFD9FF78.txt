INTRAOPERATIVZ CONSULTATION:
FROZEN SECTION: 1) Sentinel node #1: 0.6 cm lymph node.
Frozen Section diagnosis: Negative for tumor by Touch Prep and Frozen Section.
2) Sentinel node 02: 0.8 cm lymph node.
Frozen Section diagnOSIs: Negative for tumor by Touch Prep and Frozen Section.
3) Sentinel node .3: 0.8 cm lymph node.
Frozen Section diagnosis: Negative fro tumor by Touch Prep.
4) Sentinel node 04: 0.6 cm lymph node.
Frozen Section diagnosis: Negative for tumor by Touch Prep.
CONSULT: Mastectomy: 21.0 by 12.0 by 3.0 cm breast tissue with 13.0 by 5.5 cm skin ellipse, and blue dye at
12:00 position. Inked And sectioned revealing a 2.0 by 2.0 by 2.3 cm light~tan, well position under nipple.
A second, 0.5 cm nodule is found inferior to (and 2.0 cm from) first nodule. Margins tree of tumor.

IMMUNOPEROKIDASE IDENTIFICATION OF ESTROGEN AND PROCESTERONE RECEPTORS IS CARRIED OUT ON SLIDE "DI".
DISTINCT INTRANUCLEAR STAINING IS IDENTIFIED FOR ESTROGEN RECEPTOR (30%) AND PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR (<103).
THEREFORE, ESTROGEN RECEPTOR IS INTERPRETED AS BORDEBLLNE AND PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR AS. NEGATIVE.
