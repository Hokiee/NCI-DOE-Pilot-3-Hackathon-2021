FINAL DIAGNOSIS

A. (Lung, right upper lobe; wedge resection): Squamous cell carcinoma, grade
2, extending to the visceral pleura and measuring 1.9 cm in greatest
dimension.

No convincing lymphatic permeation seen.

Margins of resection free of tumor.

Stage pTZNOMx

Remaining lung without pathologic changes.

3. (Level 7 lymph node; biopsy): Fragments of lymph nodes negative for
metastatic tumor.

C. (Level 4 lymph node; biopsy): Fragments of lymph nodes negative for
metastatic tumor.

D. (Lung, right upper lobe; wedge resection): Segment of benign lung tissue
with subpleural and interstitial fibrosis and chronic inflammation.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION

A. FROZEN:WEDGE RESECTION RIGHT UPPER LOBE, DISTANT FROM STAPLE LINE: Suture
line is negative for tumor. Grossly, tumor 0.6cm-0.7 cm from stapled margin.

(A91, A92)

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. The specimen is labeled frozen, wedge resection right upper lobe.
Received fresh is a 22.0 gram, 8.0 x 3.5 x 1.9 cm wedge of lung with a 9.5 cm
staple margin. The pleura is inked blue and the staple margin is submitted

for frozen section with the remnant placed in cassettes A91 and A92. After
the staple margin is removed, the underlying lung parenchyma is inked orange.
There is a 1.9 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm firm white and black nodule causing pleural
puckering and located approximately 0.6 to 0.7 cm from the staple margin.
Sections are submitted as follows: A91 and A92— staple margin; A1 — tumor
closest to staple margin, A2 and A3 — tumor closest to pleura; A4 remainder
of tumor; A5 - normal lung away from tumor.

B. The Specimen is labeled level 7 lymph node. Received in formalin are
multiple fragments of soft tan tissue measuring in aggregate 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.4
cm. The fragments are wrapped and submitted entirely in cassette Bl.

C. The specimen is labeled level 4 lymph node. Received in formalin are
multiple small fragments of soft red and black tissue measuring in aggregate
1.3 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is entirely wrapped and submitted in
cassette C1.

D. The specimen is labeled wedge resection, right upper. Received fresh is a
22 gram, 13 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm segment of lung with a 13 cm and 14 cm staple
margin, which are variably located from 1.1 to 2.1 cm apart. The lung
parenchyma is soft, red and unremarkable. No tumor masses are seen. The
pleura is inked blue and the 13 cm margin is submitted in cassettes D1 and D2,
the 14 cm margin is submitted in cassettes D3 and D4 and two representative
sections of the lung are submitted in cassettes D5 and D6.
