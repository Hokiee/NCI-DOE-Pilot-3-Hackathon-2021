Received on: g I (L7,-

Received in formalin 2 fragments of brain parenchyma, weighing 16.0 g and
measuring together 4.5 x 3,5 x 1,5cm. Present congested and brown-blackish
outer surface. To the cuts, there is whitish and homogeneous aspect.

Microscopy:

Histological sections stained with H & E show fragments of neuroepithelial
tumor composed of cells of round nuclei, delicate chromatin and
inconspicuous nucleoli. The cytoplasm is scant with imprecise limits.
Neoplastic cells are arranged on a ﬁbrillar background sometimes forming
microcysts and diffusely inﬁltrating the cerebral cortex. where it is observed
conspicuous neuron satellitosis by neoplastic cells. It is note the few areas
with increased cellularity, wherein the cancer cells have a higher degree of i
atypia and occasional mitotic figures (2-3 mitoses per 10 high-power ﬁelds). It ‘
is also demonstrates the formation of secondary Scherer structures in the

subpial region and around some blood vessels. There are no areas of I
necrosis or microvascular proliferation in this material. I
