Gross Descrigtion a

1. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "lymph node: Query right paratracheal
qs" consists of a piece of tissue that measures 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. it is frozen for intraoperative
consultation.

1A frozen section block resubmitted

2. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "lymph node: Right paratracheal lymph nodes"
consists of four pieces of tissue that measure from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm to 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm.
2A submitted in toto

3. The specimen labeled with the patient’s name and as "parathyroid: Adenoma" consists of one piece of
red-tan nodular tissue that measures 1.8 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm.
3A bisected and submitted in toto

4. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "right thyroid lobe and isthmus, stitch right superior
pole" consists of a right hemithyroidectomy specimen that is oriented with a suture and weighs 15.6 g. The
lobe measures 4.5 cm Sl x 3.0 cm ML x 2.0 cm AP and the isthmus measures 2.0 SI x 0.7 cm ML x 0.7 cm
AP. The external surfaces have fibrous adhesions. No parathyroid glands or lymph nodes are identiﬁed
grossly. The external surface is painted with silver nitrate. The lobe contains a well delineated solid nodule
that measures 3.7 x 2.8 x 1.8 cm. The isthmus contains two well delineated solid nodules that measure 0.2
x 0.2 x 0.2 cm and 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. The remainder of the thyroid tissue is grossly unremarkable.
Sections of the right lobe nodule and normal tissue are stored frozen. The remainder of the specimen is
submitted as follows:

4A-4l lobe, superior to inferior

4J, 4K isthmus
