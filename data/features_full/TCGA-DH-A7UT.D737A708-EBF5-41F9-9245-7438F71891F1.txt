CLINICAL HISTORY: —old male with no significant past medical
history. Evaluate revealed left frontal brain tumor. Here today for
left stealth awake craniotomy.
DIAGNOSIS:
A. "Brain tumor, left frontal, awake craniotomy for resection":
Anaplastic astrocytoma, WHO Grade III (see comment)
8. "Brain tumor, left frontal, awake craniotomy for resection”:
Anaplastic astrocytoma, WHO Grade I” (see comment)
C. ”Brain tumor, left frontal, awake craniotomy for resection”:
Anaplastic astrocytoma, WHO Grade III (see comment)
COMMENT: Sections show an infiltrating glioma with prominent nuclear and
cellular pleomorphism and non-uniformity and increased mitoses. No

definitive microvascular proliferation or necrosis is seen in this

material. Tumor cells and tumor cell processes are immunoreactive for

GFAP. The tumor is positive for mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase 1
(IDH-1). P53 is immunoreactive in numerous tumor cell nuclei (50%
approximately). PHH3 confirms increased mitotic activity (up to 7
mitoses per 10 high power fields). Ki—67 confirms a focally elevated
proliferation index (up to 8% approximately). These findings support the
diagnosis.

Molecular testing for 1p and 19q chromosome status has been ordered and
results will follow in an addendum to this report.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received the following specimens in the
labeled with the patient's name and hospital #

A. Brain tumor

B. Brain tumor

C. Brain tumor
A. The specimen is received fresh, designated "Brain tumor” and
consists of a 0.9 x 0.6 x 0.3 aggregate of pink to pink-tan soft tissue
fragments. Representative sampling is submitted for frozen section. The
resulting intraoperative diagnosis is "Infiltrating glioma. Grade
deferred. . Frozen tissue is resubmitted
for permanent processing in cassette FSAl with the remaining tissue
submitted entirely in cassette A2.
B. The specimen is received fresh, designated "Brain tumor" and
consists of an unoriented, 3.5 x 2.8 x 1.5 cm portion of pink—tan to red,
focally hemorrhagic soft tissue with apparent prominent vasculature on
one surface. The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in
cassettes Bl through BS with a representative sampling also submitted to
the tumor bank.
C. The specimen is received fresh, designated "Brain tumor" and
consists of multiple irregular and varying-sized fragments of pink to
pink-tan soft tissue, measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. The
specimen is entirely submitted in cassette C1.
"I, or my qualified designee, performed the gross examination. I have
personally reviewed the gross description and performed a microscopic

examination on all referenced material. I have personally issued this

report on the basis of the gross and microscopic findings."

Anatomic site: Brain tumor, left frontal lobe

Test description

Reference range: 1p/19q: Non—deleted

A tumor is considered to have 1p or 19q deletion when the 1p probe to 1q
probe ratio (1p/1q) or the 19q probe to 19p probe ratio (19q/19p) is

1.30. A tumor is considered to have chromosome 1 or 19 gain when the
percentage of nuclei with > or =3 signals is >20%. A normal 1p/1q ratio

is 0.9-1.05 and a normal 19q/19 p ratio is 0.93-1.02.

The test uses two dual-probe 1p36 probe combined with a
control 1q probe and a 19q13.3 probe combined with a control 19p probe.
Probes are specific to the minimally deleted regions of 1p (1p36) and 19q
(19q13.3) to detect 1p and 19q deletion. The selection of tissue and the
identification of target areas on the H&E stained slide is performed by a

pathologist. The number of 1p and 19q signals in the area of interest is

scored. The testing was performed and performance characteristics of this

test were validated by the
