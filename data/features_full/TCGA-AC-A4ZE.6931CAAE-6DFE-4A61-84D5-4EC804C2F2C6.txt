Location of lesion: The lesion is locamd approximately 7.0 cm

quadrant.

Distance from closest margin: The primary lesion is located 1.5

cm superﬁcial to the deep margin, 4.0 cm from the anterior

margin, 6.0 cm from the lateral margin, 19.0 cm to the medial

margin. 6.0 cm to the inferior margin. and 14.0 cm to the

superior margin.

Other findings: Two possible satellite lesions are located with

one central and one at 2:00. The central lesion measures 6.5 x

Uninvolved parenchyma: The uninvolved parenchyma demonstrates

unremarkable ﬁbrofatty tissue.

Axillary tail and lymph nodes: No axillary tail is received in
