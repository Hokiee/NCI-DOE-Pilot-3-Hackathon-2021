HISTORY: Pelvic mass

MICkOSCOPIC:

Sections of the tumor exhibit a high grade neoplasm which is solid
and focally papillary. mitoses are numerous. Cells exhibit high N/c
ratio. In some areas there is main production seen. however it is
mostly extracellular. Rare cells though seem to contain
intracellular mucin vacuoles i.e. 'serous papillary carcinoma with
foci of mucinous carcinoma'.

Labeled with the patient's name, designated '1eft tube and ovary',
and received fresh in the Operating Roan for the intraoperative
frozen section diagnosis and subsequently fixed in formalin is a 6.0
cm long segment of fallopian tube measuring up to 1.0 cm in the
external diameter. The external surface of the fallopian tube is
mostly tan-gray and smooth. There is a 1.3 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm paratubal
cyst identified. Attached to the fallopian tube is a markedly
distorted ovarian tissue measuring up to 5.5 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm. The
markedly distorted ovuian tissues/tumor is previously incised in
the Operating Room for the intraoperative frozen section diagnosis.
The cut surface of this mass is partially solid and partially
cystic. There are areas of yellow. firm, smooth area and there are
focal areas of hemorrhage. No normal ovarian parenchyma is
identified. Representative sections are submitted as follows.

Labeled with the patient“: name, designated 'right adnexa‘. and
received fresh in the Operating Room for the suhnission of tissue
for research and subsequently fixed in formalin is a 7.0 x 7.0 x 3.0
cm markedly irregular, tan-brown, firm portion of tissue. The
portion of fallopian tube measures up to 3.5 cm in length and
averages up to 1.0 cm in external diameter. It is in close
prmcimity of the tumor mass which measures up to 6.0 x 6.0 x 3.0
