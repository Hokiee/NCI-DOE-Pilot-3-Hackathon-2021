Comment: This case is amended . to add the results of
immunohistochemical stains for estrogen and progesterone receptors, as
noted above. No other changes are made.

Although ER and PR stains were previously performed on the patient’s core
biopsy , they were repeated due the greater number of
neoplastic cells in the current specimen and due to the focal staining for
progesterone receptors (reportedly 1%) in the prior biopsy.

Estrogen and progesterone receptors were evaluated by immunohistochemical
methods ( estrogen receptor antibody 1D5, progesterone receptor
antibody PgR636). A positive test is defined as easily discernable nuclear
staining in 1% or more of the tumor cells.

Patient: Specimen #:

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION (continued):

cm superiorly to inferiorly; and 2.5 cm anterior to posterior. The darkly
pigmented superficial skin ellipse measures 15.5 x 5.5 cm and displays a
1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm centrally located, everted nipple, free of discharge.
The deep margin is inked black and the superficial margin is inked blue.
Serial sections reveal a fairly well defined, firm pink-tan mass in the
upper outer quadrant. The mass measures 2.5 x 1.4 x 0.4 cm, comes to
within 0.4 cm of the deep margin and abuts the superficial margin.
Immediately adjacent to, and continuous with the mass, is a 0.4 cm
centrally located, red-brown probable biopsy cavity. A 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm
well~circumscribed, rubbery fibrous nodule is noted in the lower mid
breast which is consistent with a fibroadenoma. The remainder of the
specimen is composed of markedly dense tan—white fibrous tissue with
minimal admixed adipose tissue. No additional lesions are identified.

The attached axillary tail measures 8.0 x 6.5 x 2.0 cm. Sectioning
reveals 11 lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.3 cm in greatest dimension
‘to 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.7 cm. On sectioning, the two largest lymph nodes, one of
which is tagged with a suture, are tan—white and moderately firm,
consistent with involvement by metastatic lesion.

Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1- nipple; 2— mass with
deep margin; 3~ mass with superficial margin; 4— mass with deep margin; 5-
mass with superficial margin; 6—7— mass with deep margin; 8-9— mass with
superficial margin; 10- mass; 11— biopsy cavity; 12- biopsy cavity; 13-
lower mid nodule; 14— UIQ; 15- L10; 16— LOQ; 1?; central (adjacent to
mass); 18— one lymph node (marked with suture); 19- five lymph nodes; 20-
one lymph node; 21- one lymph node, bisected; 22- one lymph node; 23— one
lymph node; 24—25— one lymph node, sectioned.

Matched sections of 1,5,8—10, 12—18, 20 and 22—24 are submitted in
OCT/Paraffin per Time in formalin: >80 hours.
