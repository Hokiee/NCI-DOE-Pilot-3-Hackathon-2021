Addendum Discussion: The neoplastic cells exhibit cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for
GFAP. The background brain parenchyma demonstrates immunopositivity for
synaptophysin. CAM 5.2 is essentially negative. The MlB-l labeling index ranges up to
6.5% in the most proliferative regions of tumor. Overall, the histologic features are
consistent with an anaplastic oligodendroglioma.

Addendum Diagnosis:
1-3. Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma.
- MlB-l labeling index = 6.5%.

Microscopic Description:

1. Permanent section of the frozen section specimen demonstrates hypercellular brain
with numerous scattered macrophages, many of which contain hemosiderin. There are
admixed reactive small cells as well as clusters of cells that may represent neoplasm.

2,3. Sections demonstrate sheets and irregular large nodules of neoplastic cells
associated with extensive necrosis. In some areas a myxoid stroma is seen. Blood vessels
are thick walled and hypercellular and, in specimen 2, hyalinized. Atypia is moderate
and mitotic figures are surprisingly rare. In the unfrozen material the tumor cells tend to
have small to intermediate sized round nuclei with a small nucleolus. The cytoplasm is
clear. Although much of the tumor is a nodular pattern, slide 3A shows apparent diffuse
infiltration.
