FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS «Subtle : guild: "It“ (24,, C7
9%,; aLQ’7/IH
Anterior prostatic fat, excision: Benign ﬁbroadipose tissue.
Prostate, left lateral margin, biopsy: Benign ﬁbroconnective tissue.

Lymph nodes, right pelvic, dissection: No tumor in four lymph nodes (0/4).

POP?

Lymph nodes, left pelvic, dissection: No tumor in four lymph nodes (0/4).

Prostate and seminal vesicles, radical prostatectomy:
Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3+5=8, margins negative; see comment.
Seminal vesicles with no tumOr.

P?!"

COMMENT:

The tumor is composed of admixed Gleason patterns 3, 4, and 5, with approximately 50% of the tumor
showing Gleason pattern 3, 40% showing Gleason pattern 4, and 10% showing Gleason pattern 5.
According to Gleason grading guidelines (see reference below), if >S% of the tumor shows a tertiary
Gleason pattern with the highest grade, then this grade should be reflected in the overall score. Thus,
in this case, since 10% of the tumor shows Gleason pattern 5, we have assigned Gleason score 3+5=8.

Clinical History
The patient is a’year-old male with prostate cancer ranging in grade from 3+3 to 4+5 t case
He now undergoes radical prostatectomy.

Gross Description

The specimen is received in ﬁve parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.
Parts A-D are received in formalin. Part E is received fresh.

Part A, additionally labeled "anterior prostatic fat tissue (perm)," consists of multiple fragments of
irregular, deep-yellow, lobulated adipose tissue (4.2 x 3 x 0.3 cm in aggregate). No lymph nodes are
identified. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes A1-A3.

Part B, additionally labeled “left lateral margin (perm)," consists of one unoriented, rectangular

fragment of rubbery, dusky-gray, membranous soft tissue (1 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm), entirely submitted in
cassette B1.

Part C, additionally labeled “right pelvic lymph nodes - perm,“ consists of multiple irregular fragments of
rubbery, deep—yellow, Iobulated adipose tissue (4.2 x 4 x 0.8 cm in aggregate) that contain four
rubbery, ovoid, tan to gray, ﬁrm lymph nodes (0.5-3.5 cm in greatest dimension). The specimen is
entirely submitted as follows:

C1: Three lymph nodes, intact.
C2-C3: Largest lymph node, sectioned.
C4-C5: Remaining soft tissue.

Part D, additionally labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes - perm," consists of multiple fragments of irregular,
rubbery, deep-yellow, lobulated adipose tissue (3.5 x 3.5 x 0.8 cm in aggregate) that contain three

rubbery, ovoid, tan, ﬁrm lymph nodes (0.5-3.4 cm in greatest dimension). The specimen is entirely
submitted as follows:

D1: Two lymph nodes, intact.
DZ-DB: One lymph node, sectioned.
D4-D5: Remaining soft tissue.

Part E, additionally labeled "prostate + seminal vesicles," consists of a prostate gland (47 gm; 3.5 cm

 

from apex to base x 4.5 cm in width x 3.5 cm from anterior to posterior).

GROSS PAT HOLOGIC FINDINGS: One ill-deﬁned, pale-tan to yellow, gritty, ﬁrm lesion is identiﬁed in
the posterior aspect of the gland, in both the right and left lobes (2.2 x 1.8 x 1 cm) extending from the
apex through to slice 5, multifocally less than 0.1 cm from the capsule. The surrounding parenchyma is
pale-tan, spongy with a few well-circumscribed, rubbery periurethral nodules (up to 0.4 cm in greatest
dimension). The anterior ﬁbrous tissue is open. The remaining capsule is intact. The seminal
vesicles/vas deferens bundles (right 4 x 2 x 0.5 cm; left 3.5 x 2 x 1 cm) are tan-pink and Iobulated.

ORIENTED BY: Anatomic landmarks (seminal vesicles, urethra).
INKING:

- Right anterior: Green.

- Left anterior: Blue.

- Posterior: Black.

POTENTIAL STUDIES: Snap frozen. .

GROSS PHOTOGRAPHS: Yes.

TOTAL NUMBER OF SLICES: 8; not including apex and base margin slices.

Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. ﬁnal diagnosis made by attending pathologist following review of all
pathology slides. The attending pathologist has reviewed all dlctations, including prosector work, and preliminary interpretations
performed by any resident involved in the case and performed all necessary edits before signing the ﬁnal report.
