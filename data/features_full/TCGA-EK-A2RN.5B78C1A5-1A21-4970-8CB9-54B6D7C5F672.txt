Squamous cell carcinoma in situ with endocervical gland extension is also
identified.
Invasive carcinoma is present 0.5 mm from the deep (radial) cervical stromal
margin of resection.
. PARAMETRIUM, RIGHT:
. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, microscopic focus.
. PARAMETRIUM, LEFT:
. Benign fibroadipose and vascular tissue.
. One benign lymph node (0/1).
. VAGINAL CUFF WITH MARGIN:
Squamous mucosa with patchy mild to moderate chronic inflammation.
No diagnostic evidence of significant dysplasia or malignancy.
ENDOMETRIUM:
. Atrophic changes; negative for endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy.
VHTEETRIUM:

1) Received labeled with the patient's name and "left common iliac". Received is a
portion of yellow gold to pink tan fibroadipose tissue that is, 2.5 x 1.8 x 0.9 cm.
Specinen is dissected for possible lymph nodes. Three possible lymph nodes
identified, ranging from 0.6 to 0.9 cm in greatest dimension. Specimen is submitted
as follows:

CASSETTE SUMMARY:
CASSETTE 1A: Three possible lymph nodes.

2) Received labeled with the patient's name and "left pelvic lymph node". Received is a
portion of yellow gold to pink tan fibroadipose tissue that is, 4.5 x 3 x 1.2 cm.
Specimen is dissected for possible lymph nodes. Five possible lymph nodes identified,
ranging from 0.7 to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. Submitted as follows:

CASSETTE SUMMARY:

Cassette 2A: Two possible lymph nodes.
Cassette 28: One lymph node bisected.
Cassette 2C: One lymph node serially sectioned.
Cassette 2D: One lymph node trisected.
3) Received labeled with the patient's name and "right common iliac". Received is a

yellow gold to purple tan portion of fibroadipose tissue that is, 1.7 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm.
Specimen is dissected for possible lymph nodes. One lymph node is grossly
identifiable that is, l x 0.5 x 0.5 cm.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: (continued)
CASSETTE SUMMARY:
Cassette 3A: One lymph node bisected.

4) Received labeled with the patient's name and "parametrial nodule". Received is a
white to pale pink tan tissue fragment that is, 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. Specimen is
bisected and reveals a pale yellow tan calcified fragment. The specimen is entirely
submitted in cassette 4A.

5) Received labeled with the patient‘s name and "right para—aortic". Received is a
portion of yellow gold to pink tan slightly hemorrhagic fibroadipose tissue that is, 4
x l x 1 cm. Two possible lymph nodes identified, ranging from 1.5 to 2 cm in greatest
dimension.

CASSETTE SUMMARY:
Cassette 5A: One lymph node bisected.
Cassette SB: One lymph node bisected.

6) Received labeled with the patient's name and "right pelvic lymph node". Received is a
3.2 x 3 x 1.2 cm aggregate of yellow gold slightly hemorrhagic fibroadipose tissue.
Dissected for possible lymph nodes. Four possible lymph nodes identified, ranging
from 0.5 to 2.1 cm in greatest dinension. Submitted as follows:

CASSETTE SUMMARY:

Cassette 6A: Two possible lymph nodes.
Cassette 63: One lymph node bisected.
Cassette 6C: One lymph node bisected.
7) Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and "uterus,

cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries", is a 86 gram specimen including an unopened
uterus (7.0 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm), with attached vaginal cuff (1.1 cm in length), and right
and left parametrium each one measuring 5.0 x 4.0 x 0.3 cm), right fallopian tube (5.0
cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter), right ovary (2.2 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm), left fallopian
tube (4.8 cm in length x 0.7 cm in diameter), and left ovary (1.9 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm).
There is a 2.8 x 1.4 x 1.1 cm white—tan to gray centrally ulcerated mass involving
both anterior and posterior surface of the cervix. The mass appears to invade the
outer half of the cervical stroma to a depth of 1.0 cm and encroaches upon the deep
(radial) cervical margin of resection; the tumor is 0.8 cm from the vaginal cuff
margin that is grossly free of tumor. The external as is distorted by the mass. The
endometrial cavity (4.0 cm from cornu to cornu, 3.8 cm in length), has a tan-pink
endometrium (0.3 cm in average thickness). The myometrium measures 1.4 cm in maximum
thickness. The serosa is glistening and has adhesions on the posterior surface. The
fallopian tubes are patent and have fimbriated ends. Both ovaries have tan—white
smooth surface and multiple corpora albicantia. Representative sections are submitted
as follows:
