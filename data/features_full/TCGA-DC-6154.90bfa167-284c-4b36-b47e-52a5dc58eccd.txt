Gross Description:

1) The specimen is received fresh and labeled, "segment 2 and 3 of liver*".
It consists of a liver lobe measuring l2x5.6x3.l cm. The hepatic capsule is
grossly intact and is inked black. There is a rough hepatic resection margin
which is inked blue. Serial sectioning at 0.5 cm intervals reveals
tan-yellow, relatively well-circumscribed firm mass measuring 3.4x3.lx2.7
cm. There is no gross evidence of tumor within the vessels. There is no

gross evidence of tumor within the bile ducts. The tumor is 0.6 cm from the
inked surgical resection margin. The remaining hepatic parenchyma is
unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted. Portion of the tumor
is submitted for-

 

Summary of sections:

TC - tumor with hepatic capsule

TM - tumor with margin

U - uninvolved hepatic parenchyma (away from the mass)

2). The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "Low anterior resection
colon". It consists of a rectosigmoid colon that measures 18.0 x 6.3 cm at
the distal margin. The serosal surface has an area of central retraction
and narrowing. The affected serosa is inked blue the radial resection
margin is inked black and the specimen is opened to reveal a circumferential
ulcerated tumor with heaped up borders that is located 5.7 cm from the
proximal margin and 6.5 cm from the distal margin. The tumor measures 5.8 cm
in length and 3.5 cm in width. Serial sectioning reveals tumor invasion to a
depth of 1.2cm grossly extending through the muscularis into the pericolic
fat, 1.8cm from the radial margin but grossly abutting the retracted serosa.
There is an underlying grossly positive lymph node which is 1.2 cm from the
radial margin, which is submitted and an additional grossly positive lymph
node which is abutting the radial margin. The muscularis proximal to the
tumor is thickened up to 0.6cm. The remaining mucosa shows no other
discrete lesions and is otherwise unremarkable. Pericolic and peri-rectal
adipose tissue is thoroughly examined for lymph nodes and three grossly
positive lymph nodes are partially submitted for TPS, the remaining lymph
nodes are submitted accordingly. Representative sections are submitted. -

3) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "proximal ring" and
consists of a segment of unremarkable intestine, measuring 2 cm in diameter
and 0.5 cm in thickness. Entirely submitted.

4) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "distal ring" and consists
of a segment of unremarkable intestine, measuring 1.8 cm in diameter and 0.4
cm in thickness. Entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U-undesignated

5) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "left tube and ovary" and
consists of a fallopian tube with attached ovary. The fallopian tube
measures 4.5 cm in length and averages 0.5 cm in diameter. The external
surface of the tube is pink tan and smooth with a normal fimbriated end. Cut
section through the tube reveals a pinpoint lumen. The attached ovary
measures 2.2xl.2x0.5 Cm. The external surface is unremarkable. Cut section
through the ovary is unremarkable. Ovary is entirely submitted; and
fallopian tube is representatively submitted.

Summary of sections:
F - fallopian tube
0 - ovary

6) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "right tube and ovary" and
consists of a fallopian tube with attached ovary. The fallopian tube
measures 4.7 cm in length and averages 0.7 cm in diameter. The external
surface of the tube is pink tan and smooth with a normal fimbriated end. Cut
section through the tube reveals a pinpoint lumen. The attached ovary
measures l.6xl.2x0.5 Cm. The external surface is unremarkable. Cut section
through the ovary is unremarkable. Ovary is entirely submitted; and
fallopian tube is representatively submitted.
