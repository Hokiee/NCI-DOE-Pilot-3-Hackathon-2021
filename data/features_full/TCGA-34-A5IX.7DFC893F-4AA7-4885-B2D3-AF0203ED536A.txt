COMMENT:
lmmunhiatnchemncal and special stains are performed with adequate controls and demonstrate that the tumor cells are
positive for CKSIS and p63 and negative for 0K7, TTF-‘l. PAS—D and mucicarmlne, supporting the above diagnosis. An
elastic stain highlights tumor invading through the visceral pleura Into the ﬁbrous tissue of the diaphragm
Ancillary studies will be performed on block 3F and the results issued as an addendum.
