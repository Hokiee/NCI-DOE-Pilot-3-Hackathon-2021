W m U 0 w W

CLINICAL NOTES
CLINICAL HISTORY: Cavitary left upper lobe lung lesion.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS

Lung, left ectomy: Non-small cell carcinoma; negative

margins.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Received unfixed for frozen section and tissue

procurement, labeled upper lobe, is a 16 x 12 x 1.5 cm left

upper lobectomy specimen. There is a 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm mass lesion
which pleural puckering present on the posterior surface, adjacent
to the bronchus. It has an irregular border and a gray-white cut
surface with incorporated anthrocotic pigment. No additional mass
lesions are identified. A representative section of tumor is

submitted for frozen section diagnosis, as well as the bronchial and

vascular margins. A portion of tumor is also submitted for tissue
procurement as requested. Additional representative sections
submitted in six blocks. RS-8. Summary of sections: AFSl -
margins; AFS2 — tumor; A1—A5 — tumor; A6 - uninvolved lung tissue.
B. Received fresh, labeled "lymph node level 5" are two

rubbery tan gray-gold tissues measuring and 0.9 cm. in
greatest dimension which are submitted in toto. .

C. Received fresh, labeled "lymph node l 11" is a 1.2 x

0.8 x 0.3 cm. rubbery gray bl issue which is trisected
and entirely submitted in one block.

D. Received fresh, labeled " pad" are two fragments

of soft golden yellow adipose tissue measuring 0.6 cm. in
greatest dimension and 1.4 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm. The largest tissue is
ected and the specimens are entirely submitted in one block.

E. Received fresh, labeled "lymph node level 8" is a 0.8

cm. in greatest dimension gray rubbery ue which is
bisected and entirely submitted in one block.

F. Received fresh, labeled "lymph nod l 7" are two

soft gray black tissues averagi . in greatest

dimension which are submitted in toto.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma.
Histologic grade: Moderately-differentiated.
Primary tumor (pT): pT1b (2.5 cm in greatest dimension).
Margins of resection: Negative.
Direct extension of tumor: Negative.
Venous (large vessel) invasion: Negative.
Arterial (large vessel) invasion: Negative.
Lymphatic (small vessel) invasion: Not identified.
Regional lymph nodes: Five negative lymph nodes (0/5).
Comments: Carcinoma invades up toward the pleural surface, but does
not appear to directly involve the visceral pleura.

DIAGNOSIS
A. Lung, left upper lobe, lobectomy:
Adenocarcinoma, 2.5 cm in greatest dimension.

DIAGNOSIS
Negative margins of excision.
Angiolymphatic invasion not identified.
B. Lymph node, level 5, regional resection:
Two negative lymph nodes (0/2).
C. Lymph node, level 11, biopsy:
One negative lymph node (0/1).
D. Soft tissue, "9L fat pad, biopsy:
Benign fibroadipose tissue and one negative lymph node (0/1).
E. Lymph node, level 8, biopsy:
One negative lymph node (0/1).
F. Lymph node, level 7, biopsy:
Lymphoid tissue and fibrous connective tissue; no definite
lymph node identified; no malignancy identified.
