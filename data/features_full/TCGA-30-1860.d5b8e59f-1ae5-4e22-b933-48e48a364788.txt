SPECIMEN LABELED "IMPLANT SMALL BOWEL MESENTERY":
POORLY DIFFERENTIATED CARCINOMA.

(EBA-304850

SPECIMEN LABELED "OMENTUM":
POORLY DIFFERENTIATED CARCINOMA, consistent with Adenocarcinoma, with

extensive necrosis. See note.
Lymphovascular invasion is present.

Immunohistochemistry performed at - demonstrates the following staining

profile in tumor cells:
Positive — Cytokeratin '7 (stroni), _

Negative — Cytokeratin 20,

NOTE: The tumor is characterized by sheets of poorly differentiated cells
with rare glands. No papillary architecture or psammous calcifications
are present. The histologic appearances and immunohistologic
characteristics would be consistent with a breast or a mullerian»related

primary.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: w
The specimen is received fresh, in 4 parts, each abeled with the patient's
name and unit number.

Part, labeled “implant small bowel mesentery", consists of a 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm
firm, tan tissue fragment.

Micro 2 — l frag,-

Part 2, "omentum", consists of a 23.5 x 12.9 x 3.5 cm sheet of omental fat.
Approximately 40% of the specimen is diffusely replaced by firm, white tumor.
The remainder consists predominantly of yellow/tan adipose tissue and is
studded by multiple firm, white tumor nodules measuring up to 1.4 x 1 x 1 cm.

Micro 3—5 — omentum, 3 frags, -

Part 3, “nodules from small bowel", consists of two soft tan tissue fragments
(1.0 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm) which are submitted for frozen section as

Micro 6 — FSA remnant, 2 frags, -

Part 4, "nodules from small bowel”, consists of seven soft tan, irregular,

nodular portions of tissue which measure from 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm to 0.7 x 0.6 x
' 0.5 cm. Two sections are placed in the cytogenetic media for potential flow
cytometry, one section is placed in EM fixative for possible electron microsopy
and one section is fixed in 35. The remainder is fixed in formalin.
