CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm ovary = 183.0

GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. ”Omentum {AF1)", received fresh for frozen section. Received is an

aggregate of omentum measuring 16 x 10 x 3 cm. The largest piece measures 12.5
x 6 x 3 cm. All pieces are grossly involved by tumor, with minimal residual
normal adipose tiseue. A representative section is frozen as AFl, and the
frozen section remnant is submitted in block A1. Additional representative
sections are submitted in blocks A2-A3.

B. “Right tube and right ovary", received fresh and placed in formalin.
Received is a 24.2 gram, 5 x 3.7 x 1.7 cm ovary with attached fimbriated tube.
The ovary measures 3.9 x 3.7 x 1.7 cm, and the attached tube is 4 cm long,
with a diameter of 0.8 cm. The external surface of the ovary is notable for
multiple small tan, papillary growths (inked blue). Sectioning reveals a
white nodule measuring 1.7 cm in greatest dimension within the ovary. The
attached fallopian tube is remarkable for a 0.6 cm paratubal cyst.
Representative sections are submitted in blocks Bl-BS, with tube in block BS.

C. "Left tube and left ovary”, received fresh and placed in formalin. Received
is a 26.8 gram, 4.9 x 4.5 x 1.6 cm specimen consisting of ovary and adjacent
adherent fimbriated tube (0.7 cm in diameter). The surface of the ovary
contains multiple tan, papillary structures. Also noted is a 1.9 cm serous—
filled cyst. The involved surface of the ovary is inked blue. Sectioning
reveals solid and cystic areas within the ovary. The solid area measures 2.8
cm in maximum dimension, and appears to merge with the cystic area. The cyst
is grossly filled with tan, papillary excrescences. Only a short length of
tube is visible, but it is grossly unremarkable. Representative sections of
ovary are in blocks C1—C4, and sections of the serous—filled cyst and tube are

submitted in block CS.

D. "Transverse colon", received fresh and placed in formalin. Received is a
6.5 cm segment of large bowel {8 cm circumference) with attached pericolio
fat. The attached fat is grossly involved by tumor, and appears very fibrotic
and hemorrhagic. The involved fat measures 10.5 x 6.8 x 2 cm. Some residual
yellow, lobulated adipose tissue is still present. The serosa contains a 0.3
cm firm, white, pedunculated nodule. Diffuse serosal studding is not noted.
The bowel mucosa is edematous but otherwise grossly unremarkable, with a
normal folding pattern.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Dl— bowel with involved pericolic fat.
D2— representative section of tumor.
DB- serosal nodule.

04— representative section of bowel.

FIGO GRADE: 2 OF 3.
TUMOR SIZE: APPROXIMATELY 2.8 CM.

SURFACE INVOLVEMENT: PRESENT.
FALLOPIAN TUBE: POSITIVE FOR PAPILLARY SEROUS ADENOCARCINOMA.

D. "TRANSVERSE COLON" (PARTIAL COLECTOMY):
