Metastatic carcinoma in 6 of 9 lymph nodes
(see parts 1, 2, 3 and 4)

DIRECT EXTENSION OF TUMOR:
None

EXTENT OF INVASION

PRIMARY TUMOR:

pTl: Tumor which is <3 cm, confined to lung, no more proximal than
the lobar bronchus

REGIONAL LYMPH NODES:
pN2: Metastasis in ipsilateral mediastinal or
subcarinal lymph nodes

DISTANT METASTASIS:
pr: Cannot be assessed

MARGINS:

VENOUS/ARTERIAL (LARGE VESSEL) INVASION:

LYMPHATIC (SMALL VESSEL) INVASION:

Present

3) STATION 6 (EXCISION): METASTATIC CARCINOMA INVOLVING ONE LYN?H
NOSE.

4) STATION 5 (EXCISION): ONE (1} LYMPH NODE AND ASSOCliTEL

FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

NOTE: lmmunostains show that the neoplastic cells are positive tor
963, negative for TTF—l and Napsin—A. Mucicarmine stain is negative.
Elastin stain shows that the pleura is not involved by the
neoplastic cells. Movat stain is reviewed. The carcinoma shows
marked tumor necrosis. The neoplastic cells are also present in
multiple lymphatic channels away from the main 1.5 mass.
