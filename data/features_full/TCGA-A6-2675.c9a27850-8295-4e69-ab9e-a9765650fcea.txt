SPECIMEN
Sigmoid colon

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Sigmoid cancer

GROSS DESCRIPTION

Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin labeled
”sigmoid colon” is a 17 cm. long portion of colon which
is opened on both ends. The serosa is pinkwtan smooth glistening
and
the specimen is predominantly covered with abundant yellow lobular
fat and pink—tan smooth glistening serosa. The specimen is opened
to
show pink—tan smooth glistening mucosa with an average
circumference
of 4 cm. The specimen shows a 3.2 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm. tumor which shows
ulcerated center and raised borders. The cut surface of this shows
gross invasion into the muscularis propria and comes within 7.5 cm.
of the radial margin; however, there is an umbilication near the
serosa and the fat meet. This is inked and the tumor comes within
0.7 cm. of this area. No other discrete gross lesions are
identified. Lymph nodes are grossly identified in the fat.
Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — representative luminal margins; 2 -
representative section of tumor to fat and serosa; 3~5 — additional
representative sections of tumor to fat; 6 H representative radial
margins; 7 - 4 possible lymph nodes; 8 H 6 possible lymph nodes; 9

6 possible lymph nodes; 10 — 3 possible lymph nodes. ss—io -

the junction of the muscularis propria and serosa (pT3).
Proximal margin: Negative.

Distal margin: Negative.

Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative.

Vascular invasion: Negative.

Regional lymph nodes {pN}: Eleven mesenteric lymph nodes are
negative for metastatic carcinoma (pNO).

DIAGNOSIS

Colon, sigmoid, segmental resection:
Invasive moderately differentiated colOnic adenocarcinoma
extending through the muscularis propria to the junction of the

muscularis propria and serosa.

Proximal, distal and radial margins of resection are free of
tumor.
Eleven mesenteric lymph nodes negative for metastatic carcinoma
(0/11).
