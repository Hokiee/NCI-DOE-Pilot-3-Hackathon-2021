PROCEDURE:

the distal esophagus. Clinical Diagnosis: Cancer, primary esophagus.
Operative Procedure: THE.

VERIFIED BY:

1. "Esophagus." A 13 x 5 cm specimen consisting of 6 cm of distal esophagus
and 6.5 cm of the proximal stomach. 2 to 2.5 cm caudal to the GE junction,
there is an irregular tongue of pink, velvety mucosa, with 1 x 1 cm and 2.5 x
1.5 cm somewhat excavated areas, suspicious for ulceration. Along the border
of pink-tan, velvety mucosa and gray-tan, normal-appearing esophageal mucosa
are multiple grey-tan papillationa. The esophageal wall is up to 0.9 cm thick
at the GE junction. The proximal gastric rugae are markedly thickened. There
is a 1.2 cm mucosa! pinch-out defect, 1.5 cm distal to the proximal resection
edge. There is a 1.5 cm circunferential infiltrating neoplasm arising just
above the GE juiction, which appears to extend into the nuscularis propria.
1A. Distal gastric resection margin.

13v1E. Sequential segments of the specimen from cephalad to caudad, proximal
end inked green.

iF-il-l. Deeper tumor extension.

1! 8. 1J. Representative sections of the tutor.

1K. Punched-out lesion in the proximal area.

1L. & 1". Multiple lymph nodes identified in the periesophageal fat.

2. "Cervical margin." A 2 x 2 cm fragment of tubular esophagus, stapled at
one and, with pink-grey, unremarkable mucosa. Bisected. Entirely submitted
with 2A being the margin.

PROCEDURE: VERIFIED BY:

1-2. Esophagus, transhiatal esophagectomy: Adenocarcinoma arising at the
eaophagogastric junction without associated Barrett's mucosa. Neoplasm extends
through the muscularis propria to within 0.1 cm of the inked periesophageal
soft tissue surgical margin. Cervical esophageal surgical resection margin
negative. Adenocarcinoma extends to within 0.1 cm of distal gastric resection
margin. Angiolymphatic invasion identified. Metastatic adenocarcinoma
involving one of four periesophageal lymph nodes. Please see template for
details.
