Clinical History
-year—old woman experiences memory problems and confusion .. On imaging,

there is a

right frontal complex heterogeneous mass with zones of necrosis and cyst formation, with hemorrhagic
nodular

enhancing areas. The lesion involves the corpus callosum and extends into the left parietal and temporal
lobes

across the corpus callosum.

Operative Diagnoses

Right frontal brain tumor

Operation I Specimen

A: Brain, right frontal tumor, biopsy

Pathologic Diagnosis

Brain, right frontal, excisional biopsy: Anaplastic oligodendroglioma (WHO 3).
1p, 19g LOH (codeletion): Positive.

MGMT: Positive.

MlB-1 proliferation index: 18%.

See Microscopy Description and Comment.

Comment

The sections contain portions of a rather cellular glial neoplastic proliferation that has an oligodendroglial
phenotype.

The neoplastic cells are rather uniformly round, with a borderline mitotic rate of 3% lten high power fields,
and an

elevated MlB-1 proliferation index of 18% in the more active areas. The tumor has focal microvascular
proliferation,

but is devoid of tumor necrosis. There are also zones of sparse cellularity with microcalciﬁcations.

The neoplasm is a cellular oligodendroglioma with lp, 19q LOH codeletion, positive lDH1, a modest
mitotic rate,

positive MGMT, and a high proliferation index. The biopsy is somewhat small, contains tumor at the low
end of

anaplastic transformation, and is probably not representative of the anaplastic regions depicted on the
imaging
studies
The morphological features in this sample may be correlated with clinical, imaging, and operative ﬁndings
for their
interpretation and patient‘s follow up.

MGMT Promoter Methylation

Date Ordered: Date Reported:

Interpretation

POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected.

Results-Comments

Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor parafﬁn block (A1).

H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit

from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulﬁte
treatment of

DNA followed by real-time PCR ampliﬁcation , of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The

analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors

such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the

detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic
test. This test

was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the

as required

by CLlA ‘88 regulations. it has not been cleared or approved for speciﬁc uses by the US. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are

provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in the context of established
procedures

and/or diagnostic criteria.

Loss of Heterozygosity 1p, 19q Assay (LOH)

Date Ordered: Date Reported:

Interpretation

POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1p and chromosome arm 19q is detected.
Informative loci are: D1SS48. 0131592. D1S552. D198412

Results-Comments

Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor parafﬁn block (A1). DNA extracted from
a

corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal reference control. 0198219, PLA2G4C, D198606
and

D1981182 loci are not informative. Histologic correlation is necessary.

H and E slide was examined and no mlcrodissection was needed.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)l Tumor DNA
pairs using 3

markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1p are D18548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468,
D181612, and

D18496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D198219, D1QS412, and PLA2G4C (with
D198606 and

01981182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA264C which is a
minisatellite (26

nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and
ease of

interpretation. The backup markers are used if the ﬁrst line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformatlve or

otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical ﬁnding in oligodendrogliomas with 1p and 19q deletion.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand-alone diagnostic
test. This test
was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLlA ’ 88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the US. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are
provided for informational purposes only. and should be interpreted only in the context of established
procedures
and/or diagnostic criteria.
TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in the sample may preclude the
detection of
allelic Ioss.

Microscopic Description

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The neoplastic cells are IDH1 positive. There is focal microvascular
cellular

proliferation demonstrable with the CD34. There is only sparse perivascular microglia made evident with
the CD163.

With the MIB-1 there is a proliferation index of 18% in frequent more active areas.
