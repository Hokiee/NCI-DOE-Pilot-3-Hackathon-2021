* Final Report *

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
A-D: See final microscopic—diagnoses.

E: Sections of the urinary bladder show invasive, moderately to poorly
differentiated papillary urothelial carcinoma, characterized by single strands and
small nests of enlarged malignant cells with correspondingly enlarged nucleoli and
scanty cytoplasm. The tumor extends through the full thickness of the bladder wall
and involves seminal vesicles, vasa deferentia, and rectum. The tumor cells
involve serosa, muscularis propria, and is attached to the underlying surface of
the rectal mucosa. The distal resection margin of the rectum is involved by tumor.
The proximal resection margin is free of tumor. There is extensive perineural and
lymphovascular space invasion. Bilateral ureteral mucosa show mild to severe
atypia. Representative sections of prostate are unremarkable.

F-Q: See final microscopic-diagnoses.

GROSSEXAMWANON:

A: The specimen is received fresh from the 0.R. and labelled "Retroperitoneum"
(Periaortic). It consists of a piece of tan~yellow soft tissue measuring 0.3 x 0.8
x 0.4 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in cassette AFS.

B: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labelled "Right perirenal
FS“. It consists of a piece of tan soft tissue measuring 5 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm. Half
of the specimen is submitted for frozen section and the remaining tissue is
submitted for permanent section.

C: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labelled “Rt ureter". It
consists of ureter measuring 0.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter and

surrounding soft tissue measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is submitted
for frozen section in cassette CFS

D: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labelled "Lt ureter". It
consists of ureter measuring 0.4 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter and
surrounding soft tissue measuring 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is entirely
submitted for frozen section in cassette DFS.

E: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labelled "Bladder, prostate &
rectum". It consists of prostate, urinary bladder, bilateral ureters. rectum and
peritoneum. Overall, the specimen measures 13 x 18 x 5 cm. The peritoneum
measures 15 x 5 x 0.1 cm. The bladder measures a x 5 x 2 cm. The rectum measures
20 cm in length and 7 to 10 cm in circumference. The prostate measures 6 x 5 x 5
cm. The prostate is opened anteriorly through the prostatic urethra and then the
urinary bladder is opened anteriorly. There are multiple polypoid tumors in the
urinary bladder mucosa measuring from 0.5 cm to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. A
polypoid tumor is adjacent to the left ureterovesical junction. The right
ureterovesical junction is 1.5 cm from the closest polypoid tumor. The left ureter
measures 5 cm in length and 0.6 cm in circumference. The right ureter measures 5
cm in length and 0.6 cm in circumference. There is a constricted area in the right
ureter, which measures 0.3 cm in circumference and is approximately 1 cm from the
right ureterovesical junction. This constriction is due to the deeply infiltrating
tumor in the urinary wall around the ureter. The tumor also involves bilateral
seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia. The tumor is close to but does not involve
the colonic mucosa. The right resection margins appears grossly involved by tumor.
The prostate is cross sectioned perpendicular to the prostatic urethra and is
unremarkable. The proximal and distal resection margins of the rectum are both

grossly free of tumor. The peritoneum is unremarkable. Representative sections
are submitted in a total of 15 cassettes.

F: The specimen is received in formalin and labelled "Right common iliac LN“. It
