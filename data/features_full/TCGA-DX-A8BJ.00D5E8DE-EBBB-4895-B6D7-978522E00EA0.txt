2: Chest wall mass with ribs 1. 2. 3, 4, right 5 $5

3: additional mass from right chest wall 21/}

4: Portion of right ﬁt]: rib posterior rib @b/I/Z 3

5: Portion of right 3rd rib posterior rib

6: Portion of right 2nd rib posterior rib

7: Portion of right posterior rib 2 and 3

DIAGNOSIS:
1. Tissue above 1st right rib posteriorly, excision:
-High grade malignant fibrous histiocytoma, involving skeletal muscle.

2. Chest wall mass with ribs 1.2.3.4, right, en-bloc excision:

—High grade malignant fibrous histiocytome.

-'1'umor size: 8.8 x 7 x 4 cm.

—Tbe tumor involves skeletal muscle, fibroadipose tissue, and erodes
superficially into the bone (superior segment of rib).

—'rhe tumor shows a highly intiltrative growth pattern.

—'1‘he tumor is predominantly viable, with only focal necrosis.

-Surgica1 margins are free of tumor

3. Additional mass from right chest well, excision:

—High grade malignant fibrous histiocytona, present as multiple tissue
fragments.

—'rhe tumor involves skeletal muscle and fibroadipose tissue.
-'l'he tumor shows focal reactive ossification.

4. Bone, portion of! right 4th rib posterior rib, excision:
-Fragment o! benign bony tissue and skeletal muscle.

5. Bone, portion of right 3rd rib posterior rib, excision:
—Frag-ment o! benign bony tissue and skeletal muscle.

6. Bone, portion of right 2nd rib posterior rib, excision:
-Fragment of benign bony tissue and skeletal muscle.

-** Report Electronically Signed Out '**

Gross Description:

l).The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled
'tissue above first right rib posteriorly' and consists of an irregular soft
tissue fragment measuring 3 x 2.4 x 0.8 cm. Sectioning reveals an
ill—defined, 1.2 on ten, white mass. A representative section of mass is
submitted for frozen section. The remaining tissue is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
ssc — frozen section control
RT - remaining tissue

2. The specimen is received fresh labeled, l'Chest well mass with ribs
1.2.3.4, right', and consists of one portion of chest wall with three
segments of ribs measuring 14.5x9x5.5 cm. The three segments of ribs measure
8.0, 11.5 and 13.5 cm length from superior to inferior, respectively. The
superficial surface is inked blue and the deep surface is inked black. The
specimen is serially sectioned. The cut surface reveals one tan white firm
mass measuring 8.8x7x4 cm, involving superficial soft tissue and skeletal
muscle. The tumor is adjacent to the three segments of ribs but no gross
invasion into the bony tissue identified. Surgical margins are grossly free
of tumor. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted. T95 is
taken.

Summary of sections:

Bl- two ends of rib 1, 8 cm

E2 - two ends of rib 2. 11.5 on
B3 - two ends of rib 3, 13.5 cm
T31 - tumor and rib l, 8 cm

TH2— tumor and rib 2, 11.5 cm
T33 - tumor and rib 3, 13.5 cm
SM - superficial margin and tumor
Du - deep margin and tumor

Rs - tumor, representative
