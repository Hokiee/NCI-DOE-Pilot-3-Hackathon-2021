Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and 'WLE right breast needle loc" is an oriented (short/1 clip-
superior, long/2 clips-lateral, air knot-anterior) needle localized lumpectomy with radiograph. lnk code: Anterior—
yellow, posterior-black, medial-green, lateral-red, superior—blue, inferior-orange. The specimen is serially sectioned
from lateral to medial into 8 slices revealing a 2.4 x 1.9 x 1.6 cm ﬁrm tan stellate mass that is closest to the superior
margin at 0.2 cm. Tissue is procured. Representatively submitted:

8. ADDITIONAL MARGIN RIGHT BREAST

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "additional margin right breas " is in a oriented (short-
superior, long-lateral) 11 g, 0.2 x 3.4 x 1.1 cm ﬁbrofatty tissue. Margins are inked black. Serial sectioning reveals no
discrete lesions. Inked margin submitted entirely in cassettes B1-B7.

NOTE: specimen was received with only 1 suture
C. WLE LEFT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION

DIAGNOSIS:
A. BREAST, RIGHT, WIDE LOCAL EXCISION:
- INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 2, MEASURING 2.4-CM
- INTERMEDIATE NUCLEAR GRADE, DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, SOLID AND CRIBRIFORM TYPES WITH
CENTRAL NECROSIS AND MICROCALCIFICATIONS
- INVASIVE TUMOR PRESENT WITHIN 1-MM FROM SUPERIOR/MEDIAL SURGICAL RESECTION MARGIN
- LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU
- BIOPSY SITE CHANGES WITH FIBROSIS
- SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT AND SEE NOTE.

B. BREAST, RIGHT. ADDITIONAL SUPERIOR MARGIN, EXCISION:
- INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA INVOLVES NEW INKED SURGICAL RESECTION MARGIN, SEE NOTE.

C. BREAST, LEFT, WIDE LOCAL EXCISION:

— INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 2, MEASURING 1.8-CM
- SURGICAL RESECTION MARGIN NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR

- LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU

— BIOPSY SITE CHANGES WITH FIBROSIS

- SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT.

NOTE: Part B. was designated as superior by Dr. Therefore, invasive tumor is present at superior (part B) and within
1-mm from medial (part A) surgical resection margin.

E-cadherin is negative in LCIS component.
