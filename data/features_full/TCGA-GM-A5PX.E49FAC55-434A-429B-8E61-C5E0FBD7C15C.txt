cerium
1) lmmunohistochemical stains for biologic markers are pending.

2) In specimen B. the frozen sections are reviewed but the tumor cells are not evident. In H&E stained permanent sections, the
largest group of tumor cells can be identiﬁed but the tumor cells are bland and well differentiated. The tumor cells are best seen
on immunostained slides and are present In four areas in the lymph node sections. The majority of the tumor cells are clustered
within a 0.75 x 0.1 mm area. In addition, isolated tumor cells. singly or in pair. are present in three other regions of the lymph node
sections.

3) In specimen C, tumor cells are not evident in the frozen and permanent H&E sections.

GROSSEDESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT BREAST, SHORT SUPERIOR, LONG LATERAL - A 16.0 x 15.0 x 7.0 cm skin sparing total mastectomy specimen that
is oriented by the surgeon with a short stitch designating superior and a long stitch designating lateral. The specimen is partly
surfaced by a 4.5 x 3.5 cm ovoid portion of pale tan wrinkled skin. Located on the surface of the skin is an averted nipple
surrounded by a rim of areola that measure 1.2 and 3.5 cm in diameter, respectively. The specimen is serially sectioned from
medial to lateral into eleven slices. The nipple is located in slice #5. In slices #2 through #10 there is a 12.0 x 12.0 x 2.7 cm breast
implant and cavity lined by a pink-white smooth. glistening, ﬁbrous capsular tissue. The specimen contains an intact
brand breast implant ﬁlled with a translucent viscous material. Identifying information is as follows: ,

a . The breast implant measures 12.0 x 12.0 x 2.7 cm and is for gross only. Radiographs are taken of the specimen and display

tthe 6 o'clock position, within slices #5 and #6, a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm ﬁrm, gray-white mass that grossly comes to within 0.6 cm

from the anterior inferior margin, 3.5 cm from the deep margin, 3.5 cm from the nipple and abuts the implant capsule. There is a
metal biopsy clip located in this mass in slice #5. At the 2 o'clock position, in slices #8 through #10, there is a 3.5 x 3.0 x 1.3 cm
ﬁrm gray-white mass that grossly comes to within 3.0 cm from the deep margin, 1.0 cm from the anterior superior margin. 2.5 cm
from the anterior inferior margin, and abuts the implant capsule. There is a metal biopsy clip located in slice #9 in this mass.

Remaining cut surfaces are 60% yellow glistening adipose tissue and 40% gray-white ﬁbrous tissue. Some tissue has been glveng
to tumor bank for research purposes.

INK CODE: Blue - superior; orange - inferior; black - deep.

This report is issued to give lmmunohistochemistry results. Immunohistochemical staining is performed in our lab on a
representative parafﬁn-embedded section of INVASIVE LOBULAR CARCINOMA, left breast, block A4, 6 o'clock.

Due to the above HER2 immunohistochemical staining result, gene copy level (HER2: CEP17 signal ratio) will be evaluated by
FISH and a separate report will be issued.

Boomers
Breast specimens used for determining prognostic / predictive markers are ﬁxed in formalin for 6-48 hours.
For ER & PR: Positive 10 - 100%
Low Positive 1-9%
For Ki-67 Low Positive <17%
Moderate Positive 17-35%
High Positive >35%

For Her 2: Positive cases are those with uniform, intense and complete membrane staining in greater than 30% of invasive tumor cells (Score 3+). Negative cases
are deﬁned as those with no staining (Score 0) or weak, incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of cells (Score 1+). Equlvocal or indeterminate cases are
those with strong staining in less than or equal to 30% of cells, or complete membrane staining that is either non-unifon'n or weak in intensity, but with obvious

I circumferential distribution in at least 10% of tumor cells (Score +2).
