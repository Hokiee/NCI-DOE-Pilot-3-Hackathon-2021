CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE — OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right nodule.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The Specimen is received in six parts, each labeled with the
patient’s name.

1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'lung, right upper lobe wedge
resection, r/O carcinoma, 11:09 '. It consists of a pre cut wedge
biopsy of the lung measuring 6.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm. The stapled line
measures 7 cm, shaved and the parenchyma inked blue. A t the pre
cut area there is a sub pleural light tan nodule with ill-deﬁned
borders, measuring 1.3 x 1.2 x 1 cm. The mass is located 0.5 cm
from the stapled line margin. Frozen section performed 0 the nodule
and resubmitted for permanent section. The remainder of the
parenchyma is pink-red and grossly unremarkable. Representative
sections of the specimen and entire nodule are submitted.

2. Part two is received in saline, labeled ' station 11 lymph node
right'. It consists of multiple soft red-black lymph nodes
measuring 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm in aggregate. Entirely submitted in
one cassette. '

3. Part three is received in saline, labeled 'completion right upper
lobe lobectomy '. It consists of a right lobe of the lung measuring
15 x 11 x 3 cm. The bronchial margin measures 1.5 cm and the
vascular margin measures 1 cm at the hilum. The pleura is
grey-pink, glistening and mottled moderately with ﬁne black
streaks. There are two stapled line at the mediastinal surface
measuring 12 cm and 8 cm in length. Also noted a third stapled line
at the costal surface measures 8 cm in length. The staples shaved
and the parenchyma inked black. Cut surface of the lung is dark red
crepitant and blotchy. No nodule grossly identiﬁed.

Representative sections are submitted.

4. Part four is received in saline, labeled ’station 4 lymph node
right '. It consists of multiple soﬁ red-black lymph nodes
measuring 1 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. Entirely submitted in one
cassette.

5. Part ﬁve is received in saline, labeled ‘station 2 lymph node
right '. It consists of one soft red-black lymph node measuring 1 x
1 x 0.5 cm. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

6. Part six is received in saline, labeled 'right lower lobe wedge
resection '. It consists of a wedge biopsy of the lung measuring 8

x 3 x 1 cm. The stapled line measures 8.5 cm, shaved and the
parenchyma around it inked black. The pleura is pink-tan,
glistening and reveals a pre cut area. At the pre cut area there is

a light tan well circumscribed ﬁrm nodule measuring 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.5
cm located 1.2 cm from the stapled line margin. The remainder of
the parenchyma is pink—red and crepitant. No other nodule grossly
identiﬁed. Entire nodule and representative section of the

Specimen submitted.
