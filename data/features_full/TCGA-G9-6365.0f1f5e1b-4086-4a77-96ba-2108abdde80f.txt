GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. POSTERlOR BLADDER NECK

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "posterior bladder neck“ is a
fragment of unoriented tan ﬁrm tissue measuring 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.3 cm. Entirely submitted, At.

B. RiGHT PELVEC LYMPH NODES

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "right pelvic lymph nodes"
are multiple fragments of adipose tissue measuring 5.5 x 2,2 x 1 cm in aggregate. Two possible iymph
nodes are identiﬁed measuring 1.6 x 1.4 x 0.2 cm and 3.5 x 2 x 0.9 cm. Cassettes are submitted as
follows:

B1: One lymph node

82-84: One sectioned lymph node

B5: Additional possible lymph nodes

0. LEFT PELVlC LYlleH NODES

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "left pelvic lymph nodes"
are multiple fragments of adipose tissue measuring 6.4 x 5.5 x 1.5 cm in aggregate. Multiple possible
lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging from 0.5 X 0.5 x 0.2 up to 5 x 1.4 x 0.8 cm. Cassettes are submitted
as follows:

01: Two possible lymph nodes

02: One possible lymph node

03: One possible lymph node

C4—C5: One sectioned lymph node

D. PROSTATE

Received fresh labeled with the patient’s identiﬁcation and designated “prostate" is a resected prostate
gland Weighing 91 g and measuring 7.5-cm from right to left, 5-cm from anterior to posterior, and 4.5-cm
from apex to base. The capsule has a shaggy rough appearance. lnk code: Apex-red, anterior-orange,
posterior-black. base-blue, right-green, teit - yellow. The apex and base are removed from the
specimen to yield a new weight of 52 g. The specimen is serialiy sectioned from apex to base revealing
ﬁrm tan bulging nodular parenchyma. The right and left remnants of seminal vesicle, 2 x 1.8 x 0.2 cm
and 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm, respectively, are bisected to show beige tan cystic tissue. The right and left vas
deterens, 3 x 0.3 cm and 3.2 x 0.5 cm, respectively. are sectioned to show ﬁrm tan tube structure. A
portion of the specimen is submitted which procurement, the remainder is entirely submitted:

D'l—DS: Right apex

D4-D6: Left Apex

D7: Level i right anterior

[38: Level 1 right posterior

D9: Level 1 left anterior

D10: Level 1 left posterior

D11-D13: Level 2 capsule, right side

014—2316: Level 2 capsule, left side

D17—D18: Right laterai base

019-024: Right base

025: Right base with proximal urethral margin

D26-DZ7: Left base with proximal urethrai margin

DES-D32: Left base, with left seminal vesicle remnant

D33~D34: Left lateral base

D35: Right seminal vesicle. right vas. representative sections

D36: Representative sections left vas

 

DIAGNOSIS:
A. POSTERIOR BLADDER NECK, EXCISEON:
- NEGATiVE FOR TUMOR

B. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES. EXCISION:
- EIGHT (8) LYMPH NODES, NEGATlVE FOR TUMOR

C. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES, EXCISiON:
- FIVE (5) LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR

D. PROSTATE, SEMiNAL VESICLES. AND VASA DEFERENTIA (RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY):
— PROSTATIC ADENOCARCENOMA, GLEASON SCORE 3 + 4 = 7 ENVOLVING
RIGHT AND LEFT LOBES OF PROSTATE (APPROXiMATELY 20% OF
PROSTATE TISSUE)

— TUMOR iNVOLVES MUSCULAR WALL OF LEFT SEMINAL VESICLE

- TUMOR INVOLVES INKED LEFT BASE WITH PROXIMAL URETHRAL
MARGEN (MULTIFOCAL)

- LINEAR DISTANCE OF POSiTlVE MARGIN: 1.1-MM (‘I 080 MICROMETER).
<‘l-MM (422.81 MICROMETER} AND <t—MM (8? MICROMETER)

— PERINEURAL INVASION EDENTIFIED

— NO DEFINiTIVE ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IDENTIFIED

— RIGHT SEMINAL VESICLE, RIGHT AND LEFT VAS DEFERENS, NEGATIVE
FOR TUMOR

- SEE NOTE

NOTE: THE DIAGNOSIS OF PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA iNVOLViNG

SEMINAL VESICLE IS SUPPORTED BY THE FAILURE OF EMMUNOPEROXIDASE STAINENG FOR
HiGI-i MOLECULAR WEIGHT CYTOKERATIN AND PS3 TO DEMONSTRATE BASAL CELLS N THE
ATYPICAL GLANDS. ALSO FAVORING THE DIAGNOSIS OF PROSTATIC CANCER IS THAT
STAINS FOR PSA AND PSAP (MARKERS PREFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED IN PROSTATE
CANCER) ARE POSiTIVE (TISSUE BLOCK D28). P5048 IMMUNOPEROXIDASE STAIN iS

NONCONTRIBUTORY.

NOTE: THE DiAGNOSIS OF PROSTATEC ADENOCARCiNOMA INVOLVENG

LEFT BASE WITH PROXEMAL URETHRAL MARGIN ES SUPPORTED BY THE FAILURE OF
IMMUNOPEROXIDASE STAINING FOR HIGH MOLECULAR WEEGHT CYTOKERATEN AND P63 TO
DEMONSTRATE BASAL CELLS IN THE ATYPICAL GLANDS AT THE iNKED SURFACE (TISSUE
BLOCK D28}. P5048 EMMUNOPEROXIDASE STAIN IS NONCONTRIBUTORY.
