COIIECII'OII De ie: -

 

PART 3: PROSTATE AND BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES, RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY -

FS’FQWW 99 E?

PROSTATE ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 3 + 3 = 6 WITH TERTIARY GLEASON PATTERN 4.
THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT LOBES AND HAS A GREATEST NODULAR DIAMETER OF
2 CM IN ONE HISTOLOGIC SECTION.

THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THE EXAMINED PROSTATE VOLUME.

THE CARCINOMA SHOWS FOCAL EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IN THE REGION OF POSTERIOR RIGHT MID
(SLIDE 3T). _

BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA.

ALL EXAMINED SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA.
