PART #2: Eﬁz GALLBLADDER AND WHIPPLE ( )

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:

F8: Gallbladéef and Whipple: 2.5 cm adenocarcinoma centered in the
pancrea$, <U.5 mm from uncinate margin, common bile duct margin is
negative. Proximal duodenal margin is negative. Incidentally

identiﬁied two lymph nodes-with metaStasis (2/2).

The specimen is raceived freah for frozen section, labeled with the
patienh‘a name, . and designateé ’ gallbladder and
Whigple.' The aurgaon has or;ented.the specimen such that a stitch i3
on the uncinane process. The specimgn consists at a grossly
recognizable pancreas head and attached duodenum. The pancreas
measures 5.0 x &.0 x 2.0 cm and the duodenum measures L6.0 cm in
length by 3.0 cm in average diameter. The pancreatic neck margin i3
Ldéﬂtifiﬂd and shaved for permanent section. The common bile duct is
dilaged with an approximata diametex oi 1.0 cm. In addition, a atenn
has bean placed in the cammwn bile duct. ‘he common bile duct margin
is also shaved for frozen section. The uncinate margin is an: and
aubmittad fer ﬁrozen aection. The pancxaas 13 than serially
aactioned to reveal a small partion oﬁ groasly unremarkable
yellow~tan lcbulatad parenchyma, however the majority of the
submitted pancreas is encompassed by a firm, White, illudefineﬂ tumor
which measures 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. A represanCative
secticn oﬁ this tumor is also submitted far frozen sactian. The
proximal and distal duodenal margina are shaved and the duodenum is
opened to raveal can mucosa with normal ﬁelds. A Email area 0E
gubmucoaal hemorrhage is noted in the duodanum which measures less
than 0.5 cm in graataat dimansion. Aside tram this hemorrhage, n0
othar lesions, maesea or other abnorma1icies are noted in the
duodenal mucuaa‘ The commcn bila duct is opened no the ampulla of

abnormalities after the stent is removed. Separately received is a
gallbladder which measure3 9.5 cm in length by 3.8 cm in maximum
diameter. Opening tha gallbladder reveals minimal bile and no atones
ara present. The serosal 3ur£ace of the gallbladder is greenvpink
and shiny with ma external abnarmalities. The gallbladder mucoaa is
brown-red and velvety with no lesiuna or masses moteﬁ, There is an
area pf wall thickening in the distal fundus with a dimension CE 2.2
x 2.0 x 2.0 cm. Otherwise, the gallbladder is grossly unremarkable.
Representative sections of the pancreas, duodenum, common bile duct,
tumor and gallbladder are submitted. In aﬁdinion, the peripancreatic
soﬁt tissue is submitted entirely.
