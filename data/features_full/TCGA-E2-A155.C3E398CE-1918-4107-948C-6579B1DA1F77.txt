GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. LEFT BREAST AND AXILLARY CONTENTS LEVEL 1 AND 2

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "left breast and axillary contents levels one and two
(suture in axillary tail)" is an oriented 1794 g, 31 x 22 x 4.5 cm mastectomy with 27 x 16 skin ellipse and 1.1-cm ﬁat
nipple. Skin has 4 brown macules ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 cm. In code: Anterior/superior-blue, anterior/inferior-
orange, posterior-black. Specimen is serially sectioned into 11 slices from medial to lateral with nipple in slice7

revealing 4 lesions.

#1- is a 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.7 cm ﬁrm tan stellate mass which is located at the 12 o'clock position, 4.2 cm from the deep
margin and 2 cm from the anterior margin (slices 6-7). #2- is a 1.3 x 1.1 x 1 cm ﬁrm tan stellate mass which is

located 0.3 cm medial to lesion
o'clock position (slice 5). #3- is

#1, 5 cm from the deep margin and 1.3 cm from the anterior margin at roughly the 9

a 2.5 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm ﬁrm tan stellate mass located 0.4 cm medial to lesion #2, 4 cm

from the deep margin and 1.5 cm from the anterior margin at roughly the 9 o'clock position (slice 4). #4- is a 1 x 1 x
0.6 cm ﬁrm granular mass located 2.5 cm posterior lesion #3, 1.3 cm from the deep margin and 4.5 cm from the
anterior margin (slice 4). Adjacent to the deep margin, in slice 7. is a 0.9 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm ﬁrm tan lymph node. Within
the axillary tail are multiple lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 to 3.5 cm. The largest lymph node is nodular and a portion
is procured. Representatively submitted.

B. ADDITIONAL LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS

Received fresh labeled with the

patient's identiﬁcation and "additional left axillary contents" is a piece of fatty tissue

measuring 6.3 x 4.7 x 0.6 cm. One lymph node is identiﬁed. Submitted entirely.

B1: 1 lymph node
BZ-B4: remainder of soft tissue

DIAGNOSIS:

A. BREAST, LEFT. MASTECTOMY WITH AXILLARY NODE DISSECTION:
- MULTIPLE FOCI OF INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 3 WITH MICROPAPILLARY FEATURES,

LARGEST FOCUS MEA URIN
- HIGH NUCLEAR GRADE, DU

.5-CM
CTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, SOLID AND CRIBRIFORM TYPES WITH LOBULAR

EXTENSION. CENTRAL NECROSIS AND MICROCALCIFICATIONS
- SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR

- METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE OF TWELVE AXILLARY LYMPH NODES (1/12), MEASURING 3.5-CM
WITH FOCAL EXTRANODAL EXTENSION

- METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE OF TWO INTRAMAMMARY LYMPH NODES (1/2), MEASURING 0.8-CM
WITH FOCAL EXTRANODAL EXTENSION

- SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT AND SEE NOTE.

B. LYMPH NODES, ADDITIONAL LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS, DISSECTION:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1).

NOTE: Four tumor nodules are grossly identiﬁed. Microscopically 3 of them are invasive ductal carcinoma that have
the same morphology and one is DCIS. The tissues in between these nodules show scattered foci of DCIS.
Therefore. these foci may be interconnected through DCIS. Largest conﬂuent invasive tumor measures 2.5-cm.

Two intramammary lymph nodes are identiﬁed, one is positive for metastatic carcinoma.
