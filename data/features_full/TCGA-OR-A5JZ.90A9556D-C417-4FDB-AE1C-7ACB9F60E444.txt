2. ”Left adrenal gland with retroperitoneel fat, two short stitches equals
superior, one long stitch equals lateral, two long stitch equals posterior”.
Received fresh for tissue procurement in a large container is a 585 gram
(untrinned weight}, 17.2 x 12.5 x 5.4 cm mass with attached fat oriented as
above. The mass itself measures 8.5 x 8.5 x 6.2 cm and grossly appears Hell
encapsulated. inked as per standard inking template. Untrimmed weight is 370
grams. Attached to the mass is a 5.5 x 1.0 cm adrenal gland. The cut surfaces
show yellow soft focally hemorrhagic out surfaces. The normal adrenal gland
has an orange cortex and a brown medulla. The mass grossly appears to arise
from the medulla. The attached fat has no gross abnormality.

2A and B. Tuner to adrenal gland to include anterior and medial margins.

2C. Tlmwr to include lateral margin.

2D. Tumor to include superior margin.

22. Tumor with area of hemorrhage. No margins.

2F. Tumor to adjacent adrenal gland.

26. Tumor to capsule.

2H. Additional representative section of tumor. No margin.

21. Tmer to capsule.

EJ. Representative sections of inferior and posterior margins from the
attached fat.

3. ”Left perirenal fat”. Received in a medium container of formalin is a 7.5 x
4.4 x 0.4 cm piece of fibrofatty tissue with homogenous yellow cut surfaces.
No lesions present. Representative sections in one cassette.

1. Liver capsule, biopsy: Negative for neoplasm.

 

2. Left adrenal gland, resection: Lou grade adrenocortical carcinoma (8.5 cm),
confined to the adrenal. Surgical margins negative. See TEMPLATE above and
COMMENT below.

3, Left perirenal fat, excision: Benign fibroadipose tissue.

COMMENT

{his carcinoma appears to be arising from a pre-existing adrenocortical
adenoma, present on the periphery. The tumor cells ShDH patchy positive
staining for synaptophysin, melon-A, and inhibin; rare positive staining for
cytokeratin, and negative staining for chromogranin and 3-130, NIH-1 shows a
proliferative index of approximately 20%. These results support a diagnosis of
low grade adrenocortical carcinoma.
