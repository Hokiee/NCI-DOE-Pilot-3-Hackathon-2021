CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm corpus uteri.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries", received fresh and placed in
formalin is a 109 gram, 9 x 6 x 4.5 cm uterus. The serosa is red—tan with
numerous fibrinous adhesions. The ectocervix is pink—tan, smooth and

glistening. There is a 1.1 cm central 05 leading into a 1.5 cm trabecular
endocervical canal. The 5.0 x 3.2 cm endometrial cavity discloses a posterior
wall 4.5 x 3.0 cm exophytic soft tan tumor and an 4.5 x 1.6 cm exophytic, soft

tan mass on the anterior wall. The tumor in the 1.9 cm thick posterior wall
invades to a depth of 1.0 cm. Two intramural leiomyomata are less than 1.2
cm in greatest dimension. The right adnexa consists of a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm

grossly unremarkable ovary with a 4.3 cm long, 0.4 cm in diameter fimbriated
fallopian tube with a segment mostly consistent with prior tubal ligation. The
left adnexa consists of a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm grossly unremarkable ovary with
an attached 3.5 cm long, 0.4 cm in diameter fimbriated fallopian tube with a
segment missing consistent with prior tubal ligation.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Al—Z anterior cervix

A3— posterior cervix

A3—4 anterior endomyometrium with tumor

A5—6 posterior endomyometrium with tumor (deepest invasion)

A7— anterior lower uterine segment and endocervix with tumor
AB— posterior lower uterine fragment and endocervix with tumor
A9— right adnexa

AlO— left adnexa

B. "Right external iliac nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a
5.5 x 3.2 x 1.0 cm aggregate of yellow—tan fibroadipose tissue which is
bisected for lymph nodes. One lymph node candidate is trisected and entirely
submitted in blocks Bl—2. The remaining tissue is submitted in blocks B3-5.

C. "Right obturator nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 6.5 x
3.5 x 1.8 cm fragment of yellow—tan fibroadipose tissue which is bisected for
lymph nodes. Three lymph node candidates are submitted in block C1. The
remaining tissue is submitted in blocks C2—4.

(‘
D. "Aortic nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 5.5 x 2.0 x 1.0
cm aggregate of yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue which is bisected for lymph
nodes. Three lymph node candidates are submitted in block D1. One lymph node
candidate is bisected and submitted in block D2. The remaining tissue is
submitted in block D3.

E. "Left external iliac nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a
4.5 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm aggregate of yellow—tan fibroadipose tissue which is
bisected for lymph nodes. Three lymph node candidates are submitted in block
E1. Two lymph node candidates are submitted in block E2. The remaining
tissue is submitted in blocks E3-4.

F. "Left obturator nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 6.0 x
2.7 x 2.0 cm aggregate of yellow—tan fibroadipose tissue which is dissected
for lymph nodes. One lymph node candidate is sectioned and entirely submitted
in blocks F1—2. Two lymph node candidates are submitted in block F3. The
remaining tissue is submitted in blocks F4—5.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: HYSTERECTOMY, OOPHORECTOMY & LYMPH NODES

t

PATHOLOGIC STAGE: pTlC pNO pMX

NOTE:

Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is transmitted to
this Institution‘s Cancer Registry as required for accreditation purposes by
the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely upon the current
tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate information on any
specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section, past pathology
information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative findings. Pathology
stage is only a component to be considered in determining the clinical stage,
and should not be confused with nor substituted for it. The exact operative
procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.
