Note;

KRASoodon 12113 mutations are found in approximately 10»30% lung adenocarcinomas and associated with history of
smoking (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21 mutations are present in about 10% of non-Asians and up to 40% in the Asian
population, common in non-smokers and associated with the tumor response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2).
These mutations are mutually exclusive and their presence may have prognostic andlor therapeutic implicatione (3.4).
Clinical studies show high EGFR gone cepy number by FISH analysis (amplification) to be associated with favorable

clinical benefit {clinical response, stable disease, time to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced honwsmall
cell lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Approximately 3% of lung odenocaroinomae within the Asian population have an interstitial deletion and invereion in
chromosome 2p resulting in the EMLd/ALK fusion gene (ALKM which is sensitive to ALK inhibitors (5,6). The prevalence
of this abnormality in the Western population is gstill unknown. Detection of this abnormality is critical for identifying

patients eligible for therapies that target ALK enzymatic: activity. EMLd/ALK rearrangements are mutually exclusive with
KRAS and EGFR mutations.

COMMENT:

Frozen sections performed on Part 5 “bronchial margin” shows that this“). margin is free of carcinoma, although marked
crush change is present. Permanent sections of this bronchial margin do show adonocarcinoma within the adventitial
cuff of the bronchuo. While present in these permanent sections. the margin of resection is interpreted as negative but it
should be noted that carcinoma extendS within 1~2 mm of this final margin.
