Adrenal gland, no tumor present.
(B) RETROPERITONEAL LYMPH NODES:

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT KIDNEY, ADRENAL GLAND, AND RENAL VEIN THROMBUS - A radical nephrectomy specimen (27.0 x 13.0 x 8.0
cm in toto) including kidney (15 x 7 x 6 cm), with the attached ureter (1.1 x 0.5 cm) and the unremarkable adrenal gland (6.0 x
4.5 x 1.0 cm).

A thrombus (2.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm) is present within the renal vein and is focally attached to the vascular wall. An ill-
defined multilobulated tumor (11.0 x 7.5 x 7.0 cm) replaces majority of the inferior half of the kidney, invading into the
perinephric adipose tissue inferiorly and pushes into the renal sinus adipose tissue. The tumor has a heterogeneous
appearance with large areas of hemorrhage and tan-brown solid areas.

A large cyst (3.5 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm) is filled with clear fluid in the mid pole of the kidney, and multiple other small cysts (0.2
cm in greatest dimension) filled with clear fluid are in the remaining upper pole kidney. Multiple areas of cortical hemorrhage
(1.0 cm in greatest dimension) are present diffusely in the remaining upper pole kidney parenchyma. The adrenal gland is far
from the tumor (8.0 cm away).

SECTION CODE: A1, ureter margin en face; A2, vascular margin en face; A3, A4, thrombus inside the renal vein, with
the vascular wall; A5-A9, tumor; A10-A13, tumor with adjacent inferior perinephric adipose tissue; A14-A17, tumor with sinus
adipose tissue invasion; A17-A19, tumor with pelvis; A20, A21, the larger cyst wall in the mid pole; A22, smaller cyst in upper
iole; A23, A24, hemorrhagic areas in the cortex of upper pole; A25, unremarkable parenchyma; A26, adrenal gland.

TROPERITONEAL LYMPH NODES - Fragments of adipose tissue including three lymph nodes (3.0 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm in
aggregate). The lymph nodes measure from 1.5 to 1.8 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as
follows: B1, B2, one lymph node serially sectioned; B3, one lymph node; B4, B5, one lymph node serially sectioned.
