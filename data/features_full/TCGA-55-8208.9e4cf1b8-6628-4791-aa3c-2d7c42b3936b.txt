Gross Description
"FSA." 1c, 1p, all. Submitted "FSA," control tissue.

"N FSA.â€œ The specimen consists of a 1.7 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm tan-gray soft fragment. "A," 2p, all.

"B, Right upper lobe lung." The specimen consists of a 114 gram, 15.5 x 12.5 x 4 cm upper lobe of the right lung. The pleural
surface is pink-tan with no adhesions. On the medial aspect is a sutured area measuring 2.5 cm long. Adjacent to this is a
palpable mass. The pleura at this area is puckered and there is a smooth gray-white area. The pleura is inked black. On
sectioning, the underlying mass has a yellow to dark gray focally friable cut surface and measures 3 x 2.5 x 3 cm. The tumor
comes to within 1.5 cm of the bronchial margin. The tumor abuts the overlying pleural surface. The remaining specimen is
serially sectioned and the cut surface is tan-pink and atelectatic. At the apex there is an area of emphysematous change. No
additional masses are noted. Two parabronchial lymph nodes are identified with the largest measuring 1.7 cm. There is a 0.3
cm intraparenchymal lymph node recovered. "B1 bronchial margin; "82," vascular margin; "83-85," representative sections

of tumor; "B6," representative sections of lun at apex with emphysematous change; "B7," parabronchial lymph nodes; "B8,"
intraparenchymal lymph nodes. i
