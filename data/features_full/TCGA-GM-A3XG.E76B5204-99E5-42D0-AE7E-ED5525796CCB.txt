COMMENT

In specimen D, the main focus of invasive carcinoma measures approximately 6 cm in greatest dimension, with multiple
surrounding microscopic foci. The entire area involved by invasive carcinoma is approximately 8 cm.

Cytokeratin immunostaining performed on sections E1, E4 and E8 confirms the presence of metastatic carcinoma in one lymph
node (section E8).

GROSS, DESCRIPTION

(A) SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1, RIGHT AXILLARY, - One pale-pink lymph node, 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm.
The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted for frozen section evaluation.

*FS/DX: METASTATIC CARCINOMA (AT LEAST 2.5 MM\
(B) SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2, RIGHT AXILLARY - One pale-gray possible lymph node, 2.0 x 1.4 x
0.4 cm. The lymph node Is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in B1 and B2 for frozen section evaluation.

*FS/DX: METASTATIC CARCINOIVIA.

(C) SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #3, RIGHT AXILLARY, — One pale-pink lymph node, 2.0 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm.
The lymph node is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in C for frozen section evaluation. .

*FS/DX: NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA. ' ' "

(D) RIGHT BREAST, STITCH MARKS 12 O'CLOCK — SPECIMEN X—RAY, IMMEDIATE - One skin sparing total mastectomy
specimen (19 x 18.5 x 3.5 cm) with an unremarkable areola (4.1 cm) and nipple (1.5 cm) with a stitch to mark 12 o'clock. The
specimen is inked and serially sectioned from lateral to medial into thirteen slices with nipple at slice #8. Located at slice #6 to
slice #8, there is one pale-gray, firm, ill-deﬁned nodule (4.0 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm), located at approximately 12 o'clock position, 4.0 cm
from the nipple, 1.0 cm from the closest superior superﬁcial margin. Adjacent to the nodule there is one ﬁrm area at slice #6 and
#7, approximately 2-cm in largest dimension, inferior from the nodule. One cyst (3.0 x 1.7 x 1.3 cm) is identified at slice #7 and
slice #8 adjacent to the nodule. The specimen is x-rayed after sectioning and multiple radiographic interest areas are identified at
slice #1 inferior portion, slice #6 to slice #8, central to inferior portion with a clip at slice #6, central portion. A portion of normal
tissue and tumor is submitted for tumor bank.

(E) RIGHT AXILLARY CONTENTS - One pink-yellow fibroadipose tissue (9.0 x 5.5 x 3.4 cm) with multiple lymph nodes ranging
from 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm to 2.8 x 1.4 x 0.9 cm. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted.

lymph nodes, 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm, 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted in F. '
(G) ADDITIONAL LEVEL l NODE - One pale-gray tissue fragment, 2.2 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm with two possible lymph nodes, 0.5 x 0.4 x
