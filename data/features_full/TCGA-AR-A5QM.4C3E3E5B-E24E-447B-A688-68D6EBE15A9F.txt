Breast, leﬁ, wide local excision: Inﬁltrating lobular carcinoma, Nottingham grade II (of III)
[tubules 3/3, nuclei 2/3, mitoses 2/3; Nottingham score 7/9], forming a mass (4.7 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm)
[AJCC pT2]. Lobular carcinoma in situ is present. Biopsy site changes are present.
Angiolymphatic invasion is not identiﬁed. Calciﬁcations are identiﬁed in benign ducts. A11
surgical resection margins, aﬁer re—excision of the superomedial margin, are negative for tumor
(minimum tumor free margin, 0.8 cm, deep margin). Multiple (4) left breast intramammary
lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

Breast, left "palpable" nodule, excision: A single leﬁ breast intramammary lymph node is
negative for tumor.

Lymph node, left intramammary sentinel, excision: A single left intramammary sentinel lymph
node is positive for isolated tumor cells [AJCC pNO (i+) (sn)]. These isolated tumor cells are
seen on cytokeratin immunostaining only. Blue dye is identiﬁed.

Lymph nodes, left axillary sentinel, No. 1 and No. 2, biopsy: Multiple (3) left axillary sentinel
lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma [AJ CC pNO (i-) (sn)]. Blue dye is not
identiﬁed in any of the three leﬁ axillary sentinel lymph nodes

Immunohistochemical cytokeratin stain was performed on the parafﬁn embedded sentinel lymph
node tissue and conﬁrms the H&E impression.

Breast, right, wide local excision: Inﬁltrating ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade II (of III)
[tubules 3/3, nuclei 2/3, mitoses 2/3; Nottingham score 7/9], forming a mass (1.4 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm)
[AJ CC pTlc]. Extensive ductal carcinoma in situ, low to intermediate nuclear grade, present
within (greater than 25%) and outside the invasive component (over an area 1.8 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm)
which extends anteriorly from the invasive tumor. Angiolymphatic invasion is present. Biopsy
site changes are present. All surgical resection margins, after re—excision of the anterior/medial
margin, are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 0.9 cm, deep margin). A
radioactive seed is identified.

Lymph nodes, right axillary, dissection: Multiple (4 of 25) right axillary lymph nodes are
positive for metastatic breast carcinoma [AJCC pNZ]. The largest metastatic focus is a collection
of matted lymph nodes that measure 3.0 x 1.9 x 1.6 cm.

Faxitron done.
