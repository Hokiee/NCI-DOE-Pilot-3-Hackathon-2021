*** Diagnosis/Diagnoses: ***

Colonic resection specimen (sigmoid) with a colon carcinoma of the histological type of a
moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, measuring 3 cm in its largest diameter and extending
to a maximum of 11 cm from the resection margin. Invasive tumor spread to the level of the
muscularis propria.

Oral and aboral margins tumor-free.

Ten mesocolic lymph nodes tumor-free and with uncharacteristically reactive changes.

Tumor stage therefore pT2 pn0 (0/10) L0 V0; G2.

*** Follow-up report: ***
A further lymph node preparation was performed subsequently after special fixation.

A further seven very small lymph nodes were detected as a result. Histologically the lymph
nodes are tumor-free.

Lymph node status therefore pNO (0/17)
