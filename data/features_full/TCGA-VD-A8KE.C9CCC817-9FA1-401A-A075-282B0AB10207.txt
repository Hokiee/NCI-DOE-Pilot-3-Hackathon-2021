On trans—illumination, a shadow is seen laterally at
posterior pole measuring 9mm in maximum dimension.

Plane of section: horizontal.

A pigmented collar-stud choroidal tumour is confirmed.

Tumour size: LED 8mm, Height 9mm.

Sections show a focally pigmented choroidal melanoma with
attached adjacent normal choroid and sclera. The tumour is
of mixed cell type (approximate 60% of epithelioid cells).

The microvasculature of the melanoma is prominent,

and closed loops are present in the planes of section. The
lymphocytic infiltrate within the tumour is minimal. Tumour

necrosis is not seen. There is focal early scleral invasion
but no tumour extension through optic nerve or vortex veins
examined is seen. Tumour cells are not seen at the resection

margins .

Elsewhere, the cornea shows no significant abnormality.
Hassall-Henle warts are noted. The anterior chamber angles
are open but the anterior chamber is shallow. The iris shows

atrophic with hyalinisation of ciliary processes. The lens
shows peripheral degeneration. Retina overlying the tumour
is slightly atrophic and Bruch's membrane appears breached
in the sections examined. Several drusen are seen. Optic
nerve cupping is also noted.

DIAGNOSIS

Left enucleation - Choroidal melanoma of mixed cell type

COW

Assessment of immunohistochemistry for MelanA and. ESP 2?
will follow. In addition, molecular genetic examination of
DNA extracted from the tumour cells will be performed using
multiplex—ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA),
looking at chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8.

A supplementary report will follow in due course.

In the meantime, molecular genetic analysis of tumour DNA
extracted from the fresh uveal melanoma tissue was performed
using the technique termed multiplex ligation-dependent
probe amplification (MLPA). These investigations were
performed in the - ‘ ~- -m~c"

The kit P027 from which examines for gains or
losses in 31 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and a, was used.
The DNA concentration was measured using , and the
quality assessed using multiplex—PCR prior to the MLPA
reaction.

The DNA concentration was high and of good quality on
assessment. The MLPA reaction was run at least twice on
differing occasions, resulting in similar results.

The results of the sequence analysis of the MLPA products is
printed on a separate report. In summary, sequence analysis
demonstrated:

normal chromosome 1, essentially normal chromosome 3 (2
borderline losses), gains in chromosome 6 and normal
chromosome 8.

These molecular data require correlation with the clinical
and morphological data for metastatic risk assessment.
