This staging information is based on this pathologic specimen
and may be incomplete. A comprehensive review of all available

information is recommended to determine final staging.

Comment:
The frozen section diagnosis is confirmed.

Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis:
Frozen section was requested.

FSAl: Right axillary lymph node, biopsy
— No neoplasm identified

Clinical History:
—year—old with right arm melanoma.

Gross Description:
Received are four formalin—filled containers. Specimen A is
submitted fresh for frozen section.

Container A: Received is a 3.0 x 2.1 x 1.0 cm lymph node.
Representative section is frozen as FSAl. Grossly, this area is
suspicious for hemorrhage?, remaining sections are submitted in
blocks A2-A4,

Container B is additionally labeled "sentinel lymph node #2."
Received is a brown/tan unoriented soft tissue fragment
measuring 1.4 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned
and submitted entirely in blocks B1 and B2,

Container C is additionally labeled "sentinel lymph node #3."
Received is a single unoriented 1.2 x 1.1 x 0.7 cm brown/tan
soft tissue fragment. The specimen is serially sectioned and
submitted entirely in block C1,

Container D is additionally labeled "skin, right arm melanoma,
wide excision."

Specimen fixation: formalin

Specimen type: wide excision

Tumor site: right arm

Orientation of the specimen: The specimen is oriented with a

short stitch/superior designated as 12 o' clock, and a long
stitch lateral designated as 9 o‘ clock.

Inking: yellow=12 o' clock to 3 o' clock, blue=3 o' clock to 6
o'clock, red=6 o' clock to 9 o' clock, green=9 o' clock to 12 o'
clock, deep margin=black except for a central recessed area
which is inked orange

Skin ellipse dimensions: 9.7 x 8.9 cm

Tumor size and description: The tumor is 10.5 x 8.7 x 6.3 cm.
The tumor overhangs the skin ellipse at 3 o' clock x
approximately 2.5 cm. The tumor is exophytic, raised with
lobulated borders.

Microscopic pigmentation: There are multiple white/tan nodules
ranging in diameter from 0.2 to 0.3 cm towards the posterior
aspect of the tumor, and several foci of hemorrhages mainly
towards the posterior aspect of the tumor.

Satellite nodules: none identified

Distance of tumor from margins: 1.9 cm at the 12 o' clock, 2.1
cm at 3 o' clock, 2.4 cm at 6 o' clock, and 1.8 cm at 9 o‘ clock

Digital photograph taken: not taken
Tissue submitted for special investigation: none
Block summary:

01,02 - deep en face margin from 12 o' clock to 3 o‘ clock
D3,D4 — deep en face margin from 3 o' clock to 6 o' clock
D5—D7 - deep en face margin from 6 o' clock to 9 o' clock
D8,D9 - deep en face margin from 9 o' clock to 12 o' clock
010—021— radial perpendicular sections from the biopsy site to
corresponding

clock number margin: D10, 12 o' clock; D11, 1

o' clock; etc..., D21=11 o' clock

022—025 representative sections from the tumor, abutting the
orange margin

Light Microscopy:

Light microscopic examination is performed. 8100 protein and
Melan A immunostains were performed on each sentinel lymph node
block and were medically necessary. All are negative for
metastatic melanoma. 5100 and Melan A were also utilized to
evaluate a small area in block 011. These stains are negative
thereby arguing against a satellite metastasis.
