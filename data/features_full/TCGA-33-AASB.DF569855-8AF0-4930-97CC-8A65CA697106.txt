PART #1: LEFT UPPER LOBE )
Resident Pathologist:

The specimen is received fresh labeled “and designated
"Left upper lobe". The specimen consists of a grossly recognizable
left upper lobectomy specimen measuring 25.5 x 15 x 7.5 cm. It weighs
480 grams. There is a palpable mass in the apex of the upper lobe
adjacent to the hilum. There is associated pleural puckering.
Sectioning reveals tan—white slightly lobulated mass measuring 4.5 cm
in diameter. It is located approximately 0.5 cm from the pleural
surface. The tumor directly abuts a segmental bronchus extending into
the apex. It appears to encase the bronchus but not penetrate through
it. The hilar margins however appear grossly negative. No grossly
positive hilar lymph nodes are identified. Sectioning through the
remaining lung reveals firm parenchyma with mucus plugging. No
satellite nodules are identified. Representative sections are
submitted.

This specimen is harvested by the Tumor Bank.
