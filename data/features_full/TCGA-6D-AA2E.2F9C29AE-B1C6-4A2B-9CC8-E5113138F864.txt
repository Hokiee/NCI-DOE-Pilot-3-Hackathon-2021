GHRCﬁSS IDEHSCIQIEWEIcnﬁi

Received in formalin in a container labeled with patient's name, hospital number and "right
renal mass" is a 450 gram right nephrectomy specimen including the kidney (12 x 9.0 x 5.0
cm) and surrounding perirenal fat, measuring in thickness 0.5—0.8 cm. A ureter extends
from the renal pelvis (5 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter). The entire specimen is inked
black. Cut sections show a cortically based well—circumscribed encapsulated mass located at
the midpole, 6.5 x 5.0 x 3.9 cm. Upon opening, the mass is heterogeneous, consisting of a
tan, yellow—brown tumor and two small cystic areas containing clear mucinous content. The
tumor extends near (within <O.l cm) to the capsule surface margin. There is a tan—white
nodule measuring 0.5 x 0.3 present in the upper portion of the kidney. No renal vein or the
perirenal fat involvement is identified grossly. The remainder of the renal cortex is
tan—brown with a well—defined corticomedullary junction. The pelvis and calyces are covered
with smooth, glistening, tan—pink mucosa. The adipose tissue is thinly sectioned and no
lymph nodes are round. Sections are submitted as ﬁollows:

Cassette lA—LD: Tumor, full cross—section in relation to renal capsule and adjacent normal.
Cassette lE~lG: Tumor, representative sections

Cassette lH-lJ: Tumor in relation to ureter

Cassette lK: Separated nodule, representative sections

Cassette lL: Tumor in relation to the nearest vessels

Cassette lM: Tumor in relation to pelvis

Cassette 1N: Uninvolved kidney with renal pelvis

Cassette 1P: Ureteral margin

Cassette 1Q: Renal vein margin
