Gross Description:

Received in formalin, labeled "left thigh sarcoma" is a

10.0 x 9.0 x 7.5 cm tan, Iobulated. irregular resection of fat and muscle with
attached long suture designating distal and short suture designating proximal.
The specimen is inked as follows: Proximal—yellow. distal-green. remaining
peripheral margins—black, Sectioning reveals a 6.5 x 5.6 x 5.0 cm tan-white to
red, Iobulated, hemorrhagic well delineated mass, which comes to within 0.1 cm
from the nearest peripheral margin, 1.0 cm from the distal margin and 1.7 cm
from the proximal margin. The remaining cut surface is tan, lobulated fatty
tissue admixed with tan, homogeneous muscle.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:
1 proximal margin taken perpendicular;
2 distal margin taken perpendicular;
3-6 mass to four peripheral margins;
7—8 random mass.

Microscopic Description:

The final diagnosis of each specimen incorporates the microscopic examination
findings.
