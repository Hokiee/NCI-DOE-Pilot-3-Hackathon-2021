Surg Path

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Abdominal pelvic swelling NOS.

 

GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. "Omentum", Received is an omental specimen (16 x 11 x 4.5 cm} that is
thick and rubbery (AFl Frozen section; remnant in A1, additional blocks A2).

B. "Right tube and ovary". Received is a 5.5 x 5 x 4.2 cm solid and cystic
white~red ovarian cancer mass (40 gm) with multiple serosal excrescences
maximally 4.2 x 2,5 x 0.4 cm. Cut section reveals that the white—yellow
tumor is 20% cystic; the rest is filled with a light tan serous fluid. There
is no residual normal ovary. The fallopian tube has a patent lumen but no
fimbria.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Bl~ tumor along with external excrescence
82“ cyst wall and adherent tumor

33— tentative fallopian tube

C. "Left tube and ovary”. Received is 19.6 gm 5.2 x 3 x 2.8 cm white—tan mass
with two cysts measuring 1 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm for the first and 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm
for the second. The outer surface is significant for white fibrous adherent
fragment which can be peeled off and grossly resembles the tumor in the other
ovary. Sectioning reveals a white—tan cut surface with multiple corpora
albicans and three cysts cavity. The cysts cavity contains a thin serous
solution which is red clear. The largest of the cysts which is 2 x 1.5 x 0.8
cm is on the most proximal portion of the ovary. The fallopian tube (1 cm in
length x 0.8 cm in diameter is red—tan and upon sectioning has a patent

lumen.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

cl Ovarian tumor with cyst

C2— cyst wall and adherent tumor
C3— fallopian tube

D. "Uterus", received is a 2&3 gm, 10.5 x 9 x 6.8 cm uterus without a cervix.
Bivalving the uterus reveals a 7.1 x 3.5 cm uterine cavity with multiple
subserosal leiomyomata. These leiomyomata on serial sectioning reveal an
endometrium averages of 0.1 cm with a myometrium measuring 3.1 cm there are
two large (3 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm) white whorled fibrous lesion which expand when on
ithe cut surface. The endometrium is moderately hemorrhagic. The serosal
surface of the uterus demonstrate a shiny purple surface with multiple
adherent small fibrous tissue which grossly resemble the ovarian tumor.

BLOCK SUMMARY:
01-02 anterior endomyometrium bisected

D3- leiomyomata
Dd—DS posterior endomyometrium bisected with leiomyomata
06— adherent tumor to serosa 0f uterus

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
A. “0mentum”: AFl— metastatic adenocarcinoma
consistent with ovarian primary

JICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.
