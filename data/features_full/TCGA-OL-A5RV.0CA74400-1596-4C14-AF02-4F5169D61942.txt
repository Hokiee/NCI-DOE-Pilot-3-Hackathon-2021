Clinical History:

The patient is a year old female, with a right breast mass (MRI: 1.3 x 0.9 x

0.8 cm) and biopsy diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma undergoing right

modiﬁed radical mastectomy.

Specimens Received:

A: Right breast; mastectomy

Gross Description:

A. The specimen is received in a single container labeled with the patient’s

name, medical record number, and additionally identified as, 'right breast'.

i....‘..:;;mm:--.M.:Mn—__..._ .

Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 653 gm modified radical mastectomy
specimen. The specimen is oriented with a short suture designating the superior
margin and a long suture designating lateral margin. The specimen measures 18.5
cm from superior to inferior, 22.5 cm from medial to lateral, and 3.9 cm from
anterior to posterior. There is an attached 9.6 x 7.9 x 1.5 cm axillary tail.

On the anterior surface is a 18.0 x 8.0 cm tannish brown ellipse of skin with a

4.0 x 4.5 cm areola and a 1.5 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm raised nipple. The nipple-areolar
complex reveals no evidence of ulceration or retraction.

The specimen is inked as follows:

superior edge - blue;

inferior edge - green;

posterior — black.

The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 11 slices to

reveal a rubbery, irregularly shaped, white-tan, 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm mass with a
granular cut surface in slices 3 through 5. A clip is identified in slice 3. The

mass is 0.5 cm from the posterior margin and widely free (>2 cm) from the
anterior superior and anterior inferiormargins. The remainder of the specimen
consists of approximately 30% dense gray—white fibrous breast parenchyma and 70%
lobulated yellow adipose tissue. No additional masses or nodules are grossly
identified. Sectioning through the axillary tail reveals multiple tan-brown,

rubbery lymph nodes ranging from 0.3-2.5 cm in greatest dimension.
