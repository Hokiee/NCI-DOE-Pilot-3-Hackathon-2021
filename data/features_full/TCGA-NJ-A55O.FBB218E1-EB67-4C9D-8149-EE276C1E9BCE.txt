FINAL DIAGNOSIS

A. (Right upper lobe lung; lobectomy): Invasive adenocarcinoma, grade 1, with
mucinous features, measuring 2.6 cm. Bronchial, vascular, parenchymal, and

visceral pleural margins are all free of tumor. One of five peribronchial

lymph nodes positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, measuring 0.4 cm with no
extracapsular extension. Remainder of lung with benign meningotheliaI-Iike

rest. Stage pT1bN1 (PLO). See note.

B. (Right paratracheal tissue): Fragments of anthracotic lymph node tissue

negative for tumor.

C. (Subcarinal lymph nodes): Fragments ofanthracotic lymph node tissue

negative for tumor.

lNTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION
A. FROZEN: RIGHT UPPER LOBE, FROZEN ON TUMOR AND BRONCHIAL MARGINS: Invasive
adenocarcinoma, bronchial margin negative for malignancy (A91~mass,

A92-bronchial margin,

NOTE

A. The tumor cells are strongly positive for CK7, positive for TTF-l, and are

negative for CKZO and COX-2, which supports a lung primary.

lmmunohistochemistry controls are examined and show appropriate reactivity.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. The specimen is labeled right upper lobe. Received fresh for frozen section

is a 15.0 x 10.3 x 3.0 cm lobectomy specimen with multiple overlying staples

margins in total measuring 15.5 cm in length. The visceral pleural surface is

inked black and the specimen is sectioned to show a spiculated tan tumor

measuring 2.6 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm located 0.2 cm from the overlying visceral

pleura, 2.0 cm from the closest overlying staple margin and 3.0 cm from the

bronchial margin. The remainder of the lung tissue shows anthracosis and some
mild congestion. No other discrete masses or lesions are identified. A

touch prep of the tumor is performed and a portion is submitted for frozen
section with the remnant wrapped and placed in cassette A91. A shave of the
bronchial margin is submitted for frozen section with the remnant wrapped and
placed in cassette A92. Additional cassettes are submitted as follows: A1-A2,
sections of tumor and overlying visceral pleura; A3, section of tumor and
adjacent lung; A4, stapled margin closest to tumor and vascular margin; A5,

multiple peribronchial lymph nodes; A6, uninvolved lung.

B. The specimen is labeled right paratracheal tissue. Received in formalin
are multiple irregular fragments of white-tan fibrous tissue and yellow
adipose tissue (1.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm in aggregate) admixed with multiple
fragments of black possible lymphoid tissue. All of the possible lymphoid

tissue is submitted in cassettes 31-85.

C. The specimen is labeled subcarinal nodes. Received in formalin are
multiple irregular fragments of red—black possible lymphoid tissue measuring
1.8 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm in aggregate. All of the lymphoid tissue is submitted as
follows: C1 — largest fragment bisected, C2 - one fragment bisected, C3 - 2

intact fragments.
