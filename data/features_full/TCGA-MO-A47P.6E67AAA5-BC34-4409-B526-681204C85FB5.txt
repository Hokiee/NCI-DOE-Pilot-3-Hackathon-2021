I personally informed this patient that a specimen(s) would be collected to be used for research
purposes. I reviewed the RESEARCH SUBJECT INFORMATION AND CONSENT
FORM with the patient and answered any questions the patient had. The patient then signed the
consent form as a free and voluntary act. A copy of this informed consent document will be retained at
