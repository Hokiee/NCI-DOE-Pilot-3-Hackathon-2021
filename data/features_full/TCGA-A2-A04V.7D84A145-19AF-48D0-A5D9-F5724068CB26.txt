FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS (continued):
# SCRAPE PREPS: o

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:
-NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR BASED ON TISSUE SUBMITTED.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, _

designated "RIGHT BREAST" is a 980 gram simple mastectomy specimen
measuring 23.5 cm superior to inferior, 18.0 cm medial to lateral, and 5.1
cm anterior to posterior. The overyling ellipse of nipple bearing skin
measures 7.4 x 3.8 cm, and is without gross abnormalities. Ink code:
blue=superior/anterior, green=inferior/anterior, and black=posterior.
Sectioning reveals a 2.2 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm stellate tumor with a tan, gritty,
and focally hemorrhagic cut surface in the lower outer quadrant, 2.0 cm
from the deep margin, and 2.5 cm from the inferior/anterior margin. The
remaining tissue is mostly fatty with interspersed lengths of soft, white,
parenchyma. Multiple tissue sections are submitted for CBCP protocol with
matching paraffin sections in cassette A1, A2, A3, and A7.

Slide key:
A1: Skin.
A2: Tumor.
A3: Tumor.

A4—A6: Margins nearest tumor.
A7: Fibrosis (central).

A8: Nipple.

A9: Upper inner quadrant.

A10: Lower inner quadrant.

A11: Lower outer quadrant.

A12: Upper outer quadrant. 12CF

B. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, . ,
designated "ADDITIONAL RIGHT BREAST TISSUE" are two fragments of
tan—yellow, fibrofatty, non—oriented, soft tissue. The larger measures
11.0 x 9.5 x 3.5 cm. The smaller measures 7.5 x 7.0 x 3.8 cm. The outer
portion of both specimens is inked entirely in black. Sectioning reveals
a uniform, glistening, yellow, lobular cut surface admixed with a scant
portion of white, fibrous appearing connective tissue. Representative
sections are submitted.

Bl—BS: Random sections of larger fragment.
B7-B10: Random sections of smaller fragment. 10CF

C. Received fresh for intraoperative consultation, labeled with the
patient’s name, I designated "ADDITIONAL CHEST WALL DEEP AT
SITE OF TUMOR, LEFT BREAST SHORT SUPERIOR, LONG LATERAL DOUBLE DEEP" is a
7.5 x 3.5 x 0.8 cm fragment of red—brown, soft tissue. The surface
appears to be muscle grossly. Sectioning reveals a white, fibrous
appearing band 0.3 cm thick, running the length of the center of the
specimen parallel to the deep margin. The specimen is inked deep in
black, superior in yellow, and inferior in green. The specimen is
entirely submitted lateral to medial.

Slide key:

C1: Inferior portion of section 1.0 cm from the lateral margin contiguous
with C5.

C2: Inferior portion of section submitted for frozen contiguous with C10.

D. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, ,
designated "LEFT BREAST" is a 984 gram simple mastectomy specimen. The
specimen measures 26.0 cm superior to inferior, 18.0 cm medial to lateral,
and 5.8 cm anterior to posterior. The overlying ellipse of nipple bearing
skin measures 7.2 x 3.5 cm, and is notable for an inverted nipple. Ink
code: blue=superior/anterior, green=inferior/anterior, and
black=posterior. Sectioning reveals a 2.2 x 1.8 x 1.8 cm tumor with
stellate margins, and tan, gritty, hemorrhagic cut surface in the lower
outer quadrant abutting the deep margin. The remaining tissue is mostly
fatty with interspersed widths of soft, white parenchyma. Multiple tissue
