ADDENDUM # 1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS:

  

 

EGFR, KRAS and ALK (FISH) was sent on- for patient
The test is to be performed on tissue from case
The case report, slides, and blocks for
the cited accession number were retrieved from archives. The
pathologist whose signature appears below reviewed the original
pathology report, examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block
4M appropriate to the specifications of the ordered molecular

anal sis. 1 H&E and 9 unstained slides were prepared and forwarded
to where the subject molecular test will be performed. An
addendum report will be issued when the results of this molecular
test are available.

MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY

KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS

Referring Physicia

Body Site: Lung

Specimen Type: Slides

Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma

RESULTS: Wild-type gene.

INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13
of the KRAS gene.

COMMENT:

Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor
prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly
associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.

This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of

the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated

for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in
fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In
particular the test performance has been established in samples of
colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor
these mutations, although several other tissues are also known to
harbor KRAS mutations (e. g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,
appendix, etc.).

Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide
additional information regarding this patient's probability of
response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if

clinically indicated. See references.

METHOD/LIMITAT IONS:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of (CLIA) as
qualified to perform high complexity clinical testing. This

particular test is not considered a stand along test and should be

used only in the context of other diagnostic tests or clinical

work-up related to treatment decisions.

EGFR Mutation Analysis

Referring Physician: —

Body Site: Lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: No mutation detected.

INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided
for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma

patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be

responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.

COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 30% tumor
cellularity upon pathologist review.

A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was
identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
significance.

Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential
responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (T KI)
therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a
sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.

This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell

lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change
during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this
result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation

in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.

This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types

is unknown.

METHOD/LIMITATION:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

ADDENDUM 3:

Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH)

Referring Physicia
Body Site: Lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma

INTERPRETATION:
Negative for a rearrangement involving the ALK gene.

Probe #Nuclei Examined % Positive Nuclei %
Control values

2p23(ALK)V 100 0 <15.0

A total of 100 cells were scored.

FINDINGS: FISH was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections
using dual color break-apart probe (Abbott Molecular) to the ALK
gene at 2p23. This probe ﬂanks the entire gene. If a rearrangement
involving ALK is present, inversion or translocation, one of the two
probe signals separates as one red (orange) and one green signal. In
this specimen, separated signals were present in 0.5% of the nuclei
scored. Based on laboratory validation data, these results are

within the normal limits.

COMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 27.0% of
cells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals

represents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosomes
2/2p ALK region. Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in

NSCLCs, although the significance of extra co ies of the ALK ene in
luni carcinoma is unclear at this time —g
