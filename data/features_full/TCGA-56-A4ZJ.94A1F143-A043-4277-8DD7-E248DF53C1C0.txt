Grose Description:

Four part3

Received in formalin labeled ” l — level 9 lymph
node right lung" is a 1.1 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm irregular black soft tissue
consistent with probable lymph node, which is bisected and submitted
in its entirety in one cassette.

Received in formalin labeled " 2 — level 10 lymph
node right lung" are three irregular granular black soft tissues

consistent with probable lymph node ranging from 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm
to 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm, which are submitted in toto in one cassette.

Received labeled - 3 - right lower lung lobe" is a
185 gram, 19.4 x 10.5 x 3.2 cm lower lung lobe with an attached 0.8
cm segment of bronchus. The pleura is smooth to wrinkled and
tan~pink to gray-purple with black anthraootic areas. There is s 3.1
cm linear staple line adjacent to the hilum. No additional
parenchymal staple lines are identified. There is a 1.4 x 1.1 cm
slightly ill~defined umbilicated area of pleura 2.2 cm from the
hilum.-The cut surface of this area consists of a 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm
well circumscribed tan nodule, 3.4 cm from the bronchial margin and
3.8 cm from the staple line. The remainder of the cut surface
consists of spongy tan-red parenchyma. There are two tan-white
nodules measuring 0.1 cm and 0.2 cm in greatest dimension which abut
the pleura near the periphery of the specimen. The nodules are 3.6

cm from each other. No additional parenchymal lesions are
identified. No obvious intraparenchymal or hilar lymph nodes are
identified. The specimen_is inked, serially sectioned and
representative sections are submitted as labeled: A - bronchial and
vascular margins (en face); 8 ~ pleural margin (perpendicular); C-E
- lesion, entirely submitted; G — larger nodule, entirely submitted;
8 - smaller nodule, in toto. Also received in the same container is
a blue, yellow and green cassette labeled ' genomic
research study.

Received in formalin labeled ~ 4 — level 4 lymph
node right lung" is a 2.8 x 1.7 x 0.5 cm irregular fibroadipose
tissue bearing three irregular black firm tissues consistent with
probable lymph node ranging from 1.1 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm to 1.2 x 0.8 x
0.5 cm. The specimen is sectioned and representative sections are
submitted, to include the lymph nodes in their entirety, as labeled:
A—C ~ one lymph node, bisected in each.

Microscopic Description:
See diagnosis.

Tumor distance from pleural surface: 0.1 cm
Lymph node status:
Total number of lymph nodes received (includes all four parts of
this case): 10
Total number of lymph nodes containing metastatic carcinoma: 0
other significant findings:
Two small subpleural ﬁibrous nodules are present consistent with
areas of scarring.
pTN stage: pTla, N0 PAS 9 SEC—NP

Comments .

The history of "back lower lobe squamous cell carcinoma" is noted.
There is however no prior material identified in our files for
review and comparison.

 

 

The two small subpleural nodules identified grossly, separate from
the malignancy, are both areas of. fibrosis containing some
histiocytas and reactive alveclar lining cells, possibly
representing areas of resold pneumonia.

At the request of the undersigned pathologist, these slides have
been additionally reviewed by Dr- who concurs with the
diagnosis.
