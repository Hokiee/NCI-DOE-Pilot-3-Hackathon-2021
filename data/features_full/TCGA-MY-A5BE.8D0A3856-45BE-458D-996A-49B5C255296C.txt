CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Cervical cancer.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

1. The specimen is received fresh for intraoperative consult and labeled
right common iliac lymph node. It consists of a 3.0 x 3.0 x 0.5cm aggregate
of fatty tissue fragments. There are two lymph nodes identified measuring
2.5cm and a 2.0cm in greatest dimension, The two lymph nodes are bisected
and frozen in two separate cassettes labeled

INTRADPERATIVE CONSULT: Two lymph nodes, negative for carcinoma (0/2).

2. The specimen is received fresh for intraoperative consult and labeled
right obturator. It consists of a 6.0 x 4.0 x 2.0cm aggregate of fatty
tissue fragments with a prominent fatty lymph node measuring 3.0 x 1.3 x
1.5cm. The lymph node is markedly fatty. The non-fatty portions are frozen
in three cassettes labeled he remainder of the fatty lymph node

is submitted in three cassettes labeled D-F.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULT: One lymph node, negative for carcinoma (0/1).
