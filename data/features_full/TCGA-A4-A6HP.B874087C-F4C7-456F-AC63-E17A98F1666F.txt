ADDENDUM REPORT :

ihis addendum is issued to clarify the surgical margins status. This case was discussed with Dr. Per Or.

the specimen submitted as deep margin (B) was taken from the left lateral tumor (specimen C). The left lateral tumor is not transected in the histologlc
sections examined. Multiple satellite foci (greater than 10) are noted in the renal parenchyma surrounding the three main lesions in specimen C-E. Some
of these satellite lesions measure less than 1 mm. Therefore it is possible that the deep marg'm tumor in specimen B represents a separate focus of
tumor rather than a positive margin from the left lateral tumor since the lei! lateral tumor was not transacted. A conversation with Dr also
reveals that the upper pole tumor (0) was adherent to the specimen submitted as left cyst wall (A). The upper pole tumor showed an blue or capsular
retraction with ink focally extending to the tumor. This additional information from Dr. aakes it likely that this area of concern was the alto of the
adherent cyst and therefore does not represent a true margin.

in summary, no tumor transaction is noted. however, this patient is at increased risk for recurrence due to the numerous small satellite lesions noted.

Histologic sections show numerous loci of papillary renal cell carcinoma. Each oi the resections including the tart lateral, upper pole, and lower poles
excisions demonstrate a dominant primary tumor with multiple smaller loci within the adjacent renal parenchyma. The separately submitted deep margin
{specimen 8) also demonstrates similar morphology consistent with papillary renal cell carcinoma. The cyst wall is negative for tumor.

Specimen D (upper pole tumor) demonstrates tumor extending to the inked outer/capsular surface, however the capsule appeals to have retracted in this
area and the presence of ink at the tumor is interpreted as e retraction artifact and not a true positive capsular/soil tissue margin.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received in formalin labeled ind lea cyst wall is a 4.2 x 1.5 x 0.2 cm irregular piece t“ "M“ memhranous tissue consistent with cyst
well. On section a lesion is not identiﬁed. Representative sections are submitted in one cassettr

8. Received in formalin labeled and deep margin is a 0.2 cm pink fragment submitted intact in one cassette

C. Received in formalin labeled and leﬁ lateral tumor is a 24.4 gram wedge of renal tissue. 4.5 x 3.2 x 1.3 cm. The resection margin is

inked blue and the soft tissue allu capsule yellow. The spec‘men has been previously incised for research. Further section displays a circumscribed sch
yellow lesion. 2.9 x 2.6 x 2.1 cm. The lesion is 0.2 cm from the resection margin and abuts the inked capsule. The remainder ofthe tissue is smooth
homogeneous tan renal parenchyma

Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1’2»perpendi6ular section through resection margin bisected; Wuerpendicular section through
section margin bisected; 5—«representative sections through perinephric adipose tissue. ‘wo cassettes for research are labeled

0. Received in formalin iahele ind upper pole tumor is a 4.9 gram wedge of renal tissue, 3.8 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm. it is covered by a smooth
capsule inked black. The TESGCKIDH margin is tan-pink shaggy and displays a 1.5 cm long by 0.9 cm in diameter disrupted cyst. The resection margin is
inked blue. The specimen is serially sectioned to display a circumscribed focally hemorrhagic yellow bulging nodule. 1.8 x 1.5 x 1 5 cm. it is 0.2 cm from
the cyst and less than 0.1 cm from the inked capsule and resection margin. The uninvolved tissue is tenabrown smooth and homogeneous. The entire
specimen is sequentially submitted in four cassetter

E. Rew'ved in formalin labeled 1nd lower pole tumor is a 12.5 gram wedge of renal tissue, 5.4 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm. The specimen is covered
by a complete. intact capsule. The resection margin is tan-brown and homogeneous. The capsule is inked black and the resecthn margin blue. The
specimen is serially sectioned to Show a focally hemorrhagic pale yellow sol} circumscribed lesion, 2.5 x 2.1 x 1.8 cm. The lesion abuts the capsule and
is 0.3 cm from the resection margin. The uninvolved tissue is tan‘pink and homogenous. Representative sections to include perpendicular sections
through the reelection margin are submitted in four cassettes,
