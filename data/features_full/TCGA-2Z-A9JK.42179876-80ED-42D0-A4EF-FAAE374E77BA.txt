Specimen(s) Received

Preoperative Diagnosis

Gross Description

A. The specimen is received fresh, labeled “left kidney“ and consists of a kidney with partial

encapsulated perinephric tissue, 844.0 g, 19.5 x 9.8 it 3.6 cm. The specimen is inked black. The
adrenal gland is not identified.

The cut surfacee exhibit an irregular tumor mass involving the cortex and medulla in the superior.
middle and lnferiorooles, 8.7 x 7.6 x 7.2 cm. The tumor is variegated, pale tan-pink and soft with
smooth tabulated sections .. Marked ﬁbrotic septation is noted. Neither necrosis, hemorrhage or cystic
degeneration is identified. The tumor invades 90% of the calyceal system and extends to the hilum.
The renal vein, artery and ureter are probe patent, and not lnvohred try tumor. The tumor does not
appear to imade the renal sinus, nor penetrate through the renal capsule to involve the pertnephrlc fat.
The tumor is sharply demarcated from normal paren chyma. Satellite tumor nomles are not present.
The remaining renal parenchyma is pink-tan. smooth and glistening with a well-demarcated
oortioo—medullary junction, 3.5 cm thickness. The papillae are blunted. A. segment of attached ureter
is noted {5.5 cm length x 4 mm diameter}. The renal artery reveals no signiﬁcant atherosclemtic

changes. No lymph nodes are identiﬁed. Representative sections are submitted in At-AM as
labeled:

A1: Mirror image section at tumor for Tissue Procurement Laboratory
n2: Renal vein and after; with ureter resection margin. tangential
Ail—n4: Tumor with inked pennephric lat margin

Aft—AT; Tumor, renal pelvis. pelvic fat and normal parenchyma
AB—Aﬁzl’umor and hilum in relation to renal artery.r and vein with ureter

Fitz-M3: Tumor with septated libretto tissue

A14: Normal renal oarenchyma

Rte specimen is submitted for Tissue Procurement. Laboratory.
