ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA.

PART 2: BBEASIrRIGHT, SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY —

. INV DUC , NOTTINGHAM GRADE 2 (TUBULE FORMATION 3, NUCLEAR GRADE 2,
ITOTIC ACTIVITY 1; TOTAL SCORE 6/9).

THE TUMOR SIZE MEASURES 1.8 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION (GROSS MEASUREMENT).

DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), NUCLEAR GRADE 2, CRIBRIFORM AND SOLID TYPES.

DCIS CONSTITUTES 15% OF TOTAL TUMOR VOLUME, MIXED AND AWAY FROM THE INVASIVE
COMPONENT.

SURGICAL MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA; INVASIVE TUMOR IS 7 MM TO THE CLOSEST
ANTERIOR MARGIN. AND DCIS IS 7 MM TO THE POSTERIOR MARGIN.

NO LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION NOTED.
