COMMENT :

The cervical biopsy (#1) shows fragments of gland—forming adenocarcinoma admixed with
fragments of carcinoma with solid non—glandular growth pattern and high mitotic rate. Some
of the fragments may contain a component of endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ; the degree
of backsto—back glandular confluency in one of the fragments, however, is diagnostic of
invasive adenocarcinoma. Both the gland—forming and solid components of tumor show strong
immunoreactivity for p16 compatible with endocervical primary. The solid mitotically
active component shows no evidence of immunoreactivity for neuroendocrine markers
(chromogranin, synaptophysin, CD56), stains positive for pan—keratin and CK7, and stains
negative for cytokeratin 5/6. These findings suggest that the solid component may
represent a poorly differentiated component of the adenocarcinoma and rule against a small
cell neuroendocrine or invasive squamous carcinoma component.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

1. Received in formalin labeled '_" _ and with the patient's name, the specimen
consists of multiple fragments of pale tan tissue intermixed with a moderate amount of
clotted blood measuring 2 x 1.6 x 0.6 cm in aggregate. The specimen is filtered and
entirely submitted in one cassette.

2. Received in formalin labeled ‘ and with the patient's name, the specimen consists
of multiple minute pale tan tissue fragments intermixed with a scant amount of clotted
blood measuring 2 x 0.7 x 0.2 cm in aggregate. The specimen is filtered and entirely
submitted in one cassette.
