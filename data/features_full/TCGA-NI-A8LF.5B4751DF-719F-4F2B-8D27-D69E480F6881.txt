GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. LEFT LATERAL HEPATIC SEGMENTECTOMY
Received fresh and subsequently ﬁxed in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and
designated "left lateral hepatic segmentectomy" it is a portion of previously inked (black at resection
margin) and procured partial hepatectomy specimen weighing 315 g and measuring 15 x 9 x 6.5 cm.
The specimen is sectioned to show an encapsulated, soft, dark yellow/tan lobulated mass with
hemorrhagic center measuring 6.5 x 6 x 4.6 cm. located approximately 0.1 cm from the surgical
resection margin. The remainder of the specimen shows pale red/tan, focally congested liver

parenchyma. No additional lesions or nodules are grossly appreciated. Gross photograph is taken.
Representative sections are submitted:

A1-A3: Mass, resection margin

A4-A6: Mass. capsule

A7-A9: Additional sections mass, central portion

A10: Uninvolved liver parenchyma

B. NEW MEDIAL MARGIN

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated “new medial margin" is an
oriented portion of liver tissue (multiple staples) weighing 48 g and measuring 9.3 x 4.3 x 3.2 cm. A
suture marks the old posterior medial margin. inked black, the remainder of the specimen inked blue.
The specimen is sectioned to show unremarkable red-tan congested liver parenchyma. No lesions or
nodules are grossly appreciated. Representatively submitted, B1-Ba.
