rser;9

INVASIVE, POORLY DIFFERENTIATED PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 4 + 4= 8.
TERTIARY GLEASON'PATI'ERN 5 CARCINOMA IS SEEN AND ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 3% OF
THE TOTAL TUMOR VOLUME.

THE CARCINOMA MEASURES 2.4 CM IN GREATEST NODULAR DIMENSION AND CONSTITUTES
APPROXIMATELY 40% OF THE TOTAL TISSUE EVALUATED.

THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES BOTH THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT LOBES OF THE PROSTATE.

EXTENSIVE ESTABLISHED EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION BY THE CARCINOMA IS SEEN.

THE EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IS SEEN IN THE LEFT LOBE OF THE PROSTATE AND IDENTIFIED IN
THE POSTERIOR LEFT APEX, POSTERIOR LEFT MID, POSTERIOR LEFT BASE, AND ANTERIOR LEFT MID
REGIONS.

ALL INKED MARGINS OF RESECTION ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA.

BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES, NO EVIDENCE OF CARCINOMA SEEN.

PERINEURAL INVASION BY THE CARCINOMA IS IDENTIFIED.

MULTIFOCAL HIGH GRADE PROSTATIC INTRA—EPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN) IS SEEN.

TNM STAGE: T33 ND MX.

HISTOLOGIC GRADE 63-4 (POORLY DIFFERENTIATEDIUNDIFFERENTIATED).

PART 4: PROSTATE, APICAL SOFT TISSUE, EXCISION —
BENIGN FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NO CARCINOMA SEEN.
