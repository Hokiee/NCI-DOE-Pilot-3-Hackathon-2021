I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

*** Report Electronically Signed Out *** I.

Gross Description:

1). The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "sigmoid and upper
rectum". It consists of a rectosigmoid colon that measures 35.5 x 7.2cm in
circumference at the distal margin. The serosal surface is pink tan and
smooth. The radial resection margin is inked black and the specimen is
opened to reveal a pink brown papillary tumor measuring 4.0 cm in length by
2.8 cm x 0.8 cm, located 5.8 cm from the nearest (distal) margin. The tumor
is sectioned to reveal extension to a depth of 0.6 cm involving the
underlying muscularis, and 0.3 cm from the nearest radial margin. is
taken. The specimen is submitted for lymph node dissection and all
identified lymph nodes are submitted. Representative sections are
submitted.

Summary of sections:

P -- proximal margin
D -- distal margin
RM -- radial margin
T -- tumor

RS- representative section
LN -- lymph nodes

2). The specimen is received fresh labeled "additional proximal sigmoid",
and it consists of an unoriented portion of bowel measuring 3.1 cm in length
x 2.2 cm in diameter. There is an undesignated one opened end and an
opposing undesignated stapled margin. The specimen is opened to reveal
grossly unremarkable pink-tan mucosal folds. No discrete lesions or gross
abnormalities are identified. Representative sections are submitted.

Summary:

0M-- open end margin

SM-- stapled margin

RS - representative sections

3). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "distal anastomotic ring"
and consists of a ring of pink tan soft tissue measuring 1.8 x 1.8 x 0.7 cm.
Multiple sutures and staples are attached. The mucosal surface is pink tan

and focally hemorrhagic. The sutures and staples are removed and the soft
tissue is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
Uundesignated

4). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "proximal anastomotic
ring" and consists of a silver metal anastomotic pin measuring 7.5 x 2.8 x
1.5 cm. At the center of the pin, a plastic piece is noted. A ring of pink
tan soft tissue is attached measuring 1.8 x 1.8 x 0.7 cm. The mucosal
surface is pink tan and focally hemorrhagic and the serosal surface is pink
tan and smooth. Several sutures and staples are noted. The sutures and
staples are removed and the soft tissue is entirely submitted.
