CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY:

_ 1 female with lump above left nipple. MMG showing
speculated mass at twelve o’clock position with overlying skin retraction.
US guided biopsy confirmed intraductal carcinoma.

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left breast cancer.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh, labeled with the patient’s name, - , .-_-__,,
designated "LEFT BREAST LUMPECTOMY" is an ovoid portion of soft tissue
oriented with a short stitch superior, long stitch lateral. The specimen
measures 8.0 cm medial to lateral, 6.5 cm superior to inferior, and 3.0 cm
anterior to posterior. Located on the anterior surface is a 4.5 x 2.0 cm
lightly pigmented, superficial skin ellipse. No scar is identified. The
specimen is inked as follows: superior = blue, inferior = green, medial =

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
Patient: ,-. . _ Specimen #:
GROSS DESCRIPTION (continued):

red, lateral = yellow, anterior = orange, and posterior = black. Serial
sections reveal a fairly well defined, firm, gritty, pink-white mass
measuring 1.3 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm. The mass shows focal congestion with an
embedded clip on sectioning. The mass is located subadjacent to the skin
ellipse coming to within 0.2 cm of the anterior inked margin, and 0.4 cm
of the superior margin. The remainder of the specimen is composed of
lobulated, yellow-tan, adipose tissue admixed with a moderate amount of
fibrous tissue. No additional lesions are identified.

Cassette Summary:

A1: Mass with skin.
A2: Adjacent normal with superior margin.
A3: Mass with adjacent normal.
A4—A5: Superior and posterior margins.
A6: Skin with anterior margin.
‘ A7: Medial margin.
A8: Medial margin.
A9: Lateral and inferior margin.
A10: Lateral and anterior margin.
A11: Inferior margin.
Matched sections of A1 and A3 are submitted in ‘ for CBCP protocol.

B. Received fresh, labeled with the patient’s name

designated "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1" is a 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm portion of
soft tissue. The specimen is bisected to reveal a predominantly fatty cut
surface with a partial thin, rim of pink-tan, lymphoid tissue. The
specimen is submitted in cassettes El and B2.

C. Received fresh, labeled with the patient’s name, “
designated "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2" is a 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm portion U1
soft tissue. The specimen is bisected to reveal a predominantly fatty,
cut surface with minimal lymphoid tissue identified. The specimen is
entirely submitted in cassettes C1 and C2. 1

D. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name,

designated "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #3" is a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm portion or
soft tissue. The specimen is bisected to reveal a predominantly fatty,
cut surface with minimal lymphoid tissue identified. The specimen is
entirely submitted in cassette D1. ,

. E. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name,

GROSS DESCRIPTION (continued):

designated "NON—SENTINEL NODE TISSUE" are two portions of
yellow—brown, lobulated, soft tissue measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm, and 1.1

fatty, cut surface admixed with lymphoid tissue. The larger fragment is
submitted in cassette E1. The smaller is submitted in cassette E2.
