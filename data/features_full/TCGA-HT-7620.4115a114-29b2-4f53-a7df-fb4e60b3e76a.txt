Pathology Report for Subject:-

Addendum Discussion: The MlB-l labeling index ranges up to 24.4% in the most
proliferative regions of tumor.

Addendum Diagnosis:
1-3. Left frontal brain tumor including enhancing nodule, anaplastic oligodendroglioma,
WHO grade III. Calculated MlB-l labeling index = 24.4%

Microscopic Description:

1-3. Sections demonstrate an oligodendroglioma characterized by a proliferation of
neoplastic cells which resemble oligodendrocytes. The tumor cells exhibit prominent
perinuclear halos, rounded hyperchromatic nuclei and few cellular processes. Overall,
the tumor cells exhibit moderate to marked cytologic atypia. They are arranged in
sheets and infiltrate gray and white matter. Microvascular proliferation is identified as
well as areas of early necrosis. An isolated focus of discrete necrosis is present which
may represent previous biopsy site. Numerous mitotic figures are present at up to eight
mitoses per 10 high power fields. Microgemicytes are readily identified admixed
throughout the tumor. Both microcalcifications and branching thin walled vessels,
features characteristic of oligodendrogliomas, are readily identified. These histologic
features are consistent with an anaplastic oligodendroglioma.
