GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. 2 R RIGHT PROXIMAL PARATRACHEAL

Received ﬁ'esh are 3 lymph nodes measuring 0.6 cm, 0.8 cm, and 1 cm. Submitted entirely for
frozen section diagnosis in cassette FSA.

C. 7 SUBCARINAL
Received fresh is a 1.2-cm lymph node. Submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis in
cassette FSC.

D. RIB — PORTION 5TH ,
Received in formalin is a segment of rib measuring 2.4 x 1.4 x 1.1 cm. Grossly, the specimen
appears unremarkabie. Representative sections are submitted after decalciﬁcation.

E. RIGHT LUNG -
Received fresh is a 955 gm right pneumonectomy specimen measuring 23.5 x 15.0 x 7.0 cm. In
the middle lobe, 0.1 cm deep to the pleural surface is an irregularly shaped mass measuring 4.5 X
3.1 x 3.0 cm, grossly appearing to involve multiple adjacent lymph nodes. The cut surface is '
ﬁrm, tan—white to pink—tan, and solid. Grossly, no mucinous, hemorrhagic, or necrotic foci are
_ noted. The edges of the lesion‘are irregular. The lesion ‘is located 2.5 cm from the bronchial

margin. Serial sectioning through the remainder of the lung reveals no additional gross focal
lesions. Representative sections are submitted as follows?

FSEl-FSE3: bronchial margins frozen: main bronchus El, middle lobe E2, lower lobe

E3.

E4-El 1: mass with surrounding adjacent lymph nodes involvement

E12: 3 lymph nodes

E13: 5 lymph nodes

E14: 5 lymph nodes

E15: 3 lymph nodes

E16: uninvolved lower lobe

B17: uninvolved middle lobe

E18: uninvolved upper lobe

E19: additional uninvolved upper lobe

F. SUBCARINAL LYMPH NODE

Received in formalin are 2 pieces of irregularly shaped red-brown to focally black tissue,
measuring 3.3 x 2.7 x 0.9 cm and 1.9 x 1.4 x 0.6 cm. The larger piece consists of at least 5.
lymph nodes when dissected, which are submitted entirely in F1 -FS with one lymph node in each
cassette. The second piece consists of one anthracotic lymph node which is submitted entirely in
F6.

DIAGNOSIS: .

- NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED IN ONE LYMPH NODE (0/1).

B. LYMPH NODE, LEFT DISTAL PARATRACHEAL ~ 4L, RESECTION:
— NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED IN ONE LYMPH NODE (0/1).

- ASSOCLATED WITH SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA IN SITU INVOLVING

THE ADJACENT BRONCHUS.

- THE NON-NEOPLASTIC LUNG CONTAINS EMPHYSEMATOUS CHANGES

AND FOCAL HEMORRHAGE.

— METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO THREE OF FIFTEEN PERIBRONCHIAL LYMPH
NODES (3! 15), WITH EXTRANODAL EXTENSION.

F. LYMPH NODES, SUBCARINAL LEVEL 7, RESECTION:
— NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED IN SIX LYMPH‘ NODES (0/6).
