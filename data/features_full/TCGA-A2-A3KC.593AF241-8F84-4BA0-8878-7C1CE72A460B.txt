GROSS DESCRIPTION

C RECEIVED LABELED _ RIGHT NONSENTINEL MODE #1 IS A 3.4
X 2 x 1.5 CM PORTION OF YELLOW FATTY TISSUE WHICH IS A GROSSLY FAT
REPLACED LYMPH NODE SUBMITTED ENTIRELY LABELED C1 THROUGH C3.

D RECEIVED LABELED _ RIGHT BREAST SIMPLE MASTECTOMY
STITCH AT 12 O'CLOCR IS A 1,250 GRAM SIMPLE MASTECTOMY WHICH INCLUDES 4
IRREGULAR ADDITIONAL FRAGMENTS OF YELLOW-RED FATTY TISSUE IN AGGREGATE
MEASURING 9 x 7 x 1 CM. THIS TISSUE IS NOT ORIENTED. THE MASTECTOMY
ITSELF MEASURES 28.5 x 21 x 5 CM. THE NIPPLE IS FLATTENED AND SITS
WITHIN A 26 x 13 CM SKIN ELLIPSE. THERE IS PALPABLE FIRMNESS IN THE
LOWER OUTER QUADRANT. THE SUPERFICIAL ASPECT OF THE MASTECTOMY Is
MARKED WITH BLUE INK, THE DEEP WITH BLACK. SECTIONING REVEALS 2
DISTINCT FIRM MASSES, ONE IN THE 12 O'CLOCK AREA AND THE 2ND
CORRESPONDING TO THE PALPAELE FIRMNESS IN THE LOWER OUTER QUADRANT.
THIS HAS A RIBBON CLIP AND THE 12 O CLOCK LESIGE HAS A WING CLIP. THE
DEEP MARGIN ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOWER OUTER QUADRANT LESION IS FIRM AND
PINK-TAN EIEROUS TISSUE DOES EXTEND TOWARDS THE MARGIN BUT THE ACTUAL
FIRM MASS IS GROSSLY WITHIN THE CONFINES. THE LOWER OUTER s MEASURES
2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 CM. THE 12 O'CLOCK MASS IS SEPARATED BYgéggngF TISSUE
AND MEASURES 3.5 K 2:5 x 2.5 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION. AD ITIONAL
PINK-TAN FIEROUS TISSUE IS FOUND IN THE MIDPORTION OF THE SPECIMEN WHICH
IS THEN SURROUNDED BY YELLOW FATTY TISSUE. SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED As
FOLLOWS: D1~-NIPPLE. D2 AND 3-—DEEP MARGIN OVER LOWER OUTER QUADRANT
LESION, D4——DEEP MARGIN To 12 O'CLOCK LESION, D5 AND 6—-12 O’CLOCK
LESION, D7 THROUGH D9——IONGITUDINAL SECTION OF 12 O’CLOCK LESION,
D10--TISSUE BETWEEN THE 2 LESIONS, D11 AND 12-—LOWER OUTER QUADRANT
LESION LONGITUDINAL SECTION, D13--TUMOR LOWER OUTER QUADRANT. THE
TISSUE To THE 6 O’CLOCK MARGIN OF THE LOWER OUTER QUADRANT LESION IS
NODULAR AND FOCALLY THERE IS BROWN DISCOLORATION. A SECTION IS
SUBMITTED IN D14. THIS IS 1 CM FROM THE LOWER OUTER OUADRANT LESION AND
5 CM FROM THE 12 O'CLOCK LESION. OTHER MODULES DEMONSTRATE CYSTS AS A
SECTION IN D15 DEMONSTRATES. D1S--UPPER INNER QUADRANT (3 CM FROM 12
O'CLOCK LESION), D17--UPPER OUTER QUADRANT (5 CM FROM 12 O'CLOCK
LESION), D18—-L0WER OUTER QUADRANT (3 CM FROM LOWER OUTER QUADRANT
LESION), D19--LOWER INNER QUADRANT (3 CM FROM LOWER OUTER QUADRANT
LESION). THE SEPARATELY SUBMITTED PORTIONS OF FATTY TISSUE ARE.GROSSLY
UNREMARKABLE AND REPRESENTATIVE TISSUE Is SUBMITTED IN D20 AND 21.

E RECEIVED LABELED- RIGHT AXILLARY NODE CONTENTS IS
YELLOW—RED FATTY TISSUE MEASURING 12 X 9.5 X 2.5 CM. THE TISSUE IS
EXAMINED FOR LYMPH NODES. LY‘MPH NODES ARE IDENTIFIED AND SUBMITTED AS
FOLLOWS: E1--ONE—HALF OF A FIRM NODE WITH MIRROR IMAGE SUBMITTED PER
PROTOCOL, E2--—l NODE BISECTED, E3--1 NODE BISECTED (MAY ACTUALLY
REPRESENT 2 IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT NODES) , E4~~1 NODE TRISECTED, E5--1
NODE BISECTED, E6-—l NODE BISECTED, E7--1 NODE TRISECTED, E8--3 NODES (l
BISECTED), E9--6 NODES, E10--l NODE BISECTED.
