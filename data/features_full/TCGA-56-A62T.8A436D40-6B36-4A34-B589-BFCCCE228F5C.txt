Gross Description:

A The specimen is labeled left upper lobe and is received without fixative It consists of a lobe of lung
measuring it x 9 3 x 6.0 cm and weighing *t'70 grams. The pleural surface is vrolet to pale red with
numerous string adhesions along the anterior surtace and toward the basilar portion The lateral apical
portion of the lobe has a mottled yellow-tan to pink to reddish violet appearance with thickening oilhe
pleura over an area measuring ”is x 5 cm. The bronchial margin is identified and is removed as a thin
shave for on face irozen section. On dissection there is an apical tumor mass which is composed of tan to
pale yellow to pale red tissue and Overall measures 5.5 x 5.2 x 4 cm. This tumor is centrally cavrtary
containing blood clot. This lesion IS grossly 0.5 cm from the bronchial margin and abuts the pleural
surface in numerous areas. The interior edge utthe lung has a rally irregular appearance. An intralobar
ﬁssure is not appreciated grossly This tumor mass is 2 cm from the closest inferior edge The remaining
long has a we! soggy consolidated appearance, Representative sections are submitted. Section summary:

Microscopjg Description:

A Seclrnns oi the lobectomy show an invasive squamous cell carcinoma predominantly forming

angulated and irregular nests wrth enlarged nuctei and occasional prominent. nucleoli, There is mild
keratin formation with intorcellular bridges and punctnte necrosis The tumor is away from the bronchial
and vascular margin but does invade through the visceral pleura where there is dense fibrossis. Tumor is at
the inked outer margint No diagnostic lymphovascular or perineural invasion is; identified, The uninvolved
lung has minimal changes, “the rounded forms at the bronchial margin on the frozen section slide IS a
rounded aggregate of degenerate hyaline cartilage that has some squamoid leaiures.

B. Sections ot’the additional bronchial margin show benign bronchus and surrounding lung tissue
uninvolved by malignancy

(3~ Sections ofthe pulmonary ligament NQL specimen show a distorted fragment of lung tissue with a
nested well differentiated neoplastic process at one edge measuring 09 cm. The cells are uniformly small
with oval nuclei and even lightly speckled chromatin. No necrosis or mitotic activity is present. The lesion
is {it the distorted edge of the tissue. lmmunohistochemistry shows the lesion is positive for chromogranin
rind synaptophysirr The tumor is negative for pancytokeretin.

{3‘ Sections ofthe hilar NlOL lymph node show a single benign lymph node {Oil} with focal fibrosis. No
malignancy in identified.

E. Sections of the subcarrnal N7 lymph node show a single benign lymph node {0/1}. No malignancy is

identified.
