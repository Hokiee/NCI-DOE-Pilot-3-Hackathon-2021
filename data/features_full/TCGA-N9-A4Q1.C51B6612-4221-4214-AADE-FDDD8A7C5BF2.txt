COMMENT
The carcinomatous component of the malignant mixed mullerlan tumor is composed predominantly of high-grade endometrioid

carcinoma with sex cord-like differentiation and focal papillary serous carcinoma. The stromal component consists predominantly
of unclassified high-grade sarcoma with foci of cartilaginous differentiation.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) UTERUS, CERVIX, BlLATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES - A uterus (14.0 x 7.0 x 6.0 cm) with attached right fallopian tube (7.
cm in length and 0.5 to 1.0 cm in diameter), and right ovary (3.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm), left fallopian tube stump (0.5 cm in length and 0.2
cm in diameter). The left ovary is not identified.

 

A mass (110 x 6. 0 x 6. 0 cm) IS identiﬁed In the uterus involving anterior and left lateral wall of mid lower uterine segment
and upper endocervical canal. The main mass has the connection to a polypold mass, which is attached to the most superior pan
of the fundus. The mass is 1. 5 cm to the exocervix. The mass invades into the wall at endocervical canal and 0 3 cm from the
deep margin, invades into the lower uterine segment and 0 6 cm to the deep resection margin. At the mid uterine segment, the
mass involving 1.0 cm of the myometrium. The myometrial thickness is 2.0 cm. The endometrium between the mass is
unremarkable. Multiple lelomyomas (1.2 to 2.0 cm in diameter) is identified in the myometrium. The cut surface of those nodules
have no hemorrhage or necrosis.

The ovary and fallopian tube are unremarkable. A parovarian cyst (1.0 cm in diameter) is present.

Note: The surgeon indicated that only right side of tube and ovary were taken.
