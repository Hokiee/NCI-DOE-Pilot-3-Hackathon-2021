SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Clinical History/Diagnosis: Right renal cancer, IV C thrombus.
Source of Specimen(s):

A: Lymph Node, inter aorta caval

B: Thrombus

C: Right kidney

D: Lymph Node, retro caval

Gross Description:
Received in four parts.

Source of Tissue: 1. Labeled #1 ”internaortocaval lymph node”

Gross Description: The Specimen is received fresh and consists of a
reddish—tan ovoid rubbery nodule measuring 3 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm. Sections
show tan homogeneous cut surface consistent with metastatic disease.
Representative sections in 1A.

Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled #2 "thrombus"

Gross Description: The specimen is received fresh and consists of a few
fragments of tan to red friable tissue and some blood clot measuring
collectively 4 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm. It appears to be predominantly lesional
tissue. Representative sections in 2A.

Source of Tissue: 3. Labeled #3 "right kidney"

Gross Description: The specimen is received fresh and consists of a right
kidney weighing 640 gm and measuring 12 x 10 x 8 cm. A small amount of
attached perinephric fat is present measuring up to 2 cm from point of
attachment. No adrenal gland is found. At the hilum, a segment of ureter

is present measuring 8 x 0.4 cm and is unremarkable. Also at the hilum,

is a renal vein. The renal vein is markedly distended, ragged, and

grossly contains tan fiiable lesional tissue. There is also an

appreciable amount of subcapsular hemorrhage posteriorly. The specimen is
bivalved revealing a large white firm tumor measuring 8 x 6 x 6.7 cm. The
tumor infiltrates throughout the kidney and grossly comprises

 

approximately 80% of the left kidney. The calyceal system is grossly
involved by tumor and it comes to within 1 cm from the hilum. There is a
small amount of somewhat normal appearing kidney with the usual cortical
medullary rays. No additional lymph nodes are found. Photographs were
taken. Fresh tissue procured for cytogenetic studies.

Designation of Sections: 3A ureter and vascular margins, 3B additional
section of renal vein adjacent to margin, 3C tumor, 3D tumor in
relationship to hilum/ureter, 3E tumor in relationship to capsule, 3F

tumor in relationship to normal adjacent tissue and subcapsular
hemorrhage, 3G tumor in relationship to inferior calyx, 3H uninvolVed left
kidney, 3L3} perinephric fat

Source of Tissue: 4. Labeled #4 "retrocaval lymph node"

Gross Description: The specimen is received fresh and consists of an ovoid
reddish—tan rubbery nodule measuring 6.5 x 5.5 x 3.5 cm. Sections show
approximately 25% of the node to be necrotic. Elsewhere, tan cut surface
consistent with metastatic disease is present. Representative sections
submitted in 4A and 4B.

Final Diagnosis:

1. Lymph node, inter—aortocaval (excision):

Metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma.

2. Thrombus, site not specified gexcision):
Papillary renal cell carcinoma present.

The tumor measur s 8 9113.31. grea st diameter.
— Tumor invades into nal vein and extends to the renal vein margin of

resection.
— Tumor involves the lymphatics of the vascular margin.

— Negative ureteral margin.

~ Metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma.

Note: The tumor shows extensive lymphatic invasion.

CYTOGENETIC ANALYSIS REPORTS

KARYOTYPE:

karyotype with nonclonal abnormality: 46,XY[19]/38,X,~Y,?add(1)
(p13),del(3)(p11.2),-4,-4,—6,—7,del(9)(p22),+?l3,—14,-17,-18,-18,—19,—21,
add(21)(p11.2),~22,+3mar[1]

RESULTS:
The renal tumor sample was sent to a commercial laboratory for cytogenetic

analysis. The chromosomes from twenty metaphases were counted and
analyzed, and two of these metaphases were karyotyped by G—banding.
Nineteen cells had a modal chromosome number of 46, and the cells
appeared to have a normal karyotype. One nonclonal cell contained
nonrepetitive chromosomal changes that included a deletion in the short
arm -

of chromosome 3. This deletion has been reported in cases of nonpapillary
renal cell carcinoma. Partial analysis of additional metaphases failed to

detect other aberrant cells.
