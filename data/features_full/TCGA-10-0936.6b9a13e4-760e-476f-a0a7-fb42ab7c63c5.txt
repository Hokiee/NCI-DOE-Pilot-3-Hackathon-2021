GROSS DESCRIPTION

SECTION CODE: A1, A2, representative omentum for frozen section; A3—A5, represe ' entum

*FSIDX: HIGH-GRADE CARCINOMA CONSISTENT WITH MULLERIAN PRIMARY.

(B) RIGHT TUBE AND OVARY — A cystic ovary (10.0 x 7.0 x 4.5 cm) with attached fallopian tube (3.5 x 0.8 X 0.4 cm) and
periadnexal soft tissue (4.8 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm).

The ovarian cyst is filled with clear fluid and is lined by fleshy pink tumor. The ovarian surface has a focal, roughened
area, which may represent papillary excrescences (2.0 x 1.0 cm). The remaining ovarian surface is white and smooth. Tumor is
adjacent to the fallopian tube without gross evidence of invasion into the fallopian tube wall.

tNK CODE: Black — outer surface of ovary.

SECTION CODE: B1, B2, entire faliopian tube; B3ﬂesentative cyst wait with tumor (rough area on ovarian surface

(A) PORTION OF OMENTUM — A portion of omentum (9.5 x 8.5 x 3.5 cm) infiltrated by firm, white tumor. -

entirely in 89); 810, representative periadnexat soft tissue.
(C) LEFT TUBE AND OVARY - An ovary (7.5 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm an allopian tube (2.7 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm).

The ovary is nearly completely replaced by friable, tan tumor. The tumor is adjacent to the faiiopian tube without gross
evidence of invasion into the fallopian tube wall.

SECTION CODE: Ct, entire faiiopian tube; 02—08, representative ovarian tumor.-
(D) UTERUS AND CERVIX — A uterus (7.5 X 4.5 x 2.8 cm) and unremarkable cervix (3.3 x 2.9 cm).

The posterior serosa is roughened, suspicious for involvement by tumor. The endometrium (0.1 cm thick) is smooth and
unremarkable. The myometrium (1.7 cm thick) is unremarkable.

SECTION CODE: D1 osterior serosa; DZ, cervix, 12 o’clock; D3, cervix, 6 o'clock; D4, anterior endomycmetrium; D5,
posterior endomyometrium.
(E) UMBILICUS — An unoriented skin ellipse (6.8 x 2.8 x 2.5 cm) with a raised, subcutaneous, tan, friable, central nodule (1.1 x
1.0 x 1.0 cm).
