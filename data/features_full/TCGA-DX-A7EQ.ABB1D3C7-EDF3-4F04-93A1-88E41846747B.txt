**' Report Electronically signed Out '**
Gross Description:
Dear

Thank you for asking my opinion in this interesting and challenging case. I
agree entirely with your interpretation, that based on the morphologic
appearance and the submitted immunohistochemical stains, this popliteal mess
is most consistent with a monophasic synovial sarcoma. The lesion is
composed of a highly cellular proliferation of monomorphic spindle cells
separated by a delicate collagenous stroma. The reactivity for BMA and
focally for A21:AR# further support this diagnosis.

In spite of the classic morphologic and immunophenotypic appearance of the
lesion, the clinical presentation (patient' s age) is somewhat unusual for
this diagnosis. Thus, I have submitted the paraffin block for molecular

analysis for the presence of the SYT-Ssx fusion transcript, specific of
synovial sarcoma, and the results will be issued in a separate report.

Sincerely,

ABEOC into In. banning (a. thologist
