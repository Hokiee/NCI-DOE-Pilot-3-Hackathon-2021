Gross Description: Part of the stomach with part of the esophagus. in the cardia region there is a plate-
like tumor up to 7.5 cm in its diameter, with invasion into the perigastric fat. in the fatty tissue of the
greater and lesser curvature there are enlarged dense lymph nodes. In the omentum there are nodes (of
possible metastatic nature) up to 1 cm in their diameter. Separately collected two fragments of fatty
tissue without macroscopic special features. Surgical margins are free of macroscopic special features.

Microscopic Description: Adenocarcinoma of the stomach, 6-2, with invasion into the perigastric fatty
tissue. Tumor is spread to the esophageal wall under the squamous epithelium. Surgical margins are
free of tumor elements. Lymph nodes including separately collected ones demonstrate reactive
changes. Omentum is hyperemic.
