PART #2: RIGHT TOTAL THYROID & CENTRAL NECK
Dictated:

The specimen is received fresh labeled with the patient‘s name xxxx and is designated
right total thyroid and central neck. The specimen consists of a grossly recognizable total
thyroidectomy with a small amount of central ﬁbrofatty soft tissue weighing a total of
15.6 grams and measuring 6.5 x 5.1 x 1.8 cm. The specimen comes oriented with a long
black stitch designating per surgeon of right/thyroid tumor. This specimen leﬁ lobe is
noted to be 3.9 x 2.5 x 1.3 cm and the right lobe is noted to be 5.1 x 3.5 x 1.8 cm.
Prominent vasculature is noted over the right lobe. However, the specimen is intact and
the capsule is not excised. The anterior aspect of the specimen is inked orange. Posterior
aspect of the specimen is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned from right
superior pole to right inferior pole to reveal a 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm well circumscribed
brittle soft tan nodule located in the right middle to right inferior pole of the right lobe. A
portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue banking. The remaining right lobe is
submitted in its entirety in blocks A - H with nodules submitted in blocks D - H. The
isthmus is serially sectioned to reveal no masses or lesions. The leﬁ inferior lobe is
serially sectioned from inferior to superior to reveal tan homogeneous parenchyma. No
masses or lesions are identiﬁed. The remaining portion of the thyroid is submitted its
entirety. The associated ﬁbroadipose tissue as previously mentioned was extensively
sampled to reveal no possible lymph nodes. The associated soft tissue is submitted in its
entirety in block 0. The specimen is submitted in its entirety.
