CLINICAL HISTORY: .\
Malignant neoplasm, corpus uteri. Papillary serous endometrial carcinoma- per
surgeon.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Sigmoid nodule (AF1)". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 1.6 x
1.2 x 0.4 cm tan tissue fragment, which has been previously submitted for
frozen section as AFl and is submitted in block A1, with remaining tissue in
block A2.

B. "Pannus". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 5800 gram, 56.0 x 26.0
cm ellipse of brown—tan skin, which is excised to a depth of 5.0 cm. The skin
is remarkable for a 2.0 cm umbilicus measuring 1.0 cm from the closest skin
margin. The underlying adipose tissue demonstrates mild fibrosis and
hemorrhage. Upon sectioning, no masses or lesions are identified. A
representative section is submitted in A1. A 13.3 x 10.5 x 1.0 cm piece of
omentum accompanies this specimen in which no masses or lesions are noted.
Representative section is submitted in BZ.

C. "Left pelvic biopsy". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 0.6 x 0.4
x 0.3 cm tan tissue fragment, which is submitted entirely in C1.

D. "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries". Received fresh and placed in
formalin is a 234.5 gram, 11.0 x 8.0 x 5.4 cm uterus, which has been bivalved
.. to reveal a 10.0 x 7.5 x 1.5 cm exophytic, tan, soft mass arising from the

. anterior uterine fundus. The mass appears to extend into the lower uterine
segment and is 1.0 cm from the endocervical canal and 5.0 cm from the anterior
ectocervix. 0n sectioning the mass displays minimal invasion into the
myometrium grossly; a 2.0 cm portion of the exophytic mass appears to markedly
compress the myometrium (thickness 2.5 cm wall) on the anterior wall. The
anterior cervix is inked blue distal to the peritoneal reflection. Multiple
intramural leiomyomas ranging in size from 1.0 to 1.5 cm are noted.

A 3.0 x 2.5 x 0.7 cm white ovary and a tortuous 3.0 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm right
fallopian tube are grossly unremarkable. A 3.2 x 3.0 x 1.1 cm tan—white left
ovary and a 3.2 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm left fallopian tube are grossly unremarkable.

candidates are dissected and submitted in block 11.

1.0 x 0.2 cm aggregate of fibrofatty tissue with lymph node candidates, which
have been submitted entirely in block J1.

K. "Left ligament lymph node". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 2.4
x 1.6 cm fibrous, tan tissue fragment, which is bisected and submitted
entirely in blocks Kl—2.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
A. "sigmoid nodule":AF1- adenocarcinoma (Dr. ).

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: Hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy, biopsies,
omentectomy, lymph node dissections '

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 6th Edition): ple pNO le

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon‘s operative report.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. "SIGMOID NODULE" (BIOPSY):

METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA.

B. "PANNUS" (EXCISION):

BENIGN SKIN WITH UNDERLYING FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE.
NO TUMOR IS SEEN.

OMENTUM, NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
C. "LEFT PELVIS" (BIOPSY):
BENIGN FIBROVASCULAR TISSUE.

NO TUMOR IS SEEN.

’ D. "UTERUS, BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES" (HYSTERECTOMY AND BILATERAL
SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY):

POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE ENDOMETRIUM. \/////
HISTOLOGIC TYPE: NOT OTHERWISE SPECIFIED, SEE COMMENT.
FIGO GRADE: 3 OF 3.
TUMOR SIZE: 10 X 7.5 x 1.5 CM.
DEPTH OF INVASION: 0.1—0.2 CM, IN A 2.5 CM THICK MYOMETRIUM.
LYMPHATIC/VASCULAR INVASION: ABSENT.
ADJACENT NON-NEOPLASTIC ENDOMETRIUM: HYPERPLASTIC.
REMAINING MYOMETRIUM: LEIOMYOMATA (LARGEST 1 CM).
CERVIX: FREE OF TUMOR.
SEROSA: FREE or TUMOR.
SPECIMEN MARGINS: NOT INVOLVED

 

BILATERAL OVARIES AND FALLOPIAN TUBES: FREE OF TUMOR.

COMMENT: The tumor is unusually poorly differentiated and in most areas
consists of solid sheets of cells showing no particular differentiation. In a
few areas, there is a gland-like pattern suggesting an endometrioid pattern,
but the tumor is so poorly differentiated that definitive subtyping is not

possible. Dr. : indicates that an outside biopsy was interpreted as
having a serous component, but we do not have that material available for
review.

E. "VAGINAL CUFF" (BIOPSY):

ENDOMETRIOSIS. No TUMOR IS SEEN.

F. "LEFT PELVIC NODES" (DISSECTION):

ONE LYMPH NODE, NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY (O/l).

G. "LEFT COMMONS" (LYMPH NODE DISSECTION):

FIBROVASCULAR TISSUE, NO LYMPH NODE IDENTIFIED.
NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.

H. "RIGHT PELVIC NODES" (DISSECTION):

FIVE LYMPH NODES, NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY (0/5).

I. "RIGHT PARAAORTIC NODES" (DISSECTION):

FIVE LYMPH NODES, NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY (0/5).

J. "LEFT PARAAORTIC NODES" (DISSECTION):

TWO LYMPH NODES, NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY (0/2).

K. "LEFT INFUNDIBULAR PELVIC LIGAMENT" (BIOPSY):

.“ FIBROVASCULAR TISSUE, NO LYMPH NODES IDENTIFIED. NO EVIDENCE OF
MALIGNANCY.
SMALL FRAGMENT OF RESIDUAL OVARIAN TISSUE, NO TUMOR SEEN.

NOTE: This specimen was initially received with the site identified as "left
ligament lymph node" on both the container on the accompanying requisition.
Dr. ‘ ' Indicates this was incorrectly labelled, and the site is corrected

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).

ADDENDUM 1:

This addendum is issued to report the results of additional evaluation of the
left pelvic lymph node dissection (specimen F), at the request of Dr.
Multiple step sections are obtained from the paraffin block, with no
additional findings. All of the remaining tissue in the container is
submitted in its entirety in blocks F2—6. No additional lymph nodes are
identified upon microscopic examination of these additional sections. The
previous diagnoses are unchanged.

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).
