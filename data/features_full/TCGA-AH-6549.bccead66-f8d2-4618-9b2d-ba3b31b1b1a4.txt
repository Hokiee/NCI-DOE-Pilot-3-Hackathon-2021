COMMENTS:

The vast majority of the sample submitted consists of
invasive tumor. it is unclear what represents the exact
margins in many of the sampled areas. However, where the
margins can be cleariy identiﬁed, tumor is seen at one '
focus 0.1 cm from the inked radial margin and appears to be
within 0.2 cm of both the proximal and distal mucosa!
margins. However, since the majority of the specimen does
consist of tumor there is judged to be a significant risk

that tumor is present at one of the resection margins.
Clinical correlation is suggested.

GROSS DESCRlPTION: .,
The sneaimen is received in two containers tabeled

A. Additionaiiy labeled appendix and contains a partially
fragmented tan gray vermiform appendix that when
reconstructed is approximately 6.5 cm in tength and ranges
from 0.7 up to 1.5 cm in diameter. The serosa is pink tan
and shaggy and features a minimai amount of adherent yeiiow
tan mesoappendix. Sectioning reveals a pinpoint lumen with
no perforations or fecaliths. Representative sections are
submitted in cassette A labeled (proximal margin
notched).
B. Additionally labeled rectal mass and contains two tan
pink polypoid soft tissues, 5.5 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm and 2.5 x 1.5
x 1.0 cm. A cauterized margin is present on the largest
piece. This margin is inked and the pieces are sectioned
and entirely submitted in cassettes Bi—BtQ labeied

designated as follows: 1—- smaiiest piece, sectioned;
2—1 9-— largest piece to include inked margin in cassettes
B2—B‘l5. ’ ..
A yellow and green cassette are submitted for genomic
research each labeled
