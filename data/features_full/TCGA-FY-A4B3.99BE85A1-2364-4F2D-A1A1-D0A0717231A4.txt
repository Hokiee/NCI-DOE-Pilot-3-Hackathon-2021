(D) (thyroid and isthmus) Received fresh for

sampling is a total thyroidectomy.

Specimen components and dimensions: Right lobe is 4.6 x 3.2 x
1.8 cm, weighing 10.6 gm. Left lobe is 5.0 x 2.8 x 1.3 cm,
weighing 10.3 gm. The isthmus is 3.7 x 2.3 x 2.2 cm, weighing
7.2 gm.

inking Scheme: The specimen is inked as follows: right black,
left blue, isthmus red.

Size, appearance, and location of lumen Left lobe demonstrates
three nodules, the first measuring 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm, composed
of pale tan fibrous tissue. Second nodule is 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm
and is surrounded by a white calcified wail. Tumor itself is

pale friable material. Third nodule is 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm and

is ten to white. The isthmus is almost entirely replaced with

one tumor nodule measuring 2.1 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. it is composed
of tan-yellow friable material. There are areas of

calcification within the isthmus. Number of tumor nodules:

Right lobe demonstrates two nodules. The first nodule is white
tan, calcified and measures 1.1 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The second
nodule measures 0.9 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm, is tan-yellow with a white
fibrous wall encapsulating it and is calcified.

Capsular penetration: Tumors in the left, right lobe and

isthmus are abutting the capsule.

Uninvoived parenchyma: Uninvoived parenchyma is red-brown and
soft.

Blocks submitted:

01-06 - left lobe, submitted sequentially, from inferior to
superior pole; 03-04 are submitted following decalciflcation
D7-DQ - isthmus; 07-08 are submitted following decalciflcation
D10—Dt 5 — right lobe, submitted sequentially, from inferior to
superior pole; D10 and D12 are submitted following
decalcification

(E) (right central neck lymph node) Received in formalin is

one yellow and black fibroadlpose tissue measuring 1.5 x 0.9 x
0.4 cm. One potential lymph node. Specimen is submitted
entirely in E1.

immunohlstochemlstry testing is performed, the following

- antibodies and their respective clones may be used to determine
therapy for the patient: EFGR(31G7), ER(SP1), PR(1 E2),
Her2neu(4B5), CD117(Poiy), 0020(L26).
Unless otherwise stated in the report, all tissue tested for
ERPR by IHC, Her2 by. lHC and/or HER2 by FISH have been fixed as
per ANP.22998 for a minimum of 6 hours and a maximum of 48
hours.
ER, PR, Kl-67, p53 are reported as a semi-quantitative
percentage of positively stained nuclei. Her-Zlneu and EGFR are
scored as follows: No staining at all is scored as (0), weak,
incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of cells is
scored as (1+), less than strong but complete staining In any
proportion of cells or complete strong staining in less than 30%
of cells is scored as (2+). and strong complete staining in more
that 30% of cells is scored as (3+). All studies are performed
on tissue fixed in- 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in
paraffin unless otherwise stated in the report.
