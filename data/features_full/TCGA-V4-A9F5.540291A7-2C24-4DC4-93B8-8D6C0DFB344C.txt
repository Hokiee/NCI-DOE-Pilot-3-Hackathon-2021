Macroscopy:

The eyeball measures 26 mm in diameter and the posterior optic nerve segment 7
mm, associated with a fragment of adipose tissue of 5 mm. Presence of an extra-
scleral nodule measuring 6 mm. At the section, an endo-ocular tumor measuring
20x15 mm main lines is observed. Tumor specimens have been taken for
cryopreservation and genetic studies, then the piece has been ﬁxed and included
entirely according to 13 tissue blocs.

Microscopy

The tumor observed macroscopically presents the histological features of an uveal
melanoma. It is composed of a mix of epithelioid (90%) and fusiform (10%) cells, the
latter being predominant. These cells present a large nucleus with prominent
nucleolus. The cytoplasm is most often pigmented. Presence of mitotic features (up
to 10 mitoses per 10 HPF).

The tumor is developed at the posterior part of the ciliary body which is partially
invaded, without extension to the iris. The tumor invades the sclera and present an
extra-scleral nodule of 6 mm observed macroscopically.

The tumor is located at distance from the intra—ocular emergence of the optic nerve.
Thus the optic nerve on its entire course and the meningeal sheaths are free of
tumor. The cut end of the optic nerve is also free of tumor.

Conclusion:

Uveal melanoma composed mainly of fusiform cells.

Tumor size: 20 mm main line.

Focal extension to the ciliary body without infiltration of the iris.
Tumor inﬁltration of the sclera with an extrascleral nodule of 6 mm.

Optic nerve in its entire course and cut end, and meningeal sheaths free of tumor.
