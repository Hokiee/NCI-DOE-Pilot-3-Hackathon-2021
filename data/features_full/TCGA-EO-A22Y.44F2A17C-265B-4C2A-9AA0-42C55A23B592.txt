Gross Description

1. The specimen container is labeled with the patient's name and as "uterus hysterectomy BSO"
contains a uterus. cervix. bilateral ﬁmbriated fallopian tube and bilateral ovaries received in 10%
buffered formalin. The uterus measures 11.5 Sl x 8.5 ML x 6.5 cm AP and the cervix measures
2.9 cm. in diameter with a 0.8 cm slit like os. The right and left fimbriated fallopian tube measures
3.0 x 0.4 cm and 5.0 x 0.4 cm respectively. The right and left ovary measures 3.0 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm
and 2.4 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm respectively. The entire specimen weighs 365.3 9. On gross examination,
the external surface of the right and a fimbriated fallopian tube is brown-tan in color, and has
presence of small paratubal cysts ranging in size from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 to 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm filled
clear ﬂuid. The external surface of the right and left ovary is tan in color, smooth and grossly
unremarkable. On sectioning, the cut surface is tan in color, solid and ﬁrm except for a small
cystic lesion identiﬁed on the cut surface of the left ovary measuring 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm filled with
clear ﬂuid. Most of the anterior and posterior uterine serosa is tan in color, smooth and grossly
unremarkable except for a large well-circumscribed nodule present on the anterior uterine serosa
measuring 4.5 x 4.3 x 3.9 cm. The cut surface of the nodule is white-tan in color, solid, firm and
has a whorled appearance. On sectioning, a polypoid tumor is identified on the anterior and
posterior endometrium measuring 3.9 SI x 6.5 ML x 3.8 cm AP. The cut surface of the tumor is
white-tan in color, centrally soft and friable with the peripheral aspect firm and solid. Focal areas
of hemorrhages are also noted. The tumor appears to invade through the myometrium with the
myometrium measuring 0.6 cm in thickness. The rest of the myometrium has a trabeculated
appearance. Multiple well-circumscribed nodules are also identified on both the anterior and
posterior myometrium ranging in size from 1.6 x 1.5 x 1.8 cm to 2.8 x 2.5 x 2.2 cm. The cut
surface of the nodule is white-tan in color, solid and ﬁrm with a whorled appearance.

Both the anterior and posterior endocervix is tan in color and grossly unremarkable. Multiple
pinpoint hemorrhages are noted on both the anterior and posterior exocervix.
