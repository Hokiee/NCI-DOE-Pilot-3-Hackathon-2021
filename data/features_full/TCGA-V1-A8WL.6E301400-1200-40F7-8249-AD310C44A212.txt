COMMENT:

 

Synoptic Comment for Prostate Tumors

- Type of tumor: Small acinar adenocarcinoma.

- Location of tumor: Left posterior apex, slide 19; left posterior midgland, slide 110; left posterior
base, slides 111 and 118; left anterior apex, slide 112; left anterior midgland, slide 113; left
anterior base, slide 114; right posterior apex, slides 11 and 16; right posterior midgland, slide 17;
right posterior base, slides 18 and 117; right anterior apex, slide 13; right anterior midgland, slide
I4; right anterior base, slide 15.

- Estimated volume of tumor: 7 cc.

- Gleason score: 3+4; primary pattern 3, secondary pattern 4.

- Estimated volume > Gleason pattern 3: 10-15%.

- Involvement of capsule: Tumor invades capsule (right anterior midgland, slide 14; left anterior
midgland, slide 113; left anterior base, slide 114).

- Extraprostatic extension: Present, limited in extent (right anterior midgland, slide 14; right
posterior midgland, slide 117).

- Margin status for tumor:

- Negative.

- The status of the edges of the main specimen (Part1) are reported above. Additional parts
(Parts A-E) are submitted by the surgeon and identiﬁed as margins. None of the
additional parts submitted as margins contain tumor; however, evaluation of the true
surgical margin requires clinical correlation.

- Margin status for benign prostate glands:

- Benign glands not present at inked excision margins.

- High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasla (HGPIN): Present focally.

- Tumor involvement of seminal vesicle: None.

- Perineural infiltration: Present.

- Lymph node status:

- Negative; total number of nodes examined: 4 (Parts G and H).

- AJCC/UICC stage: pT3aNOMX.

Select slides (slides 14, 113, 117) were shown at the departmental Consultation Conference on
and the faculty in attendance concurred with the above diagnosis.

Clinical History

The patient is a man with prostate cancer. Review of the electronic medical records
, reveals a history of elevated PSA levels that ranoe her-""- ‘ l 5. The patient
underwent an ultrasound-guided needle core biopsy of the prostate revealing prostatlc

adenocarclnoma, Gleason grade 3+3 = 6 to 3+4 = 7, noted bilaterally. The patient now undergoes a
robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.

Gross Description

The specimen is received in nine parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record
number. Parts A-E and Part I are received fresh. Parts F~H are received in formalin.

Part A, labeled ”right posterior lateral base margin," consists of a single soft irregular piece of red tissue

(0.8 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm). The entire s“ man Is frozen for frozen section diagnosis 1, and subsequently
submitted in cassette A1.

Part B, labeled "left anterior apex margin,” consists of a single, soft, irregular piece of pink-red
cauterized tissue (0.5 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm). The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section diagnosis 2, and
subsequently submitted in cassette BI.

Part C, labeled “left anterior apex margin #2,“ consists of a single soft Irregular piece of red cauterlzed
tissue (0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm). The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section diagnosis 3, and
subsequently submitted in cassette C1. °

Part D, labeled "right anterior apex margin," consists of a single, soft, irregular piece of red cauterized
tissue (0.5 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm). The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section diagnosis 4, and
subsequently submitted in cassette Dl.

Part E, labeled "left posterior apex margin," consists of a single, soft, irregular piece of red cauterized
tissue (0.5 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm). The entire specie-1n is frozen for frozen section diagnosis 5, and
subsequently submitted in cassette E1.

Part F, additionally labeled "pre-prostatic fat," consists of multiple, small, soft, yellow-tan, unoriented
ﬁbrofatty tissue fragments (3 x 2.2 x 0.4 cm in aggregate). Examination reveals no lymph node
candidates. The entire fibrofatty remnant is submitted in cassette F1. ’ ‘

Part G, additionally labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes,“ consists of a single, soft, yellow-tan, rubbery
ﬂbrofatty tissue fragment (6.5 x 2 x 1 cm). Careful examination reveals a single, soft, rubbery, 4 cm
lymph node candidate. The entire specimen is submitted as fdllows:

Cassettes 61-62: One lymph node candidate.

Cassette G3: Entire fibrofatty remnant.

Part H, additionally labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes,“ consists of multiple, small, soft, yellow-tan,
flbrofatty tissue fragments (4.3 x 3 x 1 cm in aggregate). Careful examination reveals three, small,

soft, off-white to yellow-tan lymph node candidates (0.2-2.5 cm). The entire specimen is submitted as
follows:

Cassette H1: One lymph node candidate, bisected.
Cassette H2: Two lymph node candidates, intact.
Cassette H3: Entire fibrofatty remnant.

Part I is labeled "prostate and seminal vesicles," and consists of a single, intact radical prostatectomy
specimen with attached seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundles (50.5 gm ; 4.2 cm from apex to base x 5
cm In width x 4 cm from anterior to posterior).

GROSS PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: No gross nodules or masses are identiﬁed. Cut sections reveal

extensively mottled prostatic parenchyma ranging from pink-tan to light brown, making gross
evaluation exceedingly difficult.

 

 

The exterior capsule is intact. The seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundles (right 5 x 2 x 0.5 cm; left 4 x

2.5 x 1 cm) are soft, red-tan, and whorled, and demonstrate no masses or tumor involvement on cut
section.

ORIENTED BY: Anatomic landmarks.

INKING: Right anterior in green, left anterior in blue, posterior in black.

POTENTIAL STUDIES: Fresh tissue is harvested for research purposes prior to ﬁxation.
GROSS PHOTOGRAPHS: Yes; cut sections.
