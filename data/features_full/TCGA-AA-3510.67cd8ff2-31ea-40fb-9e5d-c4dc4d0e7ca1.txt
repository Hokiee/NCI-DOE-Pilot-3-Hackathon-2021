*** Diagnosis/Diagnoses: ***

Right hemicolectomy specimen with an ulcerated colon carcinoma of the histological type of a
moderately differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma, measuring 6.5 cm in its largest diameter,
localized 10 cm aborally from the ileocolic valve and almost encircling the intestinal wall.
Invasive tumor spread into all intestinal wall layers as far as the adjacent fat tissue and to the
level of the subserosa.

Oral and aboral resection margins, greater omentum and appendix tumor-free. Appendix with
evidently postinï¬‚ammatory parietal fibrosis.

Tumor stage therefore: pT3, R0; G2

A follow-up report will be made on the lymph node status after special preservation and
preparation.

*** Follow-up report: ***

Forty-four lymph nodes of up to 1.2 cm in size in the vicinity of the tumor were dissected out
from the pericolic fatty tissue after clarification with acetone.

Microscopically these were all tumor-free.

In conclusion or in summary, therefore, a stage of pT3 pNO (0/44) L0 V0 R0 is established.
