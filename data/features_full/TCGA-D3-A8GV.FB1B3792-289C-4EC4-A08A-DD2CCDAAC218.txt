GROSS DESCRIPTION

’A) ADDITIONAL SUPERIOR MARGIN, STITCH AT TRUE MARGIN- A 4. 5 x 2. 5 x 2. 0 cm yellow-tan ﬁbrofatty tissue fragment.
The true margin is indicated by the suture and Is inked blue. The en face margin is submitted In A1 and A2, and representative
section is submitted in A3. B/L-rss— MW — Fri/MM Wﬁ“ 5km it alt. 8m
(B) SPECIMEN RE-EXCISION METASTATIC MELANOMA RIGHT BACK- A 6.0 x 2.3 cm light-tan skin ellipse excised to the
depth of 7.0 cm (9.5 x 7.0 x 2.0 cm yellow-tan fibrofatty subcutaneous tissue). The skin surface is unremarkable except for a 0.5
cm area of nodularity towards the lateral aspect 2.0 cm from the tip and 1.1 cm from the superior and inferior margins. No
pigmented lesions are identiﬁed on the skin surface. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a large 2.5 x 1.6 x 1.4 cm
circumscribed, Iobulated dark brown nodule involving the dermis and superﬁcial subcutaneous tissue is less than 1.0 mm from the
superior inked margin and 4.0 mm from the inferior inked margin and 70.0 mm from the deep margin. Multiple satellite nodules
measuring 5.0 to 3.0 mm in greatest dimension are present at the periphery of the main tumor nodule with the deepest nodule
30.0 mm from the deep resection margin.
Please note the majority of the tumor is submitted for

INK CODE: Blue — Superior half; Yellow — Inferior half.

SECTION CODE: B1, lateral tip; BZ, medial tip; B3-B4, largest nodule with superior and inferior margins; B5, en face
deep margin; 36, deepest satellite nodule in the skeletal muscle; B7-BB, satellite nodules close to the largest nodule; BQ,
representative section of skin with tumor; B10, representative sections of normal skin on lateral and medial aspects of the tumor.

IC) ADDITIONAL INFERIOR DEEP MARGIN, STITCH TRUE MARGIN - A 1.8 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm red-tan skeletal muscle tissue
fragment. Suture indicates true margin, which is inked blue and serially sectioned perpendicular to the margin and entirely
submitted in C.
