CLINICAL HISTORY: Per prior biopsy adenocarcinoma in the pancreas.
OPERATION: Pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS: Pancreatic mass

GROSS DESCRIPTION: Two specimens are received labeled with the
patient's name and medical record number.

The first specimen labeled “gallbladder" is received in formalin and
consists of a single piece of tan, soft tissue measuring 8.1 x 3.0 x
2.2 cm representing a gallbladder. Grossly, a 1.8 cm greatest
dimension green gallstone is identified. Representative sections
are submitted in cassette Al.

The second specimen labeled "Whipple specimen" is received fresh
from the OR and consists of a piece of Small bowel with attached
pancreas measuring 32 x 7 x 5 cm. The uncinate margin is inked in
blue, the vascular growth is inked in black and the pancreatic
resection margin is inked in green. The common bile duct and
pancreatic duct are probed. The specimen is incised on the anterior
aspect and a palpable firm, tan, well circumscribed mass is revealed
measuring 4.1 x 3.5 x 3.1 cm. Sections are submitted as follows: Bl
distal duodenal margin, 82 proximal duodenal margin, B3 bile duct
margin, 84—5 pancreatic resection margin, amputated and submitted on
edge, 36-7 uncinate margin, amputated and submitted on edge, BB full
cross section of tumor from green ink to the duodenum, 89
cross—section of tumor to black ink, Blo tumor surrounding common
bile duct to black ink, Bll representative section of tumor, BIZ

normal appearing pancreas, 813-21 peripancreatic fat for lymph
nodes.

COMMENT: Histological sections show pancreatic adenocarcinoma
centered around the pancreatic duct. Sections of the residual
pancreatic parenchyma show fat necrosis and chronic pancreatitis.
