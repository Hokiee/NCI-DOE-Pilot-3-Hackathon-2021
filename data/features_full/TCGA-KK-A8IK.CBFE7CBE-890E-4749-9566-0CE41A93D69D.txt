‘ DIAGNOSIS

(E) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 9 (4+5). (SEE COMMENT)
TUMOR CONFINED TO THE PROSTATE.
MARGINS OF RESECTION FREE OF TUMOR. RECUTS PENDING.
PROSTATIC lNTRAEPITHELlAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH-GRADE.
Right and left seminal vesicles, no tumor present.
Segments of right and left vasa deferentia, no tumor present.

COMMENT

The prostate gland contains four separate foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, two in the peripheral zone and two in the transition
zone. The dominant tumor focus is located in the left lateral , left posterolateral and left posterior peripheral zone. This tumor
focus measures 1.8 x 1.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in two cross sections and focally in the apex
and base regions. The second tumor focus is located in the right posterolateral peripheral zone, exclusively in the base region. .
This tumor focus measures 0.8 x 0.4 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in three base sections. The third
tumor focus is located in the right transition zone. This tumor focus measures 0.4 x 0.1 cm in the largest cross-sectional
dimension and it is present in two cross sections and focally in the apical region. The fourth tumor focus is located in the left
transition zone. This tumor focus measures 0.4 x 0.1 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in two cross
sections and focally in the apical region. All tumor feel are conﬁned to the prostate. The margins of resection are free of tumor.

GROSS; DESCRIPTION

(E) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES — A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (4.5 x 3.5 x 3.8 cm, 34 grams, post ﬁxation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
left posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears slightly more abundant than along the right side. A tumor is palpated on the left
base region. Serial cross sections after ﬁxation demonstrate a ﬁrm area consistent with tumor in the left peripheral zone of the two
cross sections of the prostate.

The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

SECTION CODE: E1 -E3, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; E4-E6,
left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; E7, prostatic base, right border; E8-E1 1,
prostatic base, right posterior border; E12-E17, prostatic base. central portion; E18. prostatic base, left border; E19—E21,
prostatic base, left posterior border; E22-E24, apex anterior; E25, E26, apex left; E27-E29, apex posterior; E30, E31, apex right;
E32-E39, sections of the two cross sections of the prostate according to the specimen radiograph.

Specimen Date Time:

The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in
black. Blue ink (E18, E20 and E21) denotes surfaces that do not represent the true margin of resection including anterior apex
(inked by surgeon) and left base in an area which does not represent the true margin.
