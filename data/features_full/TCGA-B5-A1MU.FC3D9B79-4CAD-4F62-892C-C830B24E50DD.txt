GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Left tube and ovary", received fresh for frozen section is a 9.3 gram, 6 x
4 x 2 cm salpingo—oophorectomy specimen consisting of an ovary (2.5 x 1.1 x
0.9 cm), fallopian tube (4 cm long, 0.5 cm diameter) and mesentery. The
mesentery is remarkable for numerous lymph node candidates (up to 1.2 cm in
greatest dimension) and numerous soft, tan nodules, the largest of which is
0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm and frozen as AFl. The frozen section remnant is submitted
in block Al. The fallopian tube discloses the specimen is remarkable four
paratubal cysts ranging from 0.1 cm to 0.8 cm diameter. The ovary is grossly
unremarkable.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

 

Al- AFl remnant

A2— one lymph node candidate, largest, bisected
A3- two lymph node candidates

A4- fallopian tube and paratubal cyst

A5— ovary

B. "Right tube and ovary", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 6.3
gram, 4.5 x 3.7 x 1.5 cm right salpingo—oophorectomy specimen consisting of
and ovary (2.6 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm), fallopian tube (3.7 cm long, 0.6 cm diameter)
and mesentery. The distal fallopian tube demonstrates a 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm
yellow—tan, firm nodule and numerous paratubal cysts ranging from 0.1 cm to
0.4 cm diameter. The ovary surface demonstrates two simple, serous cysts and
a grossly unremarkable cut surface. Representative sections of the ovary are
submitted in block B2.

C. "Uterus and cervix", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 22.9 gram,
6.5 x 4 x 2 cm unorientable hysterectomy specimen. The serosa is white—tan
with focal areas of retraction. The specimen is opened to demonstrate a 4.5 x
3.5 cm endometrial cavity containing an exophytic 5 X 3 x 1 cm white—tan
endometrial mass which upon sectioning grossly extends to and abuts the
aforementioned areas of serosal retraction. Grossly, the endocervical canal
and ectocervix are not involved. In areas grossly free of tumor, a 0.1 cm
endocervix overlies a 1 cm thick myometrium. Representative sections are
submitted as follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Cl— cervix and lower uterine segment

C2-4 mass with respect to endomyometrium and serosa, full thickness,
bisected

C5- cervix and lower uterine segment, other side, bisected

C6—8 mass with respect to endomyometrium and serosa, other side, full
thickness, bisected

D. "Right pelvic peritoneum", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 5.5 x
3 x 0.6 cm fragment of soft fibromembranous tissue remarkable for numerous
indurated nodules up to 0.2 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections
are submitted in blocks 01-2.

E. "Omentum", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 5.5 x 5 x 1.2 cm
aggregate of yellow-tan fibromembranous adipose tissue which is grossly
unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted in blocks 81—2.

F. "Left pelvic peritoneum", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 4.5 x
4 x 0.5 cm fragment of fibromembranous tissue demonstrating numerous indurated
nodules up to 0.3 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections submitted
in blocks Fl—Z.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
A. "Left tube and ovary":AF1-carcinoma present (Dr. ).

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: HYSTERECTOMY, BILATERAL SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY, STAGING BIOPSIES

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 6th Edition): pT3a pNX pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. "LEFT TUBE AND OVARY" (SALPINGO’OOPHORECTOMY):

PERIADNEXAL SOFT TISSUE: METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA.
LEFT TUBE: NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
LEFT OVARY: NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.

B. "RIGHT TUBE AND OVARY" (SALPINGO-OOPHERECTOMY):

RIGHT TUBE: METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA ON SEROSAL ASPECT.
RIGHT OVARY: NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.

C. "UTERUS AND CERVIX" (HYSTERECTOMY):

ENDOMETRIUM:
Tumor subsite: ENDOMETRIUM
Histologic type: SEROUS ADENOCARCINOMA, SEE COMMENT O
FIGO Grade: GRADE 3
Size: 5 x 3 x 1 CM
Vascular invasion: PRESENT
Adjacent endometrium: BENIGN, NEGATIVE FOR EIN
MYOMETRIUM:
Depth of invasion: 1 CM, IN A 1 CM THICK WALL
CERVIX:
Tumor extension: CARCINOMA PRESENT AT JUNCTION OF LOWER
UTERINE SEGMENT AND ENDOCERVIX, SEE COMMENT
PARAMETRIUM/SEROSA:
Tumor extension: POSITIVE (TUMOR PRESENT ON SEROSAL SURFACE)

D. "RIGHT PELVIC PERITONEUM" (BIOPSY):
METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA.
E. "OMENTUM" (EXCISION):

NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.

F. "LEFT PELVIC PERITONEUM" (BIOPSY):

METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA.

COMMENT: Dr. 7 has reviewed portions of this case. The adenocarcinoma

immediately at the junction of the lower uterine segment and cervix. Although,
technically this tumor is not invasive into cervix, this lesion may behave as
if the cervix is involved. As with the prior biopsy, there are focal areas
consistent with endometrioid adenocarcinoma, but the predominant pattern is
that of serous adenocarcinoma.

Immunoperoxidase stains for cytokeratin on part E are negative, helping to
rule out metastatic carcinoma in this site.

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).
