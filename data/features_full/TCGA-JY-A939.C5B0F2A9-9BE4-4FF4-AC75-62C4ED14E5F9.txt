Comment

8. The tumor involves both proximal stomach and distal esophagus. with the bulk of the tumor located in gastric cardia.
The gastric portion of the tumor extends for about 5 cm from the GE junction and is mainly intramucosal. There is focal
submucosal invasion in stomach as well as in esophagus. The junction of tumor with the esophagus shows some residual
benign glands with goblet cells. in keeping with a segment of Barrett‘s esophagus. In view of the 5 cm distance of the
gastric part of the tumor from the GE junction and the presence of intestinal metaplasia at the junction with the
esophagus, the tumor is classiﬁed as an adenocarcinoma of distal esophagus. The tumor features areas of gland
formation as well as sheets of cells with rare gland like lumina. There is prominent intra and peritumoral lymphocytic
inﬁltrate. lmmunohistochemical staining shows patchy positive labeling with 0K7, CKZO and CDX2. The tumor is negative
for chromogranin and synaptophysin.

There are a total of 48 lymph nodes identiﬁed including all specimens. There is one perigastric lymph node identiﬁed in
the resection specimen (#8) with metastatic adenocarcinoma. All other lymph nodes and margins are negative for
carcmoma.
