ADDENDUM #2:

EGFR Mutation Analysis

Referring Physician:
Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma

RESULTS: No mutation detected.

INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identiﬁed in the sample provided

for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma
patients without identiﬁable mutations are reported to be
responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.

COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 90% tumor

cellularity upon pathologist review.

A frequently occurring sequence change 2361>GA (Q787Q) was
identiﬁed. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
signiﬁcance.

Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with
differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among
patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.

This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell

lung carcinoma (N SCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change
during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this
result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation

in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.

This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical signiﬁcance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.

METHOD:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantiﬁed
and ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

DISCLAIMER:
This test was developed and its performance characteristics
determined by The laboratory is

regulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of

testing. This particular test is not considered a stand alone test

clinical work-up related to treatment decisions.

ADDENDUM 3:
Integrated Oncology

MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY
KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS

Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: Wild type gene.

INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identiﬁed at codons 12 and 13 of
the KRAS gene.

COMMENT:
Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor

prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (N SCLC). KRAS
mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly
associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.

This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of

the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for
use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in ﬂesh,
frozen, or formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn embedded tissue. In particular

the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal
cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these
mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor
KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,
etc.).

Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene ampliﬁcation status may provide
additional information regarding this patient's probability of
response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if

clinically indicated. See references.

METHOD/LIMITATION:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantiﬁed
and ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

ADDENDUM 4:

Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH)

Referring Physician
Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma.

INTERPRETATION:
Negative for a rearrangement involving the ALK gene.

Probe #Nuclei Examined % Positive Nuclei %
Control values ,

2p23(ALK)V 50 0 <15.0

A total of 50 cells were scored.

FINDINGS: FISH was performed on parafﬁn embedded tissue sections
using dual color break-apart probe ( , to the ALK

gene at 2p23. This probe ﬂanks the entire gene. If a rearrangement
involving ALK is present, inversion or translocation, one of the two
probe signals separates as one red (orange) and one green signal. In
this specimen, separated signals were present in 0.5% of the nuclei
scored. Based on laboratory validation data, these results are

within the normal limits.

COMMENTS: Three copies of ALK were observed in 32.0% of cells. This
gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals represents an

aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosomes 2/2p ALK

region. Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in NSCLCs,
although the signiﬁcance of extra copies of the ALK gene in lung
carcinoma is unclear at this time (Salido M. et al. J Thorac Oncol.
2011;6:21-27)

ISCN RESULTS: nuc ish(ALKx3 4)[38/50]

This Vysis ALK Break Apart Probe FISH test t , is FDA
approved for use in the detection of rearrangements involving the

ALK gene via ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in
formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) tissue specimens.
