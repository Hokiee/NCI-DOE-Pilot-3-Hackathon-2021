CLINICAL HISTORY
Right frontal tumor

OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
Operation/Specimen: A: Brain tumor, biopsy

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:

A. Brain, right frontal tumor, excision biopsy: Oligodendroglioma,
W80 Grade

11 (see comment}.

COMMENT
Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of lOWngade

oligodendroglioma. The tumor shows focal moderately dense cellularity

however

mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation and necrosis are not
seen.

Cerebral cortex calcospherites are noted.

Results of ancillary studies will be reported below in procedure
addenda.

 

 

 

 

 

 

PROCEDURES/ADDENDA

MGMT Promoter Meth lation
Date Ordered: * Date Reported:

Interpretation

 

NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected.

Results—Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block

 

a slide was examined and no microdissection was
needed

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT
promoter
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents.

Assessment of
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA

followed
by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and

unmethylated DNA
sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by

serial
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and

was
assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated

DNA. '
Factors such as the presence of >50% nonwneoplastic cells in the

sample, or
extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated

MGMT
promoter sequences.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results

from a
stand alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its

performance
characteristics determined by the—laboratory as

required by CLIA '88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved

for
specific uses by the 0.8. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA

has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These

results are

provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted
only in

the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.

 
      

Loss of Heterozygosity 1p, 19g Assay (LOH)

Date Ordered: Date Reported: _
Interpretation

POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1p is detected.
Changes suggestive of partial deletion of chromosome arm 19q (D198219,
DlBS6OG—deleted; PLAZGéC—not deleted)

Informative loci are: DlSSSZ, Dlsl6l2, D198219, 3198606, PLA2G4C

Results—Comments

Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block
DNA extracted from a corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal

reference control.

 

H slide was examined and no microdissection was
needed

TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3
markers

on 1p are D13548, D181592, and 018552 (with D18468, D181612, and
D18496 as

backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19g are D198219, D193412, and
PLAZGdC '
(with Dl9S606 and DlBSllSZ as backup). All markers are microsatellites
(2 or 4

nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat)
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score,
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used
if the

first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or
otherwise

ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas
with 1p

and 19g deletion.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results
from a

stand—alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its
performance

characteristics determined by th_ laboratory as
required by CLIA ‘ 88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved
for

specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA
has

determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are

provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted
only in

the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.

TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non~neoplastic cells in

the sample
ma reclude the detection of allelic loss.

   
 

   

IDHl/IDH2 Mutation Detection Assay

Date Ordered: Date Reported: —
Interpretation

The R132H IDHl mutation was detected by monoclonal antibody and

confirmed by
PCR. These tests are currently experimental in this laboratory.

Results—Comments
IDHl mutation was tested by immunostaining and molecular analysis.
