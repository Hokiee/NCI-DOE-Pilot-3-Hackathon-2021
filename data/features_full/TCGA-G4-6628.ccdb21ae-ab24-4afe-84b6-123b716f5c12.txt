GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. TERMINAL ILEUM RIGHT COLON
Received fresh labeled as "terminal ileum right colon" is a 28cm in length right colon and terminal ileum.
The specimen is opened to reveal a tumor mass at the cecum measuring 4.5x3.2x1.0cm. The mass is
sessile/ polypoid and raised. The mass is 1.5cm from the cecal valve and is 9 cm from the closest
surgical resection margin. The serosa is inked blue corresponding to the lesion. The mass is sectioned
and does not appear to go through the mucosa. There are two other tan polypoid lesions noted on the
mucosal surface measuring 0.9 and 1.3 cm. in greatest dimension. There is an attached appendix
measuring 10x1 cm. The appendix is serially sectioned and reveals fecal material in the tip.
Representative sections are submitted in 12 cassettes as follows:

A1 -A2: margins

A3-A5: tumor

A6: 2 presumed polyps

A7-A8: representative sections of normal bowel

A9: appendix with the proximal portion notched

A10: 7 lymph nodes

A11: 6 lymph nodes in toto

A12: 3 lymph nodes in toto, 1 bisected lymph node
A13: representative section of ileocecal valve
A14-A16: other sections of tumor mass

90% of the tumor is submitted.
