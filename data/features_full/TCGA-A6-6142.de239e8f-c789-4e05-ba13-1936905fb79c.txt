SPECIMEN
A. Liver lesion
B. Paraaortic lymph node
C. Rectosigmoid colon

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

CLINICAL NOTES
CLINICAL HISTORY: Sigmoid colon cancer.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS
A , left lobe, excision: Metastatic adenocarcinoma. -

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section
labeled "A. Left liver lesion" and consists of a tan 0.8 x
0.3 x 0. rubbery tissue, entirely frozen as frozen
section
in formalin labeled "paraaortic lymph node" is
a 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm. rubbery tan pink tissue in keeping
with lym de which is quadrisected and entirely submitted in one
block.
. Received fresh for tissue for permanent labeled
"rectosigmoid colon" is a previously unopened, 22 cm.
segment of distal colon, surfaced by smooth glistening tan—pink
serosa and scabrous adventitia, with an abundant amount of attached
mesocolon. The specimen is oriented by anatomic landmarks and both
proximal and distal margins average 8.5 cm. in circumference. On
opening, there is a circumferential, 7.8 x 4.6 cm. centrally
necrotic rubbery, tan-red tumor mass, with raised rolled edges
located 5.5 cm. from the distal margin. A portion of tumor and a
portion of normal mucosa are submitted for tissue procurement as
requested. On sectioning, the tumor extends into the muscularis to
within 0.2 cm. of the inked free radial serosal surface (see blocks
#3 and 4). The tumor is greater than 5 cm. from the adventitial
resection margins (represented in block #2). The mucosa throughout
the remainder of the specimen is focally tattooed tan-pink to
gray—black, with regular folds in the wall averages 6.0 cm. in
thickness. No additional mass lesion or abnormality is identified
grossly. soft to slightly rubbery tan-pink to gray-black
tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 1.2 cm. are
recovered from the attached mesocolon. R r entative sections are
submitted in fifteen blocks as labeled.

BLOCK SUMMARY: #1 — Proximal and distal margins (proximal inked
blue); 2 - adventitial surface adjacent to tumor (inked green); 3-5
— tumor full thickness to inked free radial serosal surface; 6 -
tumor to normal mucosa; 7 - random from remainder of specimen; 8—ll
— nine (9) whole lymph nodes assette; l2-l5 - one bisected
lymph node per cassette. -s

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
A, B, C. Microscopic examination of the rectosigmoid

resection, as well as the liver lesion and para-aortic
lymph node biopsy reveals -

Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma

Histologic grade: Moderately to poorly differentiated

Primary tumor (pT): Tumor invades through muscularis propria into
subserosa (pT3)

Proximal margin: Negative for tumor

Distal margin: Negative for tumor

Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative for tumor

Distance of tumor from closest margin: 5.5 cm from the distal

margin and greater than 5 cm from adventitial/radial margin

Vascular invasion: Lymphatic space invasion is identified and is

prominent in blocks C4 and C5. No large vessel invasion is
identified.

Regional lymph nodes (pN): Metastatic adenocarcinoma is identified
in l of 37 lymph nodes and measures 2 mm in greatest dimension in
slide Cl5. (lea).

Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: Not identified.

Distant metastasis (pM): In liver biopsy in specimen A (lea).

Other findings: The para—aortic lymph node is negative for

malignancy in specimen B. The background colonic mucosa appears
unremarkable.

4xl, l4xl, 3x1, 5x1

DIAGNOSIS

A. Liver lesion, incisional biopsy:
Metastatic adenocarcinoma of colonic type consistent with
origin from rectosigmoid tumor.

B. Para—aortic lymph node, excisional biopsy:
Single lymph node negative for metastatic tumor (0/l).

C. Colon, rectosigmoid, segmental resection:
Adenocarcinoma, moderately to poorly differentiated, invasive
through muscularis propria into subserosal tissue (pT3)
Metastatic adenocarcinoma present in l of 37 lymph nodes
(lea).
Lymphatic space invasion present.
Resection margins are negative for tumor.
