Source of Specimen:

Prostateciomy

Clinical Historleperattve Dx:
Prostate cancer.

Gross Description:

The specimen is labeled prostate and Is received without fixative. it consists of a prostatectomy specimen
which weighs 62 grams. The prostate gland measures 5.2 x 3.2 x 8.5 cm and Includes a 4 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm
right seminal vesicleI a 2 cm segment of right vas deierens, a 1.7 cm segment of left vas deferens, and a
3.8 x 1.5 x 1 cm left seminal vesicle. The right anterior surface of the prostate is inked blue, the left
anterior surface Is inked green, and the posterior surface is inked black. The prostatic apex, bladder neck,
and seminal vsslclssivasa are trimmed. The prostate is serially sectioned from apex to bladder neck. The
prostatlc gland parenchyma shows bright yellow discoloration in the apical portion of the right prostate
and bright yellow discoloration extends throughout most of the postericrgiand bilaterally. There is

bulging yellow nodularity in the periurethral region. Representative prostatic tissue ls obtained for
research purposes. Also in the specimen container are three additional tubular portions of plnl<~tan tissue
suggestive of portions of vase Varying from 0.5—2.5 cm In length and up to 0.7 cm in diameter.
Representative sections are submitted. Section summary: Ai-A2) apical margin right prostate, A3-A4)
apical margin left prostate, A5) right bladder neck. A6) left bladder neck, A?) surgical margin right vas
deferens, right seminal vesicle, A8) surgical margin left vas deferens, left seminal vesicle, A9-A22)
prostate, apex-bladder neck, A23) separate tissue.

Microscopic Description:
Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic findings are reflected in the diagnosis
rendered.
