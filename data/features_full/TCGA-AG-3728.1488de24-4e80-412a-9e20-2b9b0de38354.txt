Diagnosis:

Partial colon/rectum resection material shows two colorectal carcinomas:

An ulcerated carcinoma of the rectum characterized histologically as a moderately differentiated
colorectal adenocarcinoma, extending to within 3 cm of the aboral resection margin and
measuring 3.5 cm at its widest diameter. Invasive tumor spread within all layers of the intestinal
wall as far as the periproctic fatty tissue.

2.: A carcinoma of the colon characterized histologically as a moderately differentiated
colorectal adenocarcinoma, extending to within 4 cm of the oral resection margin and measuring
2 cm at its widest diameter. Invasive tumor spread as far as the level of the muscularis propria.
Oral and aboral resection margin tumor-free.

Three of nineteen periproctic or mesocolic lymph nodes with metastases of the rectum or colon
carcinoma extending in some cases over the lymph node capsule.
