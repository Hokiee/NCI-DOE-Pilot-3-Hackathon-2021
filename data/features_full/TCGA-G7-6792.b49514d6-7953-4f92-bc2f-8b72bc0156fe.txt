GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. RENAL TUMOR
Received fresh for frozen section are multiple cores of white-tan tissue, each measuring approximately
1.0 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette FSA1.
B. FAT OVER TUMOR
Received in formalin is a piece of yellow-pink soft tissue measuring 9.0x 5.7 x 0.5 cm. On sectioning,
no masses, lesions or areas of thickening are seen. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes
B1 -B5.
C. LEFT RENAL TUMOR
Received fresh for frozen section are three brown pieces of renal tissue measuring 5.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm,
2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm, and 3.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. Each fragment is oriented with a stitch at the surgical
margin. The margins are inked orange, blue and black, respectively. Frozen section is performed on
the margins. The specimen is submitted entirely in F801 -FSC4 (frozen section of margins) and 05-06
(the remainder of the specimen).
D. LEFT RENAL TUMOR
Received fresh is a piece of brown-tan kidney tissue weighing 117 gm and measuring 9.0 x 5.0 x 4.0
cm. The surgical margin is inked black and the external capsular surface is inked blue. The specimen
is serially sectioned to reveal a 6.2 x 4.6 x 3.0 cm tan-pink cystic friable well-circumscribed mass
located 0.1 cm beneath the renal capsule. There are two cysts on the benign appearing parenchyma
measuring 0.4 and 0.7 cm in greatest dimension that contain brown-gold gelatinous material. A
photograph is taken and sections of the tumor are procured for the tissue bank. Representative
sections are submitted in D1 -D3 (one cross section including capsule and surgical margin), D4—D5 (one
cross section including renal pelvis), D6—D9 (tumor), D10 (cyst), D11-D12 (normal appearing renal
parenchyma).
