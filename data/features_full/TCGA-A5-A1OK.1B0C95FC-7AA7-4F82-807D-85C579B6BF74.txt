changes, Fig-EC grade 3;

There is a tan soft to firm uterine tumor that involves a 4.2 x 4.0 cm area of the endometrium in the
fundus and uterine corpus (posterior > anterior) and extends into the lower uterine segment. but not into

grossly free of tumor.

The endocervical mucosa in the transformation zone appears irregular, fibrotic, and ulcerated. No distinct
mass or invasive tumor IS seen. The ectocervical mucosa shows patchy areas of erosion and/or defects
including a 0.7 x 0.6 cm oval lesion in the 6:00-9:00 quadrant. No invasive tumor is evident on gross
inspection of the cervix. The cervix also shows several mucus-ﬁlled cysts, the largest of which is about
0.3 cm in diameter. The vaginal cuff is grossly unremarkable. There is very little grossly uninvolved
endometrium. that is up to 0.1 cm in thickness. There are foci of hemorrhage in the endometrium and
superﬁcial myometrium. There is a 0.3 cm diameter Ieiomyoma composed of ﬁrm tan solid tissue in the
lower uterine segment. No areas of necrosis or hemorrhage are seen in the Ieiomyoma. A few uterine
serosal adhesions are also present.

Gross photographs are obtained.
