carcinoma. The attached left ovary has a ten. cerebrit‘onn surface. thel measures 3.3 x 2.5 x 1.4 cm end is sectioned to
show an unremarkable tan parenchyma. The left fallopian tube measures 5.6 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm with a smooth tan-purple
outer surface and a pinpoint lumen. The right ovary has a tan~whiie. oerebrilonn outer surlece, that measures 2.8 x 1.8
