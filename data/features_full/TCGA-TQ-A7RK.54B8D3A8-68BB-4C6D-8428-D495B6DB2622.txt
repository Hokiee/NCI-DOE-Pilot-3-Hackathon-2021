Nature of material: Brain 5
Biopsy number: '

ANATOMOPATHOLOGIC RESULT %l/Zq/lq
MACROSCOPY

Received in formalin an irregular fragment of brain, measuring 4.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm and
weighing in at 79. Shows congested vasculature with brown and friable areas.
MICROSCOPY

H & E sections show residual infiltrative glial neoplasm, permeating nervous tissue of
the neocortex and white matter. The tumor is hypercellular and composed of
hyperchromatic nuclei cell proliferation with mild pleomorphism and rare mitotic figures.
The cytoplasm sometimes is clear and sparse and sometimes shows
"minigemistocystic" phenotype. Are still observed cystic areas with former hemorrhage
in the neoplasia sinuses, which is richly vascularized by capillaries with mild endothelial
proliferation. No areas of necrosis were observed. The tumor shows rare mitotic figures.
The tumor showed negative immunostaining for galectin-S.

DIAGNOSTIC

Excision product of residual brain tumor (frontal):

- Oligoastrocitoma, grade ll (WHO).

- The tumor shows cell proliferation index assessed by antibody MlB-1 less than 1% of
nuclear positivity.
