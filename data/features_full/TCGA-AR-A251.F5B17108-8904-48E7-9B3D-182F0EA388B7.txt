' Final Diagnosis

   

4 ast’, left] wide local excision: Inﬁltrating ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade III (of III), forming a 2. 7 x 2. 4 x 2.0 cm bilobed
mass [AJCC pT2]. Extensive ductal carcinoma in situ, high nuclear grade, present within (>25%) and outside the invasive
component. Angiolymphatic invasion is present. The non~neoplastic breast parenchyma shows proliferative ﬁbrocystic changes.
Calciﬁcations present in malignant ducts. Biopsy site changes present. The tumor does not involve overlying skin. The
medial/inferior margin is positive for ductal carcinoma in-situ.

Left breast, new inferomedial margin, re-excision: Focally positive for ductal carcinoma in- situ.
Left breast, new deep margin, re-excision: Negative for tumor.

Lymph nodes, left axillary, dissection: Multiple (3 of 7) left axillary lymph nodes are positive for metastatic carcinoma. The
largest metastatic focus measures 2.2 x 1.9 x 1.5 cm. Extranodal extension is present.

Lymph nodes, additional left axillary, excision: A single (of 3) left axillary lymph node is positive for metastatic carcinoma.
[Total 4 positive lymph nodes; AJCCpNZ].

Breast, left, total mastectomy: No residual carcinoma identiﬁed. Biopsy site changes are present in the outer quadrant. The
adjacent breast parenchyma shows proliferative ﬁbrocystic changes. Surgical margins are negative for tumor. The nipple is
without diagnostic abnormality.
