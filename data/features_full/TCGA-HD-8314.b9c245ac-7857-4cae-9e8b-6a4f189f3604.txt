Gross Description

"FSA1." All frozen section control tissue is submitted in "FSA1".
"FSA2." All frozen section control tissue is submitted in "FSA2".

"NFSA." The specimen consists of a previously sectioned pink—tan soft tissue fragment which upon reconstruction measures
approximately 3.5 x 2.4 x 2.4 cm. The specimen has been previously been inked by the pathologist as follows: 12:00-3:00
orange. 3:006:00 green, 6:00-12:00 yellow, and deep margin black. Previous sectioning reveals a 1.1 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm, pale
tan, ﬁrm, well circumscribed mass within the medial one half aspect of the specimen. This grossly appears to come within less
than a mm of the medial and deep margin and 1.5 cm of the superior half of the lateral margin and 1.7 cm of the inferior half of
the lateral margin. "A1-A3," mass to include 3:00, 9:00, and deep margin; "A4," random sections of the inferior half of the
specimen; "A5," 6:00 margin, representative.

"Additional lateral margin." The specimen consists of a 1.9 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm, tan-brown, irregular, soft tissue fragment. A stitch
has been placed at the superior margin. One margin contains purple ink. This will be overlaid with black ink and the remaining
specimen is inked orange. "81," superior one half specimen; "BZ," inferior one half specimen; all.

"Left level 5." The specimen consists of a 1 cm, yetlow—tan fatty fragment. On examination. deﬁnite lymphoid tissue is not
identiﬁed. All tissue is submitted in "C".

"Left level 4." The specimen consists of a 5.7 x 3.8 x 1.4 cm, yellow—tan fatty fragment. On examination. nineteen possible
lymph nodes are identiﬁed. These range in size from 0.4-1.0 cm. "D1-D3," possible lymph nodes, representative.

"Left level 3." The specimen consists of a 7.1 x 4 x 3 cm, yellow~tan fatty fragment. On examination, twenty two possible
lymph nodes are identiﬁed. These range in size from 0.3-3.8 cm. "E1-E3," possible lymph nodes, representative.

"Left level 2b." The specimen consists of a 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm, tan—brown, fatty, ﬁrm fragment. On examination, eight ossible
limih nodes are identiﬁed. These range in size from 0.5-2.8 cm. "F1-F2,“ possible lymph nodes, representative.-
