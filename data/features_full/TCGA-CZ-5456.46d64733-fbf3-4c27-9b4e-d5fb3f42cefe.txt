LEFT KIDNEY, nspsnscronr (13309):
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, clear cell ty e (12.0 cm), Fuhrman nuclear grade IIIXIV,

involving the lower pole.

I
The soft tissue margins are negative for tumor.
The renal artery, vein, and ureter margins are negative for tumor.

The tumor is confined to the kidney.
Hale's colloidal iron is negative in tumor cells.

The non=nooplastic kidney will be evaluated by Renal Pathology, and the

findings will be reported in an addendum.
AJCC Classification (5th Edition): pT2 N0 MK.

REGIONAL LYMPII MODES, LYMPH NUDE DISSECTION:
Seven lymph nodes, negative for tumor (0:7).

GROSS DE 30111 91"}: ON :
The specimen is received fresh,
name and unit number.

in two parts, each labeled with the patient?s

consists of a left radical nephrectomy specimen (1330

. gm; 25.0 x 12.0 x 10.0 cm) with a ureter (13.5 x 0.4 cm}, a vein (21.0 x 0.5
cm) that wraps around the specimen, and a renal artery (16.1 cm,-0.6 cm). A
mass (1115 x 10.0 x 12.0 cm) replaces the lower pole and is 13.0 cm from the
ureter margin, 25 cm away from the vein margin, 15.0 cm away Erom the artery
margin, and 0.5 cm from the peri—renal Eat. The mass is a mixture of areas of
golden yellow (T1) and brown (T2) and white (T3) tumor. The tumor is adjacent
to but does not invade the renal vein. The tumor compresses the architecture
of the collecting system without invasion of the pelvis or calyces. The entire
lower pole is enlarged. No adrenal tissue or lymph nodes are identified. The
peri—renal fat is inked black. The renal cortex (1 cm thick) is poorly defined
from the medulla. Representative sections of tumor and normal tissue are
submitted to the tumor bank. Representative sections of kidney are submitted
for electron microscopy and immunoﬁluorescence. Representative sections of

tumor are submitted for cytogenetics.
