TYPE OF PROCEDURE: TAH. 880

Gross Description

The specimen is received in 7 parts:

A. The specimen is received fresh labeled "UTERUS, TUBES, OVARIES, CERVI'X" and consists of a 195 g distorted uterus with
attached cervix and bilateral adnexa. 8.5 cm from anterior to posterior, 8 cm from fundus to ectocervix, and 7.5 cm from comu to
comu. The serosa is tan—pink. smooth and glistening. The ectocervical mucosa is tan—pink. smooth and glistening, 4.8 cm in diameter
which surrounds a 1 cm slitlike os. The serosa on the anterior surface is inked red and the serosa on the posterior surface is inked
black. The endocervical canal is tan, glistening striated. Within the endomenial cavity and displacing the endometrium entirely, is a 7
x 4.5 x 1.5 cm tan, friable, polypoid mass. No uninvolved endometrium is grossly identiﬁed. This mass comes to within 3.5 cm from
the anterior endo-ectocervical junction and 4 cm from the posterior endo-ectocervical junction, 1.8 cm from the anterior serosal
surface and 0.5 cm from the posterior serosal surface. Sectioning beneath this mass on the anterior aspect reveals no gross invasiOn
into the myometrium, but on the posterior aspect, grossly extends to within 0.5 cm of the serosa. There are also approximately 5

intramural and subserosal, tan-white, bulging, whorled, well-circmnscribed nodules ranging from 0.5-5 cm in greatest dimension. No
areas of hemorrhage or necrosis are identiﬁed.

The left adnexal unit consists of 4.3 x 2 x 1.5 cm ovary and a ﬁmbriated fallopian tube, 5.8 cm in length and 0.7 cm in diameter. The
right adnexal unit consists of a 3.5 x 2 x 1 cm ovary and a ﬁmbriated fallopian tube 5.5 cm in length and 0.7 cm in diameter. A central
portion of each fallopian tube is missing. The outer surfaces of the ovaries are tan pink and cerebriform. Sectioning reveals
unremarkable cut surfaces. The serosa of the fallopian tubes is grey purple, smooth and glistening. Sectioning reveals patent. pinpoint
lumens. Rep. sections are submitted as follows:

B. Thespecimen is labeled "RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES" and is received in formalin. It consists of S x 5 x 1.5 cm fragment of

fatty tissue. On sectioning multiple lymph nodes are identiﬁed. Largest lymph node measuring 1.3 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. All lymph nodes are
entirely submitted as follows:

81 = possible 3 lymph nodes

82 = 4 lymph nodes

BE = bisection of a single lymph node
B4 = bisection of a single lymph node

C. The specimen is labeled "LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES" and is received in formalin. It consists of 5 x 5 x 2 cm fragment of

fatty tissue. On sectioning multiple lymph nodes are identiﬁed. The largest lymph node measuring 1.8 x l x 1 cm. All lymph nodes are
entirely submitted as follows:

C1 = 4 lymph nodes
C2 = bisection of a single lymph node
C3 = bisection of a single lymph node
C4 = bisection of a single lymph node
C5 = 3 lymph nodes

D. The specimen is labeled "RIGHT PARA AORTIC LYMPH NODES" and is received in formalin. It consists of 3 x 3 x 1 cm
fragment. of fatty tissue. On sectioning possible 4 lymph nodes are identiﬁed. Entirely submitted as follows:
Dl = possible 3 lymph nodes

D2 = bisection of a single lymph node

E. The specimen is labeled "LEFT PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODES" and is received in formalin. It consists of 2 x 1 x 1 cm
fragment of fatty tissue. On sectioning 5 lymph nodes are identiﬁed. The largest lymph node measuring 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 am. All lymph
nodes are entire is submitted as follows:

El = 3 lymph nodes

F. The specimen is labeled "OMENI‘W" and is received in formalin. It consists of an irregular piece of yellow-tan lobulated fatty
tissue grossly consistent with omentum measuring 35 x 16 x 1.5 cm. 0n sectioning the cut surface shows yellow—tan lobulated
adipose tissue without any grossly visible discrete nodule. Representative section is submitted in cassette F1-F2.

G. The specimen is labeled "BLADDER LESION BIOPSY " and is received in formalin. It consists of a fragment of gray-tan soft
tissue measuring 0.1 cm in greatest dimension. Entirely submitted in cassette Gl.
