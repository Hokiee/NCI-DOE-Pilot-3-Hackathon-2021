SPECIMEN
A. Right colon, segmental resection, sent for tissue procurement

B. Apical lymph node
C. Gallbladder

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Right colon tumor

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Received fresh for tissue procurement labeled "right

colon" is a previously unopened 23 cm. segment of proximal
right colon with attached 9.5 cm. of distal ileum surfaced by
smooth
to slightly scabrous tan pink serosa with a copious amount of
attached mesentery and mesocolon. An unremarkable 5 cm. in length,
0.6 cm. in diameter appendix is present. The proximal and distal
margins measure 4.4 and 6.5 cm. in circumference respectively. On
opening there is a circumferential 8.0 x 5.3 cm. essentially
necrotic rubbery tan white—red lesion located 4 cm. from the distal
margin. On sectioning, the lesion has a maximal thickness of 2
cm.,
grossly extending through the muscularis to within 0.1 cm. of the
closest inked free radial serosal surface. A portion of tumor and

portion of normal mucosa are submitted for tissue procurement as
requested. The ileal and remaining colonic mucosa is unremarkable
glistening tan pink with irregular folds and the Walls average 0.6
cm. in thickness. Multiple soft tan pink to slightly rubbery tan
white tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 1 cm. in
greatest dimension are recovered from the attached mesocolon and
mesentery. Representative sections are submitted in 12 blocks as
labeled. R812.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Proximal and distal margin; 2—5 — tumor full
thickness to inked free radial serosal surface; 6 ~ tumor to distal
normal mucosa; 8 — random colon; 9 - appendix; 10-12 ~ six whole
lymph nodes per cassette.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

B. Received in formalin, labeled "apical lymph node” is

1.5 x l X 0.9 cm. rubbery pale tan—gold tissue in keeping
with which is bisected and entirely submitted in one block. AS—l
C. Received in bile—stained formalin labeled ”gallbladder”
is a predominantly intact 8.5 x 2.9 x 2.4 cm. gallbladder
surfaced by smooth to focally cauterized tan~pink—red serosa with a
0.7 cm. length of attached cystic duct. The lumen contains a

copious

 

 

 

amount of viscid olive green bile and multiple minute friable

greennblack choleliths measuring up to 0.2 cm. The mucosa is

velvety

dark olive green, and the wall measures up to 0.5 cm.
Representative sections are submitted in two blocks as labeled.
RS—2

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 » c stic duct margin and gallbladder neck, 2 -
body and fundus. i

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

A. Microscopic examination of the right colon resection
reveals:
Histologic type: Invasive adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified.
Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated.
Primary tumor (pT): Invasive through muscularis propria into
superficial fat {pT3).
Proximal margin: Negative for tumor.
Distal margin: Negative for tumor.
Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative for tumor.
Distance of tumor from closest margin: 4 cm. from distal margin
Vascular invasion: Not identified.
Regional lymph nodes (pN): Eighteen lymph nodes are dissected from

 

 

 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
the specimen and they are all negative for metastatic tumor (pNO).

Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: Not identified.

Distant metastasis (pM): Could not evaluate, pMX.

Other findings: One small tubular adenoma is identified. The

appendix is unremarkable. The ileocecal valve has fatty
replacement. A representative tissue block (A2) is sent for MSI
testing, as requested. This will be reported to

office.
B; Microscopic examination of the apical lymph node

reveals benign reactive follicular hyperplasia. No
malignancy is identified. {0/1).

C. Microscopic examination of the gallbladder reveals

chronic inflammation and adenomyosis.

DIAGNOSIS
A. Colon, right, segmental resection:
Invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, invasive
into superficial fat (pT3).
Eighteen lymph nodes negative for metastatic tumor (0/18)
(pNO) .
Small tubular adenoma.
Unremarkable appendix.
Resection margins negative for carcinoma and for adenomatous
epithelium.
B. Apical lymph node, biopsy:
Reactive follicular hyperplasia, negative for malignancy.
C. Gallbladder, excision:
Chronic calculous cholecystitis.
