GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1) SOURCE: Pharyngeal wall, right lateral

Received fresh is a tan-pink soft tissue fragment, 0.4 cm in greatest
dimension. The entire specimen is submitted for frozen section.
Summary of sections: lAFSC, 1/ 1.

2) SOURCE: Neck, right level I contents

Received fresh is a large fragment of red-pink and brown fibroadipose
tissue, lymph node candidates, and minor salivary gland. The entire
specimen measures 5.0 X 2.5 X 1.5 cm. The minor salivary gland measures
3.5 X 2.0 X 1.0 cm. A thorough lymph node dissection is performed and
reveals four lymph node candidates ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 cm in
greatest dimension. The minor salivary gland is serially sectioned and
reveals a lobular, yellow-tan architecture with no suspicious nodules or
masses identified. All lymph node candidates and a representative
section of minor salivary gland are submitted.

Summary of sections: 2A, one node, 2/ 1; 2B, two nodes, smallest inked
black, 3/ 1; 2C, one node, 2/ 1; 2D, gland, 1/ 1.

3) SOURCE: Neck, right level II B

Received fresh is a tan-yellow and pink cauterized soft tissue fragment,
3.0 X 2.5 X 1.0 cm. The entire outer surface is inked black. The
specimen is mainly fibrotic, and serially sectioned to reveal
yellow-pink parenchymal surface with no suspicious nodules or masses.
Representative sections are submitted in three cassettes.

Summary of sections: 3A-3C, 1/1 each.

4) SOURCE: Neck, right level 2A, 3,4

Received fresh is a large soft tissue fragment, ranging from red-pink to
tan-yellow, measuring 10.0 X 6.0 X 2.0 cm. There is a firm, enlarged
lymph node measuring 3.0 cm in greatest dimension, grossly involved by
tumor. A portion of this lymph node is submitted for research purposes.
A thorough dissection reveals 23 lymph node candidates ranging from 0.4
to 1.8 cm in greatest dimension. All lymph node candidates are submitted.
Summary of sections: 4A, largest grossly involved node and possible
lymph node candidates, 2/ 1; 4B-4E, five lymph node candidates each, 5/1
each; 4F-4H, one lymph node candidate, 2/ 1.

5) SOURCE: Tonsil, right

Received fresh is an enlarged, tan-pink and red tonsil, 4.0 X 2.5 X 2.0

cm. The majority of the specimen has a cauterized, roughened, outer
surface. There is a squamous mucosa present with a deep crypt with a
necrotic-appearing architecture. The cauterized surface is inked

entirely black, the specimen is serially sectioned and reveals a

majority of the tonsil to be involved by an ill-defined, tan-yellow,

firm mass, suspicious for carcinoma, measuring 3.2 in greatest
dimension. The tumor appears to involve the deep margin. Representative
sections are submitted.

Summary of sections: 5A, 1/ 1; 5B-5C, 3/ 1.
6) SOURCE: Retro mandibular trigone

Received fresh is a cauterized, tan-pink soft tissue fragment, 1.0 cm in
greatest dimension. The entire specimen is inked black. The specimen is
bisected and submitted entirely in one cassette.

Summary of sections: 6A, 2/ 1.

7) SOURCE: Superior T onsillar Pole

Received fresh is a small tan-brown, cauterized soft tissue fragment,
0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is bisected and submitted
entirely in one cassette.

Summary of sections: 7A, 2/ 1.

8) SOURCE: Soft palate glands

Received fresh is a tan-brown and pink cauterized, soft tissue fragment,
1.4 X 0.8 X 0.2 cm. The specimen is bisected and submitted entirely in
one cassette.

Summary of sections: 8A, 2/ 1.
