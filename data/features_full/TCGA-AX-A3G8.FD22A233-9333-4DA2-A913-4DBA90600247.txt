Comment: In summary, this is a FIGO Grade 3 (of 3) endometrioid adenocarcinoma that invades less than half of the
myometrial thickness. A total of thirty-two lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma (0132) (14 left pelvic, 2 left
common iliac. 1 left periaortic, 10 right pelvic, 4 right common iliac and 1 right periaortic). The pelvic washings

"" ‘ ‘ were reported as negative for malignancy. AJCC pT1aN0 (Stage IA assuming no distant metastases).

Dr. - has also reviewed the case and agreeswith the above diagnosis.

Microscopic Description
The following slides have been examined by standard microscopy: 30 hematoxylin and eosin.

Frozen Section Diagnosis
Uterus, cervix, bilateral t bes and ovaries: Endometrial mass identiﬁed and tissue submitted for .Protocol. (Gross

examination only).

Gross Description

Seven specimens are received.
A Container: uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries. Received: specimen consists of a 117 gm, 7.5 x 4.5 x 4 cm

uterus and cervix with attached bilateral adnexa. The 2.7 cm in diameter ectocervix is grossly unremarkable. At the upper
uterine fundus is a 4.4 x 3.2 x 1.8 cm thick somewhat friable exoph ic tumor mass which grossly penetrates 0.4 cm into
the 3.3 cm thick fundic wall. A portion of the tumor is submitted $protocol. The tumor is more than 2.5 cm from the
lower uterine segment. The remainder of the endometrium is somewhat granular and the fundic wall shows whorled pink—
white cut surfaces and contains two ﬁbroid nodules, 1.2 cm in greatest dimension each; one is calciﬁed.

The 8 gm left adnexa consists of a 2.5 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter segment of tan-pink fallopian tube with
fimbriated end. Attached to the left tube is a smooth 2.2 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm tan-yellow ovary containing a 0.4 cm in diameter
cyst. The 8.8 gm right adnexa consists of a 2 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter tan—pink fallopian tube segment with
ﬁmbriated end. Attached to the right tube is a smooth 2.5 x 1 x 0.7 cm tan-yellow ovary with unremarkable cut surfaces.
