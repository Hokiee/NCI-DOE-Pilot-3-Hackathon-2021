The specimen is submitted fresh as "left kidney and ureter" and consists
of a kidney removed with attached perirenal fat weighing 361 grams with an
overall dimension of 19 x 11 x 5 cm” The kidney measures 10 x 6 x 3.5 cm.
The segment of attached ureter measures 8 cm in length and 0.6 cm in

r diameter. There are several segments of vessel at the hilum ranging in

‘ length from 0.4 to 1.5 cm in length and measuring up to 2 cm in diameter.
The ureteral mucosa is pale tan_with the usual striations. The pelvic
mncoea is similar in appearance. The renal parenchyma is red brown with
normal architecture. There is a 2 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm circumscribed yellow tan
tumor adjacent to the renal pelvis which appears to abut upon the
renal sinus and approaches to within 0.5 cm of the cortical surface. The
calyces are not dilated. The cortex measures up to 0.8 Cm in thickness.
The capsule strips easily revealing an underlying red brown granular
cortical surface. Examination of the attached perirenal fat is
unremarkable. The adrenal gland is absent. Representative sections are
submitted4 multiple (9) labeled as follows{”
