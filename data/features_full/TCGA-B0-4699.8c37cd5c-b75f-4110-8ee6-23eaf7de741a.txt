I

PARTZ:

RIGHT KIDNEY, ADRENAI. GLAND AND SEGMENT OF COLON, RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY WITH PARTIAL COLECTOMY —
A. RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR CELL) TYPE, FUHRMAN’S NUCLEAR GRADE 4 OF 4 WITH

SARCOMATOID DE-DIFFERENTIATION, 15 cm IN GREATEST DIMENSION.

B. THE RENAL CELL CARCINOMA INVADES THE PERINEPHRIC ADIPOSE TISSUE AND THE COLONIC WALL TO
THE LEVEL OF MUSCULARIS PROPRIA.

FOCI OF ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION ARE IDENTIFIED.

VASCULAR RESECTION MARGINS (RENAL AND COLONIC) ARE NEGATIVE FOR NEOPLASIA.

URETERAL RESECTION MARGIN IS NEGATIVE FOR NEOPLASIA.

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA IS IDENTIFIED ON THE INKED PERITONEAL SURFACE.

PROXIMAL AND DISTAL RESECTION MARGINS ON THE COLON ARE NEGATIVE FOR NEOPLASIA.

NO EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASIA IS PRESENT ON THE POSTERIQR ASPECT OF GEROTA’S FASCIA.

ADRENAL GLAND SHOWS NO EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASIA AND NO SIGNIFICANT PATHOLOGIC CHANGES.

THE NON—NEOPLASTIC RENAL PARENCHYMA SHOWS NO SIGNIFICANT PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS.

THE NON-NEOPLASTIC COLON SHOWS NO SIGNIFICANT PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS.

PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGING: pT4 N0 M1.
