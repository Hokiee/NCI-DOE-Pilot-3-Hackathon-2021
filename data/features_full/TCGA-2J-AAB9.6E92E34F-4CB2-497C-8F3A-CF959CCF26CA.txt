REVISED REPORT (Revised information underlined) ' ’

DIAGNOSIS:

D. Pancreas, head, duodenum, gallbladder, and common bile duct,
portion jejunum, pyloro—sparing Whipple resection: Invasive grade 3
(of 4) ductal adenocarcinoma is identiﬁed forming a solid 4.0 x 3.0
x 3.0 cm mass causing a stricture of the distal common bile duct.
The tumor extends beyond the pancreas to involve the peripancreatic
soft tissue. It inﬁltrates into the muscularis propria of the

duodenal wall and the adventitia of superior mesenteric vein (a 4.0
cm segment of superior mesenteric/portal vein resected on block is
present). Perineural invasion is present. Tumor necrosis is

absent. All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor
(minimum tumor free margin, less than 0.1 cm, anterior soft tissue
margin). Multiple (5 of 34) regional lymph nodes are positive for
metastatic adenocarcinoma. The gallbladder is unremarkable.

A. Lymph nodes, hepatic artery, biopsy: Multiple (2) lymph nodes
are negative for tumor.

B. Pancreas, neck margin, excision: Positive for tumor. A lymph
node is also metastatically involved.

C. Pancreas, body margin, excision: A microfocus of
carcinoma is present.

_E. Vein, superior mesenteric, margin, excision: Negative for
tumor.

F. Vein, portal margin, excision: Negative for tumor.

G. Hepatic duct, margin, excision: Invasive adenocarcinoma is
present in the soft tissues surrounding hepatic duct nearly
circumferentially.

H. Hepatic duct, new common margin, excision: Negative for tumor.

With available surgical material, [AJ CC pT3Nl] (7th edition, 2010).

This ﬁnal pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic
examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the
specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are
reviewed to conﬁrm these ﬁndings. Any substantive changes

identiﬁed on permanent section review will be reﬂected in a
revised report.

Revision Description: Part C: On permanent section, a microscopic
focus of invasive carcinoma is identiﬁed involving the pancreas
body margin. On review of frozen section slides, two small
malignant glands are identiﬁed, originally misinterpreted as

reactive.

are negative for tumor.

B. Pancreas, neck margin, excision: Positive for'tumor. A lymph
node is also metastatically involved.

C. Pancreas, body margin, excision: Margin is negative for tumor.
Invasive carcinoma is present 0.2 cm away from the resection margin.
E. Vein, superior mesenteric, margin, excision: Negative for tumor.
F. Vein, portal margin, excision: Negative for tumor.

G. Hepatic duct, margin, excision: Invasive adenocarcinoma is
present in the soft tissues surrounding hepatic duct nearly

circumferentially.

H. Hepatic duct, new common margin, excision: Negative for tumor.

1.0 cm portion of pancreas with orientation. Representative
sections are submitted. Grossed by

D. Received fresh labeled "head pancreas, gallbladder, duodenum,
common bile duct, portion jejunum" is a Whipple specimen consisting
of 27.0 cm in length of portion of duodenum, 6.0 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm
