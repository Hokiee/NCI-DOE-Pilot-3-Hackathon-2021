Macroscopy

1. Resection of the pancreas: unfixed, 4.5x3.5x0.7 cm large IameIlae of the pancreas. The tissue is grey-
yellowish, fibrotic, focally diffuse indurated. The ductus pancreaticus is rather centrally oriented, max.
0.4 cm in diameter, slightly ectatic. The IameIlae was cut in two halves and completely used for
instantaneous section after removal of the clamping and cord material.

2. Lymph node ligamentum hepatoduodenale: ﬁxed, several max. 2 cm large lymph nodes, the largest of
which with solid grey-white cutting area.

3. Lymph node truncus coeliacus: ﬁxed, 2.5 cm large focally indurated IameIlae of fatty tissue. Material
was embedded completely.

4. Pancreas and spleen, additional resection specimen of the pancreas: fixed, Whipple resection
specimen in two parts with a 13x6x5 cm large pancreas, 15 cm long duodenum, and a 5 cm long ductus
choledochus. Peripancreatic tissue max. 1.5 cm wide. Almost the complete pancreas is captured by a
12x5x4 cm large, relatively clear deﬁned solid tumor with mostly solid white—yellowish cutting area
(tumor diameter of the first resected Whipple specimen was 6 cm, tumor diameter of the additional
resection specimen of the tail was also 6 cm). At the cranial part of the tumor a 2.2. cm cyst. Wide
inﬁltration of the peripancreatic soft tissue and the lamina muscularis of the duodenum. The tumor is
not discernable dorsal from the resection margin of the pancreas. Peripancreatically several max. 2.2 cm
dense lymph nodes with solid grey-white cutting area. Distance of the resection margin of the ductus
choledochus 5 cm, to the resection margin of the duodenum oral 2 cm, to the aboral resection margin 10
cm. At the processus uncinatus regular lobular pancreatic parenchyma. Spleen weight 110 grams and
11x7x5 cm large focus. Ink mark: black resection margin dorsal, blue resection margin ventral. Attached
is a 8x8x1 cm large omentum without tumor. Photo documentation.

Instantaneous section report:

1. Positive malignancy, focally invasive carcinoma infiltrates, alongside extended high grade PanlN
lesions (IPMN) (characterization after ﬁxation)

Processed: 2 x instantaneous sections, 16 blocks, H&E, 2x EvG, 2xFe, 1x PAS, 2x complex macroscopy

Microscopy

1. There are infiltrates of a mostly ductal adenocarcinoma. Focally the infiltrates extend to the adjacent
parapancreatic fatty tissue. Occasionally perineural growth. Focally high grade PanlN. In the vicinity
much desmoplastic reaction. Focally polarization-optically double defracted surgical thread.

2. detection of a lymph node metastasis of max. 2 cm in diameter (obviously intranodal) out of 2 total
lymph nodes.

3. Detection of 5 lymph nodes without tumor and atypical cell complexes (probably contaminating)

4. The macroscopically described tumor is composed of inﬁltrates of a mostly ductal and focally solid
growing carcinoma. The tumor cells sometimes with bright cytoplasm. Moderately differentiated and
focally high grade nuclear pleomorphia and distortion of the nucleus-cytoplasm relation and formation
of promiment nucleoli. The tumor cells partially infiltrate the tunica mucularis of the duodenum and up
to the submucosa. Here vessel invasion is seen. In addition, there is extended infiltration of the
peripancreatic fatty tissue all the way up to the vessel containing fatty tissue. The tumor infiltrates
extend to the dorsal resection margin. In the adjacent pancreatic parenchyma there are some PanlN
lesions. Detection of 5 lymph node metastases out of 14 lymph nodes. The resection margins of the small

intestine and the ductus choledochus are without tumor. Spleen parenchyma without tumor and
indication of chronic congestion.

Short report on diagnostic findings

Invasive, moderately differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, reaching from the head of
the pancreas to the tail, max. 12 cm in diameter (1., 4.). Wide inﬁltration of the peripancreatic fatty
tissue (1., 4.) and infiltration of the submucosa of the small intestine (4.) and focally infiltration of the
tissue of the truncus coeliacus (3.). The dorsal resection margin and the resection at the truncus
coeliacus took not place in the healthy tissue (3.).

Detection of lymphovasular inﬁltration and extended perineural growth. Detection of 6 lymph node
metastases out of 21 lymph nodes (2., 3., 4.)

Resection margin from the ductus choledochus from small intestine and aboral without tumor and
spleen without tumor (4.).
