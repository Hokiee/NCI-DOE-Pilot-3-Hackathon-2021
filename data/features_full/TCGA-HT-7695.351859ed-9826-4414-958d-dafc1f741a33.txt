Microscopic Description:

Sections demonstrate a moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm. There is extensive
infiltration through both gray and white matter. In the gray matter, perineuronal
satellitosis is striking. In the unfrozen material, most of the tumor cells are seem to have
perinuclear halos. They have round nuclei with moderate atypia. No mitotic figures are
seen. There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis.

Addendum Discussion:

The calculated MIB-l labeling index ranges up to 5.0% in the most proliferative regions
of tumor. A MIB-l labeling index of 5.0% is considered borderline by some studies for
grade II and grade II oligodendrogliomas. The low grade features exhibited by this
oligodendroglioma are more consistent with a grade 11 tumor; however, in light of the
borderline MIB-l index, this neoplasm should be closely followed for anaplastic
progression and/or recurrence.

Diagnosis:
Low Grade Oligodendroglioma (who grade II).
MIB-l Labeling Index: 5.0%
