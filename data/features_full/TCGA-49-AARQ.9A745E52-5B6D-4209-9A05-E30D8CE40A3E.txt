INTERPRETATION AND DIAGNOSIS:

1. RIGHT UPPER LOBE (LOBECTOMY): TWO (2) SEPARATE NON-CONTIGUOUS
FOCI 0F INFILTRATING MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA (3.2 CM
AND 1.0 CM). THE TUMOR DOES NOT EXTEND TO THE OVERLYING PLEURAL
SURFACE. BRONCHIAL MARGINS, VASCULAR MARGINS, PARENCHYMAL MARGINS,
AND SIX (6) HILAR LYMPH NODES ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. THE PATHOLOGIC
STAGE OF THE TUMOR IS pTZNOMx, STAGE I. ACUTE AND ORGANIZING
BRONCHOPNEUMONIA IN THE AREA SURROUNDING THE TUMOR (FOCAL OBSTRUCTIVE
PNEUMONITIS). EMPHYSEMATOUS CHANGES WITH FOCAL PERIPHERAL BULLA
FORMATION. SEE NOTE.

2. STATION R—4 LYMPH NODE (BX): ONE (1) LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR
TUMOR.

.3. STATION 7 LYMPH NODE (BX): ONE {1) LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR
TUMOR.

NOTE: The measured tumor size is corrected for surrounding
pneumonia.

PART #1: FS: RIGHT UPPER LOBE
Resident Pathologist:

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS --
FS: RIGHT UPPER LOBE: STAPLED MARGIN NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

The specimen is received fresh labeled”nd
designated right upper lobe. It consists o a grossly recognizable
lobe of lung that weighs 250 gms, and measures 20 x 9.5 x 3.5 cm. The
staple parenchymal margin measures 17 cm in length. The entire
parenchymal margin will be sampled for histology. One particular area
of concern raised by the surgeon was frozen with frozen section
diagnosis as above. There is in fact some firmness felt underneath the
parenchymal margin. Upon serially sectioning through the lung, this
area of firmness appears to be secondary to bronchopneumonia. A tumor
mass is identified which measures 3.2 cm in greatest dimension. This
white tan tumor mass approaches the parenchymal margin no closer than
4.2 cm. Between this nodule and the overlying stapled parenchymal
margin is the area of firmness consistent with bronchopneumonia.

There is however one additional smaller nodule that is white tan in
color measuring 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. This other nodule is
separate from the main tumor nodule. This nodule is surrounded by the
firm gray tan tissue reminescent of pneumonia. This second nodule
approaches the stapled parenchymal margin, no closer than 2.2 cm. The
bronchial and vascular margins grossly appears well away from the
tumor and approach no closer that 4.0 cm from the main tumor mass,

and 6.2 cm from the other suspicious smaller nodule. In the area of
the lung adjacent to the tumor in the area away from the pneumonia.
the lung appears focally cystic. The remainder of the lung specimen
is congested. No other lesions are identified. Black and white and
color photographs of the specimen are taken. In one region the tumor
appears grossly to approach the overlying pleural surface with some of

focal hardening and puckering of the surface. Representative sections
are submitted.
