SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS
Specimen: Surgical Excision
Block Number: A4

 

 

ER: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3
PR: Positive Allred Score: 4 = Proportion Score 2 + Intensity Score 2
COMMENT:

The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the proportion score
(0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of
cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate
intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring range from 0 to 8.

ER/PR positive is deﬁned as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is deﬁned as an Allred score of less than
or equal to 2.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
lmmunohistochemistry was oerforrned using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 105, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100)
provided by following the manufacturer 5 instructions. This assay was not modiﬁed.
Interpretation or the ER/PR Immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,
information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no Innaer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis
was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit I ‘ ‘ ) using rabbit anti-
human HER2. This assay was not modiﬁed. External kit-slides provided by the manufacture. (cell lines with high,
low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-house known HER2 ampliﬁed control tissue were evaluated along
with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identiﬁed for HER2 evaluation.
Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,
information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.

This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from A500 and CAP
and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology Department takes full responsibility
for this test's performance.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
None provided.

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right breast cancer.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:
A: Right breast, lumpectomy: Mass is 0.6 cm from the closest inferior margin. By Dr., called to Dr. at P.M.

ADDENDUM:

Results of the gross examination performed on specimen A were omitted from the original report and are as follows:

Patthsion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit
Case No

Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED

Clinical Interpretation of results

Ampliﬁcation of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase ﬂuorescence in-situ

hybridization (FISH) on formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn embedded tissue sections using a chromosome

17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the

by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17

signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no

ampliﬁcation of the HER2/neu gene.

Block used A4 Source of case:

Tissue ﬁxation formalin-ﬁxed tissueOutside Case No: NA

Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes

HER2/CEP17 ratio: 0.9
This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of
CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic
mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded.

Method of ratio enumeration: manual count
Limitations
The Vysis Patthsion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is
intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free
and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding
adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into
consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No
treatment decision for stage II, nodeapositive breast cancer patients should be based on HER—Zlneu
gene ampliﬁcation status alone.
Overview of this test
FDA APPROVED REAGENT

Patthsion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of
patients for whom HerceDtin® theranv is heinn rnnsidered, These tests were performed in the
under the direction

of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the
clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.
