SURGICAL PATHOLOGY

Surgical Pathology Report

Diagnosis:

Colon, right, resection

Tumor Histologic Type: Adenocarcinoma with prominent mucinous and signet ring cell features; see comment.
Histologic Grade: poorly differentiated

Tumor Location: ascending colon

Depth of Invasion:
-Through muscularis propria into the pericolic soft tissue

Lymphovascular Invasion: present, extensive
Perineural Invasion: not identified
Margins:

Proximal margin: Negative for malignancy.
Distal margin: Negative for malignancy

Mesenteric margin: Negative for malignancy
Distance of carcinoma from closest margin (specify): tumor is 2.0 cm from the mesenteric margin.

Regional Lymph Nodes: Twelve of fourteen lymph nodes positive for metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, 1.0 cm in
greatest dimension, extracapsular extension present (12/14).

Additional pathologic findings: - Appendix with mucin and tumor cells within periappendiceal soft tissue and extending into
muscularis propria of appendix.
- Severe acute and chronic serositis with adhesions.

AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT3 pN2b
Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to change pending
clinical review and additional information.

Comment:

Immunohistochemical stains for MLH1, MSH2, and MSH5 are performed. The tumor demonstrates appropriate nuclear staining for
all three markers which is the normal phenotype and which does not support a diagnosis of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal

cancer. Microsatellite instability testing will be performed by the— Lab and reported separately.

Clinical History:
right colon cancer.

Gross Description:
Specimen fixation: formalin

Parts of bowel received/ Specimen length: colon (17 cm in length, 5.7 cm in circumference); ileum (10.7 cm in length, 3.4 cm in
circumference); appendix with a length of 3.5 cm and a diameter of 0.9 cm

Orientation: The distal colonic margin is inked black, the ileal margin is inked blue, the surrounding fat over the tumor is inked green.

Tumor location: 4.2 cm from blue inked margin and 12.7 cm from black inked margin.

Gross appearance of tumor: Ulcerated, hemorrhagic, firm, tan/white
Tumor dimensions: 7.5 cm x 5.5 cm x 5.0 cm
Circumferential growth: 50% of luminal circumference involved

Gross depth of invasion: Tumor invades grossly into the fat. There are multiple separate tumor nodules/candidate lymph nodes
which are present in the pericolonic fat and measure up to 3.5 cm.

Gross evidence of perforation through visceral peritoneum: no
Luminal obstruction: approximately 70%
Bowel circumference at tumor site: 4.5 cm

Gross distance of tumor from margins: 4.2 cm from the blue inked margin, 12.7 cm from the black inked margin, 2.0 cm from
perpendicular soft tissue margin

Lymph nodes: per block summary

Other remarkable findings: multiple tumor nodules and surrounding fat; The appendix wall is thickened (0.4 cm) and the mucosal
surface is tan. The tip of the appendix is dilated with a maximum diameter of 1.1 cm. The internal surface is tan/pink and regular.

Tissue submitted for special investigation: yes, to Tissue Procurement
Digital photograph taken: not taken
