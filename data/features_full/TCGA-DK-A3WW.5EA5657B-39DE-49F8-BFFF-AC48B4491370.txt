*** Report Electronically Signed Out ***

 

Gross Description:

1) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "right common iliac lymph nodes", and consists of multiple pink tan ﬁrm lymph nodes
ranging from 0.3 to1.6 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen including identiﬁed lymph nodes is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:

LN - lymph nodes

F - adipose tissue

2) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "left common iliac lymph nodes", and consists of multiple pink tan ﬁrm lymph nodes
ranging from 0.3 to 3.0 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen including identified lymph nodes is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:

SLN - serially sectioned lymph node
LN - lymph nodes

F - adipose tissue

3) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "right distal pelvic lymph nodes", and consists of multiple pink tan ﬁrm lymph nodes
ranging from 0.3 to 10.0 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen including identiﬁed lymph nodes is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:

SLN - serially sectioned lymph node
LN - lymph nodes

F - adipose tissue

4) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "left distal pelvic lymph nodes", and consists of multiple pink tan ﬁrm lymph nodes
ranging from 0.3 to 6.0 cm in greatest dimension. All identiﬁed lymph nodes are entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:

SLN - serially sectioned lymph node

6) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, perivesical lymph nodes urachus". It consists of a
radical cystectomy specimen measuring 15 cm from superior to inferior 15 cm laterally and 8 cm from anterior to posterior. The
bladder measures16 x 10 x 8 cm. the prostate measures 4 x 3 x 3cm, the right seminal vesicle measures 3 x 1.2 x 0.9, the right
vas deferens measures 4 x 0.7, the left seminal vesicle measures 5 x 2.5 x 1cm, and the left vas deferens measures 3 x 0.6 cm.
The anterior aspect of the bladder is inked black and the posterior blue. The prostatic urethral margin is shaved and submitted.

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

The bladder is opened along the anterior midline to reveal a gray tan ﬂeshy necrotic mass measuring 8.5 x 6.5 x 5 cm which is
situated within a distended diverticulum, which protrudes through a 3.5 x 3cm open defect located 2.5 cm above the right uretal
oriﬁce, to the bladder mucosa . The mass is located 3.5cm from the left oriﬁce and 2.cm from the right oriﬁce. Both ureters are
probe patent, measuring up to 0.2 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion is sectioned to reveal a gray tan necrotic mass,which
extends to the inked fat. Not additional lesion is grossly identiﬁed. The remaining bladder edematous congested and not other
lesion is identiﬁed Discrete perivesical lymph nodes are not identiﬁed. The prostate is serially sectioned to reveal a white
whorled ﬁrm cut surface. Representative submitted including three sections from each prostatic quadrant and transition zone. The
specimen is photographed. Nas submitted.

and attached soft tissue with one clipped end and one unclipped end. The ureter is 4.0 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. The
ureter is serially sectioned and reveals a patent lumen and smooth tan mucosa. The specimen is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
