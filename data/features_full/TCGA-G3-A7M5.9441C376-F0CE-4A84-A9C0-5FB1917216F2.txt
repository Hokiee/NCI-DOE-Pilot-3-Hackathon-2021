Gross Description

Received are specimen containers A to R 1111 requisitions and specimen containers are
labelled with the patient's name, . The cassettes and " are
labelled with the Surgical Number

A: The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin and labeled
gallbladder. The specimen consists of a partly collapsed gallbladder measuring 9 cm from
fundus to resection margin by approximately 3 cm in transverse diameter. The outer
peritoneal surface is unremarkable. The lumen contains multiple faceted and mulberry"
shaped dark pigment stones up to 1 cm in diameter. The residual mucosa is unremarkable
with a green velvety appearance. The wall measures up to 0.1 cm in thickness. No cystic
duct lymph node is identified. Representative sections from the tundua. mid body, and
cystic duct resection margin are submitted in one cassette.

8: The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin and labeled
right lobe of liver. The specimen consists of a resection specimen of liver tissue
weighing 1.570 kg. There is a blue suture attached to the inferior edge. The
anterolateral surface appears dusky and discolored with areas of pallor, possibly
capsular Eibrosie, but without any obvious involvement by tumor. The diaphragmatic area
is unremarkable and the left retrohepatic peritoneal surface is unremarkable. There is a
resection margin along the medial aspect of the specimen without any obvious tumor at
this margin and this is painted blue. The lobe measures 19 cm from superior to inferior,
18 cm from medial to lateral, and approximately 10 cm from the anterior surface to the
deep bare area. Transverse incisions into the liver lobe shows it to be expanded and
mostly replaced by a well circumscribed multinodular tumor that has a seminecrotic and
hemorrhagic cut surface with viable areas oi tumor showing a pale grey to yellow green
color. The tumor itcelf has dimensions of 14.5 x 8 x 15 cm {photographs has been taken
of the transverse section showing the multilobulated tumor). There is no obvious
extension of the tumor into vascular structures grossly, but at the resection margin,
there is large duct or vascular channel that appears to have a granular material balling
up on its lining. This is also visible more distant from the hilar zone of this resection
specimen. Further sectioning shows this to extend to the hilar resection margin. This
appears to extend to the painted resection margin at the vascular hilum of the lobe.

Adjacent liver does not show any significant nodularity to suggest underlying cirrhosis.

Sections are taken as follows:

31-13. sections at hilum of lobe to illustrate interface between tumor and resection
margin and to

illustrate potential vascular invasion and vascular extension to resection

margin

814—16. additional sections of tumor close to resection margin
817—23. tumor in relationship to capsule

824/25. tumor

326-30. sections of surrounding liver parenchyma

Microscopic Description

A. Sections show gallbladder wall with minimal inflammation but focal areas with
Aschof£~Rokitansky sinuses and mild subserosal fibrosis consistent with mild chronic
Cholecystitis. No atypia is present.

B. The resection shows a hepatocellular carcinoma that has a somewhat lobulated
architecture forming large rounded nodules of tumor. The tumor cells show mild to
moderate nuclear atypia growing in broad sheets of cells, showing focal pseudoglandular
areas with accumulation of bile, as well as showing prominent fatty change. Prominent
areas of hemorrhage and degeneration are present in the central part of the tumor. The
HCC closely approaches the painted resection margin, but direct extension is not present,
with a clear margin that is focally as close as 3.0 and 2.0 mm in two of the sections.
In multiple areas the granular material appears to involve lareger vascular spaces. with
granulatomatous changes in the walls of veins related to intraluminal foreign material
consistent with pre~operative embolization. In smaller portal tracts this is clearly in
the portal venous system. No clear evidence of perineural or vascular invasion can be
identified.

The adjacent liver parenchyma shows portal triaditis as well as areas of granulomatous
inflammation related to portal veins. The portal tracts are mildly expanded, but there
is no clear evidence of an underlying cirrhosis or chronic liver disease.
