Gross Description

A. Specimen A is received ﬂesh inhaled “hepatic artery tymph node.“ The specimen contracts at

a 213 x 1.5 x 1.0, moderately ﬁrm graytan irregular lymph node which is serialiy sectioned and entirely
oubmitted as A’Hil

B. Specimen B is received keen for frozen aeolian analysis labeled "subtotal oancreatectomy and
epicnectomy." The specimen consists of a sublets pan(:rr~,,ator:.toowF {8.0 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm) attached to a
grossly unremarkable spleen {14.0 x 8.9 x 6.0 cm}. Both specimens are adherent to a moderate
amount of tat. The pancreatic margin of resection is stapled. The staples are moved and the
underlying tieeue is removed tangentially and entirely submitted on frozen section as F531. The
pancreatic dim is markedly dilated out is probe~patent tor approximately 2 not where it in filled with a
soft brown tan protruding tissue (possible tumor}. The end of the pancreas which attaches to the
apieen is markedly indurated and exhibits a gray white smooth ill-defined mass {3.0 x 2.5 it 2.3 cm}
abutting the soft tissue margin of resection and is approximately 4 cm from the pancreatic margin of
resection- The mass at this point totally occludee the pancreatic duct. The mass occupies

approximately 75% of the pancreas. the random pancreatic parenchyma la tabulated gray tan grossly
unremarkable.

The capsule of the spleen is brown tan and intact. The cut surface exhibits a soft red brown tissue

wnh groasty unremarkable parenchyma. Sectioning of the adipose tissue isotatice no deﬁnitive tympn
nodes.

A representative section of the tumor is submitted to Tissue Procurement Laboratory.

Representative sections are submitted as:
82: Mirror image oi tumor submitted to Tiaaue Bank
33-56: Sections of tumor showing relationship to soft tissue margin of resection

87-88: Sections of tumor showing relationship to pancreatic duct

89: Groesly unremarkable pancreatic parenchyma
Bil}; Grossly unremarkable spleen
M1326: Representative sections at adipose tissue

:3 Specimen C as received {teen labeled ”.‘spienule The specimen consists of what grossly
appears to be e lobule of splenlc tissue partially covered by adipose tlssue {2- 5 x 2 til it 2.0 cm). The
overlying adipose tissue is marked with black ink The specimen is serially seeﬁoned and reveals a

red brown grossly unremarkable splenic parenchyma. Representative section: submitted as Ci.

5. Specimen Cl is received treat: for frozen section analysis labeled 'gellbladder gruesly check for
polyps. The specimen consists ot a club-shaped gallbladder (an x 3.0 x 1.5 cm). Te external surface
is. green yellow, wrinkled with a small amount of attached ﬁbroadipose tissue. ¥he lumen is ﬁlled with
a green vicile bile. No calculi grossly appreciated. There are several adherent soft teem (possible
polyps} ranging tram 9.2 cm to 35 :m in greatest dimension. A representative eeetion at? these
lesions is- submitted for frozen section as F301. The remainder of the mucosa] surface is

green—yellow, veweuilce and grossly unremarkable. Pennanent representative sections are submitted
as D2433.
