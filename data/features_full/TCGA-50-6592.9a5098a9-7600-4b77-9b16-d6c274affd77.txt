PROBE-1 Vysis. LSl EGFR §§gectrum0rangel ggg—E Z Sggctr mg-i:reenm Probe

Fluorescence in-situ hybridizatinn studies performed on the adenocarcinuma shows a ratio {II EGFR gene to the centromere of
chromosome 7 at 0.86 indicating no EGFR ampliﬁcation in the targeted region The rate of hyperpluidy for the centromere of
cnromosomu ‘i‘ was 41% of the analyzed cells. The signal to nucleus ratin (SNR) for the EGFR gens was 2.0.

interpretation guidelines for EGFR Gene Copy Number by FISH‘

Ratio of EGPR‘ to the centrornere ulchrnrnosome "r:
Less than 2.0: No EGFR amplification
Greater than 2.0: EGFR amplification

Hyperptoidy: Greater than two centrornere capleslcell.

COMMENT:
chause this carcinoma expressen CDX2 in the absence of 'l‘rF1, it its essential that an extratharacic primary site of
origin, particularly In the GI tract be excluded be torn accepting this case as a primary lung adenocarclnoma. The
