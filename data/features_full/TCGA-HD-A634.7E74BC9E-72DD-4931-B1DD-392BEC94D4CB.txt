GROSS DESCRI ON;

The specimen is received in six formalin ﬁlled containers each labeled with the patient'a name

   

 

 

A. A is additionally designated left radical tonsil and tongue base resection. The specimen consists of a 7.0 x 5.5 x 2.7 cm gray purple soft tissue that is
surfaced by a pink tan mucosa to include tonsil and small portion of base of tongue. There is some ink by the pathologist at the time of intraoperatlve
consult for orientation. No frozen was done. The lateral aspect is yellow. The superior aspect is blue. The inferior aspect is green and the medial
aspect is red. The deep surface is black. The inferior aspect of the specimen corresponds with the base of tongue. in the mucosal surface is a 4.3 x
3.5 cm red tan fungating mass. The mass is abutting the inferior aspect of the tonsil and 2.5 cm from the superior mucosal margin, 0.5 cm to the nearest
lateral mucosal margin, 0.8 cm from the nearest inferior mucosal margin and 0.2 cm from the nearest medial mucosal margin (near the inferior aspect).
The specimen is serially sectioned from superior to interior to reveal the mass has a third dimension of 2.3 cm and is 0.1 cm from the nearest deep
margin. This is abutting the deep margin on the medial aspect of the specimen. The mass also appears to be involving the skeletal muscle of the base
of the tongue. The uninvolved tonsil is pink tan to white tan with a 1.5 cm cyst ﬁlled with a purulent material. This is adjacent to the mass.
Representative sections are submitted in cassettes Al-AB as follows: A1.mass to medial mucosa and soft tissue margin: A2~mass to lateral mucosa
and soft tissue margin; A3~>superior mucosal margin shaved and submitted inked down; Aria-mass to the inferior mucosa and soft tissue margin; A5—
mass to deep; A6-additional mass to deep; A7—mass involving the base of tongue; A8—tonsillar cyst Three research cassettes were taken labeled
.,li5,.'i7and.18. ~

B. Part B is additionally designated additional deep margin inferiorly and medially and consists of a 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm portion of red tan skeletal muscle.
Orientation as to true margin is not provided. The specimen is inked, serially sectioned and submitted entirely in cassette Bi.

C. Part C- is additionally designated left level 28 lymph node and consists of a 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm portion of yellow lobular adipose tissue within which is
a 0.5 cm possrble lymph node. The possible lymph node is bisected and submitted entirely in cassette C1.

D. Part D is additionally designated level 18 lymph node and consists of a 4.0 x 2.7 x12 cm portion of submandibular gland with attached adipose
tissue. The specimen is 9 grams. The submandibular gland is inked and serially sectioned to reveal a yellow lobular cut surface. No masses or lesions
are identiﬁed. Within the adipose tissue are two possible lymph nodes, 0.5 and 0.6 cm. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes 01 and DZ
as follows: D1~submandibular gland; D2-—two lymph nodes submitted in toto.

E. Part E is additionally designated level 2A, 3 and consists ofa 5.6 x 5.2 x 2.5 cm portion of yellow lobular to pink tan fibrofatty tissue. Vlhthin the
adipose tissue are nine pink tan possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. Additionally there is a 4.5 x 3.2 x 2.5 cm mass.
The mass is serially sectioned to reveal a white tan grossly positive cut surface. There are multiple areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. Representative
sections are submitted in cassettes E1~E3 as follows: E1~ﬁve possible lymph nodes submitted in toto; E2»four possible lymph nodes submitted in toto;
E3~a representative cross section of the mass.

F. Part F is additionally designated level 4 and 5 and consists of a 9,0 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm portion of yellow lobular to pink tan ﬁbrofatty tissue. Within the
tissue are eleven possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 to 1.1 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are submitted as follows: Ft—ﬁve possible
:ymph nodes submitted in toto; FZ—four possible lymph nodes submitted in toto; F3 and Flt-each contain one possible lymph node bisected.
