CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm corpus uteri. dé// .
Endometrioid adenocarcinoma, FIGO gra \I II f III.
Grossly invades 0.1 cm into a 2.5 cm myome ium.

GROSS EXAMINATION: ,
A. "Right ovarian ' lant. " eceived fresh for frozen section and placed

in formalin a is a 1 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm fragment of tissue
Which is totally frozen as AFl and the frozen section remnant (0.3 x 0.3 x 0.1
cm) is Submitted in toto in block A1. .

B. "Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries (BF1)" e eived fresh for frozen
section and placed in formalin at “a 193 gram, 13 x 7 x
5 cm uterus with attached bilateral fimbriated fallopian tubes (each 4 cm long

x 0 8 cm in diameter) and ovaries (each 2 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm). The endometrium
(2.5 cm wide at the fundus x 5 cm long) is remarkable for brown lush
excrescences up to 0.5 cm thick along the anterior and posterior endometrial
cavity measuring 5 x 2.5 x 1.3 cm and extending to the anterior and posterior
endocervical canal junction. These excrescences grossly invade 0.1 cm into a
2.5 cm tan-pink trabeculated myometrial wall. The excrescences are 2 cm from
the serosal surface which is tan—gray, smooth and glistening. The myometrium
also exhibits four white firm nodules, 0.6cm in diameter, with bulging whorled
cut surfaces devoid of hemorrhage and necrosis.

The ectocervix is 3 cm in diameter and has a tan, smooth surface, is focally
'F‘ﬁ erythematous and leads into a 2.5 cm long endocervical canal which is tan,

. .3. smooth and fOcally erythematous.

The right ovary is tan-white with a smooth, glistening surface. On cut
sectioning there is a 0.5 cm subcapsular simple cyst. The left ovary exhibits
a 0.7 cm diameter white, firm subserosal nodule. The remaining parenchyma of
both ovaries is unremarkable. The right and left fallopian tubes have
gray—tan, smooth and glistening serosal surfaces with hemorrhagic mucosal

surfaces.

A representative section of the endometrium at the area of excrescences is
frozen as 851 and the frozen section remnant is submitted in toto in block-

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
A. "Right ovarian implant": AFl (1 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm) (in toto)— endometrioid

adenocarcinoma
B. "Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries": BFl- (representative —m' imally
invasive endometrioid adenocarcinoma, FIGO II

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: Hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 7th Edition): pT3A pNX pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. "RIGHT OVARIAN IMPLANT" (BIOPSY):

ENDOMETRIOID ADENOCARCINOMA.

B. "UTERUS, CERVIX, TUBES AND OVARIES" (HYSTERECTOMY AND BILATERAL
SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY)

C. "HERNIA SAC" (EXCISION):

MESOTHELIAL-LINED FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE CONSISTENT WITH HERNIA SAC.
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.

COMMENT: There is extensive adenomyosis, much of which is involved by
adenocarcinoma or EIN, making assessment of depth of invasion very
difficult. In the permanent sections, there is an area with numerous glands

LusUJULJ

with no identifiable endometrial stroma that are as deep as 1.2 cm in the wall
(B6). A few of these have an associated desmoplastic stromal reaction and
these are interpreted as invasive. This area was not apparent grossly and was
therefore not sampled at the time of‘ frozen section, accounting for the

difference in depth of invasion between the frozen section and final
¢ diagnosis.
