MIB-l Labeling Index: 5.2%

Microscopic description:

Sections demonstrate a moderately to markedly hypercellular glial neoplasm that
diffusely infiltrates both gray and white matter. The tumor demonstrates several distinct
regional patterns. These include regions with a predominant phenotype. The majority of
these appear to be ordinary gemistocytes but some microgemistocytes are also noted. In
other areas a fibrillary or protoplasmic astrocytoma phenotype predominates. Finally, a
microcystic stroma is focally prominent. Although nuclei tend to be round, and some
have few processes, classic oligodendroglioma differentiation is not seen. Atypia ranges
from mild to marked with the latter regionally present as scattered large, often
multinucleated cells. Mitoses are rare with never more that 2 mitoses per 10 high power
fields. Microvascular proliferation is not seen but there is focal tumor necrosis.
