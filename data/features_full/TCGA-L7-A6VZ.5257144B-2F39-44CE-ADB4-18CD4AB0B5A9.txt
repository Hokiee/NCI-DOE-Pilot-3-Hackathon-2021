Final Surgical Pathology Report C%¢\)7/25‘/I3

 

Procedure:

Diagnosis
A. Esophagus and proximal stomach, resection: Adenocarcinoma,
moderately differentiated, into and focally through the muscularis
propria (pT3); negative margins of resection; fourteen of nineteen
lymph nodes with metastatic carcinoma (14/19).
B. Lymph node, level 8, biopsy: One lymph node with metastatic
carcinoma (1/1).

Microscopic Description:
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma
Histologic grade: Moderately—differentiated

Primary tumor (pT3): Carcinoma into and focally through muscularis
propria

Proximal/distal/radial margins: Negative (closest margin is proximal,
5 mm)

Vascular invasion: Present

Regional lymph nodes (pN): Fifteen of twenty lymph nodes with

metastatic carcinoma (15/20); largest metastatic focus is 1.9 cm.
Extracapsular extension of carcinoma is present.

Other findings: Barrett‘s esophagus. The main tumor mass is distal;
however, additional satellite tumor nodules are present in the upper
esophagus, extending to within 5 mm of the proximal margin. Gastric
mucosa is otherwise unremarkable.

Comment: Desmin immunostaining performed on two tissue blocks to
assess the degree of invasion by carcinoma. Focus of carcinoma
extending through the muscularis propria confirmed by

Specimen
A. Esophagus and stomach
B. Level 8 lymph node

Clinical Information
Esophageal cancer

Gross Description

A. Received fresh labeled "esophagus and stomach" is a previously
unopened 13 cm segment of esophagus with attached 12.0 x 5.0 x 2.5 cm
portion of proximal stomach. The external soft tissue surface of the
esophageal segment is scabrous tan—pink with multiple palpable soft
lymph nodes measuring up to 2.1 cm. The proximal and distal margins
are 4.8 and 23.5 cm in circumference respectively. On opening, there
is a well—circumscribed, 6.0 x 5.8 cm nearly circumferential soft
tan—white—red tumor mass which appears to arise at the gastroesophageal
junction (note the junction is not visually apparent and may be
constituted by a staple line, as multiple staples are recovered from
the area). On sectioning, the lesion has an apparent maximal thickness
of 1.5 cm. A portion of the tumor and a portion of normal mucosa are
submitted for tissue procurement as requested. Multiple additional

soft white pink—red tumor nodules measuring up to 4 cm in greatest
dimension extend from within 1 cm of the proximal margin (as measured
in the fresh state) to within 1 cm of the primary lesion. The largest
additional lesion has a maximal thickness of 0.9 cm. All of the
lesions appear greater than 0.5 cm from the inked surface of the
specimen. The gastric mucosa is tan—pink~red with normal rugal folds
and the wall averages 0.5 cm. '

Summary: 1 — proximal margin with closest lesion,, 2 — perpendicular
sections distal margin, 3 through 8 — primary lesion to inked surface,
9 through 11 — smaller lesions, 12 —possible EGJ, 13 — random gastric,
14 through 17 lymph nodes from esophageal segment as follows: 14 — 5
lymph nodes, 15 - 6 lymph nodes, 16 through 18 — one bisected lymph
node per cassette 19 and 20 — lymph nodes recovered from adipose tissue
associated with gastric portion of specimen as follows: 19 — 4 lymph
nodes, 20 — one bisected lymph node

B. Received in formalin labeled "level 8 lymph node" is a 1.5 x 1.5 x
0.9 cm rubbery tan—white tissue in keeping with lymph node. The
specimen is sectioned and entirely submitted.
