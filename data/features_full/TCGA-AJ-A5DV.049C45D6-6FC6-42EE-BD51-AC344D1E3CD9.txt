G ross Description
"A. FSA.“ All frozen section tissue is submitted in cassette “FSA!

"A. NFSA.‘ The speclmen consists of a 98 gram. previously bisected uterus with attached cervix. Upon possible
reconstruction. this measures 10.5 x 4.5 x 5.5 cm. The semsa is pink’lan with no adhesions. The cervical neck is inked as
follows anterior cowl-i neck orange and posterior cervical neck black. The ectocervix ls pink-tan, smooth and glistening and
averages 1.6 x23! cm. The as is patent. Previous sectioning revealsa tan-brown. soft. friable mace involving the entire
endometrial cavity. This measures 4.8 cm superior to interior. 3.6 am left to right. and 2.5 cm anterior to posterior. This mass
grossly appears to be conﬁned to the inner one-half aspect of the myometrium and comes to within 0.5 cm of the cervical
neck. involving the anterior cervical neck is a 0.7 cm cervical polyp. “there are no intramural. submucosal, or subsarosal
nodules.

Attached to the uterus is a possible previously ligated fallopian tube with attached iimbriae. This measures 3.7 x 0.5 cm. There
is also an attached previously bisected left ovary, which measures 2.8 x i2 3: 0.5 cm. Previous sectioning reveals a pink-tan,
solid cut surface.

Attached to the uterus Is a right failopl'an tube with iimbrlae. which measures 2.3 x 0.4 cm. There is also an attached previously
bisected right ovary. which measures approximately 2.0 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm. Previous sectioning reveals a pink-tan. soild cut
surface. "A1: left para-uterine vessels; “A2." right parauterine vessels; "A3." anterior cervix to include cowlcal polyp; ”A4."
anterior cervical neck: "A5~A7,' anterior endomyomebium; “A8,“ posterior cervix; 'AQ.“ poslerior cervical neck; “Mo-A12."
posterior endomyomelrlum; 'A13.‘ left tube and ovary: “A14." right tube and ovary.

"B, Hemla sac." The specimen consists of 1 fragment of ﬁbrcmsmbranous tissue. measuring 9.2 cm in greatest dimension.
'3," fragments. representative. .

“C. Right pelvic node." The specimen consists of a 3.2 x 2.7 x 1.0 cm yellow-red. fatty fragment. On examination a 1.5 cm-
red~tan. possible lymph node is Identiﬁed. A repraenlallve section is submitted into cassette ”C."

"D. Left pelvic node.” The specimen consists of 2 yellow-tan, fatty fragments measuring 6.5 and 7.2 cm. On examination, 2
possible lymph nodes are Identiﬁed. These measure 1.1 and 1.4 cm. Representative sectionsof each are submitted Into
cassette 'D.‘

“E. Left common lilac.“ The specimen consists of a 13 x 2.12 x 0.3 cm aggregate of yellow-tan. fatty fragments. On

examination. 2 possible lymph nodes are identified. Thesemaasure 0.4 and 12 cm. All lymphoid tissue is submitted into
mesons-“E." representative. ,
