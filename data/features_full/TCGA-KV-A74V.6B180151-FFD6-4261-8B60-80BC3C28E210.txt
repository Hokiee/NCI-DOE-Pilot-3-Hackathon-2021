_ Surgical Pathology Report —

Specimen #1 is received in formalin labeled perinephric fat and consists of a 5.0 x 5.0 x 1.5 cm aggregate of tan-yellow, soft to

lobulated fibroadipose tissue. The specimen is serially sectioned and no gross lesions are identified. Representative sections are
submitted labeled 1A-1B.

Specimen #2 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled right renal mass and surrounding fat and consists of a 9
gram, 3.6 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm partial nephrectomy specimen. The parenchyma! margin is inked in blue. the capsule is inked in black.
The parenchymal margin appears intact and the capsule margin appears smooth, and intact. The specimen is serially sectioned to
identify a 2.5 x 2.2 x 1.6 cm tan-pink, focally hemorrhagic mass measuring 0.2 cm from the nearest parenchymal margin and
abutting the capsule. The adjacent renal parenchyma is tan-brown, soft. A representative portion of the normal and mass are
submitted for TCGA study. Representative sections are submitted labeled as follows:

2A-2F: tumor to adjacent parenchyma and capsule (2A closest parenchymal margin)

2G: uninvolved parenchyma
2H: surrounding adipose tissue.

lntraogerative Consult Diagnosis
2A/GDX: TUMOR MEASURES ~2MM AWAY FROM THE CLOSEST PARENCHYMAL MARGIN.
