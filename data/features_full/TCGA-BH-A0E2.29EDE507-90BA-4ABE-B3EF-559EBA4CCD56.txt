NOTTINGHAM GRADE 3 (TU LE FORMATION: 3, NUCLEAR PLEOMORPHISM: 3. MITOTIC ACTIVITY: 3; TOTAL
SCORE: 919).
INVASIVE TUMOR MEASURES 2.5 x 2.3 x 2.0 CM.
DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS). NUCLEAR GRADE .3. SOLID, CRIBRIFORM MICROPAPILLARY AND CLEAR
CELL TYPES WITH COMEDONECROSIS AND ASSOCIATED CALCIFICATIONS.
THE DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS) CONSTITUTES 50v. OF THE TOTAL TUMOR VOLUME AND Is
PRESENT ADMIXED WITH THE INVASIVE COMPONENT.
THE DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS) Is PRESENT IN 12122 SLIDES.

NO LYMPHOVASCULAR SPACE INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

RESECTION MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA. DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITu (DCIS) IS 4.0 MM
FROM THE NEAREST ANTERIOR MARCIN. THE INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS GREATER THAN 1.0 CM FROM ALL
MARCINS.

THE NIPPLE Is INVOLVED BY DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU.

SKIN IS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

NON-NEOPLASTIC BREAST: INTRADUCTAL PAPILLOMA AND FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES WITH
FIBROADENOMATOID NODULES.

BIOPSY SITE CHANGES WITH FAT NECROSIS.

METASTATIC CARCINOMA INVOLVING FOUR OF TWENTY-SIX LYMPH NODES (4125).

THE LARGEST METASTATIC FOCUS MEASURES 2.0 CM.

EXTRACAFSULAR EXTENSION IS IDENTIFIED AND MEASURES 1 MM.

THE INVASIVE TUMOR CELLS TESTED POSITIVE FOR ESTROGEN AND WEAKLY POSITIVE FOR

PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS AND NEGATIVE FOR HER-2. As PER PREVIOUS PATHOLOGY REPORT
