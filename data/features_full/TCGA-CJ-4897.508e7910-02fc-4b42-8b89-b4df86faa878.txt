DIAGNOSIS

 

(A) RIGHT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL:

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (90% CLEAR CELLS AND 10% EOSINOPHILIC CELLS),
FUHRMAN'S NUCLEAR GRADE 3.

TUMOR EXTENDS INTO THE PERINEPHRIC ADIPOSE TiSSUE.

TUMOR INVADES THE ADRENAL GLAND. (SEE COMMENT)

TUMOR INVADES THE RENAL VEIN. "

THE TUMOR MEASURES 13.5 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION.

Vascular, ureteral and soft tissue margins, free of tumor.

COMMENT
The tumor extends Into the perinephric adipose tissue compressing the adrenal gland. In addltlon, the tumor focally invades the adrenal

gland by direct extension.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
(A) RIGHT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL â€” A nephrectomy specimen (25.5 x13.5 x 9.0 cm) including compressed adrenal gland (6.0 x 3.0 x 0.1

cm) and ureter (8.0 x 0.5 cm).

A 13.5 x 9.0 x 0.5 cm solid and cystic, yellow-red, heterogeneous tumor ls present. The tumor ls mainly located within the upper lobe,
extending to the mid third and lower pole of the kidney. The tumor has myxoid, degenerative-looking areas, as well as hemorrhagic and
necrotlc feel. The tumor involves the perinephrlc fat, bulging out from the kidney and extendlng up to the adrenal gland, which is
grossly compressed by the tumor. The tumor involves the renal sinus but does not extend to the pelvicalyceal system. A tumoral
thrombus is present intralumlnally within the renaE vein, 1.0 cm away from the vein margin. The soft tissue margins appear to be free of
tumor. Portions of the tumor are submitted for possible electron microscopic studies and for tissue bank.

The uninvolved kidney parenchyma is unremarkable.

INK CODE: Black - soft tlssue margin.
SECTION CODE: A1, renal vein, renal artery and ureter marglns; A2-A7, tumor in relatlon to adrenal gland; A8~A12, tumor in relation to

perinephrlc fat (A11 and A12 include tumor within the perlnephrio fat); A13, tumor within the renal sinus; A14, tumor in relation to the
pelvlcalyceal system; A15, A16, tumor within renal vein, in relation to petvlcalyceal system; A17, tumor with renal vein; A18, tumor within
vein wlth adjacent renal parenchyma; A19, tumor wlth renal parenchyma; A20, nontumoral kidney parenchyma.

CLINICAL HISTORY
Right renal mass.
