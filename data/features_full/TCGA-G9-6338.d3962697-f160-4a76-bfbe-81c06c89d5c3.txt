GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE
Received fresh is a tan—pink fragment of fibrofatty tissue (5 x 2.4 x .5 cm). Dissection reveals two lymph
nodes (1 x .6 x .3 cm and 1.2 x .5 x .3 cm). Touch preps are taken and the specimen is submitted In
cassettes as follows:
A1: one lymph node
A2: one lymph node

B. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES
Received fresh is a tan~pink fragment of ﬁbrofatty tissue (3 x t x .5 cm). No lymph node is grossly
identiﬁed. Touch preps are taken and submitted entirely in cassette in Bl.

C. PROSTATE

Received fresh for tissue procurement and labeled with the patient’s name designated "prostate", is a
resected prostate gland weighing 60 grams and measuring 4.2 cm from right to left, 3.5 cm from apex to
base and 9 cm from anterior to posterior. The external capsule is red, smooth and intact. The
specimen is inked as loltows: apex—red, anterior-orange. base-blue, posterior-black, left-yellow and
right-green. Cut section of the specimen shows a tan spongy ﬁbrous tissue. The apex and base are
removed from the prostate and the prostate proper weighs 35 grams. The specimen is serially
sectioned into levels from apex to base. The right seminal vesicle is 4.7 cm in length with a diameter of
0.3 cm and the right seminal vesicle is 4.1 x 3.5 x 1 cm. The left vas deferens is 3.7 cm in length with a
diameter of 0.4 cm and the right seminal vesicle is 4.5 M x 0.5 cm. It is serially sectioned and the vas
deferens shows a tan, ﬁrm tubular structure. The seminal vesicle has a tan cyst-like tissue. Alternate
levels of the specimen are submitted for tissue procurement. The remainder of the prostate gland is
submitted for microscopic evaluation. Sections are submitted in tolo as follows:

Ci: level I, right anterior

(32: level I, right posterior

C3: level I, left anterior

C4: level i, left posterior

DIAGNOSIS:

A. LYMPH NODE, RlGHT PELViC REGEON, EXCISION:
- TWO BENIGN LYMPH NODES (0i2)

B. LYMPI—l NODE, LEFT PELVIC REGION, EXCISION:
- FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE WITH NO EVIDENCE OF CARCINOMA; NO LYMPH NODES IDENTIFEED.

C. PROSTATE, PROSTATECTOMY:

- PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON GRADE 4 + 3 = 7/10, ENVOLVING RIGHT AND LEFT
LOBES OF PROSTATE AND AN ESTIMATED 50% OF GLAND PARENCHYMA.

- ADENOCARCINOMA PRESENT AT LEFT APEX INKED SURFACE (FOCAL, 2 MILLIMETERS).

- PERINEURAL INVASION IDENTIFIED.
