SPECIMEN TYPE: Whipples

CLINICAL NOTES:
IPMN Whipple’s procedure. Coeliac axis. Lymph node.

NOTE: Block A1 neck on face (involved). A2-A5 periuncinate margin.

FROZEN SECTION REPORT:

Invasive mucinous (colloid) adenocarcinoma arising from an IPMN is present.
The invasive adenocarcinoma is clear of the neck margin. IPMN with moderate
dysplasia extends to the neck margin.

SYNOPTIC REPORT FOR WHIPPLE’S RESECTION
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled: Whipple specimen

Specimen Type:
Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple’s resection), partial pancreatectomy

Length of duodenum: 240mm.

Length of lesser curve of stomach: 60mm.
Length of greater curve of stomach: 75mm.
Size of gallbladder: 75mm in length and 35mm in diameter.
Wall thickness of gallbladder: up to 5mm.
Calculi in gallbladder: none

Size of and weight of spleen: N/A.

Length of bile duct: 35mm.

Maximum diameter of bile duct: 3mm.

Tumour location:

Pancreatic head. There is a tumour, 60 x 45 x 40mm with mucinous appearance
(lPMN on frozen report). There is a colloid focus arising within the IPMN,

30mm in maximum dimension, likely to be invasive adenocarcinoma.

The new margins are inked as follows: neck blue, portal vein bed red,

MICROSCOPIC:
SYNOPTIC REPORT FOR WHIPPLE’S RESECTION:

Tumour location: pancreatic head

Histologic type (WHO classification): IPMN (Intraductal papillary mucinous
neoplasm) with associated invasive colloid (mucinous)adenocarcinoma.
Histologic grade (TNM grading system): Moderately differentiated.

Tumour size: 60 x 45 x 40mm (invasive component 30mm in maximum dimension)
Extension out of pancreas: Colloid carcinoma does appear to bulge into
peripancreactic fat posteriorly.

Small vessel (capillary/lymphatic) invasion: not seen

Large vessel (vein/artery) invasion: not seen.

Perlneural invasion: not seen

Perineural invasion of retroperitoneal (periuncinate) neural plexus: Not seen.

Distance of invasive tumour from resection margins:
Pancreatic neck: 40mm

Periuncinate soft tissue: 30mm

Posterior retroperitoneal: 25mm

Portal vein bed: 10mm

Common bile duct: 45mm

IPMN does extend to the ampulla within the dilated duct system.

SPECIMEN TYPE: Whipples

pT: 3
pN: 0

Overall stage: IIA
Additional pathologic comments and findings in other resected organs:

The surrounding pancreas is atrophic with a generalised loss of acinar tissue.
There is focal preservation of islets within iibrotic stroma.

The common bile duct is largely denuded but no evidence of in-situ or invasive
malignancy is seen.

The gallbladder show fibromuscular thickening of the wall with chronic
inflammation.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:
MUG-1: negative

MUG-2: positive

MUG-SAC: negative

MUG-6: negative

CDX2: positive

These results would indicate that the tumour is of intestinal type.

SUMMARY:

Tumour type: IPMN with associated invasive colloid (mucinous)
adenocarcinomacarcinoma

Tumour grade: moderately differentiated

Tumour location: pancreatic head

Tumour size: 60 x 45 x 40mm (invasive component 30mm in maximum dimension)
Lymph nodes: 0/14

Stage: "A

Margins: IPMN at the neck margin, the invasive component is clear of all

margins.
