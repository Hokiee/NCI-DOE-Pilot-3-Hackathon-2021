COMMENT: The residual melanoma has some "small cell" morphologic features. Although deeper than
seen In the original biopsy 0, this does not impact staging.

The interpretation of the above immunohistochemistry stain or stains is guided by published results in
the medical literature, provided package Information from the manufacturer and by internal review of
staining performance and assay validation within the . . The use of
one or more reagents in the above tests is regulated as an analyte speciﬁc reagent (ASR). These tests
were developed and their performance characteristic determined by the .

_ They have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The
FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.

Special stains and/or immunohistochemical stains were performed with appropriately stained positive
and/or negative controls.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. RIGHT AXILLARY SLN #1
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "right axillary SLN #1" is a 5.2 x 2.2 x 0.9 cm
lymph node. It is sectioned and has a peripheral area of red-brown discoloration. The remainder has a
yellow-tan fatty cut surface; submitted entirely, A1-A4.
B. RIGHT AXILLARY SLN #2
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "right axillary SLN #2" is a 2.9 x 2.2 x 1.3 cm
piece of soft tissue containing a 2.2 x 1.6 x 0.9 cm lymph node. The lymph node Is sectioned and has a

peripheral area of red-tan coloration and the remainder is yellow-tan; lymph node is submitted entirely,
81.

C. WIDE EXCISION ANTERIOR RIGHT CHEST MELANOMA

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "wide excision anterior chest melanoma" is
an oval shaped piece of tan skin, 8 x 6 cm excised to a depth of 4 cm with a suture designating the
lateral/12:00 position. There is a mottled brown-tan-black mass, 4.2 x 3 x 1 cm. located 1.5 cm from the
closest/inferior margin. The superior margin is inked blue, inferior orange. and deep black. On
sectioning, it grossly appears to superﬁcial depth of invasion. A photograph is taken and tissue is
procured; representatively submitted:

C1-C12: shave of entire margin submitted clockwise from 12:00 position

C13-C16: mass

017-021: perpendicular sections of entire deep margin, subjacent to lesion, lateral to medial

D. ADDITIONAL LATERAL MARGIN

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "additional lateral margin" is a triangular
shaped piece of tan skin, 6 x 3 cm excised to a depth of 3 cm with a suture designating the ﬁnal lateral
margin. The skin surface is unremarkable. The superior margin is inked blue inferior orange, and old
surgical margin green. Sectioning reveals no discrete lesions; representatively submitted:

D1: lateral tip

DZ-D3: shave of old surgical margin

E. ADDITIONAL MEDIAL MARGIN

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "additional medial margin" is a triangular
shaped piece of tan skin, 6.5 x 3 cm excised to a depth of 1.3 cm with a suture designating the ﬁnal
medial margin. Skin surface has a smooth purple-tan papule, 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.1 cm located 0.5 cm from the
previous surgical margin. It has superﬁcial depth of invasion; representatively submitted:

E1: new medial tip

E2—E3: shave of previous surgical margin

E4: purple-tan papule with margins
