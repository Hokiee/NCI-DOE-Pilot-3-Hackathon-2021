CLINICAL HISTORY:
Infiltrating ductal cancer by incisional biopsy.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Left/breast". Received fresh is a 600 gram, 17 x 14 x 4 cm breast with a
7 x 5 x 2.5 cm axillary tail. There is a 15 x 10 cm skin ellipse with a 4 cm
in diameter areolar and a 1 cm in diameter nipple. 5 cm superior and lateral
to the nipple is a 2.5 cm well~healed scar. On cut section, a 5.5 x 4 x 3.5
cm firm tan~white mass lies deep to the skin incision. Within the mass is a l
x 1 x 1 cm hemorrhagic capsule. The mass appears well-circumscribed but
approaches to within 2 mm of the deep margin. No other lesions are noted.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Al—AZ- nipple.

A3- scar and previous biopsy capsule.
A4—A5- representative sections of tumor.
A6—A7- deep margin.

AB- upper inner quadrant.

A9- lower inner quadrant.

A16— four lymph node candidates, distal third.

  

Case [5

B. "Rotter's node". Received fresh is a 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm firm node which is
bisected and submitted in toto in Block Bl.

 

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

The carcinoma is growing as rounded masses composed of nests and trabeculae
of carcinoma. There is extensive necrosis. 10 mitoses per 10 high power fields
are present. The pattern of growth makes it difficult to be certain what is
invasive and what is in—situ with cancerization of the lobules.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. "LEFT BREAST" (MASTECTOMY):

BREAST WITH RESIDUAL INFILTRATING DUCTAL_CARCINOMA, NSABP HISTOLOGIC GRADE
, NUCLEAR GRADE MODERATELY—DIFFERENTIATED.

SIZE IS 5.5 X 4 X 3.5 CM. INCLUDING PRIOR BIOPSY CAVITY.

LESS THAN 5% IDENTIFIABLE AS INTRADUCTAL CARCINOMA, SOLID AND COMEDO TYPES.

THE CARCINOMA IS WITHIN 1 MM OF THE DEEP MARGIN.

NO LYMPHATIC INVASION IS SEEN.

BENIGN CHANGES OF THE BREAST INCLUDING APOCRINE METAPLASIA AND DUCT
ECTASIA.

NIPPLE WITH NO PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS.

26 LYMPH NODES WITH NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
