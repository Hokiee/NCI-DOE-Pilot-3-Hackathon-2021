thickness. The right ureter measures 4 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter and
appear to be dilated. The left uretermeasures 2 cm in length by 0.5 cm in
diameter. The prostate measures 5 x 4 x 4 cm. The prostatic urethra measures 3 cm

It consists of multiple fragments of yellow-tan, soft tissue measuring 6 x 4 x 2 cm
in aggregate. Multiple lymph nodes are identified with the largest one measuring
2.8 cm in greatest dimension. The largest lymph node is bisected and the specimen
is entirely submitted in three cassettes.

P: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled “Hypogastric lymph node left."
It consists of a fragment of yellow-tan, soft tissue measuring 5 x 2 x 0.8 cm.

One lymph node is identified measuring 3 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph node
is bisected and the specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.

G: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Presacral lymph node." It
consists of a fragment of pink-tan, soft tissue measuring 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm. Two
lymph nodes are identified with the largest one measuring 0.7 cm in greatest
dimension. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

H: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled “Left common iliac lymph
node.“l It consists of a fragment of pink-tan, soft tissue measuring 2.2 x 1 x 0.5
cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.

I: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right cloquet lymph node."
It consists of a fragment of yellow-tan, soft tissue measuring 3 x 2 x 1 cm. Two
possible lymph nodes are identified with the largest one measuring 1.8 cm in
greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are bisected and the specimen is entirely
submitted in one cassette.

J: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right obturator lymph nodes."

It consists of multiple fragments of yellow—tan soft tissue measuring 7 x 5 x 1 cm
in aggregate. One lymph nodes is identified which measures 3 cm in greatest
dimension. The specimen is entirely submitted in three cassettes.

K: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled “Right external iliac lymph
node." It consists of a fragment of yellow-tan soft tissue measuring 3 x 1.5 x 0.5
cm. One lymph node is identified measuring 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. The
lymph node is bisected and the specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.

L: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right hypogastric lymph
node." It consists of a fragment of yellow-tan soft tissue measuring 2 x 1 x 0.5
cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.

M: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right common iliac lymph
node." It consists of a fragment of yellow-tan soft tissue meausring 2 x 1 x 1 cm.
One lymph node is identified which measures 0.9 cm in greatest dimension. The
lymph node is bisected and the specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.

N: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Left proximal ureter." It
consists of a segment of ureter measuring 1.5 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter.
Two metallic clips closest to the proximal margin are identified. The proximal
margin is submitted in one cassette.

0: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled “Right proximal ureter." It
consists of a segment of ureter measuring 1.6 cm in length by 0.7 cm in diameter.

M CROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:

A—B: See final microscopic—diagnosis.
C:

Sections of the fungating seen grossly on the left posterior trigone region of
bladder corresponding histologically to a poorly differentiated invasive
transitional cell carcinoma, grade 4/4 (CS-10). The neoplastic cells have high N/C
ratios with large pleomorphic nuclei and are arranged in solid sheets. The
cytoplasm shows clear cell change. There is focal squamous metaplasia present as
well as frequent mitosis. A moderate inflammatory response to the tumor is noted.
The tumor extends through the muscularis propria. The radial inked resection
margins are free of tumor. No associated transitional cell carcinoma in situ
identified. No definitive lymphovascular space invasion is seen.

Sections of the prostate show extensive neoplastic process involving the right
and left lobes from distal to proximal (C17-20,24). The tumor is characterized
predominantly by irregularly shaped and variably sized malignant glands that
randomly infiltrate the stroma. A small component of the tumor show malignant
gland fusion. The neoplastic cells are medium to large with high nuclear to
cytoplasmic ratios, vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli. The prostatic

invasive carcinoma, the prostatic parenchyma shows high grade prostatic

stratified layers of enlarged cells with large nuclei and prominent nucleoli.
