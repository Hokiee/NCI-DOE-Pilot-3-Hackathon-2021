Comment

This tumor replaces the entire thyroid gland in an infiltrative pattern. The diffuse nature of this
tumor is reminiscent of the diffuse sclerosing variant, but in this case the abundant ﬁbrosis,
psammoma bodies and chronic inﬂammation that characterize that variant are not seen. The
tumor extends to the painted margins of resection in right and left lobes and in the isthmus. There
is unequivocal lymphatic invasion, and regions suspicious for, but not diagnostic of angioinvasion
are seen.

This report has been amended to add the lymph node involvement from a previous specimen

( ). in addition, since the resection margins are involved by tumor and no extrathyroidal
tissue is included in the specimen, evaluation of extrathyroidal extension cannot be performed on
this specimen. lntraoperative ﬁndings may alter the stage of the primary tumor.

Gross Description

1. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "Lymph Node: Apical node right posterior
triangle" consists of a piece of tan—brown tissue measuring 1.4 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm.

1A bisected and submitted in toto.

2. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "Neck: Content right neck double stitch
marks apex + single stitch marks posterior” consists of a piece of ﬁbroadipose tissue that is
oriented with two stitches and measures 14.0 x 6.0 x 1.3 cm and contains multiple lymph nodes
that range from 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm to 1.7 x 1.2 x 1.1 cm. One piece of the largest nodule is stored
frozen. The lymph nodes are submitted in toto from apex to base as follows:

2A two lymph nodes.

28 one lymph node bisected.

20 one lymph node bisected.

2D 3 lymph nodes

2E remainder of the largest lymph node.

2F one lymph node bisected.

3. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "Neck: Apex right posterior triangle"
consists of a piece of yellow-brown tissue measuring in 1.8 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm.
3A bisected and submitted in toto.

4. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "Neck: Left neck content stitch marked
apex double superior single posterior" consists of a piece of ﬁbroadipose tissue that is oriented
with two stitches and measures 10.5 x 5.0 x 1.4 cm and contains multiple lymph nodes that range
from 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm to 2.3 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm. The lymph nodes are submitted in toto from apex to
base as follows:

4A two lymph nodes.

48 3 lymph nodes.

4C two lymph nodes

40 one lymph node bisected.

4E one lymph node bisected

4F one lymph node bisected.

4G two lymph nodes

4H one lymph node bisected

4i two lymph nodes.

5. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "Surgical Waste" consists of two pieces

of fatty tissue measuring 1.7 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm in 2.5 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. Within the fatty tissue one lymph
node is identiﬁed measuring 1.4 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm.

5A representative sections submitted

6. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "Trachea: Right paratracheai node"
consists of 3 pieces of pale tan tissue measuring from 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm to 2.5 x 1.1 x 1.0 cm.
6A-B submitted in toto.

7. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "Thyroid: Total thyroid stitch marks upper
pole left lobe" consists of a thyroid gland that is oriented with a stitch and weighs 24.3 g. The
right lobe measures 3.6 cm Si x 2.5 cm ML x 1.3 cm AP, the left lobe measures 3.4 cm Sl x 2.3
cm ML x 0.9 cm AP and the isthmus measures 3.5 cm Si x 1.5 cm ML x 0.5 cm AP. The external
surfaces have ﬁbrous adhesions. There is a piece of fatty tissue attached on the inferior aspect
of the thyroid measuring 5.5 cm Si x 4.0 cm ML x 1.1 cm AP No parathyroid glands are
identiﬁed. Multiple lymph nodes are identified from the soft tissue attached to the inferior aspect
of the thyroid; they measure from 0.7 m to 2.0 cm. The external surface is painted with silver
nitrate. The upper and lower pole of e right and left lobe contain multiple delineated nodules;
the largest nodule in the left lobe superior pole measures 1.6 cm Si x 0.8 cm ML x 0.6 cm AP.
The remainder of the thyroid tissue is unremarkable. Sections of larger nodules and normal
tissue are stored frozen. The remainder of the specimen is submitted as follows:

7A-F right lobe, superior to inferior

7G-H isthmus

7l-L left lobe, superior to inferior

7M two lymph nodes

7N two lymph nodes

70 one lymph node bisected

7P-Q one lymph node serially sectioned

7R—T remainder of the fatty tissue.
