CASE HISTORY:
Previous history of melanoma left ankle

Patient aware of a lump in left groin over past 3 weeks.
?metastatic melanoma.

MACROSCOPIC:
3 air—dried slides dated

MICROSCOPY:

This is a densely cellular sample with a background lymphoid
population and abundant individual and loosely cohesive groups of
atypical epithelioid cells with prominent nucleoli and some cells
with double nuclei. There are scattered melanophages. Features are
those of metastatic malignant melanoma within the lymph node.

DIAGNOSIS:
FNA LEFT GROIN: METASTATIC MELANOMA

**SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT **
LAB No:

CASE HISTORY:

Left groin metastatic melanoma proven on fine needle aspirate. ?
Size and number of nodes involved.? Extracapsular spread of
melanoma. Some of specimen has already been tissue banked.

MACROSCOPIC:

1.Left groin dissection: ellipse of skin with a scar measuring 14 x
2 cm, there is underlying fibrofatty tissue containing lymph nodes.
There is a large area which was received inked containing a nodule
measuring 2 x 2 X 1.5 cm. The nodule appears to extend onto the
deep margin, and capsule received disrupted as was already sampled
for tissue banking before receipt. Skin sampling is A and B. C
onwards is nodule. C and D are both nodule with margins inked. Two
other nodules were found, one of which measures 0.8 cm in diameter
and is situated 1 cm from deep margin. The third nodule measures
0.5 cm and is situated 1.6 cm from the deep margin. Nodule number 2
in E. Nodule number 3 in F. Rest of large nodule inked green all
embedded in G,H,I,J.

2.Pelvic clearance left side: fibrofatty tissue containing nodes
measuring 14.5 x 2 x 1.5cm. No attached skin was seen. A total of
seven nodes were found, the largest measures 2.3 x 1.2 cm and the
smallest measures 1 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. Largest in A. Smallest in F.

MICROSCOPY:

1. Microscopic examination of the left groin dissection shows
metastatic melanoma in the largest lymph node, measuring maximum
diameter of 20 mm. Within this tissue oh there is an area of focal
extracapsular spread measuring a maximum diameter of 4 mm. 2 other
nodes found show reactive changes only. Tissue from the skin shows
scar tissue with out any melanocytic lesion.

The lymph node containing metastatic melanoma and extracapsular
spread shows a disrupted capsule and ink onto the capsule of the
node, which appears to be related to tissue banking which was done
before a dissection of the specimen.

2. Microscopic examination of the pelvic clearance from the left

side shows a total of 7 small lymph nodes, all of which show
reactive changes.

DIAGNOSIS:

1. LEFT GROIN DISSECTION: METASTATIC MELANOMA WITH EXTRACAPSULAR
SPREAD IN ONE OF 3 LYMPH NODES.

2. PELVIC CLEARANCE LEFT SIDE: 7 LYMPH NODES SHOWING REACTIVE
CHANGES ONLY.
