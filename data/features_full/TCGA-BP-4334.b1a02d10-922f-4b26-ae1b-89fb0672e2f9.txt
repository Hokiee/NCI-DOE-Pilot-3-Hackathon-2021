 

Clinical Diaqnosls & History:

Renal mass, incidentally found.

Sgecimens Submitted:
1: SP: RI. kidney, poriion of azlrenai gland and hilar lymph nocia -

2: SP: Poﬁion nf rt. 11m rib -
3: SP: Fat over tumor and colon

 

 

DIAGNOSIS:

1) KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND; NEPHRECTOMY AND ADRENALECTOMY:
— RENAL CELL CARCINOMA. CLEAR CELL TYPE {CONVENTIONAL TYPE), NUCLEAR GRADE III/IV WITH FOCAL
GRADE IV AREAS. THE PATTERN OF GROWTH ES SOLID. FOCAL METAPEASTEC OSSEFICATION IS ALSO
SEEN. THE TUMOR GREATEST DIAMETER IS 11.5 CM. THE TUMOR EXTENDS THROUGH THE RENAL
CAPSULE BUT IS CONFINED WITHIN GEROTA’S FASCIA. NO INVASION OF THE RENAL VEIN IS IDENTIFIED.
HOWEVER. FNTRATUMORAL VASCULAR INVASION IS PRESENT. ALL SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF
TUMOR. THE NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY IS UNREMARKABLE. THE ADRENAL GLAND lS UNREMARKABLE.
THE LYMPH MODE. STATUS IS AS FOLLOWS (EXPRESSED AS THE NUMBER OF METASTATIC NODES IN
RELATION TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF NODES EXAMINED): RENAL HELAR: 011.

2) RIB. PORTION OF RIGHT 11TH; EXCISION:
— GROSSLY UNREMARKABLE. SECTIONS NOT YET READY BECAUSE OF NEED TO DECALCIFY. IF

SIGNIFICANT MICROSCOPIC ABNORMALITTES ARE FOUND, AN ADDENDUM REPORT WILL BE ISSUED.

3) “FAT OVER TUMOR AND COLON"; BIOPSY:
— FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE. NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

SURGECAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

1) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right Kidney. Portion of Adrenal Gland and Hiiar Lymph Nodes". it consists of
a nephrectomy specimen with an overall dimension of 24.0 x 14.0 x 11.0 cm. The vascular and ureteral margins are identiﬁed and
uninvolved by tumor. A portion of adrenal gland at the superior pole of the kidney, measuring 1.5 cm in greatest dimension is
identiﬁed and is unremarkable. The lowar pole of the kidney demonstrates a bulging mass. A longtitudinal section through the
specimen demonstrates a large, orange-yellow, soft to firm mass arising from the lower pole of the kidney, measuring 11.5 cm in
greatest dimension. Areas of hemorrhage and local necrosis are also identiﬁed. The perioreteral junction superior to the mass
appears to be somewhat dilated. The tumor penetrates through the renal capsule and is predominantly present in the perirenal
fat. Sections through the tumor demonstrates that the tumor comes to less than 1 mm to the parirenal tat surgical margin. N0
deﬁnite lymph nodes are identiﬁed in the hilar lat. Representative sections ofthe specimen. including some hiiar fat. are
submitted.

Summary of Sections:
VM — venousmargin

AM w arterial margin

UM ~ ureteral margin

AD — adrenal gland

M ,. margin to the tumor to pcrirenai fat
TK — tumor to kidney

TP —- tumor to pelvis

TF H tumor to pertrenai fat
T — tumor

K — normal kidney

H ~ hilar fat

2) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Portion of rt. ’r‘lth rib ". it consists of two pieces of rib measuring 12.0 x 1.5 x
0.8 cm. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted after decal.

   

Summary of Sections:
U ~ undasignated

 

3} The specimen is received in formalin. labeled “Fat otter tumor and coion ". it consists of a single piece of adipose tissue
measuring 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. Entirely submitted.
