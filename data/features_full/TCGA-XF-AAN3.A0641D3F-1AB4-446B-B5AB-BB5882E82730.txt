CLINICAL INFORMATION:

Pro—0p Dx: Bladder cancer

 

Post-0p Dx: Same as pre-op

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Rt. ureter f/s". It
consists of a segment of ureter with periureteral soft tissue measuring 0.3 cm-in

length and 0.7 cm in diameter. The specimen is totally submitted for frozen
section in cassette AFS.

B: The specimen is received fresh from the 0.R. and labeled “Lt. distal ureter
f/s". It consists of a segment of ureter with periureteral soft tissue measuring

0.3 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter. The specimen is totally submitted for
frozen section in cassette BPS.

C: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Apical urethral
margin". It consists of a pink—tan irregular portion of tissue measuring 2.8 x 0.3
x 0.2 cm. Totally submitted for frozen section in cassette CFS.

D: The speCimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled l'Bladder/prostate".

It consists of a cystoprostatectomy specimen measuring overall 15 x 11 x 6 cm.

The posterior surface of the specimen is covered by peritoneum measuring 11 x 11.5
x 0.1 cm and shows a tan, firm, polypoid nodule in the lower portion of the
retrovesical region measuring 2.5 x 1.3 x 0.7 cm. The peritoneum surrounding this
region shows puckering and fibrosis. The rest of the peritoneal surface is
unremarkable. The bladder itself measures 7 x 6.5 x 4.5 cm with palpable bulging
nodules. The prostate measures 4.5 x 3.5 x 3.4 cm. The right seminal vesicle
measures 3 x 1 x 0.8 cm, and the left seminal vesicle measures 2.8 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm.
The outer surface of the bladder and prostate is.inked black. Opening the specimen
anteriorly reveals the prostatic urethra to measure 3 cm in length and 4.2 cm in
circumference. The prostatic urethra is covered by pale tan glistening mucosa with
no excavation. The verumontanum measures 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. There is an
ulcerated exophytic tan—brown necrotic mass covering the entire posterior wall and
dome of the bladder measuring 6.5 x 5.5 x 2 cm. The tumor is seen involving the
entire bladder wall with extension into perivesical fatty tissue up to peritoneal
Surface. The depth of invasion is approximately 2 cm. The rest of the bladder
mucosa shows erythematous nodules varying in size from 0.3 to 0.6 cm. The
uninvolved wall of the bladder is 0.9 cm in thickness and the involved wall is 2 cm
in thickness. Both ureterovesical junctions are identified, patent and probed
revealing the right ureter to be 5 cm in length and 1.5 cm in circumference, and
the left 5 cm in length and 2 to 2.5 cm in circumference. The left ureter is more
dilated compared to right, although both ureters are dilated. Both ureters are
covered by pale tan glistening unremarkable mucosa. On serial sectioning, the
prostate shows no definite malignancy. At the request of the surgeon, an
intraoperative gross consultation is performed and the findings are discussed.
Representative sections are submitted in 35 cassettes.

E: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Lt. L.N. of eloquet“. It
consists of a lymph node with fatty tissue measuring 1 x 1 x 0.3 cm overall.
Totally submitted in one cassette.

F1 The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Lt. external iliac L.N.". It

consists of lymph nodes with fibrofatty tissue measuring 2 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm overall.
Totally submitted in one cassette.

consists of lymph nodes with fibrofatty tissue measuring 5 x 3 x 1 cm overall.
Totally submitted in two cassettes.

H: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Lt. hypogastric L.N.". It

consists of lymph nodes with fibrofatty tissue measuring 1 x 1 x 0.3 cm overall.
Totally submitted in one cassette.

I: p The specimen is received in formalin and labeled “Lt. common iliac L.N.". It
consists of fibrofatty tissue with lymph nodes measuring 1.1 x 0.6 x 0.3 overall.
Totally submitted in one cassette.

J: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Rt. hypogastric L.N.“. It

consists of fibrofatty tissue with lymph nodes measuring 4 x 1 x 0.8 cm overall.
Totally submitted in two cassettes.

K: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Rt. obturator L.N."; It
consists of fibrofatty tissue with lymph nodes measuring 5 x 3 x 1 cm overall.
Totally submitted in three cassettes.

L: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled “Rt. common iliac L.N.". It

consists of fibrofatty tissue with lymph nodes measuring 3 x 2 x 1 cm Overall.
Totally submitted in-one cassette.

M: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Rt presciatic L.N.". It
consists of fibrofatty tissue with lymph nodes measuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.3 cm overall.
Totally submitted in one cassette.

N: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled “Aortic bifurcation", It
consists of fibrofatty tissue with lymph nodes measuring 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm
overall. Totally submitted in one cassette.

0: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Rt. proximal ureter". It
consists of a segment of ureter with periureteral soft tissue measuring 3 cm in
length and 0.6 cm in diameter. The specimen is received unoriented with two
staples at one end. A representative section of the end with two staples is
submitted in cassette 01 and the remaining tissue is submitted in cassette 02.

P: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Left proximal ureter“. It
consists of a segment of ureter with periureteral soft tissue measuring 1.8 cm in
length and 0.9 cm in diameter. The specimen is received unoriented with two

staples at one end. The specimen is serially sectioned and totally submitted in
two cassettes. '

INTRAOPERATIVE FROZEN CONSULTATION:
AFS: Right ureter:
- negative

BFS: Left distal ureter:
— negative

CFS: Apical urethral margin:
- negative

INTRAOPERATIVE GROSS CONSULTATION

Bladder/prostate (D):
— tumor identified, grossly extending through bladder wall

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

A-C: See final microscopic-diagnosis.

VD: Sections of the bladder show a poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma
(D1—14,30,31). grades 3 and 4/4, exhibiting both squamoid and glandular features.
The tumor extends through the bladder wall into perivesical soft tissue and to the
subserosa of the peritoneum. Focal lymphovascular invasion is identified (D13).
Resection margins are free of malignancy. Additional random sections of bladder
mucosa show no evidence of urothelial carcinoma in situ (flat lesion) or high grade
urothelial dysplasia,

Sections of the prostate show a focus of moderate to poorly differentiated
prostatic adenocarcinoma (D21), Gleason's score 7 (4+3). This focus of carcinoma
is unilateral being identified in the right mid to distal prostate and is confined
within prostatic parenchyma without involvement of the capsule or periprostatic
soft tissue. The prostatic urethra shows no evidence of urothelial dysplasia or

urothelial malignancy. Resection margins are free of malignancy as are the
bilateral seminal vesicles.

E—P: See final microscopic-diagnosis.
