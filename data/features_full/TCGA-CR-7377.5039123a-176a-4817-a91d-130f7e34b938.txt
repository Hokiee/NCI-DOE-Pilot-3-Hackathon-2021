13) SOURCE: Tongue, T onsillar Pillar, Floor of Mouth

The specimen labeled, "tongue, tonsillar pillar, ﬂoor of mouth," is
received fresh and consists of a segment of tongue with surrounding
connective tissue. The sample measures 6.5 cm in the anterior to posterior
dimension, 3.5 cm medial to lateral, and 6.0 cm superior to inferior. There
is a suture in the anterior tongue. The sample is not oriented per
requisition only. There are two areas of induration in the tongue. The

first measures 2.2 cm and is a triangular-shaped wedge; the specimen was
received in this manner. The second is a 3.5 X 0.6 X 0.4 cm area where
tissue is submitted for research. The surface of the tongue is tan to pink
with multiple papillae. There is an ill-defined nodule on the posterior
surface, measuring 4.0 X 3.5 X 1.0 cm. The specimen is inked as follows:
deep inferior margin-black (this contains the hyoid bone), posterior
margin- green, medial margin-red, lateral margin-blue. Buccal mucosa
inferior to the tongue and is smooth, tan, and glistening. The specimen is
sectioned anterior to posterior, perpendicular to the long aXis of the
tongue. The superior surface is not inked. The specimen is submitted for
research, in glutaraldehyde, in -80 degree freezer and in RPMI.

Summary of sections: 13A, section of nodule on posterior tongue with
surface of tongue, 1/ 1; 13B, representative section of lateral margin, 2/ 1;
13C, inferior and lateral margins, 1/ 1; 13D, representative section of
