1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis, labeled,
"Sentinel node #1, level 1, right axilla'. It consists of a 3.0 x 1.8 x 0.7
cm lymph node. Trisected and one section is submitted for frozen section.
Cut section shows firm tan-white tissue. The remaining tissue is submitted
as R. Entirely submitted.

2) The specimen is received fresh, labeled, I‘Right modified radical
mastectomy with levels 1 n 2 axillary contents with tags attached". It
consists of a product of modified radical mastectomy, breast measuring 16.0
x 11.5 x 5.0 cm with attached axillary tissue, measuring 7.9 x 7.0 x 2.0 cm
with tags attached labeled one and two. Anteriorly, the skin ellipse
measures 9.2 x 1.5 cm bearing an unremarkable nipple and areola. The
epidermal surface is unremarkable, except for blue dye staining. Serially
sectioned from medial to lateral aspect. Cut section shows a 6.5 x 4.0 x
2.5 cm tumor, located in the central quadrant, about 1.5 cm beneath the
overlying skin and 0.2 cm from the deep resection margin. The cut section
of the tumor has firm, tan-pink tissue with focal areas of hemorrhage. The
adjacent breast tissue is predominantly fatty with scattered fibrous
streaks. No other satellite nodules are seen. ﬁepresentative sections from
the tumor and the other quadrants are submitted. Part of tissue is
submitted for TPS. Multiple lymph nodes are dissected from the axillary
tissue from levels one and two, size ranging from 0.5 cm to 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0
cm. The larger lymph nodes are bisected. The specimen is inked as follows:
superior-blue, inferior-red, posterior-black.
