FINAL DIAGNOSIS
1) THYMUS, THYMECTOMY:

— MINIMALLY INVASIVE THYMOMA
-H|STOLOGIC TYPE:
— TYPE B THYMOMA, BZ (CORTICAL)
— TUMOR SIZE (GREATEST DIMENSION): 4 CM
- MARGINS: THYMOMA FOCALLY EXTENDS TO INKED/CAUTERIZED
MARGIN
— PATHOLOGIC STAGING: STAGE II (MASAOKA STAGE)
- MICROSCOPIC INVASION INTO SORROUNDING ADIPOSE
TISSUE

COMMENT: The thymoma shows focal microscopic invasion into sorrounding adipose
tissue. The tumor is predominately composed of large polygonal tumor cells exhibiting large
vesicular nuclei and predominant nucleoli with a background population of lymphocytes. A
single microscopic focus (slide 1- -16) shows confluent sheet of tumor cells and many cell
with In this areas show markedly enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei reminiscent of anaplasia
However, there" Is no evidence of increased/atypical mitosis in this area These changes are
interpreted as degenerative changes. Immunostains including Pan- cytokeratin CD3, Tdt
were performed and the results support the above diagnosis. Parathyroid hormone
immunostain was also performed and is negative.

Dr and Dr concurs with the diagnosis.

- FRAGMENTS OF BONE AND CARTILAGE
- NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR

Gross Specimen Gross Specimen

Gross Description:

1) Received fresh in the frozen section laboratory labeled with the patient's name "thymus” is a 92 g 18.0 x 6.0 x 3.8 cm
irregular fatty tissue, grossly consistent with thymus, with a short suture designating inferior and a long suture designating
superior. The external capsule is tan smooth and glistening. Within the inferior left segment is a 4.0 x 3.3 x 3.0 cm tan-white
ﬂeshy centrally necrotic firm nodule in which a representative section is frozen as FSA, now as cassette one. A
representative section is submitted for flow cytometry studies and a representative section is saved frozen for ancillary
studies. The remainder of the specimen displays a yellow lobulated fatty tissue surface in which additional nodules are not
grossly appreciated. The specimen is formalin fixed and representative sections are submitted as follows: cassettes 2-18
entire tumor sequential from right to left, cassettes 19—22 right arm sequential from superior to inferior, cassettes 23-26 left
arm sequential from superior to inferior.

2) Received fresh labeled with the patient's name, MR# and designated "right superior pole" is an unoriented 3.5 x 1 x 0.5
cm piece of red-tan soft tissue which is entirely submitted in one cassette.

3) Received fresh labeled with the patient's name, MR# and designated "thymus" is a 0.5 gram 1.5 x 0.9 x 0.3 cm portion of
lobulated yellow soft tissue which is entirely submitted in one cassette.

4) Received fresh labeled with the patient's name, MR# and designated "diaphragm" is a 1.5 x 1 x 0.3 cm portion of
cartilage which is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in one cassette following decalcification.
