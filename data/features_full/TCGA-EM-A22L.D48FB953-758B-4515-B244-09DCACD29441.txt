Comment

The dominant nodule exhibits multifocai transformation to papillary carcinoma and the extent of
malignancy warrants classiﬁcation of the entire nodule as papillary carcinoma. There is also a 0.1cm
follicular variant papillary microcarcinoma in the right lobe. The overall morphological features are those
of a low risk papillary carcinoma.

Grogs Description

The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "right subtotal thyroid stitch upper pole", consists of
a right hemithyroidectomy specimen that weighs 8.7 g. The lobe measures 3.9 cm Si x2.3 cm ML x 1.6
cm AP and the isthmus measures 1.7 Si x 1.60m ML x 0.7cm AP. No parathyroid gland or lymph nodes
are identiﬁed grossly. The mid superior lobe contains one well delineated nodule that measures 2.1 cm Si
x 2.2cm ML x 1.5 cm AP. The cut surface of the nodule has a variegated red-tan color, and has a soft and
ﬂabby consistency. Sections of nodule and normal tissue are stored frozen. The remainder of the
specimen is submitted as follows:

1A-F lobe, superior to inferior

1G isthmus
