approximately 0.7 cm from the bladder neck margin. Grossly, it involves the full
thickness of the bladder wall extendning into perivesical soft tissue. It comes
within approximately 0.3 cm of the anterior inked radial margin and o 4 cm of the
inked left lateral radial margin. The remainder of the mucosa is flat with patchy
tan-pink areas. The involved bladder wall measures 1.8 cm in thickness. The
uninvolved wall measures 0. 7 cm in thickness. The attached right and left ureters
measure 8 cm in length by 0.7 cm in circumference and 6.5 cm in length by 0.7 cm in
circumference, respectively. Both have mucosa that is tan-pink, smooth, glistening
and unremarkable without tumor involvement. The uterus with attached cervix
measures 6.5 x 4.5 x 3.4 cm. The ectocervix measures 3.5 cm across. The

INTRAOPERATIVE FROZEN CONSULTATION:
AFS: Right distal ureter:
— no high-grade atypia or tumor identified

BFS: Left distal ureter:
- no high-grade atypia or tumor identified

CFS: Bladder neck margin:
— no high—grade atypia or tumor identified

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

A-C: See final microscopic-diagnosis.

D: Sections of the bladder show a poorly differentiated invasive urothelial
carcinoma (D1—3,9—11,13,14), grade 4/4, with focal clear features. The carcinoma
is associated with extensive ulceration and penetrates through the bladder wall
into perivesical soft tissue (D1,2,10,11). A focus of lymphovascular space
invasion is seen (D13). Carcinoma comes within 0.5 cm of the anterior radial margin
and 1.2 cm of the bladder neck margin. All other radial margins and bilateral
ureters margins are more widely free of malignancy. No trigone or ureterovesical
junction involvement by dysplasia or malignancy is seen. Metastatic urothelial
carcinoma is identified in one of three left perivesical lymph nodes examined
(D21-23) .

Sections of the uterus show a small focus of well differentiated endometrial
adenocarcinoma, FIGO grade 1/3, arising in association with endometrium and a polyp
containing complex endometrial hyperplasia with atypia (D15-17). No myometrial or
cervical invasion is identified. All surgical margins are free of malignancy.
