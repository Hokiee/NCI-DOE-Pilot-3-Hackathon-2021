BEA—12-
AP Surgical Pathology: Final.“ Acc_ 5295

CLINICAL HISTORY:
RI m: There isa large, predominantly nonenhancing, T2

yperintense mass identified within the right temporal lobe. The most superior
component of this mass likely involves the inferior right parietal white
matter. Although the borders of this mass are well defined lack of multiplanar
imaging limits evaluation of size. The greatest transaxial dimensions are 53 x
37 mm on image 8 series 5. Within the larger T2 hyperintense mass they're all
are peripherally enhancing foci, most prominently anteriorly within the right
temporal lobe as demonstrated on image 50 series 4. Mass effect upon the
mesial right temporal lobe and effacement of the right basilar cisterns are
not significantly changed when compared to the prior study.

 

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Brain tissue (AE1)", received fresh for frozen section is a 7 x 5 x 3 cm
portion of focally hemorrhagic, friable brain tissue. Representative is
frosen as AFl, frozen remnant submitted in Al. Additional sections are
submitted in A2—4.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:

A. "Brain tissue":AF1— glioblastoma _

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

Microscopic examination shows brain infiltrated by a malignant astrocytic
neoplasm characterized by cytologic pleomorphism, mitotic figures,
microvascular changes and pseudopalisading necrosis. The tumor also exhibits
evidence of a previous surgical resection site.
