PATHOLOGICAL DEAGNOSIS:
A. RIGHT PARIETAL BIOPSY:
1. Ens? S'
2. KI 67 1—2%.
{MIB—l: 10—15%)
B. RIGHT PARIETAL BIOPSY: TRANSITIONAL ZONE OF THE INFILTRATING
ASTROCYTOMA.

Operation/Specimen: Rt. parietal tumor-

  
   

Clinical History and Pre—Op Dx: Rt. parietal tumor.

GROSS PATHOLOGY: The specimen (A)labeled "right parietal tumor", is a
portion of loose, gray—white to pink-white soft tissue, 1 cm. in
diameter. A portion of the specimen has been examined by frozen
section and is submitted and the remaining tissue in cassette 2.

Specimen B labeled "adjacent white matter", submitted in cassette 3.

Specimen C labeled "post infiltrating white matter", submitted in
cassette 4.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION, Frozen section diagnosis: Glioma.

MICROSCOPIC: Specimen A shows an astrocytoma with a loose, fibrillary
background. The tumor is relatively hypercellular, with majority of
cells being small astrocytes containing hyperchromatic nuclei. The
tumor cells tend to group together, or form multinucleation.
Gemistocytic form is also present. Occasional mitotic figures are
seen. Vascular proliferation and endothelial hyperplasia is present.
Tumor necrosis is not identified. GFAP stain confirms the astrocytic
nature of the tumor cells. Ki67 is about l—2%, MIB—l is about 10—15%.

Specimens B and C show the transitional zone between relatively
uninvolved parenchyma (cortex and white) and involved cortex and white
matter which are infiltrated by neoplastic cells with large irregular,
often naked nuclei. The cellularity and nuclear pleomorphism of the
specimens B and C is less than the specimen A.
