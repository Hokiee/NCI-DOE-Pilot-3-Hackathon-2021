Histologic Type: Ductal adenocarcinoma g
Histologic Grade: 61 i
Microscopic Tumor Extension: Tumor invades duodenal wall, tumor invades '

peripancreatic soft tissue I
Margins: Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma

Distance of invasive carcinoma from closest margin: 2
mm: uncinate process. peripancreatic 3
Treatment Effect: No prior treatment I

 

Pathologic Staging: Primary Tumor: pT3
Regional Lymph Nodes: pNo
Number of lymph nodes: 10
Number involved: 0
Distant Metastasis: Not applicable

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in multiple parts.

A. The specimen in the fresh state is a portion of dilated duct wall which measures 2 x 1
x 0.3 cm. totally examined by frozen section as block A1. ‘

B. This is a section of pancreas which measures 2 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm. The surgeon has placed ?
a suture on the margin side. Tangential sections through the surgical margin are examined
by frozen section as block Bl.

C. This specimen in formalin is a dilated gallbladder which measures 11 x 3.5 x 3 cm. The
attached cystic duct measures 2 x 1 cm. The serosal surface is smooth and green. Within
the lumen is gritty. green sludge. The wall measures 5 mm in thickness. Representative
sections are submitted in block C2.

D. This is a Whipple resection which measures 15 x 6 x 6 cm and includes: head of
pancreas. segment of duodenum, distal portion of stomach. distal portion of dilated common
bile duct. The duodenum measures 9 cm in length by 4 cm in diameter. The stomach measures
8 cm in length by 5 cm proximal diameter. Proximal and distal margins are stapled closed.
The pancreatic head measures 7 x 4 x 4 cm and contains a firm, relatively circumscribed
yellow tumor which measures 5 x 4 x 4 cm. Peripheral margins appear tree of tumor. The
surgeon has tagged the retroperitoneal margin and I have applied black ink to this margin.
I have applied blue ink to the margin of the uncinate process. The common bile duct is
dilated and measures 4 x 2 cm. Representative sections of the tumor are submitted for
tumor banking. The tumor invades the duodenum wall in the region of the ampulla.

The following sections are submitted:

D1 - proximal gastric margin

D2 — distal duodenal margin I
D3 ~ pancreatic duct margin é
D4—6 — pancreatic tumor with blue ink on uncinate process margin 9
D7,8 — pancreatic tumor invading duodenal wall
