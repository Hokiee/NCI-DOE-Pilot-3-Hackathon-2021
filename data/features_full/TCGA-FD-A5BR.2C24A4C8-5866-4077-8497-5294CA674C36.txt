Interpretation performed by the Attending Pathologist and reviewed with the
Resident/Fellow, D, MD, PhD

Electronically Signed Out by [] MD

Clinical History:
The patient is a year-old male with bladder cancer undergoing a radical
cystectomy with neobladder.

Specimens Received:

A: Right pelvic lymph nodes

B: Left pelvic lymph nodes

C: Bladder,prostate and seminal vesicles
D: Leﬁ distal ureter

E: Right distal ureter

Gross Description:

The specimens are received in ﬁve containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.

A. The first container is additionally identiﬁed as, "right pelvic lymph
nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is an aggregate of ﬁbroadipose

tissue measuring 9.2 x 6.5 x 2.8 cm. Several apparent lymph nodes and lymph
node candidates are identiﬁed ranging in size from 0.3-3.6 cm in greatest
dimension. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Al-A2: One sectioned lymph node.

A3-A6: One sectioned lymph node, each cassette

A7—A9: 2 lymph nodes, each cassette

AlO-Al 1: 4 lymph node candidates, each cassette

B. The second container is additionally identiﬁed as, "left pelvic lymph
nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is an aggregate of ﬁbroadipose
tissue measuring 7.5 x 6.2 x 2.5 cm. Several apparent lymph nodes and lymph
node candidates are identiﬁed ranging in size from 0.2-3.8 cm in greatest
dimension. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

B 1 -B2: One sectioned lymph node

83-84: One sectioned lymph node, each cassette

B5: One lymph node

B6: 2 lymph nodes.

B7-B8: 2 lymph nodes, each cassette

BQ-BlO: 3 lymph node candidates, each cassette

C. The third container is additionally identiﬁed as, "bladder, prostate and
seminal vesicles". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 18.5 x 13.5 x 5.0
cm cystoprostatectomy specimen consisting of a 17.0 x 10.0 x 4.0 cm markedly
dilated bladder with diffusely thickened wall and attached mesenteric fat, and a
4.3 x 3.5 x 3.4 cm prostate. The right seminal vesicles measure 3.5 x 1.4 x 0.9
cm and right vas deferens measures 2.5 cm. The left seminal vesicles measures
3.5 x 1.7 x 0.8 cm and left vas deferens measures 3.6 cm. The right ureteral
stump measures 0.9 x 0.4 cm, the left measures 0.6 x 0.4 cm, and both
demonstrate intact, patent lumens.

The right half of the prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left half is

inked black. The bladder and prostate are opened anteriorly along the urethra.
The prostate is surrounded by a thin, intact membranous capsule and sectioning
demonstrates rubbery, pink-tan, pen-urethral nodularity with no discrete masses
or indurations.

The opened bladder reveals a 2.2 x 2.2 cm papillary, friable mass was ulceration
located in the right lateral wall. On cut section, the mass extends into but

not through the muscularis propria and is 0.9 cm from the deep margin. There is
a second papillary, friable mass measuring 1.7 x 1.6 cm, which is located in the
left anterior wall. On cut section the mass extends into but not through the
muscularis propria and is 1.0 cm from the deep margin. The surrounding bladder
mucosa is edematous, granular, pink-tan with a uniform, 1.7 -2.0 cm wall
thickness. Bilateral ureteral oriﬁces, adjacent to the trigone, are identiﬁed

and probe patent.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:
Cl: Distal margin

C2: Prostate Apex

C3: Right ureter resection margin

C4: Left ureter resection margin

C5-C9: Bladder mass #1, right lateral wall
C10-C13: Bladder, mass #2, left anterior wall
C14: Uninvolved bladder mucosa bladder dome
C15: Uninvolved bladder mucosa anterior wall
C 16: Uninvolved bladder mucosa posterior wall
C17: Right ureter orifice, trigone

C18: Left ureter oriﬁce, trigone

C19-C21: Representative right lobe of prostate from apex to base
C22-C24: Representative left lobe of prostate from apex to base

C25: Bilateral seminal vesicles and vas deferens

D. The fourth container is additionally identiﬁed as, "leﬁ distal ureter".
Received fresh and placed in formalin is a segment of ureter with surrounding
periureteral tissues measuring 1.5 cm in length and 1.2 cm in diameter. There
is a surgical stitch on one end of the specimen designating margin which is
inked blue. The margin is shaved and submitted en face in cassette D1.

E. The ﬁfth container is additionally identiﬁed as, “right distal ureter".
Received fresh and placed in formalin is a segment of ureter with surrounding
periureteral tissues measuring 1.2 cm in length and 0.7 cm in diameter. There
is a surgical stitch on one end of the specimen designating margin which is
inked blue. The margin is shaved and submitted en face in cassette E1.
