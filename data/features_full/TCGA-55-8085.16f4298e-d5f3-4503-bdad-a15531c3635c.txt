SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPTION

A) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, level 9, left

The specimen is received labeled "level 9 lymph node (left),“ received in
formalin, is a 0.8 cm red-black partiaily yellow and fatty thin Iyrnph node.
Submitted in toto in one cassette.

B) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, level 9, left, additional tissue

The specimen is received labeled “additional level 9 lymph node (left).“ It
consists of a 1.2 cm gray—black lymph node. Longitudinaliy bisected and
entirely submitted in one cassette.

C) SOURCE: Lung wedge resection -frozen section, left lower lobe

The specimen is received IabeIed “wedge resection, left lower lobe." It
consists of a 48-grarn, 9 x 4.5 x 3 cm lung wedge resection with two

partially intersecting staple lines (9.5 X 0.5 cm) in aggregate. The

visceral pleural red-tan surfaces include a minimal amount of subpleural
anthracosls. The stapled margin is trimmed and immediately subjacent tissue
inked black. The intact smooth pleural surfaces are inked green. Cut
surfaces disclose a solid firm gray-tan tumor mass, measuring 2.5 x 2.2 x

1.6 cm, 1.5 cm from the blackeinked stapled resection margin and 0.2 cm
from the green-inked smooth pleural surface.

A representative section of the tumor mass is submitted on one block for
frozen microscopy.

INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: "Adenocarcinoma,
margin negative. Approximatel 2.5 cm tumor, approximately 1.5 cm from
margin." is rendered by—

The remaining lung parenchyma discloses diffuse mild emphysematous change
and a single black peribronchial, 0.3 cm lymph node without evidence of
gross tumor.

Note: Fresh tumor is retained for additional possible ancillary studies.

Representativegsections aﬁe submitted in eigfht‘cassettes as follows:
1. Frozen section residue “
2-3, Stapled resection margin, perpendicular to black ink

4—6. Tumor with green—inked pleural surface

7, Normal lung, at least 1.5 cm away from tumor

8. One peribronchial lymph node

Note: The specimen Is placed in formaiin at approximately -on
— for a minimum of six hours ﬁxation.

This case is accessioned in—

D) SOURCE: Left upper lobe wedge resection lung
Labeled ”left upper lobe wedge resection Iung" received in formalin is a
10.5 x 5 x 4 cm, 55 gram lung wedge. The pleural surface is purple~pink

focally ragged with a staple line present along one edge. The staple line

is removed from underlying tissues inked green. The lung is serially
sectioned revealing a 4 x 3 x 3 cm air pocket surrounded by white—tan dense
tissue. The remaining lung parenchyma is red-tan hemorrhagic and spongy
without masses or lesions identified. Representative sections are submitted
in five cassettes.

E) SOURCE: Level 7 lymph node, left

Labeled “ievel 7 lymph node, left" is a 0.8 cm red-brown rubbery lymph
node. The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.

F) SOURCE: Level 5 lymph node, left

Labeled “level 5 lymph node, left“ is a 0.5 cm anthracotic lymph node. The
specimen is submitted in toto in one cassette.
