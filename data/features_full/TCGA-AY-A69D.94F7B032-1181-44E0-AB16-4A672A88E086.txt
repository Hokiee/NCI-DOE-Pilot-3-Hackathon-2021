Diagnosis:
A: Colon, transverse, partial colectomy

Tumor Histologic Type: invasive adenocarcinoma
Histologic Grade: moderately differentiated (grade 2 of 4)
Tumor Location: transverse colon

Depth of Invasion:
—Through muscularis propria and into the subserosa and pericolic

soft tissue ﬁﬂ‘éa
Lymphovascular Invasion: not identified Séefi?

Margins: q! > 5’“: )3
Proximal margin: negative }

Distal margin: negative

Mesenteric margin: negative

Distance of carcinoma from closest margin (specify): 6.6 cm to
the closest distal margin of resection

Regional Lymph Nodes:
Total number with metastasis: 0
Total number examined: 25

Additional Pathologic Findings:

Immunohistochemical stains for MLH-l, MSH—Z, PSH—6 and PMS-2 are
performed on block A7. The tumor cells demonstrate appropriate
positive nuclear expression for all four markers. This is the
normal phenotype and does NOT support a diagnosis of
microsatellite instability/hereditary non—polyposis colorectal
cancer (HNPCC). Separate molecular testing for microsatellite
instability markers will be performed and reported separately.
Appropriate controls are performed.

AJCC Pathologic TNM Stage: pT3 pNO

Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information
available at the time of this report, and is subject to change
pending clinical review and additional information.

Clinical History:
—year—old female with colon cancer.

Gross Description:

Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally
labeled "transverse colon and omentum." It consists of a 23.5 cm
long x 5.2 cm in circumference segment of large bowel with
attached omentum (30.4 x 15.6 x 0.8 cm), pericolonic adipose
tissue up to 4.3 cm thick and appendix is absent. There

is a 5.2 x 2.6 x 0.7 cm (protruding into lumen) firm, pink/tan,
centrally ulcerated circumferential mass with raised borders
that is 10.7 cm from the proximal margin and 6.6 cm from the
distal margin. The distal margin has an attached suture, which
is inked blue and the serosa overlying the mass is inked

black. The mass on cut section is firm, smooth, gray/white,
extends 1.1 cm through the wall and into the mesentery focally
retracting the serosa but not extending through it, and 3.5 cm
from the mesenteric margin. The uninvolved mucosa is tan with
normal folding pattern. The omentum has patchy areas of
hemorrhage but nodules are absent. The pericolonic adipose
tissue is dissected for lymph node candidates of which 29 are
identified ranging from 0.2 cm in greatest dimension up to 0.8 x
0.8 x 0.8 cm in greatest dimension.

Block summary:

Al - mesenteric margin, en face

A2-A3 — proximal mucosal margin, en face

A4—A5 — distal mucosal margin, en face

A6 — mass retracting the serosa

A7—A8 - each contains deepest extension of mass with positive
lymph node in A8

A9 - mass with distal mucosa

A10 - mass with proximal mucosa

All — omentum

A12-A14 — each contains six lymph node candidates

AlS-A16 — each contains four lymph node candidates

A17 - two lymph node candidates, each bisected, one is inked
black

Al8—A19 — one lymph node candidate, serially sectioned
