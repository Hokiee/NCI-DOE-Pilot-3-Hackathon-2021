COMMENT:

For staging and synoptic reporting purposes, the soft tissue deposit in level
2 of the left neck (part 6) is considered a positive lymph node with extensive
extracapsular spread, though there is no actual residual lymph node
architecture. Additionally, the vallecular margin is considered positive,

albeit involvedb ase arate rim tumor.

My s1gnature 1s attestation that I have personally reviewed the submitted
material(s) and the ﬁnal diagnosis reﬂects that evaluation.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received fixed in nine parts.

Part 1 is labeled with the patient's name, initials, XX and labeled as "left
hypopharynx". It consists of fragments of white-tan soft tissue measuring 1.8
x 1.2 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen
section consultation and resubmitted in cassette labeled 1AF S.

Pat 2 is received ﬁxed labeled with the patient's name, initials, XX and
labeled as "right external jugular vein + node". It consists of a 5.0 x 3.0 x
0.6 cm unoriented fibroadipose tissue. A small stitch is tied to a vessel

that is next to an enlarged lymph node (1.5 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm). The stitched end
of the vessel is inked blue. The large lymph node is bisected and submitted in
cassettes labeled 2A and 2B. The vessel is probe patent and both ends with
surrounding tissue are submitted in cassette labeled 2C.

Part 3 is labeled with the patient's name, initials, XX and labeled as "right
neck levels 2, 3, and 4". It consists of a 10.5 x 3.1 x 1.6 cm unoriented
ﬁbroadipose tissue. The specimen is oriented into part 2, 3, and 4.

Possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging in greatest dimension from 0.1 to
1.8 cm. Lymph nodes are submitted as follows:

3A one lymph node, 1.8 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm, bisected, level 2

3B one lymph node, bisected level 2

3C possible lymph nodes, level 2

3D two possible lymph nodes, level 3

3E two possible lymph nodes, level 4

3F two possible lymph nodes, level 4.

Part 4 is labeled with the patient's name, initials, XX and labeled as "left
external jugular node". It consists of two fragments of unoriented
ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm and 3.6 x 1.7 x 0.7 cm. Two
enlarged lymph nodes measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm and 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm are
identiﬁed. Tissue is submitted as follows:

4A one bisected lymph node

4B one bisected lymph node

4C remainder of the tissue, entirely submitted.

Part 5 is labeled with the patient's name, initials, XX and labeled as "left
hypoglossal nerve". It consists of four fragments of tissue measuring 1.0 x
0.5 x 0.2 cm in aggregate. The specimen is totally submitted for frozen
section consultation and resubmitted in cassette labeled 5AF S.

Part 6 is labeled with the patient's name, initials, XX and labeled as "left
neck levels 2, 3, and 4". It consists of a 7.1 x 6.5 x 2.5 cm unoriented
ﬁbroadipose tissue. The specimen is oriented based on the radiographic
report and divided into levels 2, 3 and 4. One large possible lymph node
measuring 3.2 x 2.2 x 1.8 cm is identified on level 2 and serially sectioned,
which reveals central necrosis. The possible lymph node was banked for

tissue bank. Representative sections of the lymph node are submitted in
cassettes 6A and 6B. The remainder of the tissue reveals multiple lymph nodes
ranging in greatest dimension from 0.1 to 1.4 cm. Lymph nodes are submitted
as follows:

6C four possible lymph nodes, level 3

6D two lymph nodes, level 4

6E four lymph nodes, level 4.

Part 7 is labeled with the patient's name, initials, XX and labeled as "total
laryngectomy and left thyroid lobectomy". It consists of a total laryngectomy
specimen measuring 8.0 x 8.0 x 6.1 cm including 3 trachea rings, hyoid bone,
left thyroid lobe (4.0 x 2.0 x 1.1 cm) and a possible parathyroid (2.2 x 0.9 x
0.5 cm) that is attached to the left thyroid gland. Grossly, there is a 4.1 x

3.2 x 1.7 cm, white-tan, ﬁrm, hypopharyngeal mass predominantly located in
the left pyriform sinus space. The mass has supraglottic extension involving
the left false vocal fold. Gross sectioning reveals that the tumor does not
involve thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, preepiglottic soft tissue and
anterior soft tissue. The tumor is approximately 2.5cm from the anterior soft
tissue margin.

The left thyroid lobe is serially sectioned and reveals a homo eneous, ﬂeshy,
red, unremarkable parenchyma. The tumor is banked fori tissue bank.
Digital images are taken.

Ink code:

Black anterior soft tissue margin

Blue preepiglottic soft tissue

Orange areas under the hyoid bone

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

7A base of tongue margin, shave

7B right lateral pharyngeal margin, shave

7C tracheal ring margin, shave

7D anterior soft tissue margin, left side, shave

7E representative section of left thyroid

7F possible left parathyroid

7G right true and false vocal folds

7H DR anterior commissure with thyroid cartilage

7I preepiglottic soft tissue, left side, perpendicular

7] 7K representative section of the tumor

7L DR representative section of the tumor

7M DR tumor and left true and false vocal fold and the thyroid cartilage

7N tumor and left true and left vocal fold

7O anterior adipose tissue for possible lymph nodes.

Part 8 is labeled with the patient's name, initials, XX and labeled as "left
pharyngeal margin". It consists of a 2.9 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm tan-white tissue. The
tissue is entirely submitted for frozen section consultation and resubmitted

in cassette labeled 8AFS.

Part 9 is labeled with the patient's name, initials, XX and labeled as "post
cricoid margin". It consists of a 1.9 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm white-tan soft tissue.

The s ecimen is totally submitted in cassette labeled 9AFS.
