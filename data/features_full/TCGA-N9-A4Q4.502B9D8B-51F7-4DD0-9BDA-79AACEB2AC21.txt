COMMENT

The carcinomatous components include mixed high grade endometrioid and high grade serous carcinoma, while the sarcomatous
component is undifferentiated with extensive rhabdoid features.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) CERVIX, UTERUS, BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES — A hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, consisting oi
a uterus (12 x 5 x 3 cm), right ovary (2.5 x 2 x 1 cm). right fallopian tube (3 x 1 cm). left ovary (2.4 x 1 x 1 cm) and left fallopian
tube (5 x 1 cm).

Filling the entire endometrial cavity is a polypoid tumor (8 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm), with a homogenous, ﬂeshy, pink-white, focally
necrotic cut surface. The tumor appears confined to the endometrium without myometrial or cervical involvement.

Two myometrial nodules (3.5 x 2 x 2 cm and 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm) are identified within the uterus and lower uterine segment,
respectively. Both nodules have well-circumscribed borders and firm, whorled and bulging, gray-white cut surfaces. The
remaining endometrium is irregular and trabeculated.

The remainder of the cervix and bilateral adnexa are unremarkable.

Representative portions of the specimen are submitted for tissue banking.

Representative sections are submitted.

nodules (A17. lower uterine segment).
(B) LEFT COMMON ILIAC LYMPH NODE — Two lymph nodes (1.1 and 2.4 cm in greatest dimension). Submitted in toto in B.

(C) LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE — Multiple fibroadipose tissue fragments (5.9 x 4.5 x 0.7 cm). Multiple lymph nodes ranging
from 1.0 to 5.5 cm in greatest dimension, are identified and submitted in toto.
SECTION CODE: C1, one lymph node; C2, one lymph node, bisected; 03-05, one lymph node serially sectioned.

(D) RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES - Two fibroadipose tissue fragments (4 x 3 x 0.6 cm). Two lymph nodes (1.3 and 4.8 cm in
dimension) are identified and submitted in toto.

connective tissue, no gross lesions are identified. A calcified nodule is identified within the lumen measuring (0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm).
submitted for decalcification.

SECTION CODE: F1, representative sections of the vascular structure; F2, representative sections from the vascular
structure and surrounding connective tissue.

F3. calcified nodule.
(G) RIGHT PERIAORTIC LYMPH NODE — Multiple lymph nodes are identified, the largest measures 2.5 x 1.3 x 0.4 cm with
pink-tan color and soft consistency. All lymph nodes are entirely submitted.

SECTION CODE: G1. three possible lymph nodes; G2, three possible lymph nodes; 63. two possible lymph nodes; G4,
one possible lymph node.
(H) RIGHT PRESACRAL LYMPH NODE —- Two pink-tan soft tissue fragments measuring on average (0.7 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm).
Entirely submitted in H.
(I) OMENTUM -— No gross lesions are identiﬁed. Representative sections are submitted in l1-I6.
(J) INF RA-GASTRIC OMENTAL NODULE — A (2.5 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm) yellow-tan fatty tissue with a pink-tan firm well-circumscribed
nodule, measuring (0.7 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm). Entirely submitted in J.
