CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm corpus uteri. ~

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries", received fresh and placed in
formalin at 's a 103 gram, 8 x 5 x 4 cm uterus with a 0.6 cm
patent cervical 05. The specimen is opened to reveal a 2.8 x 2.5 x 0.7 cm
exophytic mass within the anterior fundus which appears to invade 0.3 cm into
a 1.9 cm thick myometrium. The posterior uterine serosal surface is
remarkable for a l x 1 cm area of adhesions. The endocervical canal and
ectocervix is grossly unremarkable. The right adnexa measures 4.5 x 4 x 1.5
cm and is remarkable for a 4.1 x 0.5 cm fallopian tube with several large
paratubal cysts with a smooth transparent lining measuring 2.2 cm in greatest
dimension. No definite right ovarian tissue is identified. The left adnexa
measures 5 x 3.5 x 1 cm and consists of a 5.5 x 0.4 cm fimbriated fallopian
tube and a 2.2 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm grossly unremarkable ovary. The left adnexa is
remarkable for a 3 x 1.5 cm area of adhesions contiguous with those of the
uterine serosa. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Al—3— representative sections of tumor at deepest invasion

A4— anterior cervix and lower uterine segment

AS- posterior cervix and gower uterine segment

A6- representative serosai and left adnexal adhesions

A7- representative right fallopian tube and paratubal cyst lining
AB- potential right ovary tissue -

A9- left ovary and fallopian tube

B. "Cul—de-sac nodule", received fresh and placed in formalin at
is a 2.5 x.2 x 0.3 cm aggregate of tan-brown soft tissue which is
entirely submitted in block Bl.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: Hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 6th Edition): pT3b pNX pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate

"information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,

past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

DIAGNOSIS:

SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY) :
