SPECIMENS:
A. LT RAD NEPRECTOMY & RETRO PERITONEAL LYMPH NODES

DIAGNOSIS:
LEFT KIDNEY, ADRENAL AND RETROPERITONEAL LYMPH NODES, RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY:
- PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, TYPE 2, FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3.
- TUMOR SIZE 6.5 cm.
- CARCINOMA EXTENSIVELY INVADING INTO RENAL HILAR ADIPOSE TISSUE.
- VASCULAR LYMPHATIC SPACE INVASION IDENTIFIED.
- CARCINOMA FOCALLY INVADING INTO VASCULAR WALL, BUT NOT IN LUMEN, OF RENAL
VEIN.
- LARGE MA'I'I'ED HILAR LYMPH NODE (11 CM) AND THREE ADDITIONAL SMALLER LYMPH
NODES, EXTENSIVELY REPLACED BY METASTATIC CARCINOMA (4/4).
- URETERAL AND VASCULAR MARGINS, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
- ADRENAL GLAND, NO TUMOR SEEN.
- SEE TEMPLATE AND NOTE.

NOTE: There is focal necrosis and focal cystic degeneration identified in the tumor. No sarcomatoid
component is seen. Several small tumor nodules are present at the periphery of the main tumor, and
some of those nodules represent metastatic tumors in the angiolymphatic spaces. The metastatic tumor
in the hilar lymph nodes shows perineural invasion.

A panel of immunohistochemical stains was performed to rule out possible collecting duct carcinoma.
The tumor is positive for CK20, RCC, EMA, and Cam5.2. It is negative for ULEX Europaeus agglutinin,
HMW-CK, Vimentin, CK7 and CEA. There is weak stain of CK19, probably due to non-specific stain.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. LEFT RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY AND RETROPERITONEAL LYMPH NODES
Received fresh in a container labeled with patient name and “left radical nephrectomy and
retroperitoneal lymph nodes” is a kidney and perinephric adipose measuring 15 x 7.5 x 7.0 cm together.
The kidney alone measures 12 x 6 x 5 cm and has a 6 cm long, 0.6 cm diameter proximal ureter. At the
renal hilum is a 15 x 5 x 4 cm portion of fibroadipose, nodular lymph nodes and probable tumor.
Sectioning of the renal parenchyma reveals an inferior pole 6.5 x 5.5 x 6.1 cm firm, tan mass with
irregular edges. Surrounding the main tumor mass the renal parenchyma contains multiple, small
nodules of tumor that appear to be separate from the primary mass. Portions of the tumor cut surface
show necrosis and hemorrhage. The tumor invades hilar adipose and encases the renal artery and
vein at the hilum. There is no tumor present in the lumen of vascular margins. Tumor also encases
proximal ureter, but the ureter is probe patent. Tumor obliterates the renal pelvis. The 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.0
cm adrenal gland is hemorrhagic but uninvolved by tumor. Tumor appears to penetrate renal capsule
only towards the renal hilum. There does not appear to be penetration of Gerota's fascia. Remaining
renal parenchyma has a reasonably well defined cortico-medullary junction. Sectioning of the hilar soft
tissue reveals that it is largely replaced by an 11 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm lobulate mass of tumor that is
contiguous with the tumor in the kidney. Additionally, at the periphery of this main mass are multiple
<0.5 cm separate, tan, well circumscribed nodules of tumor probably representing lymph nodes with
metastatic disease.

A1 : urethral and vascular margins

A2-A8: renal tumor including extension into the hilar adipose and encasement of hilar

vascular and ureteral structures

A9: a section of kidney adjacent to tumor with small tumor nodules

A10: hilar mass

A11-A12: possible metastatic disease in hilar lymph nodes

A13: adrenal
