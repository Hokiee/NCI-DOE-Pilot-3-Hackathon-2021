Gross Description

A. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section analysis, labeled ”liver nodule.“ The

specimen consists of a 1.0 x 0.5 it 0.1 cm, soft, tan—pink irregular fragment of liver, which is entirely
submitted for frozen section as FSAt,

B. the specimen is received fresh for frozen section analysis labeled ”Whipple; specimen is
gallbladder, head of pancreas, distal stomach. and duodenum.“ The specimen consists of a reeected

portion of head of the pancreas (4.0 x 3.9 x 2.5 cm). the duodenum (12 cm in length and 2 cm in its
greatest diameter}, distal stomach (3- cm along the lessor curvature and 5.5 cm along the greater
curvature), and attached gallbladder {7.0 x 3.22} x 2.5 cm}. The landmarks otthe summon are inked

as follows; superior mesenteric artery stapled margin of resection yellow, portal vein groove blue, and
retroperitoneal surface black.

the pancreatic duct is probed-patent up to about 2 cm. at which point it appears to be obstructed by
an ill-deﬁned, indurated pancreatic mass {2.0 x 2.0 x 0.3 cm}. grossly coming to within 2 cm of the
pancreatic margin of resection, and 6.5 cm of the radial soft tissue margin. Grossly the mass does not
appear to involve the common bile duct, ampulla of Voter. or duodenum- The remainder of the
pancreatic parenchyma is grossly unremarkable. The gastric and the duodenal mucosa are grosst
unremarkable. Orr opening the attached gallbladder a moderate amount of red-brown, viscous bite is
expelled. No calculi are grossly appreciated. the wall of the gallbladder measures up to '3 mm in
thickness. The ‘mtemal surface is red—hrown and velvet'llke. Dissection of the allocated adipose tissue
isolates no deﬁnitive lymph nodes. The adipose tissue is submitted in its entirety.

Tivo representative frozen sections are taken and submitted as F351 and F332. A. representative

section of the tumor is submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory. Permanent representative
sections are submitted as:

83-: Mirror image of tumor su omittedE to Tissue Bank.

84—85: Tangential superior mesenten'c artery margin of resection.

86—37: Perpendicular pulmonary vein groove.

38439: Retroperitoneal surface.

Bid-Bi "t: tangential gastric margin of resection.

812‘: Tangential duodenal margin of resection.

51.3: Tumor showing its relationship to pancreatic duct.

B 14: Tumor showing its relationship to duodenum.

3154316: Tumor showing its relattonshtp to duodenum, common bile duct
and ampulla of Voter.

817: Additional section of tumor.

818:. Tumor showmg its relationship to nearest radial margin of
resection.

B is; Gmssiy unremarkable gastric mucosa.

BEE}: Grossly unremarkable duodenum.

321: Gallbladder.

822-824: Entire adipose tissue with attached panoreas.

825-830: Entire adipose tissue attached at lesser curvature.

331-854: Entire adipose tissue attached to lesser curvature.
