Comment

The right adrenalectomy specimen reveals a composite phecchromocytoma consisting of pheochromocytoma and
ganglicneuroma. Since the gland is almost entirely occupied by the tumor, the assessment of underlying adrenal
medullary hyperplasia cannot be performed accurately on this specimen.

The left adrenalectomy specimen shows a clear cell adrenal cortical adenoma with central degeneration. There is no
evidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia. There is alo no atrophy of the nontumorous adrenal cortex.

At least 30% of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are associated with familial syndromes. Since there is no
adrenal medullary hyperplasia in the nontumorous medulla (left adrenal). the possibility of MEN2 is. unlikely. The tumor will
also be tested for SDHB expression since loss of SDHB expression is regarded as a surrogate marker for familial
paraganglioma syndromes caused by any SDH mutations. The results of SDHB immunostain will follow as an addendum.

Addendum Comment
The stain for SDHB shows only focal loss of staining;
suggests that this is not and SDH—related lesion.

 

The MlB—1 labeling index is 5%.
