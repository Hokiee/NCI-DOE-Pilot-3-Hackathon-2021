FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued):

(ESTROGEN RECEPTOR, PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR, AND HER—2 STUDIES WERE
PERFORMED ON AN EARLIER BIOPSY AT SCOTTSDALE PATHOLOGY CONSULTANTS,
ACCESSION .

-PATHOLOGIC STAGE: pT2N0(i-)MX

~ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIC CHANGES: CYSTIC CHANGE, APOCRINE METAPLASIA,

COLUMNAR CELL CHANGE.

B. RIGHT BREAST TISSUE FROM INFERIOR FLAP, EXCISION:
—NO SIGNIFICANT PATHOLOGIC CHANGE.

C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1, BIOPSY:
-NO METASTATIC DEPOSIT IDENTIFIED IN ONE EXAMINED LYMPH NODE
(MULTIPLE SLIDES STAINED WITH HEMATOXYLIN&EOSIN AND WITH IMMUNOSTAIN
FOR CYTOKERATIN)

D. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE RIGHT AXILLA #2, BIOPSY:
-NO METASTATIC DEPOSIT IDENTIFIED IN ONE EXAMINED LYMPH NODE
(MULTIPLE SLIDES STAINED WITH HEMATOXYLIN&EOSIN AND WITH IMMUNOSTAIN
FOR CYTOKERATIN)

COMMENT:
The smaller tumor in the upper inner quadrant is present at the margin and

the greatest extent of the tumor cannot be assessed, this tumor might
otherwise be classified pTX. The cenral mass appears to be larger and is
completely excised. Its greatest dimension of 2.5 cm is the basis of the
pathologic T stage of pT2.

AMENDMENT COMMENT L_ _--':

The report is amended to add evaluation of markers (ER, PR, Her2)
performed on the upper inner quadrant tumor, sections of block A2. The
studies reported for the central tumor are from the report of a biopsy
designated "12:00" at another institution.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled with the patient’s name

designated "RIGHT MASTECTOMY SPECIMEN" is a 278 gram right mastectomy
oriented with short stitch superior, long lateral and double deep. The
specimen measures 16 cm medial to lateral, 14 cm superior to inferior and
3 cm anterior to posterior. The lightly pigmented superficial skin ellipse
measures 10 x 3 cm and displays a 1.7 cm everted nipple free of discharge.
No scars are noted. The deep margin is inked black and the superficial
surface of the upper inner quadrant is inked blue. Serially sectioned to
reveal a 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm firm pink white mass abutting the superficial
margin of the UIQ (1:00). The cut surface shows focal congestion

A1: one piece, skin

A2—A4: one piece in each, upper inner quadrant mass anterior margin
A5: one piece, central mass deep margin

A6: one piece, central mass

A7: upper outer quadrant

A8: lower outer quadrant

A9: lower inner quadrant

A10: upper inner quadrant

All: one piece, nipple

A12—A13: one piece each, representative mass. 13CF

Matched sections of Al-A2 and A6-A10 are submitted in for CBCP
protocol.

B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient’s name

designated "BREAST TISSUE FROM INFERIOR FLAP" are multiple pieces of
yellow tan lobulated adipose tissue measuring 4.7 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm in

B1-B4: one piece in each, 4C4
.0. Received fresh labeled with the patient's name
