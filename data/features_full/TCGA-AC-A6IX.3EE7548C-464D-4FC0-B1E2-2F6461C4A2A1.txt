COMMENT: The main tumor mass is located in the 34:00 region of the breast, and
grossly measures 3.5 cm in diameter. Adjacent to this nodule is a 1.2 cm secondary
nodule. A third 0.5 cm nodule is identiﬁed in the lower inner quadrant, and small fool
of invasive tumor are located in the subareolar breast tissue. The separately
submitted lymph node (specimen B) is positive for metastatic carcinoma, and is
included in the total lymph node count above.

Source of Specimen:
A. Breastleft

B. Apical node
Clinical HistomIOQerative Dx:
Left breast cancer.

Gross Desert tion:

A. Received fresh labeled "modiﬁed radical mastectomy" is a right modiﬁed radical mastectomy
specimen. The breast measures 16 cm (medial-lateral) x 15 cm (superior‘inferior) x 5 cm
(anterior-posterior), and weighs 538 9. There is an eiliptical portion of ten skin measuring 15 x 8 cm, with
nipple and areola present just medial of center. The attached axillary tail measures to x 4 x 1.5 cm. The
specimen is inked as foliows:

Blue - Superior,
Orange - Inferior,
Black - Deep.

The specimen is sliced from medial to iaterai in nine siices with slice 1 most medial, slice nine most
lateral (including axiliary tart). The nipple is in slice #4.

measuring 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm. T IS mass is 2 cm from the ciosest inferior margin, 1 cm from the deep margin,
and is at least 4 cm from all other margins. A nodule is appreciated superior-posterior to lesion #1, 1.2 x
0.8 cm, within slabs 4-5.
