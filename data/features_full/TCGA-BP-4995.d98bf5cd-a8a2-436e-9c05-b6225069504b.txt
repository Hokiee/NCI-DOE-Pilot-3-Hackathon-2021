Gross Descrigtion:

l). The specimen is received fresh. labeled "right kidney and part of adrenal" and consists of a kidney with attached ureter, renal
vessels and perinephric fat weighing 780 g in total. A portion of adrenal gland is also present on the specimen which measures
1.8 x 0.9 cm. The kidney measures 10.3 x 6 x 5 cm. The attached ureter measures 6.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter.
The attached renal vein measures 0.5 cm in length and 1.0 cm in diameter. The renal vessels and ureter margins are grossly
unremarkable. The kidney is inked black and bivalved to reveal a 4.6 x 2.7 x 2.5 cm well deﬁned. orange-yellow tumor in the
upper half of the kidney. Sectioning through the tumor reveals a soft, variegated cut surface. Grossly, the tumor appears to
extend into the renal vein and shots but does not invade the renal pelvis. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a
pinkabrown parenchyma. with a wail—deﬁned cortico~medullary iunction. The cortex measures 0.6 cm and the calyces appear
normal. No nodes are identiﬁed in the perinephric fat. The specimen is photographed. Representative sections are
submitted forﬂnd for permanent sections.
