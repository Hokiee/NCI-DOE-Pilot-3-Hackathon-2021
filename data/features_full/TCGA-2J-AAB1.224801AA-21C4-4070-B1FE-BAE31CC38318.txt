DIAGNOSIS:

D. Head of ancreas, duodenum, and common bile duct; Whi 1e
resection: Irijvasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma with muciriiibs - PW ng ‘ 07" MOW
features is identiﬁed forming a diffusely inﬁltrative mass (4.5 x

2.8 x 2.2 cm) in the region of the pancreatic head and possibly
arising from an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (2.0 x 1.5 x
1.5 cm). Tumor extends beyond the pancreas to involve
peripancreatic soft tissue and the adjacent duodenal wall. The
stomach and gallbladder are uninvolved by tumor. Angiolymphatic
invasion is identiﬁed. Tumor involves the common bile duct and
pancreatic duct. The uncinate margin is involved by tumor. The
portal vein groove is negative for tumor. The pancreatic

body and common hepatic duct margins are negative for tumor (see
parts B and C below); however, the uncinate margin remains positive
for tumor. Multiple (7 of 21) peripancreatic lymph nodes are

positive for metastatic carcinoma. . uurn:ngg:a12A§:ﬁc341-fg71agar-aArsiccEzsésacted

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received fresh labeled "common hepatic artery lymph nodes" is a
2.4 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm lymph node. Lymph node submitted. Grossed by

B. Received fresh labeled "pancreatic body margin with margin up"
is a 2.7 x 2.0 x 0.2 cm portion of pancreatic tissue with
orientation. Margin submitted. Grossed by

C. Received fresh labeled "common hepatic duct margin" is a 1.0 x
1.0 x 0.3 cm portion of tan—red ﬁbrous tissue without orientation.
Margin submitted. Grossed by

D. Received fresh labeled "head of pancreas, duodenum, portion of
stomach and jejunum, gallbladder" is a Whipple specimen consistent
of 52.0 cm in length portion of duodenum, 7.5 x 6.5 x 5.5 cm portion
ofpancreas, 7.8 x 3.7 x 1.0 cm gallbladder, and a 20.0 x 7.5 x 3.0
cm portion of stomach. The pancreatic uncinate margin is inked
yellow and shaved, the portal vein groove is inked black and
submitted perpendicularly. There is a 4.5 x 2.8 x 2.2 cm diffusely
inﬁltrative mass within the pancreatic head at the uncinate margin.
The mass extends to peripancreatic soft tissue. A stent is present
within the common bile duct. The pancreatic neck contains a 2.0 x
1.5 x 1.5 cm cyst on a side—branch duct. The gallbladder contains

no choleliths. Peripancreatic lymph nodes and periduodenal lymph

nodes are identiﬁed. Representative sections submitted. Grossed
