ADDENDA:
Parafﬁn embedded tumor tissue was sent to for DNA ploidy by MA studies. The report

 

 

, interpreted by follows:

Source: Prostate, Radical Prostatectomy, block BIS

Results:
The cancer cells are DNA aneuploid.

DlA ploidy test results have been validated by our laboratory for formal’n-ﬂxed. paraffin embedded tissue sections. Analysis was performed using the . '
instrument 1, which determined DNA ploidy status by comparing the DNA content of tumor cells and control cells (selected by operator). This
test was developed and "5 performance characteristics determined by This test has not been cleared or approved

by the us. Food and Drug Administration.

Proliferation index (MIB—l) = 5.48%.

Ki-67 Antigen immunohistochemical test results have been validmd by our laboratory for parafﬁn embedded tissue sections ﬁxed in formalin. Testing is
performed using the MlB-l clone and a polymer-based detection system. All controls show appropriate reactivity. Image collectionand analysis is performed using
“‘5 . . instrument. . The 7 modes the percentage of positive staining tumor nuclei (tumor selected by operator). This test wu
developed and its perfonnance characteristics determined by This test has not been cleared or approved by the
