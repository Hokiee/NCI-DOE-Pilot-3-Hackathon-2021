1. "Gallbladder.” Received in formalin in a medium container is a 9.1 x 3.5 x
2.7 cm gallbladder with smooth, unremarkable serosal surface. A 0.2 x 0.4 x
0.4 cm stump of cystic duct (probe patent) is present. The lumen of the
gallbladder contains yellow, thick, viscous bile and seven black stones,
ranging from 0.8 cm to 2.8 cm in greatest dimension. The gallbladder mucosa is
dark yellow, velvety with patchy areas of erythema. The maximum gallbladder
wall thickness is 0.2 cm. No areas of modularity or masses are present.

1A. Standard gallbladder sections.

2. ”Segment 8 liver mass, gross margins.”

An 8.5 x 8.0 x 5.5 cm segment of liver with a 2.2 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm nodule, 1.1
cm to closest parenchymal margin (inked blue). The segment of liver has
nodular capsule and parenchyma, without any other mass readily seen.

2A-2C. Mass with closest approach to margin.
2D. Remaining nodular parenchyma.

INTRAOPERATIVE GROSS DESCRIPTION:

2. Margin grossly negative (1.1 cm away).
I, have reviewed and interpreted the frozen section
material at the time it was requested.

Frozen section diagnosis is confirmed.
