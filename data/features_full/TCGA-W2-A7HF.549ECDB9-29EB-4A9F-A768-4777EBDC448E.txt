A. The specimen is labeled "left adrenal." Received in
formalin is a 244 gram, 12.0 x 8.0 x 4.4 cm, previously
incised and disrupted piece of tissue with an aggregate of
tissue measuring 9.0 x 5.0 x 1.5 cm. The tumor mass is tan-
yellow and encapsulated. The mass is sectioned to reveal a
tan—orange—pink cortex beneath the capsule and a dark brown

and soft stellate shaped medulla. Representative sections
are submitted as follows:

Cassette Designation:

Al-S Representative sections of
encapsulated mass
A6—7 Representative sections of

additional tissue aggregate

83' The specimen is labeled "right adrenal." Received fresh
and transferred to formalin is a 54 gram, 5.2 x 4.3 x 3.2
cm, previously incised, encapsulated, tan—brown to orange
mass. On sectioning, the mass appears to be completely
stbllate and tan-orange. Representative sections are
submitted in cassettes Bl through B4.

C. The specimen is labeled "parathyroid." Received fresh
for frozen section is a piece of tan—yellow tissue measuring
0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto for
frozen section. The frozen section remnant is resubmitted
for permanent in cassette C.

D. The specimen is labeled "left levels 3 and 4." Received
fresh and transferred to formalin is an 8.0 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm
piece of fibrofatty tissue with multiple palpable nodules.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Cassette Designation:

01 One lymph node candidate, bisected
DZ Three lymph node candidates

D3 Four lymph node candidates

04-6 Remaining fat, entirely submitted

E. The specimen is labeled "thyroid and level 6 contents."
Received fresh and transferred to formalin is an intact
thyroid with attached fibroadipose tissue and parathyroid
candidate and separate mass of fibroadipose tissue measuring
in aggregate of 6.5 x 8.0 x 3.5 cm. The thyroid and
attached tissue is inked in black. The attached
fibroadipose tissue and parathyroid candidate attached to
the right inferior lobe are removed. The thyroid gland

3-" Page 3 of5

weighs 36 grams and measures 7.0 x 5.0 x 2.5 cm. The
surface of the thyroid is smooth and tan—brown. The thyroid
is serially sectioned to reveal large, firm, pale nodules
occupying the left and right lobes. The nodule in the left
lobe measures 3.2 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm and contains an area of
calcification towards its inferior edge. The nodule in the
right lobe measures 3.0 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm and superiorly
contains a smooth walled cyst. The parathyroid candidates

weigh 0.4 grams and measure 1.4 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Cassette Designation:

E1—3 Representative sections of left
thyroid lobe nodule. E3 submitted after decal

E4 Representative sections of normal
left lobe thyroid

E5-7 Representative sections of right
thyroid nodule

E8 Representative sections of normal
right thyroid

E9 Parathyroid candidates

E10 Four lymph node candidates

F. The specimen is labeled "right levels 3 and 4."
Received fresh and transferred to formalin is a piece of
fibroadipose tissue measuring 6.5 x 3.5 x 1.0 cm.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Cassette Designation:

F1 One lymph node, bisected
F2 Three lymph node candidates
F3 Two lymph node candidates
F4 Two lymph node candidates
