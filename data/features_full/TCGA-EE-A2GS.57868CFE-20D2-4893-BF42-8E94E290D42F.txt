MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
(Dr ;

Three specimens were received.

1. ."LONG STITCH SHORT SAPHENOUS JUNCTION SHORT TIE ON LONG SAPHENOUS VEIN".
Two ellipses of skin which arejoined together. One ellipse of skin measures 300mm x 30mm with
underlying subcutis to a depth of 30mm and the smaller ellipse measures 70mm x 20mm with underlying
fatty tissue to a depth of 20mm. There are two sutures in the specimen container which have fallen off the
specimen. At one pole of the specimen is a tail of fatty tissue measuring 100 x 50 x 30mm, pressumed to be
ilio-inguinal dissection. On the skin surface are several marking circles which are pressumed to mark the
site of the subcutaneous nodules. The excision margins are all inked blue. Corresponding to the ﬁrst circle
on the skin, in the underlying subcutaneous tissue is a pale tan nodule measuring 7 x 7mm x 5mm. This
nodule appears to be located 6mm from the closest deep margin. There is another tan nodule adjacent to it
?lymph node measuring 5mm in maximum dimension. A second nodule is seen in the subcutaneous tissue
corresponding to the second circle on the skin. This nodule measures 21mm x 15mm x 20mm and was
sampled for ' / his nodule appears to be located 7mm away fromthe deep margin and 7mm
away from the peripheral margin. Corresponding to the third circle on the skin is a further tan nodule in the
subcutaneous nodule measuring 9mm x 8mm x 10mm. This nodule is located 7mm from the closest deep
margin and 10mm away from the closest lateral margin. Corresponding to the fourth circle on the skin is a
further tan nodule 8mm x 5 x 5mm. This nodule is located I lmm from the closest deep margin and 15mm
from the closest peripheral margin. Corresponding to the ﬁfth circle on the skin is a subcutaneous nodule
meaurinng 5mm x 5mm x 5mm. This nodule is located [mm from the deep margin and 10mm away from

the closest peripheral margin. The cut surface through the rest of the subcutaneous tissue shows no further
lesions.

HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

2. "LEFT COMMON AND EXTERNAL ILIAC NODES". Multiple fragments of fatty tissue 50 x 45 x
20mm in aggregate.

A&B. One lymph node bisected.
C-B. One lymph node trisected
F&G. One lymph node bisected.

H. One lymph node in fragments.
J. ?Five lymph nodes.

3. "LEFT OBTURATOR NODES". A fatty piece of tissue 40mm x 15mm x 15mm.

A&B. One large lymph node trisected.
C. One lymph node.

MICROSCOPIC REPORT

1., "LONG STITCH SHORT SAPHENOUS JUNCTION SHORT TIE ON LONG SAPHENOUS VEIN".
The 5 subcutaneous nodules (lA, 1C - 1F) show an undifferentiated nOn- pigmented epithelioid, naevoid and
spindle malignant neOpIasm consistent with metastatic amelanotic melanoma. The nodules in IA and IF are
within deﬁnite lymph nodes.

The remaining lymph nodes show (lG-IK) no evidence of malignancy.

 

Positive: 5100 +++, HMB45 +++, Melan A +++-

2. "LEFT COMMON AND EXTERNAL ILIAC NODES".
The 8 lymph nodes identified show no evidence of malignancy.

3. "LEFT OBTURATOR NODES".
Two lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy

SUMMARY

1. Leﬁﬂthigh ($2995) and lymph nodes (inguinal) - metastatic melanoma (5/12)
/ -._.,

2. Lymph nodes, left common and external iliac - no evidence of malignancy (0/8)
/

3. Lymph nodes, leﬁ obturator - no evidence of malignancy (0/2)
