Addendum Microscopic Description: 3/3 (97/43)”)

 

A panel of immunohistochemical stains are performed. The tumor cells appear negative for expression
of AE1/AE3, HMB-45, smooth muscle actin, MiTF, CD31, desmin, cytokeratin 7, and EMA. They
demonstrate diffuse strong immunoreactivity. A CD34 immunostain highlights the background tumor

vasculature. The tumor cells exhibit diffuse strong vimentin expression. The calculated MlB-l labeling
index is 15.7%.
