F inal Diagnosis:

A.~ C. Brain. right frontal mass #1. #2, #3. resection and i: Low grade oligodendroglioma with focal
increased cellulan'ty and mild increase in mitotic activity (WI-IO grade 1]).

 

lmmunohistochemical stains were performed on parafﬁn embedded tissue using antibodies to ID!“ (RI32H), 953.
and Ki-67. IDH1(R132H) immunostain is positive consistent with IDHl mutation. p53 protein is expressed in
rare cells. Ki-67 labeling varies from low to focally moderate. These ﬁndings support the above diagnosis.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies for lp19q deletion have been ordered on paraffin sections and
