B: Peri-aortic lymph node

Final Pathologic Diagnosis:
A. Kidney, left, nephrectomy:

Tumor histologic type: Papillary renal cell carcinoma, type 1
(Please, see note)
Sarcomatoid features (%): 0%
Tumor size: 5 cm (greatest dimension)
Other dimensions: 3 x 2 cm
Macroscopic extent of tumor: Tumor limited to the kidney
Focality: Unifocal
Fuhrman grade: 1 of 4
Microscopic extent of tumor:
Perinephric fat invasion: No
Renal sinus invasion: No
Renal vein involvement: No
Adrenal gland present: No
Cancer at resection margin: No
Pathologic ﬁndings in nonneoplastic kidney: Patchy chronic inﬂammation
Hilar lymph nodes present: Yes

Number involved/number present: 0/1
Ancillary Studies:

Racemase: Positive
Carbonic anhydrase: Positive
TFE3: Negative
Vimentin: Positive

SDHB: Negative
Cytokeratin 7: Positive

All controls stained appropriately.
Pathologic stage (2010) pT1b, pNO. pMX

B. Lymph nodes, periaortic, resection:
Fifteen lymph nodes, negative for malignancy (0/15).

The examination of this case material and the preparation of this report were
performed by the staff pathologist.

Note:

The tumor is predominantly papillary in architecture with cells that mainly have
an abundant cytoplasm that ranges from completely eosinophilic to clear.
Although, the morphologic features in general are in favor of papillary renal

cell carcinoma type I, the cytological features of "clear cells" are concerning

for clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma. lmmunohistochemical studies
showed that the tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin 7, racemase, carbonic
anhydrase and vimentin and are negative for TFE3 and SDHB. Controls stained
appropriately. The immunohistochemical profile and morphologic features are

consistent with the diagnosis of renal papillary carcinoma type I. Dr. has reviewed the case and
concurs with the diagnosis.

Gross Description:

Received are two formalin filled containers, each labeled with the patient's
name

Part A

Specimen components and dimensions: The specimen is the product of a left
nephrectomy, having aggregate dimensions of 15 x 11 x 10 cm and consists of a
kidney having dimensions of 10 x 7 x 5 cm, ureter with length of 5 cm. Adrenal
gland is not present.

Size, appearance, and location of tumor: 5 x 3 x 2 cm located in the
mid/superior pole, well encapsulated, inside the capsule the tumor is a friable

tissue, yellow tan- to grey tan in color. It is contained within the kidney
parenchyma boundaries.

Renal capsule/renal sinus: The renal capsule strips with ease.
Renal vein: The renal vein is free of tumor.
Lymph nodes (size, number, & location): Perihilarfibrofatty tissue weighs
100 grams, it was placed in a fat clearing agent for 30 minutes. Serial
sectioning and palpation does not reveal any obvious lymph nodes. Portions of
fibrous fatty tissue with probable lymph nodes are submitted in cassettes A13-14
for microscopic analysis.
Other findings: Multiple cortical cysts that measure from 0.5 cm up to 2 cm in
greatest dimension.
Blocks submitted:

A1 ureter and vascular margins;

A2-4 tumor to renal capsule;

A5-6 tumor to renal sinus fat;

A7 tumor to collecting system;

A8 tumor;

A9-12 representative sections of the cysts;

A13-14 Perihilar ﬁbrofatty tissue with possible whole lymph nodes.

Part B is additionally labeled "periaortic lymph nodes" and consists of multiple
portions of fibrofatty tissue that measure in aggregate 3 x 3 x 0.8 cm.

Sectioning reveals four possible lymph nodes that range from 0.5 cm up to 2 cm
in greatest dimension.

Blocks submitted:
B1-2 multiple whole lymph nodes;
B3 one lymph node bisected;
B4 one lymph node bisected;
B5 one lymph node bisected.

Microscopic Description:

The final diagnosis of each specimen incorporates the microscopic examination
findings.
