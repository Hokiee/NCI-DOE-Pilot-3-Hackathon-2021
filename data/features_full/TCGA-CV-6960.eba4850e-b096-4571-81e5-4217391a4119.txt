Located at the base of tongue and epiglottis, is an ulcerated mass (5.5 x
5.0 cm and 4.5 cm in depth). The mass involves the epigTottis, base of
tongue, pre—epiglottic space and pyriform sinus. The tumor grossly extends to
the anterior intrinsic muscle margins. The tumor is present in supra lottic
space and extends inferiorly to 1 cm superior to true vocal cords. T e lesion
grossly involves both right and lateraT aspects of the supraglottic space.
However, the glottic space and infragTottic spaces are not involved. The
tumor anteriorTy approaches the hyoid bone.

The true and fa se vocal cords, the trachea and salivary glands are
unremarkabTe. Mu1tip1e lymph nodes are retrieved (ranging from 1.5 to 0.2 cm
in greatest dimension).

The tip of tongue is granular.

INK CODE: Blue — the floor of mouth margin and mucosal margin. Green —
the anterior soft tissue mar in.
