BACKGROUND:

EGFR mutations are present In about 10-15% of non-Asian and up to 40% of the Asian patients with non-smaII—oell lung
cancer (NSCLC) (1.2). They are more frequent in non-smokers, females. and in tumors with adenocarcinoma histology.
Activating EGFR mutations Including exon 19 deletions, exon 21 point mutations (L858R, L861Q), and exon 18 GTI9AlClS
point mutation are associated with the clinical response to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (gefitinib
erlotinlb) (2-4). Advanced NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations show response rates of more than 70%, with
progression-free survival up to 14 month (2,3). However. EGFR mutations in exon 20 (Insertions and T790M point
mutation) are associated with acquired resistance to Title (4). KRAS mutations and BRAF mutations are found in
approximately 30% and 2% of lung adenocarcinomas respectively. The most common mutation types are KRAS codon
12l13 and BRAF VSODE. Patients with these mutations tend to be resistant to erlotlnib and geﬂtlnlb (2,5,6). However,
not all tumors reveal such a correlation and, therefore, the results of molecular testing should be interpreted in
conjunction with other laboratory and clinical ﬁndings.

 

MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS: . . _

For cytology samples, extraction of DNA was performed from the ﬂuid or sample prow'ded. For surgical specimens, manual mrcrodlssectron was
perfumed. Specimens with the minimum of 50% of tumor cells in a microdissection target or more than 300 cells for FNA spec-men were .
accepted for the analysis. DNA was isolated using standard laboratory procedure. Optical density readings were obtained. For the detection of
mutation, DNA was ampliﬁed with primers for the exons 2 and 3 of the KRAS gene and axons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. Then, forward and
reverse sequencing was performed using the BigDye Terminator Kit on ABl3130 he sequencing electrophorograms were
analyzed for the presence of mutations The method sensllivlh/ is approximaleh/ o o m an a e as n a background of normal DNA. For
detection of BRAF mutation, realalime PCR was performed on the ngthycler platform to amplify BRAF mommi sequences. Post-PCR
melting curve analysis was used to detect possible mutations. If required, the mutation type was continued by equencing of the PCR
product on ABl3130. The limit of detection is approximately 10-20% of alleles with mutation present in the background of normal DNA.

“U3" I Kb
ALK translocation is detected as follows:

 

ALK negative:
0-1 5% of cells positive for the ALK rearrangement.

Normal cells without the ALK translocation show green and orange signals in juxtaposition.

ALK positive:
Greater than 15% of cells positive for the ALK reanangement.

Cells with the ALK translocation show one of the following patterns: One pair of signals (green and orange) fused or in juxtaposition

and one green and one orange signal separated; Only split 0 & G (single 0 and single G in the same nucleus); Only single 0;
Fusion + single 0.

 

c-ME T ampliﬁcation is detected as follows:

FGFR1(Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1) is a protein coding gene whose largest transcript features 18 axons, measures 5.6
kb and is located on chromosome Bp11.2.The FGFR1 probe mix consists of a green 154kb probe telomeric to the FGFRT gene
spanning the LETM2-202 gene and 088135 marker. The red probe is 52kb centromeric to the FGFR1 gene Spanning a 108kb
region including the 088389 marker.
