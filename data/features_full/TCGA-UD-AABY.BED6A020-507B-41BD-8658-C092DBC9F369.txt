LABORATORY NUMBER:

SPECIMEN :
PLEURAI. BFFUSION .

MACROSCOPIC:

500ml of translucent yellow/orange fluid received. Two alcohol fixed smears
and two air dried smears prepared.

MICROSCOPIC:

The smears are highly cellular and contain numerous balls and crowded
clusters of cells in a background of histiocytes, mesothelial cells and
lymphocytes. The cells within the balls have small oval nuclei. Some cell
in cell clustering is present. Occasional cells have vacuolated cytoplasm.
In some of the papillary clusters there is a central core of fibrous tissue.
The cell block is also cellular and contains numerous clusters of cells, some
of which have a central fibrous core. Immunoperoxidase staining for

Cytokeratin and EMA are positive and for CEA is negative. The cells contain
glycogen and mucin is not seen.

CONCLU S ION :

The cytologic features are those of a malignant effusion and are consistent
with malignant mesothelioma. A portion of the specimen has been reserved in

glutaraldehyde and will be sent for electron microscopic confirmation of the
diagnosis.

SPECIMEN:
Pleural fluid
ELECTRON MICROSCOPY:

As noted in the cytological preparations, there are clusters of mesothelial cells, sometimes
associated with a central collagenous core, forming small papillary structures. The cells have
moderately irregular nuclei and some possess prominent nucleoli. The free surfaces of the cells
show well-formed, long and thin microvilli devoid of glycocalyx and lacking any ﬁlamentous
core rootlets. These microvillOus are slender, wavy and often branched. Apically the cells are
joined by well formed junctional complexes. In the cytoplasm, there are perinuclear
intermediate ﬁlaments arranged as tonoﬁlaments and some of these insert into well formed
desmosomes. There are small collections of rosetted glycogen in the cytoplasm. Other
organelles are non-speciﬁcally distributed. There are no mucin granules evident.

CONCLUSION:

Pleural ﬂuid — The ultrastructural characteristics are in keeping with a malignant mesothelioma.
