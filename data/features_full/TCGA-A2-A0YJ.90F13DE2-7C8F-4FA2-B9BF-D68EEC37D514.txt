PART A RECEIVED LABELED , LEI-T MODIFIED RADICAL

MASTECTOMY STITCH AT 12 O'CLOCK, IS A LEFT MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY
. WITH A SKIN ELLIPSE MEASURING 20 X 8.5 m WITH A GROSSLY UNREMARKABLE
NIPPLE. THE SPECIMEN ITSELF MEASURES 26.5 X 14 X 3.5 CM. THE AXILLARY
CONTENTS ARE DISSECTED OFF THE SPECIMEN AND THIS AREA IS MARKED WITH RED
INK DENOTING THAT THIS IS NOT A TRUE MARGIN. THE AXILLARY TAIL IS
EXAMINED FOR LYMPH NODES. IN THE LOWER AXILLARY TAIL THERE IS A 3.7-CM
IN GREATEST DIMENSION GROSSLY POSITIVE LYMPH NODE. ADDITIONAL NODES ARE
ALSO IDENTIFIED. TWO ADDITIONAL GROSSLY POSITIVE NODES ARE SUBMITTED,
ONE SECTION EACH, IN A1 AND A2 WITH MIRROR IMAGES PER PROTOCOL. A3 IS A
GROSSLY UNREMARKABLE LYMPH NODE WITH MIRROR IMAGE IN PROTOCOL. A4--ONE
SECTION OF A GROSSLY POSITIVE LYMPH NODE WITH MIRROR IMAGE PROTOCOL,
A5--LARGEST LY'MPH NODE, A6--TWO NODES, EACH BISECTED, A7—-TWO NODES, EACH A
BISECTED, A8--NINE NODES. EIGHTEEN LYMPH NODES ARE IDENTIFIED IN ALL.

CM OF THE DEEP MARGIN. CENTRALLY IN THE BREAST THE TISSUE IS TAN AND
FIBROUS. THE PERIMETER OF THE SPECIMEN IS FATTY WITH FI’NE FIBROUS BANDS.
SECTIONS OF THE BREAST ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: A9--NIPPLE AND SKIN
(MIRROR IMAGE TO PROTOCOL), A10--SECTION OF TUMOR TO INCLUDE DEEP MARGIN
(MIRROR IMAGE TO PROTOCOL), A11 THROUGH A16--A FULL CROSS SECTION FROM
SUPERIOR TO INFERIOR OF THE LESION TO INCLUDE THE DEEP MARGIN IN All, 12,
14, AND 16 WITH A13 AND A15 REPRESENTING THE SUPERFICIAL SECTIONS TO A12
AND A14, RESPECTIVELY, A17--TUMOR AND DEEP MARGIN, A18--THE MOST LATERAL
ASPECT OF THE LESION, A19--THE MEDIAL ASPECT OF THE LESION (4.5 CM FROM
PREVIOUS SECTION) , A20--LOWER OUTER QUADRANT, A21--UPPER OUTER QUADRANT,
A22--UPPER INNER QUADRANT 5 CM FROM TUMOR, A23-LOWER INNER QUADRANT 5 CM
FROM TUMOR, A22 AND A23--MIRROR IMAGES TO PROTOCOL TISSUE.

0 PART B RECEIVED LABELED DEEP MARGIN BENEATH TUMOR
STITCH NEW MARGIN, IS AN IRREGULAR PORTION OF RED-TAN MUSCU'LAR TISSUE
WITH CAUTERY ARTIFACT ON THE SIDE WITH THE SUTURE DENOTING THE NEW
