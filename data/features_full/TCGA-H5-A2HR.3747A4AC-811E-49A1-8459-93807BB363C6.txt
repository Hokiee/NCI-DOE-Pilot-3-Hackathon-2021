Final Pathologic Diagnosis

A) OMENTUM (EXCISION):

- Benign fibroadipose tissue, negative for tumor.

B) UTERUS, CERVIX, BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES (TOTAL ABDOMINAL HYSTERECTOMY

AND BILATERAL SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY):

- Endometrial adenocarcinoma,“endometrioid type (not otherwise
characterized), FIGO (nuclear) grade III (8.0 cm) (see comment).

- Tumor invades the underlying myometrium to a depth of 0.4 cm out
of a total myometrial thickness of 2.2 cm (less than half).

- Tumor extends into the lower uterine segment and focally replaces
the adjoining superﬁcial endocervical glands (section B5), but no
destructive cervical stromal invasion seen; remaining cervix is free
of tumor (see comment).

- Lymphovascular emboli present (section B5).

- All surgical margins are free of tumor; closest circumferential margin
is 1.5 cm from invasive tumor.

- Bilateral parametria are free of tumor.

- Adenomyosis.

- Leiomyomata.

- Non-neoplastic endometrium is weakly proliferative; no hyperplasia
seen.

- . Mild chronic cervicitis with squamous metaplasia.

- Bilateral tubes and ovaries, no significant pathologic change.

C) LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES (DISSECTION):

- Eight lymph nodes, negative for tumor (0/8).

D) LEFT OBTURATOR LYMPH NODES (DISSECTION):

- Two lymph nodes, negative for tumor (0/2).

E) RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES (DISSECTION):

- Four lymph nodes, negative for tumor (0/4).

F) RIGHT OBTURATOR LYMPH NODES (DISSECTION):

- Five lymph nodes, negative for tumor (0/5).

Veriﬁed Date/Time:

Specimen A: Designated "omentum" is received in formalin labeled with the patient’s name and "omentum". Specimen
consists of a portion of yellow lobulated fibroadipose tissue measuring 10 x 4 x 1 cm. There are no areas of hemorrhage or
necrosis. The specimen is searched for nodes and none are identified.

Section code: A1 -A5 — representative sections.

Specimen B: Designated "uterus tubes and ovarV“ is received fresh for lntraoperative consultation and frozen section at

l. on ‘ and reported at abeled with the patient’s name and "uterus tubes and ovary“.
Specimen consists of a uterus with attached bilateral tubes and ovaries weighing 188 gm and measuring 8 cm from cornu to
cornu, 5 cm from anterior to posterior and 11 cm from fundus to cervix. The external surface is gray/tan with two subserosal
white/tan whorled nodules measuring 0.3 and 0.8 cm in diameter. The cervix has a surface diameter of 4 x 3 cm and is light
tan and unremarkable. The cervical 05 measures 0.5 cm in diameter. The specimen is bivalved to reveal an exophytic soft
gray/tan tumor measuring 8 x 5 x 2 cm. The endometrium appears to measures 0.2 cm in thickness. The myometrium
measures 2 cm in thickness. The tumor appears to be superficially invasive to a depth of 0.5 cm. Multiple intramural and
submucosal white—whorled nodules are also identified without hemorrhage or necrosis on cut surface. The white-whorled
nodules range in size from 0.2 cm in diameter to 2.5 cm in diameter. The tumor extends into the lower uterine segment. The
right tube measures 6 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter with a 0.2 cm paratubal cyst. The left tube measures 6 cm in length x
0.3 cm in diameter. The left ovary is tan/white and measures 1.8 x 1 x 0.5 cm and weighs 2.5 gm. The right ovary measures
2 x 1 x 1 cm and weighs 2.1 gm. Cut surface of ovaries are unremarkable. Representative section of tumor is submitted to

Tumor Bank. and Drug Resistance Assays. A representative section of tumor is frozen. Frozen section

diagnosis per Dr. ' iometrioid adenocarcinoma, Nuclear grade 3. Suspicious for superficial myometrial
invasion. Grossly tumor involves lower uterine segment. The specimen is photographed.
Section code: B1 — frozen section control; 82; anterior cervix; B3 — posterior cervix; B4 - anterior lower uterine segment; BS —
posterior lower uterine segment; 86-89 — representative sections of tumor and anterior endometrium/myometrium; B10-B12 —
sections of tumor and posterior endometrium/myometrium; B13 -— left parametrium; B14 — right parametrium; B15 —- largest
white-whorled nodule; B16-B18 - representative sections of each white-whorled nodule; B19 — left ovary and tube; 820 — right
tube and ovary.

Specimen C: Designated “left pelvic lymph node“ is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "left pelvic lymph
node“. Specimen consists of multiple fragments of fibrofatty tissue measuring 3.5 x 3 x 1 cm in aggregate. Specimen is
searched for nodes.

Section code: C1 ~ suspected lymph node, bisected; C2 — single lymph node, bisected; C3 — remainder of specimen.

Specimen D: Designated "left obturator lymph node“ is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "left obturator
lymph node“. Specimen consists of a single portion of fibrofatty tissue measuring 3 x 1 x 0.5 cm. Specimen is searched for

nodes.
Section code: D1 — single lymph node, bisected; DZ — remainder of specimen.
