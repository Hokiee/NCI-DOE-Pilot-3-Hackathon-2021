A1: superior pole
A2-A9: cross-section is submitted from superior to inferior (4~5, 6-7, 8-9: bisected sections)
A10-A12: inferior pole. perpendicular sections
B. LEFT THYROID LOBE
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "left thyroid lobe" is an oriented 4-g lobe of
thyroid measuring 3.8 x 2.4 x 0.5 cm with a suture designating the superior pole. Capsule is nodular,
