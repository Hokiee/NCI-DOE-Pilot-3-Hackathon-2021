Comment

Part B: The metastatic carcinoma is represented by a single gland that is
positive for Cam5.2. Irnmunohistochemical stain PSA is non-contributory due to
the absence of the malignant gland on a section submitted for
immunohistochemistry.

Interpretation performed by the Attending Pathologist and reviewed with the

Clinical History:
The patient is a year-old male with bladder cancer undergoing cystectomy.

Specimens Received:

A: Left pelvic lymph nodes

B: Right pelvic lymph nodes

C: Bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, vas deferens
D: Left distal ureter stitch

Gross Description:
The specimens are received in four containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.

A. The ﬁrst container is additionally identiﬁed as, "left pelvic lymph
nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is an aggregate of lobulated
yellow ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 7.2 x 5.4 x 1.3 cm. The specimen is
dissected for lymph node candidates. 5 lymph node candidates are identiﬁed
measuring 0.5—4.5 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph node candidates are
entirely submitted as follows:

Al: 2 lymph node candidates

A2: One lymph node candidate, bisected

A3-A4: One lymph node candidate, sectioned

A5-A8: One lymph node candidate, sectioned

B. The second container is additionally identiﬁed as, "right pelvic lymph
nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is an aggregate of lobulated
yellow ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 7.9 x 7.1 x 1.6 cm. The specimen is
dissected for lymph node candidates. 10 lymph node candidates are identiﬁed
measuring 0.4-7.5 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph node candidates are
entirely submitted as follows:

B1: 4 lymph node candidates

B2: 3 lymph node candidates

B3: One lymph node candidate, bisected

B4-B5: One lymph node candidate, sectioned

B6-B8: One lymph node candidate, sectioned

C. The third container is additionally identiﬁed as, "3. Bladder, prostate,

seminal vesicles, vas deferens ". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a
514.6 g, 20.5 x 11 x 5 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen. The bladder is 8.5 x 8.5
x 5 cm. The right ureteral stump is 4.5 x 0.5 cm and the left ureteral stump is

3 x 0.4 cm. The prostate is 6.3 x 4.8 x 4.8 cm. The right seminal vesicle is 4.3

x 2.3 x 0.9 cm and the right vas deferens is 11.8 x 0.4 cm. The left seminal
vesicle is 4.3 x 2.4 x 1 cm and the left vas deferens is 6.5 x 0.5 cm. There are

2 additional detached segments of vas deferens measuring 3.8 x 0.4 cm and 9.8 x

0.3 cm. The right half of the prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left

half is inked black. The bladder and prostate are opened anteriorly along the
urethra. The prostate is surrounded by a thin, intact membranous capsule and
sectioning demonstrates rubbery, pink-tan, pen-urethral nodularity and a 3.5 x

1 x 1 cm area of ﬁrm, tan-white induration along the posterior aspect

bilaterally. The seminal vesicles contain dilated cystic spaces ﬁlled with

tan, gelatinous material. The opened bladder reveals a 3 x 2.7 cm ulceration
located in the right posterior/lateral wall with a 5 x 4.2 cm surrounding area

of hemorrhagic mucosa. The remaining bladder mucosa is edematous, wrinkled and
pink—tan with a uniform 0.2 cm wall thickness. The bladder is serially

sectioned to reveal tumor grossly extending to a depth of 1.4 cm which is 2.4 cm
from the inked blue margin. Bilateral ureteral oriﬁces, adjacent to the

trigone, are identiﬁed and probe patent.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

C1: Distal prostatic urethral margin (apex)

C2: Right and left ureter resection margin (right side is inked blue)

C3-C5: Prostate apex, shaved and serially sectioned

C6-C9: Representative right lobe of prostate from apex to base

C10-C13: Representative left lobe of prostate submitted from apex to base
C14: Right seminal vesicle and vas deferens

C15: Left seminal vesicle and vas deferens

C16: Uninvolved bladder mucosa, posterior wall

C17: Uninvolved bladder mucosa, left lateral wall

C18: Hemorrhagic mucosa, dome

C19: Uninvolved bladder mucosa, anterior wall

C20-C30: Bladder mass/Ulceration (entirely submitted) with the deepest area of
invasion in cassette C20 (with inked margin deep to the area of invasion in
cassette C21).

D. The fourth container is additionally identiﬁed as, "left distal ureter

stitch on non-margin side". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a rubbery
white-tan tubular structure measuring 0.9 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter.
There is a stitch designating the non-margin side. The margin side is shaved and
submitted in D1 .
