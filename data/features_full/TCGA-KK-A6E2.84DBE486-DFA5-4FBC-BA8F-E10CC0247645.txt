DIAGNOSIS:

(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES AND PERIRECTAL NODULE:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 7 (3+4). (SEE COMMENT)
CARCINOMA EXTENDING TO THE ANTERIOR BLADDER NECK MARGIN OF
RESECTION. (SEE COMMENT)
FINAL BLADDER NECK MARGIN OF RESECTION (SPECIMENS F & G), FREE OF

TUMOR.

No extra prostatic extension present.
PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN). HIGH GRADE.
Right and 1eft seminai vesicies, no tumor present.
segments of right and ieft vasa deferentia, no tumor present.
Focai granuiomas in prostatic parenchyma. (See Comment)
Periprostatic noduie with necrotizing granuiomatous infiammation.
(See Comment)

(F) ADDITIONAL LEFT BLADDER NECK MARGIN:
smooth muscie focaiiy iined by urotheiium consistent with biadder
neck, no tumor present. Few giands consistent with prostatic giands
present.No prostatic giands present at margin.

(G) ADDITIONAL RIGHT BLADDER NECK MARGIN:
Smooth muscie and adipose tissue consistent with biadder neck tissue,

no tumor present.

No prostatic giands present.

COMMENT:

The prostate giand contains three separate foei of prostatic adenocarcinoma,
one in_the tran51tion zone and two in the peripherai zone. The dominant tumor
focus is iocated on the mid anterior and ieft transition zone. This tumor

present in the four cross sections of the prostate and extensiveiy in the apex
and base regions. This tumor focus extends in the prostatectomy specimen to

Spec1men DateITlme:

the right anterior biadder neck margin of resection: _The extent of marginai
invoivement is 4.0 mm. It shouid be noted that additionai, separateiy
submitted specimens from the biadder neck (parts F and G) are free of tumor.

The peripherai zone foci are iocated in the 1eft iaterai and Weft
posteroiaterai peripherai zone. These tumor foci measure 0.3 x 0.2 and 0.2 x

1ess than 0.1 mm and each is present in age cross section. These tumor foc1
are confined to the prostate and the margins of resection are free of tumor.

The eriprostatic noduie present on the right posterior surface (base ievei)
of t e rostate is composed of necrotizina granuiomatous infiammation. It
cannot e estabiished with certainty if t e process is iocated in a
periprostatic iymph node. A few granuiomas without centrai necrosis and one
or two with focai necrosis are present within the prostate proper. Speciai
stains for organisms performed on sections from the
periprostatic noduie are pending. A suppiementai report wiii foiiow.

GROSS:

(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES — A specimen consisting of a prostate,
attached right and ieft seminai vesicies and attached segments of right and
ieft vasa deferentia.

The prostate giand (5.2 x 3.7 x 4.0 cm, 48 grams, post fixation) has the
usuai shape. The soft tissue present aiong the right and left posteroiaterai
aspects of the prostate appears symmetrica . A firm noduie is iocated in the
right posterior surface of the prostate in the base region. This noduie
measures 2.3 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. T e center of the noduie contains soft yeiiow
materia]. Seriai cross sections demonstrate possibie carcinoma in the ieft
transition zone of the first cross section. No unequivocai tumor is
identified in the peripherai zone.

The seminai vesicies and segments of vasa deferentia are symmetricai and
grossiy free of tumor.

SECTION CODE: C1, ieft transition zone, punch biopsy; C2, possibie
carcinoma ieft transition zone: C3, C4, ri ht seminai vesicie and segment of
right vas deferens from the base towards t e tip; C5, C6, ieft seminai vesicie
and segment of ieft vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C7. C8,
prostatic base right border; C9, C10, prostatic base right posterior border;
C11-C21, prostatic base centrai portion; C22, C23, prostatic base ieft border;
C24, C25, prostatic base 1eft posterior border; C26, C27, apex anterior;
C28¢C30, apex Weft; C31—C33, apex posterior; C34, apex right: C35, detached
portions of margin of resection according to specimen radiograph; C36—C57,
sections of the four cross sections of the prostate according to specimen
radiograph.

The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, ieft surface in
red, right surface in yeiiow and posterior surface in biack. Orange ink (C57)
denotes a surface which is not a true margin of resection.

(F) ADDITIONAL LEFT BLADDER NECK MARGIN (LONG STITCH MARKS FINAL MARGIN) - A
fragment of tan-gray tissue (3.3 x 0.9 x 0.3 cm). There are muitipie Tong
sutures aiong one surface of the fragment. Muitipie smaii sutures are present
on the oppOSite surface. The surface corresponding to the Tang sutures is
inked red. The specimen is seriaiiy sectioned perpendicuiar to the surface
inked red and submitted as F1 and F2.

(G) ADDITIONAL RIGHT BLADDER NECK MARGIN (LONG STITCH IS FINAL MARGIN) — A
fragment of firm tan—gray tissue (2.8 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm). Muitipie Tong sutures
are present on one surface of the specimen and muiti 1e short Sutures on the
opposite surface. The surface corresponding to the gong sutures is inked

surface inked yeiiow and submitted entireiy as 61 and G2.
