Small foci of metastatic carcinoma in 3 of 15 lymph nodes. See note.

PRIMARY TUMOR:
pT2: Tumor >2cm, but <=4cm, limited to thyroid.

REGIONAL LYMPH NODES:
leA: regional lymph node metastasis, See note.

VENOUS/LYMPHATIC INVASION:
Present.

ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS:
Thyroiditis (lymphocytic).

nodes, and levels and immunostains for cytokeratin highlight
individual metastatic carcinoma cells in association with these
