Microscopy

Analysis of the specimen shows an intraocular tumor which morphological characteristics are
those of a melanoma. The lesion is composed of fusiform cells. The pigment content is
moderate. The mitotic index is low (less mitosis by field at the 40 magniﬁcation.)There are no
necrosis. The lesion is implanted at the posterior pole, covering the emergence of the optic
nerve. It measures 13 mm at the basis with 7 mm of thickness. It stays distant from the ciliary
processes. At the posterior pole, the optic foramen,the optic nerve and the meningeal sheaths
are free. The cut end of the optic nerve is also free.

Conclusion

Choroidal melanoma with fusiform cells

Size of the tumor: 10 mm

Neither involvement of the sclera nor extrascleral extension

Ciliary processes, optic foramen and optic nerve are free.
