GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. The specimen consists of a 7.3 x 2.7 x 2.1 cm gallbladder that has a
tan—grey outer serosa that appears complete apart from the area of attachment
to the liver bed. It contains a viscous dark green fluid without calculi.
Around the proximal end of the gallbladder and extending down to the
midportion is a cord—like portion of fibrofatty tissue without nodularity. The
inner mucosa is bile stained and velvety and speckled with pinpoint yellow
lesions. Cassettes submitted as follows: representative sections of
gallbladder in block A.

B. The specimen consists of a 12.5 x 10.5 x 6 cm portion of liver weighing 301
g. It has previously been inked with silver nitrate and the surgical margin
has been inked black. Within the liver there is a 6.5 x 5.3 x 5.1 cm
irregularly circumscribed tan—yellow multiply lobulated smooth heterogeneous

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

lesion. It abuts the serosa and is creating nodules on the serosal surface.
It comes to within 1.3 cm of the surgical margin. As well there is a similar
appearing lesion that is 1.0 cm in diameter that is 0.7 cm away from the major
lesion, 0.9 cm away from the serosal surface, and 1.0 cm away from the
surgical margin. The remainder of the parenchyma has an orange-brown
heterogeneous slightly nodular appearance. Cassettes submitted as follows:

B1,B2 - liver parenchyma uninvolved by tumor.

B3 — portion of tumor abutting serosal surface.

B4 - tumor with serosal nodule.

B5 — section of parenchyma between nodules.

B6 — smaller tumor with serosal and surgical margin.
B7 - largest tumor with surgical margin.

B8 - representative section of tumor.

B9 — representative section of tumor with serosa.

{% MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
B. Sections of liver away from the tumor show a preserved lobular
architecture. The portal areas are expanded due to inflammatory cell
infiltration and fibrosis. Piecemeal necrosis and portal to portal fibrous
strands are present. The lobular parenchyma shows spotty necrosis and
sinusoidal permeation by lymphocytes. Mild macrovesicular steatosis is also
present. Special stain for iron shows iron overload in hepatocytes (3+) and
special stain for alpha 1 antitrypsin globules is negative.
