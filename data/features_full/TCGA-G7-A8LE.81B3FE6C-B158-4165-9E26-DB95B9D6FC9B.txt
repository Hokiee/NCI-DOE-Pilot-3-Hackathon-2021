GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. LEFT PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY
fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "left partial nephrectomy" is a ruptured
partial nephrectomy specimen with attached perirenal adipose tissue weighing 31 g and measuring 9.5
x 4 x 3.5 cm. A suture designates the surgical resection margin, inked blue (remainder of the specimen
inked black). The specimen is sectioned to show an ill-deﬁned. soft, 4 x 3.8 x 3 cm mass with
heterogeneous, focally hemorrhagic cut surface approaching the surgical resection margin at 0,1 cm.
The mass grossly involves the surrounding adipose tissue. Gross photograph is taken. A portion of the
specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representative sections are submitted:
A1-A4: Mass, surgical resection margin
A5-A6: Mass, disrupted area
A7-A8: Mass, adipose tissue

CLINICAL HISTORY:
None Given

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left renal mass
