*****GROSS DESCRIPTION:*****

The specimens are received in seven properly labeled containers with the
patient' 5 name and accession number.

A. The specimen is designated "left perimetrium" and consists of
two portions of tan to yellow soft tissue that are 1.8 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm and
1.5 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm. Each portion of tissue is bisected. TE 1

B. The specimen is designated "right perimetrium" and consists of
a 3.0 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm aggregate of multiple portions of tan-yellow soft
tissue. One of the portions of tissue contains a staple line. The
specimen is serially sectioned. RS 2

Summary of Cassettes: 81-2, entire specimen, only the staple line
remains in the container

C. The specimen is designated "radical hysterectomy (uterus,
cervix, upper vagina)" and consists of a 231.4 gram uterus and cervix with
attached bilateral adnexal structures that is 9.6 cm from fundus to
posterior vaginal cuff margin, 4.8 cm from cornu to cornu and 4.3 cm from
anterior to posterior. The serosa is tan-pink and smooth. Right and left
parametrium is present which is shaved and entirely submitted. The serosa,
cervical resection margins and parametrium are inked as follows: anterior =
blue, posterior a black. Portions of anterior and posterior, grossly
unremarkable vaginal cuff is present which ranges in length from 0.8 to 2.9
cm. The anterior vaginal cuff is tan—white, wrinkled and displays no
discrete lesions. The posterior vaginal cuff is tan-white to brown and
slightly thickened. No discrete lesions are identified on the mucosal
surfacei’ The anterior ectocervical mucosa displays a 2.5 cm (width) x 1.3
cm (length) tan-brown, endophytic, ulcerated mass that is 2.5 cm from the
anterior vaginal cuff margin. Cut sections through the mass are tan—white,
smooth, have a maximum depth of 0.3 cm and are 1.5 cm from the blue—inked
stromal margin. The posterior ectocervix contains a red-brown to
gray-green, rubbery, exophytic mass that is 4.7 cm (width) x 2.5 cm
(length). The mass is 2.1 cm from the posterior vaginal cuff margin. Cut
sections through the mass are tan-pink to white, have a maximum depth of
1.9 cm and are 1.1 cm from the black-inked stromal margin. The anterior
mass is grossly confined to the ectocervix while the posterior mass extends
to involve the endocervical mucosa. The triangular endometrial cavity is
lined by a tan-pink to red, soft endometrium that is 0.2 cm in average
thickness. No discrete endometrial lesions are identified. The myometrium
is tan—pink, moderately trabeculated and contains three tan-white,
well—circumscribed, rubbery, whorled nodules that range from 0.4 cm in
greatest dimension to 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm. The nodules are located in the
intramural aspect of the anterior and posterior myometrium. Upon
sectioning, no areas of hemorrhage or necrosis are identified. The right
tubo~ovarian complex is 10.5 grams. The previously interrupted fimbriated
fallopian tube is 3.5 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter. The serosa is
purple and wrinkled. Cut sections reveal a lumen. The tan—yellow to
purple, focally cystic right ovary is 3.2 x 2.2 x 2.0 cm. The cut surfaces
are tan-white, lobulated and contain two smooth—walled, blood-filled cysts

that are 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm and 1.7 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm. Both blood-filled
cysts are consistent with hemorrhagic corpora lutea. The left tubo~ovarian
complex is 9.4 grams. The previously interrupted fimbriated fallopian tube
is 3.1 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter. The serosa is tan-pink and
smooth. Cut sections reveal a lumen. The tan-yellow to purple, focally
cystic left ovary is 2.9 x 2.1 x 1.9 cm. The cut surfaces are tan~white,
lobulated, and contain multiple smooth-walled, subcortical cysts which
range from 0.2 cm in greatest dimension to 1.4 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm. Some of the
cysts contain clotted blood and are consistent with hemorrhagic corpora
lutea. One cyst contains a thin, straw-colored fluid. RS 32

parametrium, shave; C8, anterior vaginal cuff margin, shaved and trisected;
