The examination of this case material and the preparation of this report were
performed by the staff pathologist.

Note:

The tumor consist of primarily adenocarcinoma in situ with multiple minute foci
of invasion none of which is greater than 5 mm. The tumor abuts the visceral
pleura but does not show invasion.

intraoperative Consult Diagnosis:
FSA: Left lower lobe:
Adenocarcinoma.

Gross Description:
Received are six specimen containers, all labeled with the patient name,

Part A is received fresh for frozen section evaluation additionally labeled,

"left lower lobe (FSA)" and consists of a 1.6 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm portion of pink—tan
nodular soft tissue which is submitted for frozen section evaluation (FSA) with
residual frozen section tissue submitted in cassette A.

 

 

 

 

Part B is received in formalin and additionally labeled, "left inferior

pulmonary ligament" and consists of two nodular portions of tan-yellow
fibrofatty tissue not otherwise designated and having greatest dimensions of 1.2
and 1.8 cm, submitted in toto in cassette B.

Part C is received in formalin and additionally labeled, "left lower lobe #2"
and consists of the product of a left lower lobectomy having overall dimensions
of 19.5 x 11 by up to 4 cm. This specimen features essentially intact visceral
pleura with the exception of an umbilicated subpleural mass which has been
previously incised, the latter of which has dimensions of 2.8 x 2.2 x 1 cm and
which approaches to within 2 cm of the closest bronchial margin of resection.
This mass appears to remain in a sub visceral pleural location without extension
beyond the pleura. This mass arises within the central aspect of the left lower
lobe. Sectioning of the remaining lung parenchyma reveals no grossly
identifiable lesions. Signiﬁcant emphysematous change is not grossly identified
and there are multiple peribronchial lymph nodes, none of which appear involved
by tumor, however exhibit anthracotic pigment. Sections are submitted as
follows:

C1 bronchial and vascular margins of surgical resection left lower lobe
of the lung;

02-4 representative sections of mass central to left lower lobe;

05,6 random unremarkable left lower lobe of lung;

C7 three whole peribronchial lymph nodes;

CB three whole peribronchial lymph nodes;

CQ largest peribronchial lymph node bisected.

Part D is received in formalin additionally labeled, "subcarinal lymph node" and
consists of a single nodular portion of yellow lobulated fibrofatty tissue 2 x

1.8 x 1 cm. Within these tissues are at least three anthracotic laden lymph
nodes that range from 0.3 to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension submitted in cassette
D1 and remaining tissue submitted ini cassette D2. This portion of the case has
been submitted in its entirety.

Part E is received in formalin and additionally labeled, "AP window" and
consists of a single nodular portion of tan-yellow to gray-tan tissue which is
1.8 x 1 x 0.5 cm. Within this tissue there are two probable lymph nodes which
are sectioned and submitted in in cassette E.

Part F is received in formalin and additionally labeled, "Level 10 lymph node"
and consists of a single 1.5 cm in greatest dimension anthracotic laden lymph
node which is bisected and submitted entirely in cassette F.

Microscopic Description:
The final diagnosis of each specimen incorporates the microscopic examination
findings.
