Clinical History
Malignant neoplasm of sigmoid colon.
Gross Examination

A. "Left paratu l c st with left tubal fimbria". Received fresh and placed
in formalin at is a 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm fragment of
fimbria with attache . x . x .0 cm paratubal cyst. The cyst is

unilocular and filled with clear serous fluid. The cyst wall is less than 0.1
cm thick and has a smooth internal lining. Representative sections are
submitted as follows:

 

 

 

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Al— fimbriated end, bisected

A2~ representative sections of cyst wall

A3~9~ remainder of specimen

B. "Descendin and si moid colon, stitch marks distal". received and placed in
Specimen received: Descending colon and sigmoid colon.

Colon length: 21.5 cm.

Tumor location: Descending colon.

Tumor dimensions: 5.2 x 4.7 x 1.2 cm

Tumor appearance: Exophytic, lobulated, and focally friable. On cut
surface, the mass displays elongated cystic spaces within
the bowel wall which are filled with friable tumor

material.
istance from margins:
Froximal: 2.8 cm.
Distal: 13‘5 mm.
Mesenteric: 2.0 cm.
Bowel circumference
at tumor site: 7.2 cm.
Circumferential
growth: 75%.
Depth of invasion: 2.2 cm.
Deepest invasion: The mass invades through the bowel wall, into the fat and

puckers the underlying serosa (inked blue).
Tumor perforation: No.
Involvement of

adjacent structures: No.
Mesentery dimensions: 20.0 x 7.0 x 2.0 cm
Serosa: The serosa is focally puckered underlying the mass

{blue ink), The puckering comes within 3.5 cm of the
proximal margin.

Lymph nodes: Multiple lymph nodes are identified, up to 1.0 cm in
greatest dimension.

Secondary findings: The remainder of the bowel mucosa is tan, valVety,
with normal folding pattern. There is focal
submucosal tattooing, 2.5 cm proximal to the mass.

Special studies
prospectively ordered: No

Photograph: Yes.

Block diagram: No.

Tissue submitted

for research: Yes, tumor and normal.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Bl—BZ— proximal margin

BB~B4~ distal margin

B6—BlOw additional sections of mass

Bll~ mass to closest mesenteric margin

812— representative normal colon with tattoo
813— six lymph nodes

Bléw six lymph nodes

815— four lymph nodes

816w four lymph nodes

817— four lymph nodes

BlB~ four lymph nodes

819* one lymph node, bisected

820~ one lymph node bisected

Microscopic Examination
Microscopic examination is performed. Within part A, the fallopian tube
fimbria demonstrates a focal area of mild oytologic atypia.
Immunohistochemistry of this area (block Al} reveals weakilow cytokeratin 7,
p53 and Ki67 expression. Cytokeratin 20, Pax8 and CDXZ are negative. In
comparison, the tumor present in the colon demonstrates strong cytokeratin 20
and CDXZ expression and is negative for 93x8, p53, and cytokeratin 7. Kiﬁ? is
moderately elevated. Overall, the findings in the fallopian tube are felt to
be secondary to cautery artifact. Dr.—has reviewed parts of this case
and concurs with the interpretation.

Immunohistochemical Findings
The immunoperoxidase tests reported herein were developed and their
performance characteristics were determined by the z . , . ..

Some of them may not be cleared or approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such
clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical
purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical
testing.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 7th Edition): pT3 pNO pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution‘s Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
