Addendum Report

Addendum Diagnosis

A representative portion of this case is sent for specialized laboratory testing. This addendum is created
to report that the results are scanned into the patient's electronic medical record

TEST/ASSAY
RESULTS
Thymoma Class = 1

Patients with a Class1 molecular signature have a low risk of experiencing near
term (within 10 years) clinical metastasis.

Addendum Comment

A section or paraffin block from the patient's thymoma tissue was sent for
I- Thymoma(tm) Gene Expression Assay

Type of Specimen: FFPE prepared tumor tissue

THYMOMA GENE EXPRESSION ASSAY DESCRIPTION

THYMOMA<174> gene expression assay for thymoma tumors is a proprietary
assay which uses RT-PCR to determine the expression levels of a 23 gene panel (4
controls) in primary tumor tissue samples. The THYMOMA<174>
classiﬁcation is calculated from the gene expression results as compared to
results of a training set of patients with known outcomes.

Final Pathologic Diagnosis:
Thymus, thymectomy:

Encapsulated thymoma, Type B2 (1.7 cm in greatest dimension) with microcyst
formation.

Seven benign lymph nodes (0/7).

The examination of this case material and the preparation of this report were
performed by the staff pathologist.

Gross Description:

The specimen is received in a single formalin filled container labeled with the
patient's name. and additionally labeled as "anterior

mediastinal mass and thymus" and consists of two unoriented separate fragments
of lobulated ﬁbroadipose soft tissue; the larger fragment measures 145 x 7 x

1.2 cm and the smaller fragment measures 3.5 x 3.5 x 0.5 cm. The total weight of
the specimen is 60 grams. The larger fragment is partially Surfaced by
purple-gray membranous covering. The external surface is inked in black. Step
sectioning through the larger fragment reveals a 1.7 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm well
circumscribed, homogeneous, yellow-tan, ﬁrm nodule that immediately abuts one
aspect of the inked external surface. The remaining cut surface of this fragment
is homogeneous, lobulated soft yellow-tan and fatty. The external surface of the
smaller fragment is inked in red. Step sectioning through this fragment reveals

a homogeneous lobulated, fibrofatty. No lesions are identified within this

smaller fragment. Three potential lymph nodes are identiﬁed, ranging from 0.4
cm to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension.

Representative sections, with the nodule in its entirety, are submitted as
follows:

1-2 well circumscribed nodule;

3-4 well circumscribed nodule with relationship to closest inked
surface. paired sections;

5 well circumscribed nodule;

6-1 1 larger fragment;

12-13 smaller fragment;

14 Potential whole lymph nodes.

Microscopic Description:
The final diagnosis of each specimen incorporates the microscopic examination
ﬁndings.
