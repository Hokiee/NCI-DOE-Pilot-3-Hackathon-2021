SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS
Specimen: Surgical Excision
Block Number:

 

ER: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3
PR: Positive Allred Score: 6 = Proportion Score 3 + Intensity Score 3

 

COMMENT:

The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the
proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of
cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak
intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining. 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring
range from 0 to 8.

ER/PR positive is deﬁned as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is deﬁned as an Allred score
of less than or equal to 2.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
lmmunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 105, 1:100) and PR (PGR
136, 1:100) provided by ’ ‘ " following the manufacturer 3 instructions. This
assay was not modiﬁed. Interpretation of the ER/FK Irrimunohlstochemical stain ls guided by published
results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal
review of staining performance.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed In 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit .

using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modiﬁed. External kit-slides

provrdeo by me manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-
house known HER2 ampliﬁed control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well
preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identiﬁed for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2
immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided
by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.

This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from
A300 and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The I“
( takes full responsibility for this test's performance.

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right breast cancer.

PRE-OPERTATIVE CONSULTATION:
TPA/T PB/T PC: Negative for carcinoma. Diagnosis called to Dr. at Dr..

Dr. at ’ by Dr.

ADDENDUM:
Patthsion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit
Case No
Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED
Clinical Interpretation of results
Ampliﬁcation of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase ﬂuorescence in-situ
hybridization (FISH) on formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn embedded tissue sections using a chromosome
17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the

TSS ID

. by Dr.. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17
signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0. consistent with no
ampliﬁcation of the HER2/neu gene.
Block used DQ Source of case: RPCI
Tissue fixation formalin-ﬁxed tissue Outside Case No:NA
Tissue source - breast Results interpreted: yes
HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.05
This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of
CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic
mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded.
Method of ratio enumeration: manual count
Limitations
The Vysis Patthsion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is
Intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free
and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding
adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into
consideration, such as tumor size. number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status.
No
treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-
2/neu
gene ampliﬁcation status alone.
Overview of this test
FDA APPROVED REAGENT
Patthsion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of
patients for Whom Herceptin® therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the
-. . . . Institute under the direction
of. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the
clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.
