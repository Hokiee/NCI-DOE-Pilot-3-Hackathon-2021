Pathologic lntemetation:

A.

Right hemithyroldectomy:

- Papillary thyroid carcinoma:
- Tumor size: 3.0 cm in greatest dimension.
- Tumor extent: the tumor focally extends through the thyroid gland capsule. microscopically extending into the
surrounding skeletal muscle.
- Lymphovascular invasion: present.
~ Margins of resection are free of tumor (but the tumor approaches the peripheral margin within 1.0 millimeter).
- AJCC Pathologic TNM Staging: pT3, pN‘la, pr.

- Other ﬁndings: Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis.

Tissue at the right inferior laryngeal nerve:
- Microscopic focus of metastatic thyroid carcinoma (1/1 ).

Note: The iumorai focus was not present in the frozen section slide (only present in the permanent sections). A positive
cytokeratin immunostain conﬁrms the diagnosis.

Lateral margin at the pharyngeal constrictor muscle:
- Skeletal muscle. free of tumor.

Left hemlthyroldectomy:
- Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis.

Pre-laryngeal lymph nodes:

~ Fragments of thyroid tissue with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis.

- Micrometastasis of thyroid carcinoma in the subcapsuiar sinus of one out of two lymph nodes. (1/2).
- Salivary gland tissue with no pathologic changes.

Right paratracheal lymph node dissection:
- Metastatic thyroid carcinoma in one lymph node, out of nine nodes dissected (1/9).
- One parathyroid gland.

Gross Description:

A. Received fresh is the right lobe of the thyroid which measures 7.0 x 3.7 x 2.0 cm and weighs 26 grams. The specimen is
oriented with a suture at the right superior pole. Resection margin is inked black. Sections reveal a well circumscribed
light tan nodular lesion which measures 3.0 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm. The cut surface shows papillary appearance. The lesion
seems to be conﬁned to the thyroid parenchyma. The remainder of the thyroid shows an ordered Well circumscribed light
tan nodular lesion which measures 0.3 cm in greatest dimension. located at 1.7 cm from the main nodular lesion. This
lesion is also at 1.5 cm from the medial resection margin and at 0.7 cm from the anterior aspect of the specimen. The

remainder of the thyroid parenchyma is brown, firm inconsistency with irregular appearance. Sections submitted as

follows:

1 Upper pole resection margin with lesions

2 Anterior aspect of the specimen with lesion

3 Posterior aspect of the specimen with lesions

4 Lesion and normal thyroid

5 Smaller nodular lesion

6 Normal parenchyme from the remainder of the thyroid

B. Reseived fresh is an irregularly shaped light tan soft tissue fragment which measures 0.6 cm in greatest dimension.
Submitted in toto in one cassette for frozen.

C. Received trash is an irregular light tan soft tissue fragment which measures 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. Submitted in
toto in one cassette for frozen.

0. Received in formalin is a left lobe of the thyroid which measures 6.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm and weighs 12 grams. The specimen
is oriented with one suture at the superior pole. The resection margin is inked black. Sections reveal light tan
multinodular appearance. mainly at the posterior aspect of the specimen. The largest nodular area measures 1.0 cm in
greatest dimension. Sections submitted as follows:

1 Perpendicular resection margin at the isthmus
2 Perpendicular resection margin at the upper pole
3 Posterior aspect of the specimen with nodular lesion
4-6 From the remainder of the specimen with nodular lesions
E. Received in formalin is a single irregularly shaped light tan soft tissue fragment which measures 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm.

Sections reveal four lymph nodes, ranging in size from 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm to 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. Sections
submitted as follows:

1&2 One lymph node per cassette, bisected

3 Two lymph nodes submitted in toto

F. Received in formalin is an irregularly shaped light soft tissue fragment which measures 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. Sections
reveal twelve lymph nodes. ranging in size from 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm to 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. Sections submitted
as follows:

1&2 One lymph node per cassette bisected
3&4 Five lymph nodes per cassette. submitted in toto
