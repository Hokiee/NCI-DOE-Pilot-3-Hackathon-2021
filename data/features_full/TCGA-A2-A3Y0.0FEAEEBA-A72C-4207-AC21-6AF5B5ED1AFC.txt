A. LT BREAST AND AXILLARY TISSUE
B. ADDITIONAL LYMPH NODES LT AXILLA

PART A RECEIVED FRESH LABELED — LEFT BREAST AND AXILLARY
CONTENTS SUTURE AT 12 O’CLOCK, AND CONS-181's O A MODIFIED RADICAL
MASTECTOM’Y SPECIMEN WITH OVERALL DIMENSIONS OF 31 X 20.5 X 5.8 CM. THE
NIPPLE IS UNREMARKABLE AND SITS WITHIN A SKIN ELLIPSE MEASURING 21 X 12.3
CM. THERE IS A 3.5 CM IN LENGTH WELL—HEALED PERIAREOLAR SCAR EXTENDING
FROM 12 TO 2 O’CLOCK. THERE IS A PALEABLWR

U . THE SUPERFICIAL ASPECT IS MARKED WITH BLUE INK, THE DEEP
ASPECT WITH BLACK INK. THE AXILLARY TAIL IS REMOVED AND EXAMINED FOR
LYMPH NODES, OF WHICH MULTIPLE ARE IDENTIFIED. SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS
FOLLOWS: A1--NIPPLE SKIN AND SCAR; A2--FIVE NODES; A3--FIVE NODES;
A4--THREE NODES, EACH BISEC’I‘ED; A5--THREE NODES, EACH BISECTED,‘
A6--SECTION OF ONE NODE; A7--SECTION OF ONE NODE; A8--SECTION OF ONE
NODE; A9--SECTION OF ONE NODE; A10--SECTION OF ONE NODE. NOTE THAT A6
THROUGH A10 ARE MIRROR IMAGES OF PROTOCOL SECTIONS. A11—-TWO NODES, EACH
BISECTED; A12-—ON'E NODE BISECTED; A13-—ONE NODE BISECTED; A14-—ONE NODE
BISECTED. SECTIONING THE BREAST REVEALS THE UPPER OUTER QUADRANT V,BE_A
ROUNDED PINK-TAN SOFT MASS WHICH IS CENTRALLY CYSTIC. IT MEASUREsaX/E
3.7 X 2.8 CM. GROSSLY, THIS ABUTS THE DEEP MARGIN. IMMEDIATELY
SUPERFICIAL TO THIS MASS IS A SECOND NODULE WITH A COIL CLIP MEASURING
1.5 X 1.2 X 1.0 CM. MEDIAL AND CENTRAL TO THE BREAST, THE SPECIMEN HAS A
TAN FIBROUS BAND WHICH EXTENDS 9 CM FROM SUPERIOR TO INFERIOR AND THERE
IS TAN FIBROUS TISSUE CENTRAL WITHIN THE BREAST. THIS IS SURROUNDED BY A
PERIMETER OF BLAND YELLOW FATTY TISSUE. SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS
FOLLOWS: A15 AND 16--MASS IN DEEP MARGIN; A17--SECTION OF THE MASS AND
THE ADJACENT MORE SUPERFICIAL NODULE; A18, 19 AND 20--SECTIONS OF MASS
CORRESPONDING TO SECTIONS FROM THE SUBMITTED PER PROTOCOL, WITH A20
REPRESENTING THE ADJACENT FIBROUS TISSUE; A21--AN ADDITIONAL SECTION OF
THE SUPERFICIAL LESION (MIRROR IMAGE TO PROTOCOL); A22 --UPPER OUTER
QUADRANT; A23--UPPER INNER QUADRANT; A24--LOWER INNER QUADRANT;
A25-’LOWER OUTER QUADRANT (A22 THROUGH A25 ARE MIRROR IMAGE SECTIONS TO
PROTOCOL); A26--TISSUE FROM SUPERIOR PORTION OF BREAST.

THE AXILLARY TAIL IS REEXAMINED FOR LYMPH NODES AFTER FIXATION TIME IN
ACETIC FORMALIN. ADDITIONAL NODES ARE THEN SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS:
