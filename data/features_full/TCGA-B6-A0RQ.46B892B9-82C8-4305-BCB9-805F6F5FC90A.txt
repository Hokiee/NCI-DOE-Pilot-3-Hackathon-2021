Not provided.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A."Right breast biopsy", fresh. The specimen is a 4.5 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm portion
of yellow to grey-white soft tissue. According to the surgeon, the resection
margins are not a concern, as a mastectomy is planned. The specimen is not
inked. Cut surface shows an approximately 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm mass composed of
firm white tissue with interspersed foci of adipose tissue. The mass extends
to the operative margin over a wide area. The specimen is otherwise composed
of unremarkable adipose tissue. A representative portion of the mass is
submitted for frozen section. Another representative portion is submitted for
hormone receptor analysis.

BLOCK SUMMARY:
Al frozen section remnant.
A2—A4 further representative sections from the mass.

B."Breast tissue right side", fresh. The specimen is a 700 gram, 21 x 14 x 4
cm breast with an attached, approximately 9 x 9 x l to 2 cm portion of soft
tissue in the axillary region. The breast includes a 17.5 x 10.5 cm
elliptical portion of skin with a roughly centrally placed nipple and a 4.5 cm
transverse incisional wound located superior, and slightly medial, to the
nipple. The skin is uniformly smooth and tan-white, without erythema,

(% induration or nodules. The nipple is likewise unremarkable. Cut surface

' reveals an approximately 6.0 x 5.0 x 4.5 cm cavity deep to the incisional
wound. The biopsy cavity occupies the region immediately deep to the nipple
and the adjacent upper inner quadrant. An approximately 3.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm
mass is present alongside the biopsy cavity, involving tissue medial and deep
to the biopsy cavity. The mass is composed of firm grey—white tissue which
contains foci of yellow adipose tissue within it. The surgical resection
margins are grossly free of the mass; toward the medial edge of the specimen,
the mass extends to approximately 0.3 cm from the deep resection margin, with
questionable extension to within 0.2 cm from the margin at this site. The
breast is otherwise composed of adipose tissue and grey~white glandular-
appearing breast tissue, showing occasional firmer areas of white fibrous-
appearing tissue, but no other discrete masses or nodules. Nine lymph nodes
are identified in the lower portion of the axillary tissue, and nine lymph
nodes are identified in the upper portion of the axillary tissue. The lymph
nodes range up to 3.0 cm in greatest dimensions. Some of the lymph nodes show
replacement with adipose tissue, but they are otherwise grossly unremarkable.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

the tumor to the margin).

B3-4 medial resection margin.

B5-6 representative sections of the mass, medial to the biopsy cavity.

questionable lymph nodes, upper axillary region.
