CLINICAL NOTES
Right breast cancer

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS
A. Sentinel node #1, right axilla:
One benign lymph node (0/1).
B. Sentinel node #2, right axilla:
One negative lymph node (0/1).
C. Sentinel node #3, right axilla:
One negative lymph node (0/1).
H. Sentinel node #4, right axilla: Benign (0/1).

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Received unfixed for frozen section, labeled "sentinel
node #1 hot and blue 84 right axilla" is a 1.4 x 1.1 x 0.6
cm lymph node, bisected and entirely submitted in two blocks.
B. Received unfixed for frozen section, labeled "sentinel
node #2 (237) hot and blue right axilla", is a l x 0.8 x
0.6 cm lymph node, bisected and entirely submitted in one block.
C. Received unfixed for frozen section, labeled "sentinel

GROSS DESCRIPTION
node #3 (277) hot and blue right axilla," is a lymph node
that is 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm quadrisected and entirely submitted in four
blocks.
D. Received unfixed for tissue procurement, labeled
"segmental mastectomy right breast", is a portion of
fibroadipose tissue that is oriented with sutures as previously
stated, and 8 cm. from medial to lateral, 5.4 cm. from anterior to
posterior, and 4.0 cm. from superior to inferior. A mass lesion is
identified, 3 x 2.5 x 2.4 cm., a portion of which is submitted for
tissue procurement. Margins are inked: superior black, anterior
green, inferior yellow, posterior blue. The mass lesion is 2 mm.
from the black superior inked margin, and possible less than 1 mm.
from the yellow inferior margin. Representative sections are
:% submitted sequentially from lateral to medial, with Dl being the
*IE? lateral margin, DZ-D4 being representative sections between lateral
margin and beginning of mass lesion, including representative deep

 

margin and debris of prior biopsy site, with D15 being medial shaved
margins. A total 15 cassettes. R815.
E. Received fresh subsequently fixed in formalin labeled
"superior wall right breast" is a 4.5 x 3.0 x 1.2 cm.
yellow lobular fatty tissue fragment which has a suture designating
a new superior margin. The surface is inked blue. The specimen is
sectioned to show no other discrete gross lesions identified and
the
yellow lobular fatty cut surface. The specimen is entirely
submitted in 6 cassettes. AS-6
E. Received fresh subsequently fixed in formalin labeled
"posterior wall right breast" is a 1.7 x 1.6 x 1.0 cm.
pink
yellow rubbery tissue fragment which has a suture designated to the
new posterior margin. This is located on skeletal muscle. The
surface is inked blue. The opposite surface is yellow, pink and
fatty. No residual tumor is grossly identified. The specimen is
sectioned and entirely submitted in one cassette. AS-l
G. Received fresh subsequently fixed in formalin labeled

GROSS DESCRIPTION
"retroareolar" is a white pink rubbery nodule which shows gross
evidence of bluing staining present. The specimen is 2.5 x 2.2 x
1.7 cm., having a single suture designating lateral and double
suture designating anterior. The specimen is inked as follows:
Superior orange, anterior blue, posterior black, inferior green.
The specimen is sectioned from medial to lateral to show a white
tan
whorled cut surface, shows white rice like pellets located in the
inferior aspect of the specimen. The specimen is entirely
submitted
from medial to lateral labeled "1—5". AS—5.
