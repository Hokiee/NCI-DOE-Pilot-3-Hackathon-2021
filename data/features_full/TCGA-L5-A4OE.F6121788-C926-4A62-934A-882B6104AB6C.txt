1. "Distal esophagus and proximal stomach"

Received in a large container of formalin is a previously opened 11.8 cm
segment of distal esophagus and proximal stomach. Both margins are stapled.
Tho esophageal adventitio is focally firm, close to the esophagogostric
junction. the gastric serosa is also focally firm at this point. the
esophageal adventitia is inked green and the gastric serosa is inked black.
The focally nodular perigaatric fat is stripped. A full thickness defect (1.6
x 0.3 cm) is found in the gastric cardia, within 0.1. cm of the ES junction.
Multiple incisions have been previously made with excision of some of the firm
tissue. This firm mass arising at the EB junction is 3.7 x 2.9 cm. Most of the
firm. multinodular mass involves the gastric aided! the E6 junction. The firm
area is not granular on the moosel surface, yet appears to only involve the
submucosa. The cut surface shows a maxim thickness of 2.1 cm with extension
to the deep margin of the 65 function. The firm, submcooal mass is also
within 1.7 cm of the distal margin (blue). The multinodular mass involves 80%
of the circumference at the Eli junction, including the area that was
previously excised. Extension and direct invasion involving the adventitia and
muscular wall, extending to within 0.? cm of the distal margin. The remaining
esophageal and gastric. mucosa is unremarkable. lymph node candidates retrieved
from the paraeaophageal and perigastric fat are found up to 3.2 cm in greatest
dimensions. The largest has a grey-tan to pink, firm cut surface that is
partly replaced with fatty tissue. Also lymph node candidates that are
