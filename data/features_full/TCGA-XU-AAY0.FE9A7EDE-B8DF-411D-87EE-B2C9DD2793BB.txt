Surgical Pathology Consultation Report

SPECIMEN(S) RECEIVED

1. Thymus: anterior mediastinal tUmor and total thymus—stitch marks open
biopsy site

DIAGNOSIS
1. Mediastinum. resection (anterior mediastinal tumor and total thymus):
a) Thymoma, WHO type AB, with: (see Comment)

iii) Resection margins negative for tUmor
b) Organizing hematoma with surrounding foreign body giant cell
reaction and fibrosis, consistent with biopsy site

Sections show an encapsulated tumor composed predominantly_of nodular
proliferations of small lymphocytes admixed with lesser numbers of bland
epithelioid cells (90-95% of the tumor), separated by fibrous septae.
These are admixed with scattered areas composed of bland spindle cells
containing few lymphocytes (5*10% of the tumor). The tumor appears to be
completely encapsulated, but a single focus of microscopic transcapsular
invasion is identified (block 1H). However, the tumor appears to be
covered with ample adipose tissue at this point (approx. 0.8 cm from the
tumor to the painted surface). An area overlying the tumor marked with a
stitch shows a resolving hematoma with surrounding foreign body giant
cell response and dense fibrosis, consistent with the previous Open
biopsy site. The tumor appears encapsulated in this area, with tumor
cells 0.6 cm from the cauterized margin of this site.

Immunohistochemical staining confirming thymic derivation were previously
performed and were not repeated here. The overall findings
remain of a WHO type AB thymoma, with focal microscopic transcapsular
invasion (modified Masaoka stage Ila).

GROSS DESCRIPTION

1. The specimen container labeled with the patient's name and as
"anterior mediastinal tumor and total thymus—stitch marks open biopsy
site " contains an oval-shaped encapsulated mass with attached
fibroadipose tissue, grossly consistent with thymus received in 10%
buffered formalin. It measures 13.5 x 10 x 5.2 cm in overall dimension

and weighs 234 g. There is a stitch attached to a portion of adherent
fibrous tissue indicating the open biopsy site. This portion of fibrous
tissue measures 2.7 x 1.8 x 0.7 cm. The entire surface of the specimen is
painted with Silver nitrate and the adherent fibrous tissue over-coated
with India ink. The mass measures 8.6 x 8.5 x 4.7 cm and is firm,
multilobular, homogeneous tan with whitish fibrotic areas admixed. The
capsule is overall smooth except for the stitch area. Sections of the
mass and thymic tissue stored frozen. Representative sections submitted
as follows:

1A—1H sections from the open biopsy surface (lA—lD-includes the open
biopsy site).

lI-lM sections from the opposite (deep) surface, with overlying fatty
tissue.

1N, 10 sections from mid tumor.

1P. 1Q sections from fibrofatty tissue consistent with thymic tissue.
