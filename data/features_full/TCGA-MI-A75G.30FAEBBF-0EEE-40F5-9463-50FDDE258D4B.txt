GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. The specimen consists of a 10.5 x 4.2 x 4.0 cm, intact gallbladder
displaying a 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm attached, clamped, patent cystic duct.
The serosa is tan-pink to yellow—green, smooth and glistening with
minimal bile staining. Opening reveals multiple tan—yellow,
bosselated choleliths ranging from 0.3 to 0.8 cm in greatest
dimensions with abundant amounts of dark green Viscous bile. The
mucosa is dark green and granular. Wall thickness averages 0.3 cm.
Representative sections are submitted in cassettes l and 2.

B. The specimen consists of a 555 gram, 13.8 x 11.5 x 6.0 cm, partial
hepatectomy specimen displaying a tan—brown, scabrous hepatic
resection margin. The capsule is tan-pink to red, and smooth with an
underlying bulging mass displays in the capsule measuring 4.5 x 4.5
cm. There is an attached segment of soft tissue measuring 6.0 x 3.2 x
1.0 cm that is designated by the surgeon as adhered adrenal gland.

The hepatic resection margin is inked. The specimen is serially
sectioned to reveal a 4.5 x 4.0 x 2.6 cm, tan—yellow to green,
lobulated, well—circumscribed solitary mass that isO.8 cm from the
closest hepatic resection margin. the mass is grossly confined to the
hepatic parenchyma and displays the overlying hepatic capsule. The
mass does not extend into the adrenal or the periadrenal fat.

Remaining hepatic parenchyma is tan-brown and granular. No subsequent
lesions are identified. The attached adrenal gland has an
approximated weight of 8.2 grams, and displays a tan-brown to golden
yellow cut surface.

Representative sections are submitted as follows: Bl—B3— mass to
closest hepatic resection margin; B4—B5— mass to overlying adrenal
gland and hepatic capsule; B6-B7— mass to adjacent uninvolved hepatic
parenchyma; B—B mass with overlying hepatic capsule; B9- hepatic
parenchyma away from mass.
