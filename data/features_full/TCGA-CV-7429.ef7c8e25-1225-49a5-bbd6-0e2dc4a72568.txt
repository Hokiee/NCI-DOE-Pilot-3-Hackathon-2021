»COMMENT
The tumor measures 8.5 x 8.5 X 8.0 cm and d1ffusely 1nvolves the r1ght
buccal space, mand1ble, and floor of mouth soft t1ssue. Although two
pterygo1d marg1ns were 1n1t1ally pos1t1ve, the f1nal pterygo1d marg1n of
exc1s1on (part K) 15 free of tumor. The anter1or mand1bu ar marg1n of
exc1s1on and condyle of the mand1ble are pend1ng decalc1f1cat1on and an
addendum report w1ll follow.

The largest lymph node metastas1s completely replaces a 5.0 cm lymph
node; extranodal extens1on of approx1mately 0.1 cm 15 present.
