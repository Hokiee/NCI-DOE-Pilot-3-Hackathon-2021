Pathology Report for Subiect-

Addendum Discussion:
A calculated MIB-l labeling index is 2.7%

Addendum Diagnosis:
Oligodendroglioma, WHO grade II.

Microscopic Description:

Microscopic examination reveals an infiltrating glioma. The tumor is
composed of a proliferation of cells with predominantly round nuclei and
mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism. The tumor cells demonstrate
prominent perinuclear halos. They diffusely infiltrate the adjacent brain
parenchyma. Overall, the tumor appears mildly hypercellular with focal
regions showing increased hypercellularity. Occasional cells show more
significant cytologic atypia, but overall the atypia appears mild to
moderate. Scattered neurons demonstrate perineuronal satellitosis. Up to
one mitotic figure per 10 high power field is identified. Neither
microvascular proliferation nor necrosis are indentified.
