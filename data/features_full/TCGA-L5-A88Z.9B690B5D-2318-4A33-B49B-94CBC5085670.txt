OPER DATE: REG DOC:
VERIFIED BY:

-year-old female with squamous cell esophageal cancer. Operative procedure:
THE transhiatal esophagectomy jejunostomy.

VERIFIED BY:

1. "Esophageal margin closed end is distal, opened and proximal” A 1.7 x 1.6
x 0.7 cm segment of pink-red esophagus with staple line at one end.

1A. Proximal and.

Frozen section control.

111. Remainder of specimen. (2 cassettes,

2. ”Thoracic esophagus" Received fresh in a medium container is a segment of
esophagus (6.5 cm in length and averages 3.0 cm in circwnference) and an
attached portion of stomach that is 5.0 x 4.0 cm. The serosa of the esophagus
is grey-brown and fibrous with a portion of stomach is predominantly surfaced
by yellow glistening adipose tissue. There is a 2.5 x 2.0 cm tan-brown
centrally ulcerated mass with rolled borders that is 2.3 cm from the proximal
margin, 2.0 cm from the GE junction and occupies approximately 95% of the
circumference of the esophagus. Sectioning through the mass reveals it to be
approximately 0.8 cm thick and grossly abut but not extend through the
mscularis propria. Located 1.5 cm proximal to the aforemntioned mass is a
0.8 cm in greatest dimension tan nodule that upon sectioning has a tan-white
solid cut surface and grossly abuts the mscularis propria. The GE junction
and the remaining mucosa is ten and unremarkable with a grey-white area just
distal to the first described mass. The GE junction is grossly unremarkable.
The mucosa of the stomach is ten, normally folded and grossly unremarkable.
Examination of the attached adipose tissue reveals eight probable lymph nodes
that range from 0 5 up to ‘l. 5 cm in greatest dimension. The largest possible
node is firm and has tan- white, solid cut surfaces.

2A. -E. Mass entirely submitted.

2F. Second described nodule.

26. Representative section of stomach and distal margin.

2H. Four lymph nodes in their entirety.

El. Three lynph nodes in their entirety.

2.1. One lymph node bisected. (10 cassettes,

FROZEN SECTION REPORT:

1A. Ulcer and inflammation. Negative for carcinoma.
