PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
RECTO-SIGMOID ADENOCARCINOMA

POSTCPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
RECTO—SIGMOID ADENOCARCINOMA

Surgeon/physician:

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. The specimen consists of 21.0 cm in length segment of colon,
stapled at both ends with moderate amounts of attached fat. The
specimen is received fresh to the frozen section lab for
intraoperative gross consultation. Intraoperative findings are
communicated to the surgeon in person. The serosa is tan- pink, smooth
and glistening. There is a firm area of puckering in the mid portion
of the serosa. The serosal aspect with the puckering is inked blue.

Opening reveals a 2.8 x 2.5 cm, tan—pink, centrally ulcerated mass
with raised borders that is nearly circumferential, 9.5 cm from the
proximal resection margin, and 5.8 cm from the distal resection
margin. Sectioning through the mass reveals a tan- white, granular cut
surface that grossly extends into the underlying attached mesenteric
fat. The mass does not grossly extend to the inked serosal aspect.

The mass is 9.3 cm from the mesenteric resection margin.

The remaining colonic mucosa is tan—brown, smooth and glistening. No
subsequent lesions are identified. Sectioning through the attached
fat reveals multiple tan—pink, rubbery lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 to
0.8 cm in greatest dimensions.

Pepresentative sections are submitted as follows: Al~ proximal
resection margin; A2~ distal resection margin; A3 A4— mass to closest
inked serosa; AS—Aé— mass to include underlying fat and adjacent
uninvolved mucosa; A7— mesenteric resection margin closest to mass;
A8—Al3- multiple whole lymph nodes.

GROSS DIAGNOSIS:
RECTOSIGMOID COLON RESECTION:

— TUMOR IDENTIFIED WITH MARGINS APPEARING GROSSLY FAR FROM THE
MASS.

3. The specimen consists of a 1.8 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm, tanebrown, annular
a! t tissue partially surface by a tan—brown, smooth and glistening
posa. Sectioning reveals a tan—brown, unremarkable cut surface. No
