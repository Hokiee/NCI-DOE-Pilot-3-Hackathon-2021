1). The specimen is received tresh, labeled "Total thyroid" and consists of a thyroid weighing 24 g. The right lobe measures 5.5 x
2.0 x 2.0 cm, the left lobe measures 4.3 x 2.3 x 2.3 cm and the isthmus measures 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. The external surface is
covered by a thin ﬁbrous capsule. The posterior surface of the specimen is inked black, and the anterior is inked blue.
Sectioning reveals a 1.5 x 1.1 x 1.0 cm yellow tinged fluid tilled cyst with a 1.2 cm papillary excrescence, identified in the right lobe.
The cyst wall lining is white and trabecuier. There are two 0.3 cm in greatest dimension whitetan ﬁrm nodules identiﬁed in the
right lobe. Sectioning through the remaining tissue reveals a 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.4 cm encapsulated yellow-tan tumor in the left lobe
abutting the anterior and posterior capsule. The remaining thyroid parenchyma is red tan and beefy. Representative sections of
the specimen are submitted for TPS, and a photograph has been taken. The remaining tissue is serially sectioned and entirely
submitted: - -
