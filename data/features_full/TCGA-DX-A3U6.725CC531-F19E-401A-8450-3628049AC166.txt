DEPARTMENT OF PATHOLOGY

 

Clinical Diagnosis & History:
rear old with mesenteric mass left upper quadrant.

Specimens Suhmitted:

1: Radical resection of retroperitoneal sarcoma with resection of proximal
jejunum and left adrenal gland

2: Fourth part of duodendum

DIAGNOSIS:
l. Retroperitoneal sarcoma with resection of proximal jejunum, radical
resection:

- High grade deditferentiated liposarcoma. involving mesenteric fat.

— There are three separate tumor nodules identified grossly. measuring
8.5 x 7.5 x 8.1 cm. 8.5 x 7.5 x 4 cm and 4 x 3.5 x 2 cm respectively.

— The first mass is involving the subserosal fat of the small bowel. It
shows a dedifferentiated component with a high grade malignant fibrous
histiocytoma—like morphology, estimated as 30-40% of the mass.

- The second mass is composed of predominantly well-differentiated
liposarcoma component.

- The third mass shows equal well-differentiated and dedifferentiated
components.

— Non neoplastic small bowel is unremarkable

- Smell bowel resection margins are free of tumor

2. Fourth part of duodendum. resection:
- Duodenum with acute serositis. no evidence of malignancy.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDBB (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

gland', and consists of a coiled bowel loop of small bowel measuring 50 cm
in length and 3 cm in diameter. There is attached mesentery measuring 32 cm
and 16 x 5 cm. A small portion of the adrenal gland embedded in adipose
tissue is identified, measuring 1.7 x 1.5 cm. There are three separate
masses identified arising in the mesentry. The tirat mass is 8.5 x 7.5 x 8.1
cm (M1), the second mass is 8.5 x 7.5 x 4 cm (M2) and the third mass is 4 x
3.5 x 2 cm (ma). All the masses have a tan yellow -white firm cut surface
and there are focal areas of hemorrhage in M1. The M1 and N2 are arising
from the wall of the small bowel. The small bowel mucosa is unremarkable.
The possible adrenal gland appears unremarkable and the M3 appears to be
arising in the adipose tissue surrounding the gland. Representative sections
of the specimen are submitted for permanent sections and for TPS.

2).The specimen is received fresh labeled, "fourth part or duodenum', and

identitied. The specimen is representatively submitted.
