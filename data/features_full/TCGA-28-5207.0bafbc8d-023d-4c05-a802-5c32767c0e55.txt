Recent studies have shown that co—expression of EGFRvItI and PTEN as detected by immunostainin

was at niﬁcantl correiated with a clinical response of glioblastomas to EGFR kinase inhibitorsﬂ
Hence the preserved expression of PTEN in this case, when combined

with EGFRvIIi mutation. permits a possibility of this tumor being responsive to EGFR-kinase inhibitors.

creased expression of Iaminin beta 2 predicting a worse survival of patients with gliomas.
Association between Iaminin-S and gliai tumor grade, recurrence, and patient survivai.

Accordingly, elevated expression of beta 1 and suppressed expression of beta 2 in this tumor predict
more aggressive behavior.

Presence of activated (phosphorylated) p42/44 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (pMAPK) often is
indicative of an upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. It has shown to be associated
with a relative resistance to radiation therapy in glioblastoma muitiformeb

 

The use of these tests in guiding therapy has limitations. Review of the reievant literature and clinical
correlation is advised. These test results do not obligate or preclude use of the relevant therapeutic
agents.

FLUORESCENCE IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION (FISH) for EGFR in BRAIN

 

Tissue Block: J8
RESULTS: POSITiVE for EGFR Ampliﬁcation (See note below)
Number of cells evaluated: 40

iNTERPRETATION:

Fiuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis on a brain tumor sample from this patient with Abbott
Molecular probes speciﬁc for the centromere of chromosome 7 (control probe) and the short arm (EGFR-
7p12) of chromosome 7 was performed. The control sample gave expected results.

These studies showed ampliﬁcation of the EGFR gene with a 8.1 ratio of EGFR signals to the centromere
signals in 72.5% of the nuclei examined.

NOTE:

1. Samples are considered positive in brain if the EGFR to CEP 7 signal ratio is 2 2.0 in 2 10% of
analyzed cells or tumors with four or more copies of the EGFR gene in 2 40% of the cells (high
polysomy).

2. Samples are considered inconclusive, requiring consult with the pathologist, in brain if the EGFR to
CEP 7 signal ratio is 2 2.0 in <10% of analyzed celis or when four or more copies of the EGFR gene in <
40% of the cells.
