Gross Description:

A. Received fresh labeled “Sentinel lymph node count 1 " containing 1.3 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm pale yellow soft
lymph node. Bisected and submitted in into in one cassette for frozen section.

B. Received fresh labeled "Sentinel node 2 count " containing 1.3 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm pale yellow, soft lymph
node. It is bisected and submitted in toto in one cassette for frozen section.

C. Received in formalin labeled “Left breast lumpectomy, 1 superior, 2 lateral 3 deep” is a lumpectomy
specimen of the breast weighing 180 grams. It is oriented with sutures by the surgeon. It measures 7.5 cm
in superior to inferior, 7.0 cm medial to lateral surface, 3.5 cm anterior to the posterior surface. The
specimen is inked as follows: Blue superior, green inferior, red medial, orange lateral, black posterior,
yellow anterior. Upon sectioning, there is a 2.0 x 1.6 x 1.2 cm tan-white, ﬁrm gritty mass with stellate
borders. It is approximately round to oval in shape. The mass contains a metallic clip measuring 3 mm.
The mass is closest to the anterior margin which is 0.7 cm away. It is 3.0 cm away from the posterior
margin, 2.0 cm from the superior margin, 2.6 cm from the inferior margin, 4.0 cm from the medial margin and
2.5 cm from the lateral margin. The rest of the breast parenchyma is yellow and soft with fat to stroma ratio
90's to 30. A piece of tumor measuring approximately1.0 x 1.0 cm is submitted to the tissue bank. Sections
are submitted as follows:

Cassettes #1-6 Mass in toto (cassette 1 mass with clip)
Cassette #7 Anterior margin

Cassette #8 Posterior margin

Cassette #9 Medial margin

Cassette #10 Lateral margin

Cassette #1 1 Superior margin
