CLINICAL INFORMATION
Adenocarcinoma

SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPTION

A) SOURCE: Lung, right upper lobe

Received fresh labeled "right upper lobe lung" and consists of a 14 x 11 x
2.5 cm lobe of lung. The bronchial margin is taken an face and submitted on
one chuck for frozen section diagnosis.

INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLO TION WITH FROZEN SECTION: "Bronchial
margin negative“ is rendered by

On cut section, there is a palpable 2.3 x 2.2 x 2.2 cm mass in the upper
portion of the lobe. It puckers the pleural surface which has been inked

black. The mass is 4 cm from the nearest bronchial margin. The remainder of
the parenchyma is spongy tan-pink with very mild anthraccsis.

Part of the tissue is taken for possible ancillary study. _

 

 

Representative sections are submitted in 10 cassettes labeled:
1, Frozen section

2. Vascular margins

3. Hiiar lymph nodes

4-7. Tumor to pleural surface in normal parenchyma

840. Random normal parenchyma remote from tumor

B) SOURCE: Hilar lymph node
Labeled "hilar lymph node" is a 0.7 cm anthracotic lymph node. The specimen
is submitted in toto in one cassette.
