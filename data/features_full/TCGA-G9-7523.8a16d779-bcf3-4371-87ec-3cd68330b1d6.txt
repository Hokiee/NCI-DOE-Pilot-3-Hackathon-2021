DIAGNOSIS:

A. PROSTATE, PROSTATECTOMY:
- PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON GRADE 5+5 (10/10), INVOLVING APPROXIMATELY
35% OF THE EXAMINED PROSTATIC TISSUE
- TUMOR INVOLVES APEX; LEVEL I LEFT AND RIGHT ANTERIOR; LEVEL II LEFT LATERAL AND
ANTERIOR; LEVEL III LEFT AND RIGHT ANTERIOR; LEVEL III RIGHT POSTERIOR; LEFT AND
RIGHT MID BASE
- EXTRAPROSTATIC EXTENSIONS ARE PRESENT AT ANTERIOR AND MID BASE
- SURGICAL MARGINS AT APEX, ANTERIOR AND BASE ARE POSITIVE FOR CARCINOMA
(LINEAR DISTANCE APPROXIMATELY 8MM IN AGGREGATE)

- PERINEURAL INVASION IDENTIFIED

- NO LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IDENTIFIED

- SEMINAL VESICLES/VAS DEFERENS ARE UNINVOLVED BY TUMOR

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. PROSTATE
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "prostate" is a 36 g resected prostate gland
measuring 4.2 cm from right lateral to left lateral, 3.2 cm from anterior to posterior, and 2.3 cm from
apex to base. The capsule is smooth, red, and intact. Ink code: anterior-orange, apex-red, base-blue,
right lateral-green, left lateral-yellow, and posterior-black. After removal of apex and base, the prostate
weighs 16 g and has a nodular tan parenchyma. The right seminal vesicle is 3.7 x 2.1 x 0.9 cm and the
left is 3.7 x 2 x 0.9 cm; they consist of cystic tan tissue. The right vas deferens is 3 x 0.8 cm and the left
is 2.3 x 0.7 cm; they consist of tubular tan tissue. Tissue is procured (7 9); submitted entirely:
A1 -A3: perpendicular sections of apex
A4: level 1, right anterior
A5: level 1, right posterior
A6: level 1, left anterior
A7: level 1, left posterior
A8: level 2, right lateral and posterior capsule
A9: level 2, left lateral and anterior capsule
A10: level 3, right anterior
A11: level 3, right posterior
A12: level 3, left anterior
A13: level 3, left posterior
A14-A15: perpendicular sections of right mid base
A16: perpendicular section of left mid base
A17-A18: perpendicular section of right lateral base
A19-A20: perpendicular section of left lateral base
A21: perpendicular section of right posterior base
A22: perpendicular section of left posterior base
A23: perpendicular section of right mid base urethral orifice margin
A24: perpendicular section of left mid base urethral orifice margin
A25: right seminal vesicle and vas deferens
A26: left seminal vesicle and vas deferens
B. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES
Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and "right pelvic lymph node" are pieces of
yellow-tan soft tissue in aggregate, 4.2 x 2.5 x 0.7 cm containing 3 possible lymph nodes, 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.4
cm, 1.8 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm, and 3.3 x 1.4 x 0.7 cm. Larger lymph node is bisected and has a variegated red-
tan cut surface; submitted entirely:
B1: 2 possible lymph nodes
B2-B3: 1 bisected lymph node
B4: remainder of soft tissue
C. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES
Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and "left pelvic lymph node" are pieces of
yellow-tan soft tissue in aggregate, 3.9 x 2.3 x 1 cm containing possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 x
0.2 x 0.2 cm to 3.1 x 1.9 x 0.6 cm. The larger lymph nodes are bisected and have pink-tan cut surfaces;
submitted entirely:
C1: 3 possible lymph nodes
C2: 1 bisected lymph node
C3-C4: 1 bisected lymph node
C5: remainder of soft tissue
