Immunohistochemical stains are performed on sections of a.
paraffin-embedded tissue for calcitonin, thyroglobulin, and TTF-l. The
neoplastic cells are positive for TTF-l and thyroglobulin, and are negative
for calcitonin. All immunohistochemical control sections are adequate. The
findings are consistent with a papillary thyroid carcinoma with oncocytic
features.

pTNM: pT3, pNO, pMX.

*****SPECIMEN(S) RECEIVED:**'**

Thyroid, REG

*****GROSS DESCRIPTION:*****

The specimen is received in one properly labeled container with the
patient' 3 name and accession number.

A. The specimen is designated 3total thyroid4 and consists of a
32.8 gram thyroid gland that is 9.5 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm. The right lobe is
approximately 10% larger than the left lobe. The external surface is
tan-gray and wrinkled, with no attached parathyroid glands or lymph nodes.
The specimen is inked as follows: right lobe-blue, left lobe—black,
isthmus—green. Sectioning of the right lobe reveals a 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm
well-defined, tan—gray, granular, firm nodule within the inferior pole,
which focally abuts the capsule. The nodule is approximately 20% necrotic,
and does not involve the isthmus. Multiple (under 10) tan, gelatinous,
soft, well—circumscribed nodules are noted within the left lobe, which
range from 0.3 to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The nodules comprise
approximately 30% of the left lobe parenchyma. The isthmus is
unremarkable. The uninvolved parenchyma is tan—red and rubbery. The
entire right lobe nodule is submitted for microscopic examination. (P)

Summary of Cassettes: A1-9, entire right lobe node nodule with
adjacent capsule and normal thyroid; A10, sections of isthmus; All-12,
sections of left lobe including nodules
