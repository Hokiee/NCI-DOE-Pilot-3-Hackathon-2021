HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

Division Head:
Inquiry Numbers:

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION: -

A. The specimen consists of an intact gallbladder measuring 8.3 x 2.4 x 2.6
cm. The serosal surface is smooth. The lumen contains green bile and no
calculi, and the cystic duct is patent. The mucosa is granular, and the wall
averages 0.2 cm in thickness. The cystic duct lymph node is not identified.
Representative sections are submitted in one cassette.

PLEASE NOTE: There is also a 0.5 cm polyp identified on the mucosa which has
been sampled in the cassette.

B. The specimen is received fresh and is submitted in formalin. The specimen
consists Of a segment of liver measuring 13 x 6.9 x 3.7 cm. The resection
margin is dyed with black ink. Grossly on the liver surface, there is a
grossly identifiable light tan nodule which grossly appears to invade the
liver capsule. Upon sectioning through this portion, there is a grossly
g identifiable tumor measuring 2.5 x 2.2 x 2.1 cm. This lesion has a nodular
appearance and comes to within 1.0 cm of the surgical resection margin. The
remainder of the specimen is sectioned and reveals no more gross
abnormalities. Representative sections of the tumor including the grossly
deepest point of invasion to the resection margin and the invasion to the
liver capsule are submitted in blocks Bl to B5. Representative sections of
grossly unremarkable liver parenchyma are submitted in block B6. “""'

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The gallbladder wall appears thin. The mucosa shows a polypoid lesion
consisting of aggregates of foamy histiocytes covered by intact mucosa,
consistent with a cholesterol polyp. There is no dysplasia. No significant
inflammation is present. The cystic duct is unremarkable.

The liver mass shows features of a hepatocellular carcinoma. The tumor has a
lobulated border with the adjacent hepatic parenchyma. The tumor cells are
arranged in solid sheets, acinar formations and trabeculae. Their cytoplasm
varies from eosinophilic to clear, and the nuclei show moderate to severe
cytologic atypia, with some areas of the tumor demonstrating marked nuclear
pleomorphism and prominent mitotic activity. Coarse fibrous septae are noted
between the lobules of tumor, but no satellite nodules are noted in the
adjacent parenchyma. No vascular invasion is identified. The adjacent
parenchyma shows moderate microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis and
evidence of chronic hepatitis, including chronic portal inflammation with
interface hepatitis, and lobular inflammation with hepatocyte dropout. There
is also anisocytosis and anisonucleosis. Trichrome stain reveals evidence of
periportal fibrosis with some bridging, but no evidence of established

HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

. Division Head: Dr.
Inquiry Numbers:

 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
cirrhosis.

Immunohistochemistry was performed on the tumor and reveals it to be positive
for CAM 5.2, HEP PAR—1 (patchy) and alpha fetoprotein (focal); there is very
weak/equivocal staining with cytokeratin 7 and no staining with cytokeratin
20, synaptophysin or TTFl (non—specific cytoplasmic staining only).
