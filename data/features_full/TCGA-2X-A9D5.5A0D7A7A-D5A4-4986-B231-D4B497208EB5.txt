performed by the staff pathologist.

Gross Description:

Received in formalin, labeled "left radical orchiectomy" is a

95 g orchiectomy specimen, which consists of a 6.5 x 4.6 x 3.4 cm testicle with
attached 5.3 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm epididymis, with attached 6.0 x 2.0 cm spermatic
cord. The tunica vaginalis is tan-pink, smooth and glistening. Sectioning
reveals a 6.2 x 4.6 x 3.3 cm tan, ﬁrm, lobulated, ill~deﬁned predominately
homogeneous mass which abuts the visceral layer of the tunica vaginalis. No
extension outside the testicle is identiﬁed. The scant uninvolved testis is

tan, soft and homogeneous. The seminiferous tubules string with ease. The
spermatic cord on sectioning is unremarkable. A gross photograph is taken.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:
spermatic cord margin taken en face;
mass at Rete testis to include epididymis;
mass to epididymis;

mass to visceral layer of tunica vaginalis;
mass to uninvolved testicle;

proximal spermatic cord.
