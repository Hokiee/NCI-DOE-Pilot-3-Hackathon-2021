2R upper paratracheal (right) lymph node, excision:
One (1) benign lymph node with no evidence of metastatic neoplasm.

Level 7 subcarinal lymph nodes, excision:
Three (3) benign lymph nodes with no evidence of metastatic neoplasm.

Comment: A total of 14 lymph nodes were sampled, one (1) of which (the level 10 hilar lymph
node) shows a micrometastatic focus of squamous cell carcinoma. AJCC pathologic stage:

Gross Description (Verified)
"FSA." All frozen section tissue is submitted in cassette “FSA.”

"A, NSFA." The specimen consists of a 1.2 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm gray-tan, ﬁrm tissue fragment. A portion of the specimen has been submitted at
frozen section. The remaining specimen is submitted. Free in the container are multiple soft, gray-tan tissue fragments measuring less than a
millimeter. "A," fragments, all, tea bag.

"FSB." All frozen section tissue is submitted in cassette “FSB.”

"B, NFSB." The specimen consists of a 15.0 x 11.0 x 4.0 cm right lung. There is a 4.5 x 4.0 cm ﬁrm. puckered area on the pleural surface.
There is also a 0.4 x 0.4 cm gray-white, ﬁrm area on the pleura. The remaining pleural surface is blue-gray. The specimen has previously
been sectioned by the pathologist to reveal a 5.1 x 3.5 x 6.4 cm gray-tan mass with cavitation. The pleural surface overlying the mass is inked
black. This mass grossly appears to abut the overlying pleural surface and comes to within 3.0 cm of the bronchial margin. The remaining
lung parenchyma is red-tan and markedly congested. On examination, one intraparenchymal lymph node is identiﬁed. This measures 0.5 cm.
Three peribronchial lymph nodes are identiﬁed. These range in size from 0.3 to 2.0 cm. "B1," vascular margin; "82—85," mass to include

overlying pleura; "BS," gray-white, ﬁrm area on pleura and intraparenchymal lymph node; "B7,“ peribronchial lymph nodes, representative.
"C, 9 pulmonary ligament." The specimen consists of a 1.3 cm gray-black lymph node. All lymphoid tissue is submitted into cassette "C."

"D, 8 paraesophageal (below carina)." The specimen consists of 3 gray-black to yellow-black lymph nodes ranging in size from 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.7
cm to 1.8 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm. The second largest lymph node is markedly calciﬁed. "D1," smallest lymph node; "D2," largest lymph node; "D3,"
markedly calciﬁed lymph node, all; light decal "D3."

"E, 4R lower paratracheal (right)." The specimen consists of 2 gray-tan lymph nodes measuring 1.9 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm and 2.5 x 1.7 x 0.6 cm. All
lymphoid tissue is submitted into cassettes "E1—E2." "E1," smallest lymph node; "E2," largest lymph node.

"F, 10 hilar." The specimen consists of a 4.2 x 2.1 x 1.7 cm gray-black, irregular lymph node. "F1-F4," fragments, all.

"G, 2R upper paratracheal (right)." The specimen consists of a 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm yellow-tan, fatty tissue fragment. On examination, a 0.7 cm
gray-tan lymph node is identiﬁed. All lymphoid tissue is submitted into cassette "G," representative.

"H, 7 subcarinal." The specimen consists of 3 gray-tan to gray-black lymph node fragments ranging in size from 0.9 x 0.4 x 0.5 cm to 2.2 x 2.0
x 1.0 cm. All lymphoid tissue is submitted into cassette "H1—H3."

"l, Expo project." Received in formalin is one yellow cassette with the following label—
Siinature Line

Clinical Information (Verified)
HTN, carpal tunnel syndrome.

Frozen Section Diagnosis (Verified)

A) Right lung, upper lobe, wedge biopsy of lesion
Gross: 1.2 cm greatest dimension fragment of hard gray tissue. Also present are a few small (1 mm of less) fragments of softer gray
tissue. One half of the large fragment submitted for F8. Squash preps made from small fragments.
Diagnosis: Squamous cell carcinoma.

B) Right lung, upper lobe, lobectomy
Gross: 15 x 11 x 4 RUL with large palpable tumor and palpable leura. Bronchial margin sampled as FSB. Section through tumor
shows gray cut surface with cavitations. Tumor sa
FS Diagnosis: Bronchial margin negative for tumor.
