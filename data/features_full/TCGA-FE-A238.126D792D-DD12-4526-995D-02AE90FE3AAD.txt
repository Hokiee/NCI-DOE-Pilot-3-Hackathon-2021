BFI. Thyroid: (FROZEN SECTION PERFORMED)
— Papillary carcinoma.

'““SPECIMEN(S) RECEIVED; ”H:
A: Lymph node, ENT, REG
8: Thyroid, REG

*****GROSS DESCRIPTION:*****

The specimens are received in two properly labeled containers, which are
frozen sections, with the patient' 5 name and accession number.

A. The specimen is designated "Delphian lymph node" and consists
of a 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm tan-pink lymph node. The entire specimen is
submitted for frozen section and frozen section in cassette API is
resubmitted as received. TE 1

B. The specimen is designated "thyroid" and consists of a 5.0 x
3.5 x 3.5 cm thyroid gland that weighs 17 grams. The outer surface is
tan-purple smooth and glistening. The entire specimen is inked black and
the Specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 3.9 x 2.7 x 2.0 cm
well-circumscribed tan firm nodule present in the right thyroid lobe that
grossly abuts the black inked capsular surface. The nodule is hemorrhagic
over approximately 40%. The right lobe also displays a separate 0.5 x 0.3
x 0.3 cm tan-white well-circumscribed nodule which is located 1.0 cm from
the largest nodule. The left lobe of the thyroid contains a 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2
cm tan—white well circumscribed nodule that grossly abuts the black inked
capsular surface. This nodule is located 2.4 cm from the largest nodules.
The remaining thyroid parenchyma is dark red and rubbery with no other
discrete lesions identified. A representative section of the largest nodule
is submitted for frozen section and frozen section cassette BPl is
resubmitted as received. (P) RS 17
