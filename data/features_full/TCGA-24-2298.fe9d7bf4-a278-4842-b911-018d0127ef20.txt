IVIICI‘OSCODIC Desorption and Comment:

There is widely disseminated‘ poorly differentiated papillary
serous carcinoma involving both right and left ovaries, right and
left paratubal soft tissue, serosal surface of the uterus, and
biopsies submitted as sigmoid epiploica, pelvic tumor, right upper
quadrant mass, sigmoid mesentery, descending colon. and umbilicus.
The omentum is also extensively replaced by metastatic serous
carcinoma. A few small nests of tumor are floating in the lumen
of the left fallopian tube. The tumor cells are pleomorphic with
large hyperchromatic nuclei and a high mitotic rate. Psammoma
bodies are numerous. There is considerable lymphatic involvement
especially in sections of the right ovary.

The endometrium is inactive. There are no significant

histopathologic chanies ii mum or the cervix.

Gross Description;

The specimens are received in nine containers of formalin each
labelled with the patient's name. The first container is labelled
"uterus, cervix and BSD." It contains a uterus and cervix with
bilaterally attached adnexa. The uterus with cervix alone weighs
64 grams and measures 7.4 x 7.0 x 2.8 cm in greatest dimension.
Both the anterior and posterior serosal surfaces are studded by
ten tumor nodules. These are most prominent on the

anterior surface. The serosa otherwise is ten smooth and shiny.
The endometrial cavity measures 2.9 x 2.5 cm in greatest
dimension. It is lined by glistening yellow-tan endometrium. The
endometrium measures ~0.l cm in greatest depth and is
unremarkable. It overlies solid pink—tan myometrium which
measures 1.5 cm in maximal depth. No leiomyornata are present.

The endocervix measures 3 cm in length and is lined by
unremarkable yellow, furrowad mucosa. Sectioning reVeals
occasional nabothian cysts. The cervical OS measures -l cm; the
ectocervix is lined by unremarkable smooth white epithelium.

The right ovary measures 5 x 2.5 x 1.9 cm_ in greatest dimension
and is largely replaced by tan nodular friable tumor. The tumor
studs the broad ligament and the surface of the fallopian tube.
The fallopian tube measures 3.5 cm in length by 0.4 cm in average
diameter. No intrinsic abnormalities of the fallopian tube are
identified. The left ovary measures 2.6 x 2.4 x 1.4 cm in
greatest dimension and is also replaced by tan nodular friable
tumor. The tumor studs the broad ligament. A convoluted
fimbriated fallopian tube measuring 2.5 cm in length by 0.7 cm in
average diameter is also present. No intrinsic: abnormalities of
the tube are identified. Labelled E141, anterior endomyometrium;
3M2, posterior endomyometrium: C1. anterior cervix.- C2. posterior
cervix; Rol—R03, right ovary,- RT, right tube and broad ligament;
£014.03; left ovary.- LT, left tube and broad ligament.

The second container is labelled "F51" and contains an irregular
tan glistening fragment of tissue measuring 1 x 0.7 x 0.1 cm.
Labelled FSl. Jar 0.

The third container is labelled ”sigmoid epiploica.“ It contains
two irregular firm yellow and white nodular pieces of tissue
measuring 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm and 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm. Labelled A.
Jar l.

The fourth container is labelled "pelvic tumor" and contains two
irregular shaggy pieces of tan tiseue measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x
0.5 Cm and 1.8 x 1.6 x 0.3 Cm. Labelled B. Jar 1.

"to fifth container is labelled "sigmoid mesentery" and contains

'0 irregular fragments of shaggy tan tissue consistent with
tumor. The tissue measures 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm and 2.0 x 1.6 x 1.0
cm in greatest dimension. Labelled C. Jar l.

The sixth container is labelled "right upper quadrant mass." It
contains four irregular pieces of tan nodular tissue consistent
with tumor tissue admixed with fibroadipose tissue. In aggregate

 

l SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

the specimen measures 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension.
Labelled D. Jar l.

The seventh container is labelled "descending colon." It contains
two irregular nodular pieces of tan tissue consistent with tumor.
These pieces measure 1.5 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm and 1.7 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm.
Labelled E. Jar l.

The eighth container is labelled "umbilical hernia.” It consists
of a irregular membraneous sheet ot tissue with attached
fibroadipose tissue. The tissue measures 7.5 x 3.5 x 0.4 cm in
greatest dimension. Also present is a smaller fragment of tissue
of a similar nature measuring 2 x 1.5 X 0.3 cm. A tan tuner
nodule measuring 0.5 cm in greatest dimension is identified in the
larger piece of tissue. Labelled F. Jar 1.

The ninth container is labelled “omentum.” It contains a 30 x 15
x 3 cm sheet of omental tissue massively studded by tumor nodules
ranging in size from minute to 10 cm in greatest dimension. Also
present are two irregular pieces of tumor measuring 3 and 7 cm in
greatest dimension. Labelled G. section of omentum. Jar 2.
