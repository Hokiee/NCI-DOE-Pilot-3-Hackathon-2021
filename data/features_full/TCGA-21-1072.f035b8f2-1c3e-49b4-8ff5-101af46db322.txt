FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: SFS — BRONCHIAL MARGIN NEGATIVE FOR
TUMOR

GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen was received fresh for frozen section. The specimen
consists of a left pneumonectomy measuring 22.0 X 14.5 x 3.0 cm. The specimen contains a
bronchus measuring 4.0 cm in length with a diameter of 2.0 cm. The pleura is pink—tan with
diffuse areas of anthracotic pigmentation. There are no areas of puckering or induration
identiﬁed grossly on the pleura. The bronchial tree was dissected to reveal the upper
bronchus containing a pink~tan soft mass which obliterates the bronchiole. The mass
measures 2.4 X 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. The surrounding lung parenchyma contains
mucous plugs. The surrounding vasculature is not involved with the tumor. The bronchial
margin was frozen and the frozen section residue is submitted in one block. Representative
sections are submitted in eight blocks.

DESIGNATION OF SECTIONS: 5FS, 5A—5G

SUMMARY OF SECTIONS: 5FS frozen section residue, 5A vascular margin, 5B four
lymph nodes, 5C four lymph nodes, 5D-5E bronchus with tumor, 5F the parenchyma nearest
to the tumor and 5G normal lung.
