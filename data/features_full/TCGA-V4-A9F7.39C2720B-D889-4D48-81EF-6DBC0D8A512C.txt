Enucleation of the right eye Qts & ”4, /[£/

Macroscopy

The eyeball measures 28 by 25 mm and the optic nerve 11 mm. Samples have been made for
cryo preservation .The specimen has been then included entirely.

Microscopy

The eyeball is occupied by a tumor proliferation morphologic features of which are those of a
choroidal melanoma containing mostly fusiforrn cells (90%) and rarely epithelioid cells
(10%). The lesion is loaded with melanin pigment. The mitotic index is low with 5 mitosis out
of 10 high 400 magniﬁcation ﬁelds. The lesion inﬁltrates the internal third of the sclera, there
is no extrascleral extension. The tumor proliferation inﬁltrates the intraocular emergence of
the optic nerve but the optic foramen, the post laminar section, the cut end and the meningeal
sheaths are free of tumor. The iris, the ciliary body and the anterior chamber are free of tumor.

Conclusion

Choroidal melanoma with mostly fusiform cells
Size of the lesion: 10mm

Low mitotic activity

The tumor proliferation inﬁltrates the intraocular emergence of the optic nerve but the optic
foramen, the post laminar section, the cut end and the meningeal sheaths are free of tumor.

The iris, the ciliary body and the anterior chamber are free of tumor.
