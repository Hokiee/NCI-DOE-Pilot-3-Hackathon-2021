- Four benign lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy (0/4 lymph

nodes).

COMMENT:

This neoplasm shows high cellularity, prominent atypia, numerous

mitoses, necrosis and hemorrhage. The small bowel wall is unaffected;

the tumor arose in the mesentery; presumably in mesenteric vessel wall.

Previous biopsy of this tumor shows it to be negative

for C0117 (Ckit—negative).

CLINICAL HISTORY:

The patient is male with history of sarcoma. Operative

 

 

procedure: Small bowel and sarcoma resection.

GROSS:
One formalin-filled container is received labeled with the patient's

Name and medical record number.

The container is additionally labeled "small and sarcoma" and consist of
a 71 cm in length by 2.5 cm in diameter segment of small bowel with
attached large amount of mesenteric adipose tissue. Both resection
margins are previously stapled closed. The serosal surface is red and
smooth with no exudate, perforation, or lesions. An 8.5 x 8.4 x 7.3 cm
large, round, and solid mass is present within mesenteric adipose
tissue. On sectioning, the mass is white, whorled, ﬁrm and solid. A

1.8 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm dark red hemorrhagic area is present in the central
portion. The mass is 7.5 cm to the bowel, 7.5 and 9.0 cm to bowel
resection margins respectively. The mesenteric margin is inked black
and the mass is 0.5 cm to the closest margin. Grossly the mass is
entirely encapsulated. The bowel is opened to reveal tan and
unremarkable mucosa with permanent transverse ridges. A lymph node
dissection is performed within mesenteric adipose tissue and lymph nodes
ranging from 0.5 to 1.7 cm in greatest dimension are present.

Representative tissue was procured for potential future studies.

Summary of Sections:

A1 - two bowel margins.

A2 - the mass with closest mesenteric margin.
A3-A4 - mass to include hemorrhage.

A5-A11 - mass.

A12-A13 - bowel wall.

A14-A18 - one lymph node in each.

MICROSCOPIC:

Microscopic examination is performed.
