FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS
Mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy, 3@b/5
A. Left axillary sentinel node #1: Sil'l’é .‘ WA. 13, e as + a}. é :DO
- Single lymph node, no tumor (0/ l). a 50 g
B. Leﬁ axillary sentinel node #2: 0&4 r: B/‘easi" NOS
- Single lymph node, no tumor (0/1). ‘25:)?!
C. Mastectomy, left breast: 940/2/2 4/11

- Invaswe ductal carcinoma, SRB grade II, with focal necrosis.

- Ductal carcinoma in situ, high nuclear grade, solid type.

- Focal Paget' 5 disease of the nipple.

- Uninvolved breast parenchyma with focal ﬂat epithelial atypia, columnar
cell change, ductal hyperplasia of usual type, intraductal papilloma.

D. Left axillary base, non-sentinel lymph node:

- Two lymph nodes, no tumor (0/2).

Breast Pathologic Parameters

l. Invasive carcinoma:

A. Size: Gross measurement: 6.5cm

B. Composite histologic (modiﬁed SBR) grade II

- Architecture: 3

- Nuclear grade: 2

- Mitotic count: 1

C. Associated ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS):

- High nuclear grade, solid type

- Associated with (forming 5% of tumor volume) and extending away (focal to
involved lactiferous ducts and nipple) from index lesion

2. Excisional biopsy margins. Free of tumor

- DCIS >lcm from deep (closest) margin

« Invasive carcinoma 5mm from deep (closest) margin

3. Blood vessel and lymphatic invasion:

— Rare microscopic foci worrisome for lymphatic involvement in breast
parenchyma.

4 Axillary lymph nodes: Negative for tumor (0/4)

5. Special studies (see

- Strong expression of ER 1n 100% of 1nvasive tumor nuclei
- Strong expression of PR in 100% of 1nvasive tumor nuclei
- HerZ/neu antigen (FISH): pending on prior biopsy material.
6. pTNM: pT3, N0(sn), MX.

Clinical History: ‘

The patient is a year-old female with palpable left breast mass. Biopsy at
outside hospital showed invasive ductal carcinoma, ER/PR positive, HER-2
negative. Breast MRI on » ihowed left inferior irregular margin
with irregular mass and heterogenous enhancement at 6 o' clock position.
Multiple contiguous satellite lesions are present predominantly extending
anterior from the mass. Overall dimensions are 6.4 x 6.1 x 4.1 cm. The right
breast was normal. Bilateral axillae were normal.

Specimens Received:

A: Left axillary sentinel node

B: Left axillary sentinel node

C: Left breast

D: Non-Sentinel node base of axilla

Gross Description:
The specimen is received in four containers each labeled with the patient' s
name and medical record number.

A. Container A is further identiﬁed as, 3leﬁ axillary sentinel node4.

Received fresh is a 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm apparent lymph node with blue ink. The
specimen is bisected and entirely submitted for frozen section with the
diagnosis of 3no evidence of tumor4 per . The frozen remnant is
entirely submitted in cassette AIF S.

B. Container B is further identiﬁed as, 3left axillary sentinel node4.

Received fresh is a 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm apparent lymph node with blue ink. The
specimen is bisected and entirely submitted for frozen section with a diagnosis
of 3no evidence of tumor4 per _ The remnant of the frozen section is
entirely submitted in cassette Bl FS.

C. Container C is further identiﬁed as, 31eﬂ breast4. Received fresh and

placed in formalin is a specimen mastectomy weighing 1100 grams measuring 23.8
cm from medial to lateral, 17.4 cm from superior to inferior, 6.0 cm from

anterior to posterior. The specimen is oriented with two short sutures

designated as superior and two long sutures designated as lateral. The breast

is overlaid with 14.5 x 10.5 cm adipose and skin. Eccentricallylocated is a

5.8 x 5.2 cm areola with a nipple with a diameter of 1.5 cm. The nipple areolar
complex displays no evidence of ulceration or retraction. The deep fascia is

inked black and the specimen is sectioned from medial to lateral into ten

slices, with the medial slice designated as slice 1. The nipple is located in
slice 4 and slice 5. A 6.5 x 4.9 x 3.3 cm mass is located in slice 4 through
slice 7. The mass is white and firm and inferior to the nipple. The margin of
the mass is irregular especially at the anterior aspect. A satellite lesion is
identiﬁed superior and anterior to the index mass located in slice 5 measuring
1.5 x 1.1 x 1.1 cm and is 0.4 cm from the nearest skin. The mass is 1.0 cm from
the closest inked margin on slice 5. A 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm black discolored area
is identified in slice 3 and 4 and another 4.0 x 3.8 x 2.0 cm blue discolored
area is identiﬁed on slice 5 and 6. The remainder of the breast consists
approximately 17% of adipose tissue and 30% of breast duct parenchyma.
Additional masses or nodules are not grossly identiﬁed. Representative
sections are submitted as follows:

C1: nipple

C2-C3: areola

C4—C7: full section of the tumor on slice 5 with cassette 4 showing
the closest deep margin and cassette

6 showing the satellite lesion and the closest skin

C8: section from slice 5 showing satellite lesion and the closest skin
C9: representative sections from the tumor on slice 6

C10: inner upper quadrant slice 3

C11: inner upper quadrant slice 4

C12: inner lower quadrant slice 3

C13: inner lower quadrant slice 2

C14: outer upper quadrant slice 5

C15: outer upper quadrant slice 8

C16: outer lower quadrant slice 8

D. Container D is further identiﬁed, as 3n0n-sentinel node base of axilla
left4. Received fresh and placed in formalin are two apparent lymph nodes
measuring 1.8 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm and 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is entirely
submitted in cassettes Dl-D2 with one lymph node in each cassette bisected.

lntraoperative Consult Diagnosis:
A1 FS. Left axillary sentinel node: No evidence of tumor.
BlF S. Left axillary sentinel node: No evidence of tumor.
