CLINICAL HISTORY
The patient is a —year—old woman who had an oligodendroglioma diagnosed in

and recurrence on . Currently she has nodular contrast—enhancing
progressive disease.
OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
Possible recurrent tumor
Operation/Specimen: A: Brain, excision biopsy
PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:
Brain, right temporal lesion, excision: Glioblastoma with oligodendroglial
component (WHO Grade IV) (see comment).
COMMENT
Sections show a densely cellular pleomorphic glioma demonstrating frequent
mitotic figures and pseudopalisading necrosis. The tumor cell nuclei are
hyperchromatic and irregularly shaped, and mostly resemble those found in
glioblastoma. The prior oligodendroglial phenotype of the tumor cells is not
clearly recognizable on permanent sections, however mini—gemistocytic type
cytoplasm can be observed in some of the tumor cells and a small fraction of
the tumor cell nuclei are roughly round in shape. The latter can also be seen
in the intraoperative smear preparations. The tumor is focally GFAP positive,
but largely negative. The tumor is also weakly NeuN positive and shows focal
synaptophysin positivity. The patient's prior specimen is reviewed
and confirmed to show mixed oligodendroglial and astrocytic histological
features. At that time the Ki-67 labeling index of the tumor was
approximately
5 to 15%. The current specimen shows little resemblance to the specimen
histologically and demonstrates a much higher Ki—67 labeling index of 80 to
90%. This likely reflects transformation of the prior lesion to glioblastoma.
An immunohistochemical stain for p53 is strongly and diffusely positive.
Nearly 100% of the tumor cells demonstrate strong nuclear immunoreactivity.
The K «67 labeling index is 80 to 90%.
The Mng promoter methylation assay is now negative, and partial loss of
chrome ome arm 1p is detected without evidence of 19q loss (see
procedures/addenda below).

PROCEDURES/ADDENDA

MGMT Promoter Methylation

Date Ordered: Date Reported:

Interpretation ,

NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected.
Results—Comments

Testing performed on tissue block (A3).

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA followed
by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated
DNA

sequences.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a
stand alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its performance
characteristics determined by the as
required by CLIA ‘ 88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for
specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results
are

provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.

Loss of Heterozygosity 1p, l9q Assay (LOH)
Date Ordered: Date Reported:
Interpretation

There is loss of heterozygosity at DlSS4B locus suggestive of partial loss on
chromosome arm 1p

There is no allelic loss on chromosome arm 19q detected.

Informative loci are: DlSS48, DlSSSZ, D198219, D193412, PLA2G4C and D19S606
Results—Comments

Testing performed on DNA extracted from a paraffin tumor block

(A3)

and a corresponding blood specimen.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers
on 1p are DlSS48, DlSlS92, and D18552 (with D18468, D131612, and DlS496 as
backup markers) and the 3 markers on l9q are D198219, D195412, and PLA2G4C
(with DlSS606 and D1931182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or
4

nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat)
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score,
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used if the
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or otherwise
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1p
and 19q deletion.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a
stand-alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its performance
characteristics determined by the as
required by CLIA ' 88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for
specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has

determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results

provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.
TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non—neoplastic cells in the
sample
may preclude the detection of allelic loss.
