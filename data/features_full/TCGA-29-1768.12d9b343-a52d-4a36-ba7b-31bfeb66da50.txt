CLINICAL HISTORY:
Ovarian cyst.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Omentum", received fresh; A 19 x 13 x 2.5 cm firm, nodular, matted
fragment of yellow-tan omental tissue is received. Sectioning reveals yellow
fat intermixed with dense bands of white, fibrous tumor tissue; Areas of fat
necrosis are focally appreciated. Representative sections are submitted in
Blocks A1~3.

B. "Right ovary and tube", received fresh. A 3 gram aggregate of tissue
composed of a 3.9 x 0.8 cm slightly edematous fimbriated fallopian tube
adherent upon_a focally disrupted 4.5 x 3.7 x 2 cm ovary with a nodular,
friable cut surface. Representative sections are submitted in Blocks Bli3h

C. "Left tube and ovary", received fresh. A 26 gram aggregate of tissue
composed of fimbriated ends of a fallopian tube adherent upon a nodular,
focally disrupted 5 x 3.8 x 3.2 cm ovary. Sectioning through the ovary
reveals a focally solid cut surface and a peripheral clear, fluid—filled
thin-walled 2.2 cm diameter cyst. The cyst itself is lined by smooth,
glistening surfaces surrounded by normal—appearing.ovarian tissue. The
nodularity appears to be on the edge of the ovary in the fibrofatty tissue
(02—3). Representative sections are submitted in Blocks 01—3.
