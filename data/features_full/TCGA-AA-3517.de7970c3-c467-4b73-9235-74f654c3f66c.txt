*** Diagnosis / Diagnoses: ***

1.: Partial colectomy specimen with portions of the terminal ileum and an ulcerated colon
carcinoma conforming to the histological type of a moderately differentiated colorectal
carcinoma, located 50 cm aborally from Bauhin’ s valve and circularly occupying the
colon wall over a length of 5.5 cm. Invasive spread of tumor within all layers of the
intestinal wall and extending into the level of the mesocolic fatty tissue.

Colon otherwise with three tubulovillous colonic mucosal adenomas, two of which
exhibit mild epithelial dysplasia (synonym: low-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia), one
with severe epithelial dysplasia (synonym: high-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia).

In the cecum and 0.6 cm aboral to Bauhin’s valve, a fresh, ulcerous mucosal defect —
status following prior endoscopic removal of adenomas and with no further portions of
the adenomas that were removed.

Oral and aboral resection margins and large omentum tumor-free.

54 mesocolic and mesenteric lymph nodes tumor-free with uncharacteristic reactive
changes.

Tumor stage thus: pT3 pNO (0/54), L0, V0; G2. + pT? in cecum

2.: Gall bladder with moderate, barely ﬂorid, chronic cholecystitis, probably with
cholecystolithiasis.
