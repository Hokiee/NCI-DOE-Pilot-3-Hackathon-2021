SPECIMEN(S):
A. RIGHT COLON

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. RIGHT COLON
Received fresh is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of a segment of large intestine measuring
22 x 8.5 cm (circumference) and portion of distal ileum measuring 1 x 3.2 cm (circumference). No
appendix is seen grossly. The large intestine contains an exophytic tumor measuring 3.9 x 3.2 x 0.5 cm
and located 4.5 cm from the ileocecal valve. The serosal surface corresponding to tumor area is inked
black. The tumor appears to invade muscularis propria grossly. The ileocecal valve mucosa has a
slightly sessile polypoid granular area; this area measures 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.3 cm. There is another possible
polyp located 4.8 cm from the first polyp and is located 3.1 cm distally from the tumor; this polyp
measures 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm. The pericolic fat is submitted in O-fix for overnight fixation; multiple lymph
nodes are found, they range from 0.1 to 0.5 cm in diameter. A portion of the tumor is submitted for
tissue procurement. Representative sections are submitted in A1 (distal margin, shaved section), A2-
A3 (ileocecal valve granular area), A4-A12 (entire tumor), A13 (another polyp toward the distal margin),
A14-A15 (random mucosa), A16-A40 (lymph nodes), and A41 (proximal margin, shaved section).

DIAGNOSIS:
A. COLON, RIGHT, HEMICOLECTOMY:
- INVASIVE MODERATELY TO POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA INVADING
SUBSEROSA
- TUMOR SIZE 3.9 X 3.2 X 0.5 CM
- METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE OUT OF THIRTY SEVEN LYMPH NODES (1/37). THE
INVOLVED LYMPH NODE SIZE 0.4 CM AND LOCATED IN PERICOLIC FAT UNDERLYING THE
INVASIVE CARCINOMA
- SURGICAL MARGINS NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA

- MULTIPLE TUBULAR ADENOMAS (LOCATED AT THE ILEOCECAL VALVE AND ADJACENT TO
THE INVASIVE CARCINOMA)

- HYPERPLASTIC POLYP

ADDENDUM:
ANALYSIS OF MISMATCH REPAIR PROTEIN EXPRESSION

SUMMARY OF IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY/SPECIAL STAINS
Material: Block A9

Population: Tumor Cells

Stain/Marker:Result: Comment:

MSH2 Positive
MSH6 Positive
MLH1 Positive
PMS2 Positive

The interpretation of the above immunohistochemistry stain or stains is guided by published results in
the medical literature, provided package information from the manufacturer and by internal review of
staining performance and assay validation within the Immunohistochemistry Laboratory of the. The use
of one or more reagents in the above tests is regulated as an analyte specific reagent (ASR). These
tests were developed and their performance characteristic determined by the Department of Pathology
Laboratory at. They have not been cleared or approved by the US. Food and Drug Administration.
The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.

INTERPRETATION: No abnormalities in mismatch repair protein expression identified.

Expression of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 in the tumor was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.
Peritumoral lymphocytes and normal glands serve as internal positive controls expressing MLH1,
MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2.

Testing for Microsatellite Instability has been ordered. The results will be issued in a separate report.
