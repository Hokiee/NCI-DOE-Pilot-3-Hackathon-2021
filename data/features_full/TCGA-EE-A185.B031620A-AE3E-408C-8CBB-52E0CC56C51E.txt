Four specimens were received.

1. "RIGHT'GROW"‘ONTENTS STAPLES UPPER". Portion taken ﬁam largest ﬂoriylngt. .Tltmgyr
Bantzﬁg -. . ,,. An irregular piece of fatty tissue 210 x 110 x 4655mm; an overlying
ellipse of skin 205 x 45mm, bearing staples at the upper (superior) pole. The skin surface appears overall
unremarkable. Multiple involved lymph nodes were identiﬁed, including an enlarged necrotic lymph node
up to 45mm in maximum dimension.

All of lymph nodes embedded sequentially from superior to inferior.

A. Most superior lymph node.

B. l lymph node trisected. All embedded.

C. Representative, 1 involved lymph node.

D-E. Representative, 1 involved lymph node.

F. 1 involved lymph node bisected all embedded.
0-1-1. 1 lymph node bisected all embedded.

J. 2 lymph nodes.

K. Representative involved lymph node.

L. Representative involved lymph node.

2. "TISSUE BEHIND RIGHT FEMORAL NERVE". A dark brown piece of tissue, (?Iymph node) 7mm
across. Embedded whole in one block.

3. "TUMOUR RIGHT THIGH". An unorientated ellipse of skin 120 x 40mm with an underlying mass of
subcutaneous tissue 125 x 50 x 35mm. Fascia is present on the deep aspect. On the skin surface centrally is
a crusted grey plaque 30 x 20mm, lying clear of the margins. One long margin inked blue, opposite black.
Serial sectioning through the area of the crusting, shows a partially necrotic nodule centered in the subcutis
(15 x 8 x 7mm, surrounded by haemorrhagic fatty tissue). The nodule lies well clear of all margins (up to
20mm from the deep margin and 17mm from the closest peripheral margin).

A. Representative necrotic lesion showing closest peripheral (blue inked) margin, deep margin
and opposite long margin trimmed.

B. Representative necrotic lesion.

C-E. Further blocks (remainder of necrotic nodule embedded).

HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

4. "TISSUE AROUND RIGHT FEMORAL NERVE". An irregular piece of grey and haemorrhagic ﬁbrous

and fatty tissue 35 x 25 x 10mm. Cut section shows uniform fibrofatty tissue. Bisected and all embedded in
two blocks (A-B).

MICROSCOPIC REPQRT

1. "RIGHT GROIN CONTENTS STAPLES UPPER". Sections show metastatic melanoma in six of nine
lymph nodes (6/9), and one extranodal subcutaneous deposit of melanoma with focal dermal involvement
(blocks ID and IE). Tumour deposits consist of sheets of epithelioid pleomorphic cells with prominent
central eosinophilic nucleoli, and variable dusty dark brown pigment.

2. "TISSUE BEHIND RIGHT FEMORAL NERVE". Sections show a deposit of metastatic melanoma.
Lymph node tissue is not identiﬁed.

3. "TUMOUR RIGHT THIGH". The skin contains an abscess within the deep dermis and subcutis,
underlying epidermal and dermal scar from the recent surgery. Residual melanoma is not identiﬁed and
melanocytic lesion is not seen.

4. "TISSUE AROUND RIGHT FEMORAL NERVE". The specimen consists of skeletal muscle and
adipose tissue. A 3.5mm deposit of metastatic melanoma is seen within adipose tissue. Lymph node tissue is
not.

SUMMARY

1. Lymph node dissection, and skin, right groin : METASTATIC MELANOMA IN 6 OF 9 LYMPI-I
NODES AND AN EXTRANODAL SUBCUTANEOUS DEPOSIT.

/
2. Soft tissue, behind femoral nerve : METASTATIC MELANOMA.
/
3. Skin, right thigh, wide excision : ABSCESS CAVITY AND SCAR.
: NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
/ ,
4. Soft tissue, right femoral nerve region : METASTATIC MELANOMA.
