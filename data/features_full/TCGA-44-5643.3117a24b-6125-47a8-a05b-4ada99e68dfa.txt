GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. Received fresh labeled "right lower lobe" is a 363—

gram,

19 x 11 x 5.5 cm lobectomy specimen with attached 1 cm in
length, 1.8 x 1.4 cm in diameter bronchial stump. The pleura is
smooth glistening tan—pink and focally retracted with a subjacent
palpable mass lesion. On sectioning, there is a well—

circumscribed,
6.8 x 6.5 x 5 cm focally cystic tan—white lesion, which focally
approaches the inked pleural surface within less than 0.1 cm. A
portion of tumor and a portion of normal tissue are submitted for
tissue procurement, as requested. In addition, the tumor extends
to
within 2 cm of the bronchial stump margin. The remaining
parenchyma
is spongiform, red—purple, with a 4—cm ill—defined, focus of
consolidation inferior to the tumor (see block 10). No additional
abnormality is noted. Three slight rubbery tan—gray—black tissue

in
keeping with lymph nodes measuring up 1.3 cm in greatest dimension
are recovered from the hilar region. Representative sections are
submitted in 12 blocks as labeled. RS—l2.
BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Bronchial stump margin, 2 — vascular margin, 3—
5

— tumor to inked pleural surface, 6 — tumor to bronchial stump, 7 —
central tumor, 8 — tumor to normal, 9 — random normal, 10 — area of

node.

B. Received fresh, labeled "completion right
pneumonectomy" is a 223 gram, 13.5 x 10.5 x 6.0 cm.
lobectomy specimen with attached 2.5 cm. in length, 2.8 x 1.8 cm.

diameter bronchial stump. The pleura is wrinkled pink purple. On
sectioning the parenchyma is spongiform red purple with scant
diffuse anthracosis. No discrete mass lesion or abnormality is
identified. Four slightly rubbery tan gray—black tissues in

keeping

with lymph nodes measuring up to 1.8 cm. in greatest dimension are
recovered from the hilum. Representative sections are submitted in
7 blocks as labeled. RS7.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Bronchial stump margin; 2 — vascular margin; 3—5
— random parenchyma; 6 — three whole peri nodes; 7 —
trisected largest perihilar lymph node.

C. Received fresh, labeled "level 7 lymph node" are four

intact to slightly fragmented soft pale tan to tan red
tissue in keeping with lymph nodes ranging from 0.7 cm. in greatest
dimension up to 4.5 x 2.8 x 1.3 cm.(the largest possibly
representing a nodule aggregate). The specimen is entirely
submitted in five blocks as labeled. AS—5.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Three whole tissues; 2—5 — section largest
tissue.

D. Received fresh, labeled "4R lymph nodes" are two soft

tan white to tan red tissues measuring 0.7 and 1.3 cm. in
greatest dimension which are submitted in toto. AS—l.

E. Received fresh, labeled "mediastinal cyst" are four

diffusely cauterized slightly rubbery white pink tissue
fragments averaging 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.15 cm. The specimens are

bisected

and entirely submitted in two blocks.
F. Received fresh, labeled "2R lymph nodes" are two
diffusely cauterized fragmented, soft golden yellow fatty
portions of tissue measuring 1.3 and 1.8 cm. in greatest dimension.
No definitive lymphoid tissues are recovered. The specimens are
submitted in toto independently in two blocks. AS—2.
G. Received fresh, labeled "superior vein stump" is an
irregular, 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.15 cm. fragment of rubbery white
pink tissue with numerous silver metallic staples. The staples are
d and the specimen is entirely submitted in one block. AS—l.

 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Histologic type: Non—small cell carcinoma.
Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated.
Primary tumor (pT): Tumor measures maximally 6.8 cm in size and is
confined to the lung (pT2b).
Margins of resection: Negative.
Direct extension of tumor: Absent.
Venous (large vessel) invasion: Positive.
Arterial (large vessel) invasion: Negative.
Lymphatic (small vessel) invasion: Positive.
Regional lymph nodes (pN): Eight peribronchial and perihilar lymph
nodes
are negative for metastatic carcinoma. One of four level 7
mediastinal
nodes contains metastatic adenocarcinoma. 4R and 2R lymph nodes
are
negative for tumor (pN2).
Distant metastasis (pM): Cannot be assessed (pMX).
Other findings: Post—obstructive pneumonitis and pulmonary edema
are
present. Benign mediastinal cyst.

DIAGNOSIS

the

A,B. Lung, right pneumonectomy:
Poorly differentiated non—small cell carcinoma involving

right lower lobe.

The bronchial and vascular margins of resection are free of
tumor. The tumor does not extend beyond the visceral
pleural surface. Lymphovascular space invasion and
medium—sized venous invasion by tumor is present.
Post—obstructive pneumonitis with pulmonary edema.

Eight peribronchial and perihilar lymph nodes negative for
metastatic carcinoma (0/8).

C. Lymph nodes, level 7, resection:
One of four lymph nodes contains metastatic carcinoma (1/4).

D. Lymph node, 4R, resection:
Single lymph node negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/1).

E. Mediastinum, resection of lesion:
Benign fibrofatty tissue with a mesothelial—lined cyst.

Negative for malignancy.

F. Lymph nodes, 2R, resection:
Two lymph nodes negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/2).

G. Vein, superior vein stump, resection:
DIAGNOSIS

No significant histopathologic findings.
Negative for malignancy.
