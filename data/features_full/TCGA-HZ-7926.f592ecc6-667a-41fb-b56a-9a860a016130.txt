Clinical History
Pancreatic neoplasm, patient is participating in the

Specimen
#1 Gallbladder
#2 Pancreaticoduodenectomy

Gross Examination

#1 Labeled gallbladder is a 10.5 x 5.0 x up to 2.5 cm intact gallbladder. The
serosa is smooth and dusky purple. The mucosa is discolored dark green and
velvety. The lumen is filled with a dark green Viscid fluid. There are no
gallstones present. The wall is up to 0.5 cm thick. Four representative
sections, to include the cystic duct margin, is submitted in one cassette.

#2 Received fresh, placed in formalin for overnight fixation labeled
pancreaticoduodenectomy is a specimen consisting of a 7.0 x 4.0 x 3.5 cm portion
of distal stomach contiguous with a 16.0 cm long, 4.0 cm in average diameter
portion of small bowel with attached mesentery. There is an attached 8.5 x 5.5
X 3.5 cm portion of pancreas. Within the pancreas is a 3.5 x 3.2 x 3.0 cm
ill—defined pale tan—yellow mass. The mass grossly comes to within 0.1 cm of
the retroperitoneal tissue margin (inked black), 1.0 cm from the pancreatic
resection margin {inked blue), and at least 2.0 cm from the common bile duct
margin. The mass surrounds the common bile duct, which is narrowed but still
probe patent. Proximal to the narrowing the common bile duct is bifurcated and
both lumens are dilated to 1.0 cm in greatest dimension, each. The mass grossly
appears to extend into the wall of the small bowel. The overlying mucosa,
including the ampulla, is raised and granular over 2.5 x 1.7 cm. The mass is
2.0 cm from the ampulla. The mass comes to within 0.1 cm of the outer surface
of the pancreas, posteriorly (also inked black}. The remaining pancreatic
parenchyma is firm, tan—yellow, and lobulated. There are no additional masses
identified. The mucosa of the small bowel and stomach is tan and glistening.
There are no mucosal—based masses identified. There are multiple peripancreatic
lymph node candidates, up to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. There is a 1.6 cm in
greatest dimension lymph node candidate identified adjacent to the bile duct
margin. Within the perigastric adipose tissue are multiple additional lymph
node candidates, up to 0.4 cm. There is no attached small bowel mesentery.
Representative sections submitted in fifteen: “A"—"0". Block summary: the
following margin Sections are tangential in nature; "A" bifurcated bile duct;

Microscopic Examination
#1 Microscopic examination performed.

#2 Sections of the pancreatic mass demonstrate a well differentiated pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma composed of irregular glandular structures lined by a
malignant cell population with nuclear pleomorphism and nucleoli formation. The
adenocarcinoma extends into the peripancreatic soft tissue and is less than 0.1
cm away from the retroperitoneal margin. However, some of the retroperitoneal
margin sections contain significant cautery artifact which blurs the
retroperitoneal margin sections. The bile duct, proximal stomach, distal
duodenum and pancreatic margins are all free of adenocarcinoma. The
adenocarcinoma extends into the duodenum and extensively involves the duodenum
as well as the ampulla. In the ampullary section, there is lymphovascular space
invasion beneath the mucosal surface of the ampulla. Extensive perineural
invasion is noted. Sections labeled "2M" of the peripancreatic lymph nodes
demonstrate metastatic adenocarcinoma in two of four lymph nodes. The remaining
lymph node sections, ("2N", "20") are free of adenocarcinoma. There is
metastatic adenocarcinoma in a total of two of thirteen lymph nodes.

COMMENT:

#2 There is marked cautery effect at the retroperitoneal soft tissue surgical
margin, which impairs assessment of this margin. Although this margin is
technically free of adenocarcinoma, I am suspicious that this margin is involved

by adenocarcinoma _
