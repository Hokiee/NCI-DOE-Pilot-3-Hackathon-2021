Diagnosis/ diagnoses:

Right hemicolectomy preparation with tumor-free oral and aboral resection margins and a
hyperplastic polyp in the ascending colon. It also includes an ulcerated, in parts poorly
differentiated adenocarcinoma of the cecum with widespread and deep infiltration of the
perimuscular fatty tissue (G3, pT3).

Follow-up report:

Following acetone clarification, 40 lymph nodes in the pericolic fatty tissue bordering the
tumor were prepared, measuring up to 1.5 cm.

These proved to be microscopically tumor-free throughout.

In conclusion and in summary a stage of pT3 pNO (0/40) L0 V0 R0 is established.
