LYMPH NODES, RIGHT AXILLARY MASS. LYMPHADENECTOMY»
A?" “‘ POORLY DIFFERENTIATED METASTATIC NEOPLASM COMPATIBLE WITH MALIGNANT MELANOMA. INVOLVING

FIVE (5) OUT OF FIFTEEN (15) LYMPH NODES (LARGEST LYMPH MODE 4 CM), WITH EXTENSIVE NECROSIS.
B. EXTRACAPSULAR SPREAD IS OBSERVED.

COMMENT:

Although ﬁfteen lymph nodes are counted, many of the larger masses described may represent multiple now conﬂuent
lymph nodes.

lmrriunohistochemical stains for $100 and NK1-C3 are positive. The neoplasm is negative for Cam 5.2, AE1IAE3,
pankeratin, 0021, CD23, CD34, CK'I. CKZO, Tl’F and ER- Although It is also negative for Melan A, tyrosinase & HMB-45,
those melanocytic markers can be lost' In poorly differentiated melanocytic neoplasms.

Histopathologically, the differential would also include a metastatic peripheral nerve sheath humorII but the remote history
of melanoma favors a melanoma as diagnosis (in conjunction With the stains above).
