Gross Description:
(A) (lymph node) Received in formalin are two fragments of
yellow-tan firm tissue measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm and 1.5 x
0.7 x 0.5 cm. The smaller specimen is inked black and submitted
entirely in A1 along with the larger specimen. which is uninked
and bisected.
(B) (gallbladder) Received in formalin is a previously
unopened 9.4 x 5.0 x 5.0 cm gallbladder. The serosal surfaces
are purple-tan and glistening. The gallbladder has a wall
measuring 0.2 cm. The mucosal surfaces are green and velvety.
The gallbladder contains green bile and four large ﬁrm yellow
stones ranging in size from 1.5 x1.5 x 0.5 cm up to 3.5 x 3.5 x
2.8 cm. A cross-section of the cystic duct and a representative
section of the wall are submitted in 81 along with a section of
a 1.5 cm greatest dimension lymph node candidate.
(C) (liver biopsy) Received in formalin are two tan tissue
cores measuring 0.1 cm in diameter and ranging in length from
0.4 to 2.1 cm. The specimen is submitted entirely in C1.
(D) (liver mass) Received fresh for intraoperative
consultation is a 10.0 x 6.0 x 4.0 cm portion of liver. One
side is cauterized and the capsular surface is gray-tan with a
smooth serosa but a macronodular surface. The resection margin
is inked black. Sectioning through the specimen reveals a
yellow lobulated soft tissue mass measuring 7.0 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm
and appears to abut the surgical resection margin but does not
appear to penetrate through it. Representative sections are
submitted in D1-DS with D1-02 containing tumor to the closest
resection margin. A representative section of grossly
uninvolved liver is submitted in D6.
Microscopic Description:
Complete microscopic evaluation has been performed.

 

Appropriately reacting controls have been performed and
evaluated for all stains on this case as required.
Histopathology has a list of lH antibodies that are regulated as
analyte specific reagents (ASR's). These assays were developed
and their performance characteristics determined by the
Histopathology Laboratory in the I at the
They have not been cleared by the US
Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such
clearance or approval is not necessary for the ASR's. These

tests are not investigational and are used in standard clinical
care. In cases where lmmunohistochemistry testing is performed,
the following antibodies and their respective clones may be used
to determine therapy for the patient: EFGR(31G7), ER(SP1),
PR(1E2). Her2neu(485), CD117(Poly), CDZO(L26).

Unless otherwise stated in the report, all tissue tested for

ERPR by lHC. Her2 by IHC and/or HER2 by FISH have been ﬁxed as
per ANP.22998 for a minimum of 6 hours and a maximum of 48
hours.

ER. PR. Ki-67, p53 are reported as a semi-quantitative
percentage of positively stained nuclei. Her-2/neu and EGFR are
scored as follows: No staining at all is scored as (0), weak,
incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of cells is
scored as (1+), less than strong but complete staining in any
proportion of cells or complete strong staining in less than 30%

of cells is scored as (2+). and strong complete staining in more
that 30% of cells is scored as (3+). All studies are performed

on tissue fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in
paraffin unless otherwise stated in the report.
