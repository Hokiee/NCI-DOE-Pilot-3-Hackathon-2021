PATHOLOGY REPORT

    

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. The specimen consists of a 193 gm, 18.2 x 11.5 x 2.5 cm lobe of
lung displaying a 5.5 cm in length linear staple line superior to the
bronchus. The bronchial resection margin is removed en face and
submitted for frozen section diagnosis and subsequent routine
histology in cassette FsA. The remaining pleural surface is tan—pink
and smooth with a 1.0 x 1.0 cm area of induration and puckering along
the lateral aspect. The area of pleural puckering is inked blue. The
linear staple line is removed, and the underlying parenchyma is inked
black.

Sectioning reveals a 1.6 x 1.6 x 0.8 cm, tan—yellow to white,
granular, poorly demarcated mass underlying the aforementioned area of
pleural puckering and induration. The mass approaches the pleural
surface. The mass is 4.3 cm from the bronchial resection margin, and
3.6 cm from the closest vascular resection margin. The mass is 4.6 cm
from the closest staple line surface.

The remaining lung parenchyma is tan—pink to red and unremarkable. No
areas of congestion, consolidation, or emphysematous change are
grossly appreciated. Sectioning through the peribronchial region
reveals multiple dark black, rubbery, anthracotic lymph nodes.

Representative sections are submitted as follows: Al— vascular
resection margin; A2-A3- entire staple line resection margin en face;
A4—A5- entire mass with overlying pleura and adjacent uninvolved
parenchyma; A6- uninvolved lung parenchyma; A7- peribronchial lymph
nodes.

B. The specimen consists of a 1.6 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm, tan-pink to yellow,
rubbery lymph node that is serially sectioned to reveal a tan—pink to
black, unremarkable cut surface. The lymph node is submitted in its

entirety in cassette E.

C. The specimen consists of a 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm, tan—yellow to black,
rubbery soft tissue which is submitted in total in cassette C.

D. The specimen consists of a 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm, tan—brown to black,
rubbery soft tissue which is submitted in total in cassette D.

E. The specimen consists of two, tan—pink to black, rubbery lymph
nodes averaging 1.2 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. The lymph nodes are submitted in
their entirety-in cassette E.

F. The specimen consists of a 1.3 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm aggregate of
tan-brown, rubbery soft tissue which is submitted in total in cassette
F.

G. The specimen consists of a 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm, tan—brown to black,

rubbery lymph node that is bisected to reveal a dark black anthracotic
cut surface. The lymph node is submitted in its entirety in cassette

G.

H. The specimen consists of a 2.3 x 2.0 x 0.8 cm aggregate of tan—pink
to black, rubbery anthracotic lymph nodes which are submitted in total
in cassettes H1 and H2.

I. The specimen consists of a 2.6 x 2.0 x 0.8 cm aggregate of tan-pink
to black, rubbery anthracotic lymph nodes. The largest lymph node is
bisected to reveal a dark black anthracotic cut surface. Lymph nodes
are submitted in their entirety as follows: Il— multiple whole lymph
nodes; 12— one bisected lymph node. ( )

COMMENT: Immunostains show that the tumor cells are positive for CK7,
TTF—l, focally positive for P63 and negativ efor CKZO. These findings
are consistent with adenocarcinoma.

Immunostain for ALK and molecular studies for EGFR and ALK gene will
be performed. The results will be issued as an addendum report after
completion.
