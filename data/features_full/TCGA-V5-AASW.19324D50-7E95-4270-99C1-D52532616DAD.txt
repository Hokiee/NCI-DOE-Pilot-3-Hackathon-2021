Microscopic: .

A. lrregularly shaped glands, some forming cribiform structures, are

present. whey are lined by atypical cells which show disordered
stratification and a loss of nuclear polarity. Individual malignant cells
have extended beyond the basement membrane into the lamina propria and/or
muscularis mucosa but are not seen to extend into the submucose.

B. Columnarwlined mucosa composed o5 gastric type of surface cells with
intestinal metaplasia characterized by interspersed goblet cells which is
characteristic of the specialized epithelium of Barrett's. Some areas have
glands showing nuclear hyperchromaticity and pseudostratification, with the
nuclei seen extending to the surface of the gland lumen. These changes are
seen to extend onto the surface of the specimen, and there is also
significant glandular crowding. 5o invasive activity is seen.

c. There is a tumor composed of irregularlyushaged sheets of pleomorphic
cells, some showing gland—like structures, which infiltrate she mucosa.
Occasional mncin production is noted. Mitotic activity is brisk and tumor

necrosis is evident.
