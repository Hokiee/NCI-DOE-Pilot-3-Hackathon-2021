Diagnosis:
A: Sentinel lymph node #1, right external iliac, removal
— Two lymph nodes, no tumor seen, based on H & E sections, with
one node showing isolated tumor cells (itc) on immunostain for
pancytokeratin only (AEl/AE3) (0/2 itc+)

B: Sentinel lymph node, right obturator, removal

— One lymph node, no tumor seen, based on evaluation of H & E
slides (O/l)

- Immunostain for pancytokeratin (AEl/AEB) confirms, with a high
background

C: Lymph node, presacral, regional resection
— Five minute lymph nodes, no tumor seen (0/5)

D: Lymph nodes, right pelvic, regional resection
— Ten lymph nodes, no tumor seen (0/10)
E: Lymph nodes, left pelvic, regional resection

Fifteen lymph nodes, no tumor seen (0/15)

F: Lymph nodes, right periaortic, regional resection
— Four lymph nodes, no tumor seen (0/4)

G: Uterus, cervix, parametrium, bilateral tubes, robotically
assisted radical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingectomy

Histologic type: Squamous cell carcinoma
Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated

Tumor site: Cervix, unifocal, involving the entire anterior half
of the cervix

Tumor size (greatest dimension): 3.2 cm (combined measurement of
slides G6 and G7)

Note: This staging information is based on the pathologic
specimen and may be incomplete. A comprehensive review of all

available clinical information is recommended to determine final
staging.

Comment:
Immunostains for the pancytokeratin AEl/AE3 are performed on
blocks A1, A2, and B1, per sentinel lymph node protocol

, with the above findings, with a high contamination
background.

Clinical History:

-year—old female with a clinical diagnosis of cervical cancer
who presents for robotic radical hysterectomy.

Gross Description:
Received are seven appropriately labeled containers.

Container A is additionally labeled "right external iliac
sentinel lymph node #1 ." It holds a 3.2 x 1.5 x
0.5 cm tan/pink lymph node candidate. The lymph node candidate

is serially sectioned at close intervals and submitted in
blocks A1 and A2,

Container B is additionally labeled "right obturator sentinel
lymph node ." It holds a 1.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm lymph
node which is bisected and submitted in block Bl,

Container C is additionally labeled "presacral lymph node." It
holds a 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm fragment of tan/pink fibrous tissue.
No lymph node is palpated. Tissue is submitted in blocks C1—C2,

Container D is additionally labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes."
It holds multiple fragments of yellow fibrofatty tissue, 3.5 x
3.5 x 2.2 cm in aggregate. Palpated within the tissue are
multiple lymph nodes, the largest is 1.5 cm.

tissue. Within the tissue there are multiple lymph node
candidates, the largest is 3.0 cm.
