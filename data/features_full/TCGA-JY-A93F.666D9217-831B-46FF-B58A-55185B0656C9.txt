w Surgical Pathology Consultation Report I A...

Mass 1: There is a tan ulcerated ill-deﬁned mass on the esophageal mucosa measuring 4.8 cm in length and 3.0-cm in
diameter. The mass occupies 75% of the circumference of the esophagus and there is a cobblestoned esophageal

mucosa continuous with the mass that extends over an area of 6.5-cm. Sectioning of the mass reveals a thickness of
1.2—cm.

The mass approaches the margins as follows:
Proximal: 1.3 cm

Distal: 9.4 cm

Painted esophageal external surface: 0.2

Mass 2: There is a tan friable massjust proximal to the GE junction measuring 1.7-cm in length by 1.6-cm in diameter.
The mass occupies 50% of the circumference of the esophagus and there is approximately 0.7-cm of unremarkable
esophageal mucosa separating the two mass lesions. Sectioning of the mass reveals a thickness of 0.6-cm.

The mass approaches the margins as follows:
Proximal: 10—cm

Distal: 4.3-cm

Painted esophageal external surface: 0.6—cm

;

Polyp: There is a tan polyp adjacent to the distal gastric excision margin measuring 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm.

- PERFORATION: No perforations are grossly identiﬁed

ESTIMATED DEPTH OF lNVASlON: Mass 1 appears to invade through the muscularls but Mass 2 does not invade
through the muscularis.

LESIONS lN NONCANCEROUS STOMACH: No other lesions are grossly identified

LYMPH NODES: There is little to no appreciable periesophageal and perigastric fat grossly identiﬁed and no lymph nodes
can be grossly identified.

The proximal esophageal excision margin is submitted for intraoperative consult and further submitted for permanent
processing.
