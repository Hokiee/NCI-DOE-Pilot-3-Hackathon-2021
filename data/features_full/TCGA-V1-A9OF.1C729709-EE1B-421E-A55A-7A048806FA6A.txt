The patient is a with history of prostate cancer by core biopsy, Gleason grade 3+3 = 6,
clinical stage T1cNXMO. The patient undergoes robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.

Gross Description .

The specimen is received fresh in one part labeled with the patient's name, unit number and "prostate
and BSV." it consists of a single intact prostate gland with attached seminal vesicle/vas deferens
bundles, which on out section reveals a suspicious area of yellow-gold, lobulated tissue just anterior to
the urethral channel in serial slices 1 and 2, as well as a solid, white-tan tumor nodule in the right
lateral aspect of serial slices 3 and 4. The specimen weighs 37 grams and measures 3.5 cm from apex
to base, 4 cm from medial to lateral and 3.5 cm from anterior to posterior. The external surface is
relatively smooth, red-tan and glistening. The bladder margin demonstrates extensive cautery. The
dorsal vein complex is closed with the use of a single suture. The seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundles
are soft, red-tan and whorled, without obvious lesion or mass. The right anterior resection margin is
inked green. The left anterior resection margin is inked blue. The posterior resection margin is inked
black. An incision is made in the posterior surface between apex and midgland, with tissue being
banked for research purposes. The incision is glued shut, and the specimen is ﬁxed prior to'further
sectioning. Following fixation, the bladder margin is removed, and the remainder of the gland is serially
sectioned from apex to base perpendicular to the urethral channel into eight serial slices. The slices
reveal a 1.1 cm foci of bright yellow—gold, slightly lobulated tissue just anterior to the urethral channel
in serial slices 1 and 2. Additionally, there is a solid, white-tan, 1.2-cm lesion in the right lateral aspect
of serial slices 3 and 4. This lesion grossly abuts the lateral to posterior inked Surgical margin. The
central-transition zone is of normal size and appearance and composed of ﬁrm, white-tan, striated and
nodular tissue. The peripheral zone, making up approximately two-thirds of total gland volume, is
composed of softer, semiporous, light tan tissue where unaffected by tumor. The apical and bladder

margin, as well as representative sections of the prostate and seminal vesicles, are submitted as
follows:
