*****GROSS DESCRIPTION:‘**** E

The specimens are received in four properly labeled containers, two of
which are frozen sections, with the patient' 5 name and accession number.
i
A. The specimen is designated "prethyroid node cancer?" and
consists of a 1.1 x 0.8 x 0.5 on aggregate of tah—red soft tissue
fragments. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section and
resubmitted as received in cassette AFl. TE 1

B. The specimen is designated "thyroid gland vs. muscle?" and
consists of a 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm portion of red-brown soft tissue. The
specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section and resubmitted as

. . 1
received in cassette BFl. TE 1

C. The specimen is designated "right thytoid lobe" and consists of
a 2.2 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm aggregate of multiple portions of shaggy tan—red soft
tissue. TE 1 j

D. The specimen is designated "thyroid gland, one Stitchnright
superior pole, two stitches=right inferior pole, three stitches=left
superior pole" and consists of a 21.2 gram thyrohd gland that is 6.5 x 4.5
x 2.3 cm. The right lobe is markedly larger than the left. The capsular
surface is tan~red and intact with no adherent pobsible lymph nodes or
parathyroid glands identified. The left lobe displays a focal area of
disruption. The thyroid gland is inked as followsh right lobe=blue, left
lobe=black, isthmus=green. The specimen is seriaLly sectioned revealing a
3.3 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm well circumscribed tan-red coﬂrsely granular mass with
focal areas of yellow flecks replacing the entire right lobe of the
thyroid, and diffusely abuts the blue inked capsdlar surface. The isthmus
and left lobes are grossly uninvolved by the mass The uninvolved thyroid
parenchyma is dark red to brown and glistening. g %

Summary of Cassettes: D1-5, representative sections of mass involving
right thyroid lobe; 06, representative section oﬁ isthmus; D7—8,
representative sections of left thyroid lobe with focal area of disruption
