The examination of this case material and the preparation of this report were
performed by the staff pathologist.

Note:

A section taken from the renal vein at the resection margin shows the tumor
thrombus. The thrombus is adherent to the vein wall at this point and this is
considered to represent a positive surgical margin.

Gross Description:
Received is a single formalin filled container labeled with the patient's name
and additionally labeled "left radical nephrectomy and caval
thrombus with hilar and retroperitoneal lymph nodes."
Specimen components and dimensions: The specimen consists of the product of a
left radical nephrectomy with left kidney, left renal pelvis and a part of the
left renal vein. There is an abundant amount of perinephric fat attached that
contains the left adrenal gland. The specimen has been previously opened to
reveal the tumor. The specimen aggregately measures 25 x 19 x 7 cm in greatest
dimension. The renal parenchyma measures 115 x 9 x 5.4 cm in greatest
dimension. The ureter is attached and measures 12.2 cm in length and 0.3 cm in
diameter. The adrenal gland measures 8 x 4.5 x 1.4 cm in greatest dimension and
weighs 20.3 9.
Size, appearance, and location of tumor: The tumor is pink-tan to brown in
color with hemorrhagic areas. It has a variegated surface and almost entirely
replaces the renal parenchyma. it measures 11 x 6.5 x 4.5 cm in greatest
dimension. The tumor involves the renal sinus. the renal sinus fat and the renal
pelvis grossly and extends into the renal vein with a protruding thrombus
measuring 6.5 cm in length beyond the renal vein margin.
Renal capsule/renal sinus: The renal sinus is completely replaced by the tumor
mass. The tumor approaches the renal capsule, however no invasion is grossly
identified. The renal capsule strips with ease.
Renal vein: The renal vein is occluded by the tumor mass, thrombus. The tumor
thrombus extends beyond the renal vein margin by 7 cm.
Lymph nodes (size, number, & location): The perihilar fat has been dissected
for lymph nodes with at least eight lymph nodes identified grossly. The rest of
the fat is placed in a clearing agent.
Other findings: There is a cortical cyst near the lower pole measuring 4.5 x
2.2 x 2.4 cm in greatest dimension. The normal renal parenchyma has a cortical
thickness of 0.5 cm.
