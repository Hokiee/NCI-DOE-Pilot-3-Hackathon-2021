Diagnosis:

Right hemicolectomy preparation with an ulcerated colon carcinoma characterized
histologically as a poorly differentiated, partially mucinous adenocarcinoma of the
colorectal type, located 0.5 cm aborally to Bauhinâ€™s valve and encircling the intestinal wall
at a length of 5 cm. Invasive spreading of the tumor within all intestinal wall layers up to
the bordering mesocolic fatty tissue and the level of the subserosa.

Oral and aboral resection margins are tumor-free.

Three of nineteen lymph nodes display metastasis of the colon carcinoma, not extending
across the capsules.

Stage of tumor is therefore: pT3, le (3/19) L0 V0; G3 R0
