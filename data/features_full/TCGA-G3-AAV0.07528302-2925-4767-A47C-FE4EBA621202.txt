Gross Description

Received is a single specimen container Th“ "—quisition and specimen container are
labelled with the patient's name, _ The cassette and identifiers are
labelled with the Surgical Number

The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The container
is designated liver segment 6 and 7. The specimen consists of a wedge-shaped piece of
liver which measures 12.5 x 7.5 x 5.5 cm. The capsule has a nodular appearance and shows
peritoneal adhesions. The resection margin is painted black. The specimen is serially

sectioned. The liver parenchyma underneath the nodular adhesion shows a circumscribed
yellow tan single tumor which measures 5.5 x S x S cm. Sections:

A1. representative section of grossly normal liver parenchyma
A2-4. tumor with overlying capsule

A5-7. tumor

A8.

A9. tumor and closest resection margin

The closest margin is 1 cm from the tumor.

Microscopic Description

Sections of the grossly described tumor show moderately differentiated hepatocellular
carcinoma which is confined within the liver capsule. The tumor shows clear cell change
in many of the sections. Intracellular and canalicular bile pigment is noted in the
neoplastic tissue. The resection margin is uninvolved. The surrounding liver parenchyma
has a normal architecture and shows no significant histologic abnormalities. Special

stain for iron shows iron overload (2+) and special stain for alphal—antitrypsin globule
is negative.
