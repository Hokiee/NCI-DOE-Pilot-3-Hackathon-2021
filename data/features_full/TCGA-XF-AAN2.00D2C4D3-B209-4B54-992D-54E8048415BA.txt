E: The specimen is received fresh from the 0.R. and labeled "Bladder/prostate".

It consists of a radical cystoprostatectomy specimen measuring 29.5 x 11 x 3.4 cm.
A flap of peritoneal fat is present measuring 27.5 x 1116 by less than 0.1 cm. The
peritoneal surface is smooth and glistening. The bladder itself measures 6.2 x 5 x
3.6 cm. The resection margin and prostate are inked black with red ink
superimposed on the right side. The bladder is then opened along the anterior
prostatic urethra and bladder wall. The uninvolved bladder wall measures 1.1 cm in
thickness. Opening the bladder reveals an ulcerated mass lesion abutting the right
ureterovesical junction. The lesion measures 3 x 2.5 x 1.6 cm. The mass extends
into the deep muscle of the bladder wall but does not penetrate the surrounding
soft tissue grossly. It extends into the ureterovesical junction over a distance

It consists of a single segment of adipose tissue measuring 1. 6 x 1 x 0.4 cm.
Entirely submitted in one cassette.

0: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled “Left obturator/hypogastric
lymph nodes". It consists of multiple fragments of adipose tissue measuring 9. 2 x
4. 6 x 1. 2 cm in aggregate. Entirely submitted in nine cassettes.

INTRAOPERATIVE FROZEN CONSULTATION:
AFS: Right distal ureter:
- no high grade atypia or tumor identified

BFS: Left distal ureter:
- no high grade atypia or tumor identified

CPS: Right external iliac lymph node:
— benign

DFS: Urethral margin:
— no high grade atypia or tumor identified

K MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

A—D: See final microscopic-diagnosis.

E: Sections of the bladder show high grade invasive urothelial carcinoma (El—3,
5-7), grades 3 and 4/4, extending into the deep muscularis propria. The tumor
approaches without involving perivesical soft tissue. Lymphovascular space
invasion is not identified. Additional random sections of the bladder show no
urothelial dysplasia or malignancy. All resection margins are free of both
dysplasia and malignancy. Sections of the prostate show prostatic adenocarcinoma
[El6,18,19,23), Gleason's score 6 (3+3). The tumor is confined to the prostate.
There are multiple foci of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN II
and III) present. The seminal vesicles and all resection margins are free of
malignancy and urothelial dysplasia.

F-U: See final microscopic -diagnosis.
