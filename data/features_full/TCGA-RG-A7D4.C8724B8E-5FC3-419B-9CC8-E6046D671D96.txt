CLINICAL INFORMAIION:
Liver Cancer

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

1. The specimen is received fresh for intraoperative consult labeled
“central hepatectomy'. It consists of a 57 g, 7.0 x 4.4 x 2.8 cm
wedge-shaped piece of liver. The capsule is smooth and glistening. The
parenchymal margin is inked black. Sectioning reveals a
well-circumscribed, nodular, tan tumor, measuring 2.3 x 2.4 x 2.2 cm and
located 0.1 cm from the capsule and 0.2 cm from the parenchymal margin.
The surrounding liver psrenchyma is tan and grossly unremarkable with
cauterized areas. Representative sections are submitted as follows;
IAPSC: Liver tumor with parenchymal margin, frozen
18-13: Additional sections of liver tumor with parenchymal margin and
capsule

1F: Grossly uninvolved liver

INTRAQPERATIVE CONSULT:

— Focally tumor is l to 2 mm to inked parenchymal margin.

2. The specimen is received fresh and labeled “Gallbladder" and consists of
a previously cut gallbladder, measuring 6.6 x 3.0 x 1.2 cm. The screen is
tan-pink with fibrous adhesion. Sectioning reveals a minimal amount of bile
and a 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm black calculus. The mucosa is erythematous with
minimal focal yellow flecks. The wall measures up to 0.3 cm thick. The
proximal portion of the cystic duct is identified and contains no stones in
its lumen, which measures up to 0.2 cm in diamEter. There are two firm
lymph nodes adjacent to the cystic duct and measuring 1.4 x 0.5 x 0.6 cm
and 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm. Sections are submitted as follows:

2A: inked shaved cystic duct margin and sections of gallbladder

23: Two bisected lymph nodes (differentially inked black and blue)
