GROSS DESCR lPTlON:

A. Received fresh, the specimen is labeled "apical margin" and
consists of a 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm piece of red—tan soft tissue.
The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis.
Summary of sections: AFSC.

B. Received fresh, the-specimen is labeled "prostate glands and
seminal vesicleS", and consists of a 62.4 gram radical
prostatectomy specimen including a 6.5 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm prostate, a
3.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm left seminal vesicle, a 2.0 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm
left vas deferens, a 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm right seminal vesicle
and a 3.0 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm right vas deferens. The right side of
the specimen is inked green and the left side is inked black.
The seminal vesicle base, bladder neck and apical margins are
shaved and submitted. The prostate is serially sectioned from
the apex to base with sections designated from A to B
respectively. On sectioning, multiple nodular and cystic areas
are seen. The prostate is submitted alternative sections.

DIAGNOSIS:

A. Apical margin (biopsy):
Benign fibromuscular tissue and nerve.
No prostatic glands or carcinoma seen.

B. Prostate, seminal vesicles and vas deferens (radical
prostatectomy):

Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 9(4+5),
tertiary 3 (as per unilateral, with
multifocal extra~prostatic extension.

There is preferential perineural invasion.

Seminal vesicles and inked surgical margins are
negative for carcinoma.

Please see synoptic summary.

 

C. Pelvic lymph nodes (excision):
Ten lymph nodes negative for metastatic carcinoma
(0/10)-

D. Anterior fat (biopsy):
Benign fibroadipose tissue.
No carcinoma seen.
