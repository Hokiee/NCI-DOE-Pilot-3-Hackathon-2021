FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS
A. Breast, right, modified radical mastectomy:
- Invasive ductal carcinoma, grade III/Ill, 5.0 cm in greatest dimension,
present 1.0 mm from posterior inked surgical margin, other margins widely free
(see pathologic parameters and comment below)
- Ductal carcinoma in-situ, high grade, solid type with associated central
necrosis and calcifications, surgical margins negative
- Previous biopsy site identified

9. pTNM (AJCC, 7th edition, 2010): pT2, Nla, MX

Clinical History:
The patient is 3 year-old female with right breast invasive ductal carcinoma

with axillary nodal metastases who undergoes right modified radical mastectomy.

Comment
The 5.0 cm mass identified on gross examination is comprised of both invasive

and in-situ carcinoma with extensive necrosis and calcifications.

Specimens Received:

A: Right breast and axillary contents

B: Additional deep margin

C: Additional tissue under superiomedial skin flap

D: Skin at corner of incision; r chest wall

Gross Description:
The specimens are received in four containers each labeled with the patient's

name and medical record number.

A. The first container is additionally identified as, 'right breast and
axillary contents'. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 730 g simple
mastectomy specimen. The specimen is oriented with a double short suture

designating the superior aspect and a double long suture designating the lateral

aspect. The breast measures 23 cm from medial to lateral, 21 cm from superior
to inferior, and 4.5 cm from anterior to posterior. On the anterior surface is

20 x 8.5 cm ellipse of skin with a 4.2 x 4.0 cm areola and a 1.3 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm
nipple. The nipple-areolar complex reveals no evidence of ulceration or
retraction. There is an attached 6.5 x 5.5 x 1.5 cm portion of apparent axillary
tail on the lateral aspect of the specimen. There is an attached 4.5 x 1.8 x 0.2
cm skeletal muscle consisting of pectoralis at the deep margin at junction of
upper-outer quadrant and lower-outer quadrant in slice3-5. The specimen is

inked as follows:

anterior—superior - blue;
anterior-inferior - green;

posterior - black.

The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral (slice #1) to medial (slice #11)

to reveal a 5.0 x 3.8 x 3.5 cm pink-tan, firm mass (lesion #1) extending from
upper-outer quadrant to lower-outer quadrant in slices 3-7. The mass is 1.6 cm
from the anterior-inferior margin and abuts the posterior margin. Surrounding

the mass is a 10 x 7 x 4 cm ill-defined, pink area composing of dilated ducts

and fibrotic tissue in slices 4-9 and the most prominent in slice 7-8. The

ill-defined area (lesion #2) extends towards anterior aspect and is 0.6 cm from

the closest anterior margin and 2.0 cm from the closest posterior margin. The
remainder of the specimen consists of approximately 10% dense gray~white fibrous
breast parenchyma and 90% lobulated yellow adipose tissue. No additional masses

or nodules are grossly identified. Within the axillary tail are identified

several lymph node candidates measuring from 0.3-2.5 cm in greatest dimension.

B. The second container is additionally identified as, 'additional deep margin;
underlying palpable tumor '. Received in formalin is a 3.9 g, 4.2 x 2.2 x 0.8 cm
yellow-tan, soft tissue fragment with one short stitch designating as new true
deep margin (inked blue) and attached clips on original margin (inked black).

The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted as 81-35.

C. The third container is additionally identified as, 'additional tissue under
superiomedial skin flap'. Received in formalin is an unoriented 2.3 g, 4.8 x 1.2
x 1.1 cm portion of yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue, which is serially sectioned

and entirely submitted C1-C2.

D. The fourth container is additionally identified as, 'skin at corner of

incision; right chest wall'. Received fresh and placed in formalin is an

unoriented V-shaped ellipse of wrinkled, tan-brown skin measuring 4.5 x 1.5 cm
adjunct with 3.2 x 1.5 cm excised to a depth of 1.3 cm. The specimen is serial
sectioned and review grossly unremarkable parenchyma. The representative section

is submitted as 01.

Tissue fixed for at least 6 hours in 10% NBF and no more than 72 hours.
