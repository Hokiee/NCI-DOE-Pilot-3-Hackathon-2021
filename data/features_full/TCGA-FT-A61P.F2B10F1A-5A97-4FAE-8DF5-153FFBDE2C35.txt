2 One lymph node in toto

3 Three lymph nodes in toto

E. Received in formalin and labeled "Internal iliac lymph node left side" is a fragment
of ﬁbroadipose tissue that measures 3.4 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm. No lymph nodes are grossly
identiﬁed. Specimen submitted in three cassettes.

F. Received in formalin and labeled "Common iliac lymph node left side" are three
fragments of ﬁbroadipose tissue that measures in aggregate 2.7 x 2.0 x 0.7 cm. Two
possible lymph nodes were grossly identiﬁed. The largest one measures 1.4 cm in
greatest dimension. Sections submitted as follows:

lOne possible lymph node

2 One possible lymph node

G. Received in formalin and labeled "External iliac lymph node left side #2" is a
fragment of ﬁbroadipose tissue that measures 3.1 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm. One lymph node was
grossly identiﬁed measuring 1.9 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm. Submitted in toto in two cassettes.

4.0 x 3.0 cm), right ureter (0.2 cm in length x 0.2 cm in diameter) and left ureter

(0.2 cm in length x 0.2 cm in diameter). The outer surface of the bladder is smooth
with yellow and perivesicle soft tissue attached and it is inked in black. The bladder
is opened anteriorly through the urethra and the incision is extended to the dome. A
(3.0 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm) tan pink mass is located in the posterior left lateral wall of

the bladder. The mass is ulcerated and ﬁrm. The mass is extending into the
perivesicle soft tissue and is at 0.2 cm away from the deep margin (inked black).
The mass is 1.0 cm away from the left ureteral oriﬁce and 3.0 cm away from the right
ureteral oriﬁce. The prostate is inked on its outer surface and serially sectioned
through the posterior surface perpendicular to prostatic urethra. The parenchyma is
white and yellow, no lesion is grossly identiﬁed. The right side of the prostate is
inked in green and the left side is inked in black. The right seminal vesicle measures
2.7 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm and the left seminal vesicle measures 3.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. The right
vas deferens measures 10.5 x 0.2cm and the left vas deferens measures 8.5 x 0.2 cm.
Perivesical soft tissue is thinly sectioned and no lymph nodes are identiﬁed.

Cassette#l: Left uretheral oriﬁce in relation to tumor

Cassette#2: Right uretheral oriﬁce in relation to bladder

Cassette#3—4: Deepest extent of tumor invasion including deep margin
Cassette#5-6: Additional sections of tumor with deep margin

ﬁbroadipose tissue that measures 7.1 x 3.0 x 1.2 cm. One possible lymph node was
grossly identiﬁed that measures 4.0 cm in greatest dimension. Sections submitted as
follows:

1&2 One lymph node bisected submitted in toto

L. Received in formalin and labeled "Internal iliac lymph node" is a fragment of
ﬁbroadipose tissue that measures 3.9 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm. Three possible lymph nodes are
identiﬁed. The largest one measures 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. Sections submitted
as follows:

1 One lymph node bisected submitted in toto

2 Two lymph nodes submitted in toto
