FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS

A. Prostate and seminal vesicles, prostatectomy:

— Prostate: Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason grade 3+4 (+5) (score = 7)
with focal extraprostatic extension and a positive margin at the left apex; see
comment.

- Right seminal vesicle: Prostatic adenocarcinoma growing around seminal
vesicle and extending very near to the inked surfaces.

- Left seminal vesicle: Prostatic adenocarcinoma growing around seminal
vesicle and extending very near to the inked surfaces.

8. Anterior bladder neck, biopsy: Benign muscle and fibroadipose tissue, no
evidence of carcinoma.

COMMENT:

Synoptic Comment for Prostate Tumors

1. Type of tumor: Small acinar adenocarcinoma.

2. Location of tumor: Left posterior apex (slide A2), left posterior mid gland (slides Ala-A13), left

anterior apex (slide A2), left anterior mid gland (slides A14-A16), right posterior mid gland (slides

A6-A9), right anterior mid gland (slides A3~A5), right seminal vesicle (slide A19), left seminal vesicle

(slide A20).

3. Estimated volume of tumor: 4.2 cubic cm.

4. Gleason score: 3+4, primary pattern 3, secondary pattern 4.
Note that there is a small component of Gleason pattern 5 scattered throughout the prostate,
most notably in the right posterior mid gland (slide A8) and the left posterior mld gland (slide
A12).

5. Estimated volume > Gleason pattern 3: 40%.

6. Involvement of capsule: Tumor invades capsule, right posterior mid gland, (slide A7), left posterior

mid gland (slide A11).

7. Extraprostatlc extension: Extraprostatlc extension present, limited in extent (left seminal vesicle

prostatlc junction, slide A20).

8. Status of excision margins for tumor: Tumor extends to inked excision margins, left apex (slide

A2); and tumor extends very close to the bilateral posterior seminal vesicle margins (slides A19 and
A20).

Status of excision margins for benign prostate glands: Benign glands present at inked excision
margins (right and left bladder margins, slides A17 and A18).
9. Involvement of seminal vesicle: Present, both sides (slides A19 and A20).
10. Perineural inﬁltration: Present, extensive.
11. Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasla (PIN): Present, extensive.
12. AJCC/UICC stage: pT3bNXMX.
13. Additional comments: The prostatlc adenocarcinoma in this case consists predominantly of Gleason
patterns 3 and 4 with focal areas of grade 5 present. The prostate is extensively involved,
adenocarcinoma is present in all histologic sections examined except the right apex and bladder
margins. Tumor extends to the left apical margin and tumor involves the seminal vesicles, bilaterally.
In addition, there is a focus of iymphovascular invasion in the right posterior mid gland (slide A13).

BzAnterior bladder neck

Clinical History
The patient is a—man with a history of bilateral prostate cancer, Gleason grade 3+4=7

who now undergoes robotic-assisted Iaparoscopic total prostatectomy. Per the operative
note, there is no lymph node tissue, or fatty tissue in the obturator fossa or overlying external iliac
veins, so a lymph node dissection is not performed.

Gross Description
The specimen is received in two parts, each labeled with the patient‘s name and medical record number.

Part A, received fresh and labeled “prostate and seminal vesicles,“ consists of a 29 gm radical
prostatectomy specimen measuring 3.1 cm from superior to inferior, 4.5 cm from medial to lateral, and
2.4 cm from anterior to posterior, containing an unremarkable left seminal vesicle (3.0 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm),
right seminal vesicle (3.0 x 1.7 x 0.9 cm), left vas deferens (2.5 x 0.6 cm), and right vas deferens (2.3
x 0.6 cm). A portion of the tumor is taken for tissue banking purposes from the left and right posterior
mid gland. The specimen is then glued together and is ﬁxed overnight. After ﬁxation, the apex and
base urethral margins are removed, and the specimen is transversely sectioned from apex to base into
eight slices. There are suspicious tan~whlte nodules in the left posterior mid gland (slice 4) and the left
and right posterior mid glands (slice 6). The nodules do not appear to involve the seminal vesicles, and
do not involve any of the specimen margins. The surface of the prostate gland is somewhat roughened
and contains numerous metal surgical clips. The left prostate is inked blue, the right green, and the
deep, black. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Apical margins

Cassette A1: Right apex, 12 - 6 o'clock, radially sectioned and entirely submitted.
Cassette A2: Left apex, 12 - 6 o'clock, radially sectioned and entirely submitted.
Right anterior quadrant

Cassette A4: Serial slice 4.

Cassette AS: Serial slice 6.

Right posterior quadrant

Cassette A9: Serial slice 8.

Left posterior quadrant

Bladder margins

Cassette A18: Left bladder margin, bread-loafed and entirely submitted.
Prostatic/seminal vesicle junction

Cassette A19: Right seminal vesicle and cross-section of vas deferens.
Cassette A20: Left seminal vesicle and cross-section of vas deferens.

Part B, received in formalin and labeled “anterior bladder neck,“ consists of three pieces of cauterlzed,
unoriented, tan-brown soft tissue measuring 3.1 x 2.9 x 0.7 cm in aggregate. The unoriented pieces
are inked black, sectioned, and entirely submitted in cassettes Bl-BZ.

Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. Final diagnosis made by attending pathologist
following review of all pathology slides.
