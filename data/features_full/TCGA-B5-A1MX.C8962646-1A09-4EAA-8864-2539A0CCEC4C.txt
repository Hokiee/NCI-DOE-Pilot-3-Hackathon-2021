CLINICAL HISTORY:
Endometrial hyperplasia with atypia.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Uterus", received unfixed for frozen section and placed in formalin at

_ on ‘ is a 3 X 2.5 x 0.5 cm fragment of white-tan tissue,
partially frozen as AFl. The frozen section remnant is submitted in block Al,
and the remainder of the specimen is submitted in block A2.

B. "Uterus and cervix", received unfixed and placed in formalin at , on
is a 260 gram, 11.5 X 6.5 X 4 cm uterus demonstrating a smooth,
glistening unremarkable cervix (specimen is received opened). The endometrium

(5.8 x 5 cm) demonstrates a diffuse, exophytic, friable, tan—white tumor that
is involving the majority of the endometrial cavity (>90%). The tumor is 4 cm
from the anterior cervix, and 4.5 cm from the posterior cervix. The mass
extends 4.5 cm deep into the myometrium (4.5 cm thick), and abuts the serosa
without invading beyond the serosa. On cut section, the mass demonstrates a
fleshy, tan-yellow appearance with focal hemorrhage and necrosis. Within the
anterior endometrium, there is a small area of possibly uninvolved endometrium
(0.5 x 0.5 cm). Apart from the mass, no other abnormalities are seen within
the myometrium.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

 

Bl— anterior cervix

B2— posterior cervix

BS- mass abutting serosa

B4-lO- mass

811— possibly uninvolved endometrium

C. "Left pelvic lymph nodes", received unfixed and placed in formalin at

on is a 3.5 x 2.7 x 1.5 cm aggregate of fibroadipose tissue,
demonstrating two lymph node candidates, up to 1.8 cm in greatest dimension.
One lymph node candidate is bisected and submitted in block Cl, one lymph node
candidate is submitted in block C2, and the remainder of the specimen is
submitted in block C3.

D. "Right pelvic lymph nodes", received unfixed and placed in formalin at

on is a 4 X 3 X 1 cm aggregate of fibroadipose tissue
demonstrating two lymph node candidates, up to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension.
One lymph node candidate is bisected and submitted entirely in block DI, the
second lymph node candidate is bisected and submitted in block D2. The
remainder of the specimen is submitted in block D3-4.

E. "Right obturator", received unfixed and placed in formalin at on

is a 2.5 x l x 1 cm aggregate of fibroadipose tissue demonstrating
three lymph node candidates, one lymph node candidate is bisected and
submitted in block E1. One lymph node candidate is bisected and submitted in
E2, and one lymph node candidate is bisected and submitted in E3 (entire
specimen is submitted).

F. "Riaht aortic node", received unfixed and placed in formalin at vn
is a 1.5 x l X 0.5 cm fragment of tan—pink tissue, which is bisected
and submitted in block Fl.

G. "Left r‘bturator node", received unfixed and placed in formalin at
on . is a 2 x 2 x 0.5 cm aggregate of fibroadipose tissue demonstrating

two lymph node candidates, up to 2.4 cm in greatest dimension. One lymph node
candidates is trisected and submitted in block G1, and the other lymph node
candidate is bisected and submitted in block G2 (the entire specimen is
submitted).

H. "Left and right tubes and ovaries", received unfixed and placed in formalin
at on is a 52 gram, bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy specimen
with no orientation. One ovary (4 x 2 x 1 cm) demonstrates an unremarkable
white-tan, lobulated serosa, and an unremarkable, white-tan cut surface. The
attached fimbriated fallopian tube (3.5 X 0.5 cm) demonstrates an interrupted
lumen consistent with previous tubal ligation. The second ovary (3.3 x 2 x 1
cm) demonstrates a pink-tan, lobulated serosa, and a pink-tan cut surface
demonstrating a 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm hemorrhagic cyst. The attached fimbriated
fallopian tube (4.5 x 0.5 cm) demonstrates an interrupted lumen consistent
with previous tubal ligation, and is otherwise unremarkable. Representative
sections of the first described tube and ovary are submitted in block H1, and
sections of the second ovary and fallopian tube are submitted in block H2.

I. "Left aortic nodes", received unfixed and placed in formalin at on
is a 1.5 x 0.5 X 0.5 cm fragment of tan tissue, which is bisected and
submitted entirely in block 11.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:

A. "Uterus": AF1~ (representative)- high-grade carcinoma, extending through
the entire thickness of the representative section. Dr.
concurs (Dr. ).

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: TOTAL VAGINAL HYSTERECTOMY
PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 7th Edition): ple pNO pMX
NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.
DIAGNOSIS:
A. UTERUS (TOTAL VAGINAL HYSTERECTOMY):

ENDOMETRIAL ENDOMETRIQID ADENOCARCINOMA (FIGO GRADE 3). SEE NOTE.

CARCINOMA INVADES FULL THICKNESS OF MYOMETRIUM.

BACKGROUND WITH COMPLEX ATYPICAL HYPERPLASIA.
B. UTERUS AND CERVIX (TOTAL VAGINAL HYSTERECTOMY):

CARCINOMA OF THE ENDOMETRIUM:

TUMOR SITE: DIFFUSE ENDOMETRIAL INVOLVEMENT.

HISTOLOGIC TYPE: ENDOMETRIOID ADENOCARCINOMA. SEE NOTE.

FIGO GRADE: 3.

— 2...

TUMOR SIZE: 5.8 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION.

MAXIMUM DEPTH OF MYOMETRIAL INVASION: 4.5 CM, IN A 4.5 CM THICK WALL.
LYMPHATIC/VASCULAR INVASION: PRESENT.

ADJACENT NON-NEOPLASTIC ENDOMETRIUM WITH COMPLEX ATYPICAL HYPERPLASIA.

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS: CERVIX WITH NO DIAGNOSTIC ABNORMALITY.
THE TUMOR ABUTS THE SEROSAL SURFACE.

SPECIMEN MARGINS ARE NOT INVOLVED.

NOTE: Microscopic examination demonstrates a poorly differentiated
carcinoma with a predominant (>80%) solid growth pattern, extensive
areas of necrosis and focal pseudorosette/pseudoglandular formation.
A histochemical stain for mucicarmine was negative. Additionally,
immunohistochemical stains were performed and show positive
immunolabeling of tumor cells for EMA (strong/diffuse), CK7 (focal),
and CD99 (focal/patchy), while negative immunoreactivity for
chromogranin and synaptophysin. Morphologically, the differential
diagnosis would include an undifferentiated carcinoma, a PNET or a
high grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma (FIGO 3). The diffuse EMA
positivity supports the latter diagnosis.
