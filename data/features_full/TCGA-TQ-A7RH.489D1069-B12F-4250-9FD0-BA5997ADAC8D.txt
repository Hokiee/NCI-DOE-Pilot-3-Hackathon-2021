Nature of material: Brain 781-: A105

Received on: C7! ‘7
1014/1

Macroscopy: 94‘) 5

Received ﬁve irregular structures of the brain, the largest measuring 5.5 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm,
partially covered by meninge and presenting on the outer surface a jelly, brown and
irregular lesion. Smaller structures together measure 3.0 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm.

Microscopy:

Histological sections stained with H & E sections show diffuse glial neoplasm with
moderate and polymorphic cellularity, consisting sometimes of cells with clear
cytoplasm that exhibit perinuclear halo, sometimes by cells with elongated nuclei, dense
chromatin and eosinophilic cytoplasm. The nuclei show moderate pleomorphism.
Examination shows multiple cells with minigemistocistic aspect and sattelitosis of
neoplastic cells in cortical neurons. A few areas of the neoplasm presents with dense
cellularity. with sparse mitotic ﬁgures and steeper nuclear atypia, but no foci of
microvascular proliferation. In these areas the CPI Ki-67 is about 5%. It is also
observed, focal deposits of hemosiderin. Not observed foci of necrosis in the tumor. In
areas of astrocytic pattern, there is overexpression of p53. The tumor shows
predominant oligodendroglial pattern.

Diagnosis:

Resection product of brain lesion: Oligoastrocitoma with diffuse anaplastic foci, WHO
grade II (ICD-O 9382/3)

Notes:

There are no criteria for grade III, although the greater CPI Ki-67 in some areas

associated with nuclear atypia are highly suggestive of malignancy progression to
higher degree of malignancy.
