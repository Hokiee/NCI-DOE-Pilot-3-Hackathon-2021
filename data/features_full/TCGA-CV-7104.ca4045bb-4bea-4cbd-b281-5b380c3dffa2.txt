GROSS DESCRIPTION . _ ,
(A) NASAL PHARYNGECTOMY, PARTIAL PHARYNGECTOMY, LEFT NECK DISSECTION, TOTAL
GLOSSECTOMY, LEFT MANDIBULECTOMY — A 17.5 x 10.4 x 6.2 cm specimen consisting
of tongue (6.1 x 4.6 x 3.7 cm), left pharynx (3.5 x 2.6 cm), left mandible
(8.5 x 5.2 x 1.8 cm), and left neck contents (15.0 x 7.7 x 1.7 cm). According
to the surgeon, the left neck contents corresponds to levels I—V.

Present in the area of the ieft tonsiiiar bead and spreading to cover both
the left pharynx and left posterior lateral aspect of the tongue is a
ulcerated tan—red lesion (2.5 x 2.3 cm, depth 0.8 cm). Sectioning through this
lesion reveals gray—tan rubbery apparent tumor which has a thickness of 0.8
cm.

The anterior tongue has a gray—tan rubbery fairly well circumscribed mass
(1.5 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm).

The submucosai tissue of the midportion of the tongue, between the two
ill-defined lesions. is arav—tan and rubberv.

Identified within the level I neck contents is a gray—white poorly
circumscribed rubbery mass (1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm). In addition, a fibrotic
submandibular gland (1.6 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm) is also present within the level I
contents. Four possible level I lymph nodes (ranging from 0.3 cm to 0.9 x 0.8
x 0.8 cm) are identified. within the levels II contents is a rubbery gray-tan
