and right adnexa and anterior vaginal wall. The entire specimen has overall
measurements of 15.5 x 14.3 x 3.8 cm and weighs 290 grams. The peritoneum is
pink-tan and smooth and shiny and measures 18 x 10.5 x < 0.1 cm. The bladder
itself measures 7.5 x 7 x 3 cm. Palpation reveals a mass at the left lateral
aspect of the bladder near the bladder neck, and the radial margin within this area
is inked in black. The bladder is opened along the anterior bladder wall revealing
a tumor in the left inferolateral wall measuring 3.5 x 3 x 2.1 cm, extending to the
proximal aspect of the bladder neck. The tumor includes a pink to tan, firm,
exophytic mass that measures 2.1 x 2 x 1.5 cm with an adjacent white-tan ulcer
which measures 2.5 x 2 x 1 cm. Sectioning of the ulcerative area reveals a
yellow—tan, firm, homogeneous cut surface. The tumor grossly appears to extend
into the perivesical soft tissue and is located 0.5 cm from the inked radial
margin. Additional sections show the tumor to be located 0.6 cm from the anterior
vaginal wall. The tumor is located 1.3 cm below the left ureterovesical junction
and 3.5 cm from the urethral margin. The uninvolved bladder wall measures 1.0 cm
throughout and the remaining bladder mucosa is pink to tan and unremarkable with no
other lesions identified. The urethra measures 2.5 cm in length and 2.3 cm in
circumference and the urethral mucosa is unremarkable. The attached ureters are

surface. The ectocervix measures 3.9 cm in diameter and shows a pink—tan, smooth,
shiny epithelial surface, and the external 05 measures 1.5 cm. The uterus is
bivalved. The endocervical canal measures 2.2 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter
and is covered by a tan-gray granular mucosa. The endometrial cavity measures 1.2
x 3.4 cm and is covered by a thin endometrial strip measuring 0.1 cm in thickness.
Serial sections show the myometrium to average 1.3 cm in thickness. A few small
intramural leiomyomas are identified, one in the anterior wall measuring 0.4 cm in
greatest dimension and two in the posterior myometrium measuring 0.4 and 0.6 cm.

identified. The right fallopian tube measures 7.4 cm in length and 0.5 cm in
diameter and grossly is unremarkable. The left adnexa are not identified. The
attached anterior vaginal wall measures 6 x 4.4 cm and is white to tan to pink and
smooth and shiny with no significant lesions identified on the mucosal surface.

C: Sections of bladder show an extensive poorly differentiated invasive papillary
transitional cell carcinoma (ell-16), nuclear grade 4/4, located grossly at the
left inferolateral bladder wall approximating the bladder neck and invading into
deep muscularis propria and approaching but not involving the perivesical fatty
tissue. The tumor is characterized by a large (grossly 2.1 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm)
papillary proliferation of tumor cells with moderate to marked pleomorphiem. The
nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio is markedly increased in many cells, and the nuclei
are round to oval, some showing large nucleoli. Numerous mitotic figures are seen
as well as necrosis. The tumor deeply infiltrates into the muscularis propria with
the closest inked radial margin located 0.4 cm from the tumor (C13).

Lymphovascular invasion is identified (C11). The left ureterovesical junction is
uninvolved. The tumor is located 0.6 cm from the anterior vaginal wall (C12). All
resection margins are free of both malignancy and urothelial dysplasia. Additional
sections of bladder show focal areas of erosion and mild to moderate chronic
cystitis with lymphoid aggregates identified. Mild dysplasia is seen in the
trigone but no foci of high—grade dysplasia or in situ carcinoma (flat lesion) are
identified. In addition, a focal foreign body giant cell reaction is seen (CS)
consistent with previous biopsy site.

Sections of anterior vaginal wall show benign squamous epithelium. Sections
from the cervix show benign cervical glandular epithelium and the endometrium
exhibits atrophic changes. Small intramural leiomyomas are identified. The right
ovary shows benign physiological changes and the right fallopian tube is
unremarkable. There is no evidence of atypia or malignancy.
