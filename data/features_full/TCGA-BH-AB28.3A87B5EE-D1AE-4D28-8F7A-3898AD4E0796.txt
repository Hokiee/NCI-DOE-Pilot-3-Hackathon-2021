COEMENT ,

Part ll 1, ti 2. it 3, it 4. and # 5: The results of immunohistochemical stainings support the
above diagnosis (see microscopic description).

Parts #1, #2 and #3: The metastatic tumor cells with thin these lymph nodes are depicted
by the AE1/AE3 cytokeratin immunostaining end are present circumierentialiy within the
sub capsular sinusoidal area in minute tumor cell Clusters and mowy as single cells. Re-
review of the imprint slides performed at intraoperative consultation showed no metastatic
tumor cells in part 1 and part 2, and showed rare atypical Cells in part 3.

 

GRﬁS DESCRIPTION
The specimen is received fresh and in 5 parts.

 

Part 1 is received for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name. initials
‘ and "sentinel node biopsy #1 left exille. not blue'. it consists of a portion of I

adipose tissue which measures 2.5 x 1.5 II 1.2 cm. A single pink tan probable lymph node

is identified measuring 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm. The lymph node is bisected for touch

preparation to reveal a homogenous tan-yellow cut surface. The lymph node is further

bisected longitudinally into 2-mm intervals and submitted entirely in two cassettes labeled

w

1..

1A-1 B.
Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours

Pan 2 is received for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, initials
- and “sentinel node biopsy #2 left axilla not blue“. It consists of a single fatty pink
tan probable lymph node with minimal attached adipose tissue which measures 2 x 1.7 x 1
cm. The lymph node is bisected for touch preparation analysis to reveal a largely fatty
replaced cut Surface. The lymph node halves are further bisected into 2-rnm longitudinal
intervals and submitted entirely in two cassettes labeled 2A-23.

Formalin ExpCSUre Time: 13 hours

Part 3 is received for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name. initials
‘ and "sentinel node biopsy #3 left axilla . not blue'. It consists of a portion of
adipose tissue which measures 4 x 3 x 1.5 cm. A single fatty pink tan probable lymph node
is identiﬁed measuring 1.5 x1 x 0.8 cm. The lymph node is bisected to reveal a largely
fatty replaced cut surface. One half the lymph node is submitted for frozen section
analysis. Both halves of the lymph node are further bisected into 2-mm longitudinal
intervals and submitted entirely as follows:

3FS- lymph node half, frozen section

SA- remaining lymph node halves.

Forrnalin Exposure Time: 13 hours

Part 4 is labeled with the patients name, initials -' and “sentinel node biopsy #4 left axilla
not blue". It consists of a portion of adipose tissue which measures 4.0 x 2.7 x 1.0 cm.

A single pink tan probable’lymph node is identiﬁed measuring 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.6 cm. The

lymph node is bisected to reveal a pink-tan cut surface interspersed with adipose tissue.

The lymph node halves are further sectimed into 2-mm longitudinal intervals and submitted

entirely in two cassettes labeled 4A-4B.

Formalin Exposure Time: 13 hours

Part 5 is labeled with the patient‘s name, initials . and 'left total mastectomy long lateral
short superior'. it consists of a 1202 9 total mastectomy smclmen which measures 235 x
22 x 7.5 cm. The anterior surface is remarkable for an ellipse shaped portion of light tan
skin which measures 20 x 16 cm. The areola measures 6.5 x 6 cm with a 1.1-cm
retracted, mobile nipple. No discrete skin scars or lesions are grossly identiﬁed. The
specimen is inked and sectioned to reveal a large, ill-defined stightly stellate mass (ring-
shaped biopsy Clip) which is located roughly between the upper outer and lower outer
quadrants, and extends towards the central aspect of the breast. The mass measures 8.0
x 6.5 x 4.2 cm and comes to within 1.0 cm of the closest posterior margin, 2.2 cm of the
skin and 3 cm of the anterior inked margin. The breast parenchyma directly martial of the
mass and encompassing a large portion Of the upper inner and lower inner quadrants is
dense and extensively ﬁbrocystic (approximately 10 x 4.5 x 4 cm). No additional masses
are identiﬁed grossly. The uninvolved breast parenchyma is composed of approximately
50% adipose tissue and 50% nodular fibrous tissue. Representative sections are
submitted as follows:

5A- nipple and subareolar soft tissue

53- breast parenchyma directly lateral of mass

513- fullface mass (most lateral aspect)

SD-SK- fullface mass (central lateral aspect). 5D-56: posterior aspect. 5E-5K= anterior
aspect

5L-SS- iullface mass (central medial aspect), 5L-50= posterior aspect. 5P-5S= anterior
aspect

5T-5U- fullface mass (most medial aspect)

5V- breast parenchyma directly medial of mass

5W-5Y- fibrocystic tissue adjacent to the mass

5Z-5AA- posterior inked margin closest to mass

5AB- anterior inked margin closest to mass

5AC- lower outer quadrant

5AD- lower inner quadrant

5AE- upper inner quadrant

SAF-upper outer quadrant

Block 1-ieft breast tumor inﬁltrating lobular carcinoma.
Block 2-left breast normal fibrocystic changes.

Upper cuter quadrant- green

Lower outer quedrant- red

Upper inner quadrant- black

Lower inner quadrant. blue

Anterior- orange.
