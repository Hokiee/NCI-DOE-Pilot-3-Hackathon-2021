EATI‘EST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS ES BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SUDES (ANDIOR OTHER MATERiAL]. AND THAT i HAVE
REVlEWED AND AW’ROVED THIS REPORT.

 

 

 

1). The specimen is received fresh labeled "right radical nephrectomy " and consists of a kidney with attached ureter. renal vessels
and perinaphric fat weighing 190 to in total. The kidney measures 10.5 x 6.5 x 5.5 cm. The attached ureter measures 2.4 cm in
length and 0.3 cm in diameter. The renal vessels and ureter margins are grossly unremarkable. The kidney is inked blue and
bivalved to reveal a cortical tumorilocated in the upper pole of the kidney and measuring 6 x 6.3 x 4 cm. The tumor is separated
irorn the normal parenchyme by althin capsule and grossly does not invade the cortex and the perinephric tat. Focaliy it is situated
inside the calyces . The tumor has a rubbery variegated while tan cut surface. Sections through the remainder of the kidney
reveal a pink brown perenchyma. with a wall~detined cortico—rnedullaryiUnctlon. The cortex measures 0.6 cm and the calycas
appear normal. No lymph nodes are identiﬁed in the perinephric fat. The specimen is photographed. Representative sections
are submitted for TPS and for permanent sections.

Summary of sections: .

UVM -- ureterel and vessel margins

2}. The specimen is received in formalin, labeled “Perlnephric lat”. It consist of multiple fragments of pale tan unremarkable tally
tissue measuring 9 x 7 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. No lymph nodes are identiﬁed. Representativaly submitted.
