Gross Description

A. Received in formalin labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes" are
two nodules 0f tan fatty tissue consistent with lymphoid tissue
from 2‘5 am. down he 1 cm. The excess fat is trimmed. Bath nodes
are submitted in Al.

B, Received in formalin labeled "left.pelvic nodes" are two
modules of fatty tissue, each measuring 1 cm. The excess fat is
trimmed. Bath nodes are submitted in 81.

C. Received in ﬁormalin labaled "tissue over prostate" is a 2.5
cm. aggragate of tan fatty tissue. No palpable masses are
identified“ The entire speciman is submitted in Cl.

D. Receivad in formalin labeled "prostate, seminal vesicle and
vaa deferens” is a radical prustatectomy specimen‘which includes
a 29 gram prostate gland with attached seminal vesicle and vas
deferens. The prostate gland meaauxes 4 x 3.5 x 3 Cm and has a
shaggy capsule that is disrupted at the bladder resection margin
and has been previously inked black on the left and blue on the
right. The right seminal vesicle measures 3 x l x 1 cm. The
right vas measures 4.5 cm. The left seminal vesicle measures 3 x
l x 1 cm. The left vas measures 3.5 cm. The inferior proatate
is sectioned transversely, removed from the rest of the specimen
and sectioned from anterior to posterior following the plane of
the urethra. The remaining gland is serially sectioned
txansversely and Show: a firm, facally nodular parenchyma. The
seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia shew no abnormalities.
