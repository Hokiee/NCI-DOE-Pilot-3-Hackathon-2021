DPER DATE: REG DOC:
VERIFIED BY:

wyear-old with history of dysphagia, heartburn, regurg and weight
loss. Adenocarcinoma of distal esophagus. Operative Procedure:
Esophagectomy.

VERIFIED BY:

1. ”Thoracic esophagus.” A 15 cm long segment of esophagus and 2 x 3 cm
proximal stomach. The specimen is received open. Near the GE junction there is
a 3.5 x 2 cm ulcerated mass with depth of invasion 1.3 on all the way through
muscularis propria and closely approximating to serosel surface. The mass
occlpies 70% of the lumen circumference and with marked lumen occlusion. Tuner
closely approximates the distal gastric surgical margin within 0.2 cm. The
remaining esophagus and stomach are grossly unremarkable. Several gross
positive lymph nodes identified, up to 1 cm in greatest dimension with no
obvious actual capsular extension.

1AsB. Tumor with deepest invasion and adjacent gastric mucosa.

10-0. Tumor with deepest invasion with adjacent esophagus.

1E. Tumor with closest distal surgical margin after shaving the stapled
mucosa.

1F. Shaved stapled gastric mucosa.

10. Normal appearing GE junction overlying the tumor.

1H. Normal appearing esophagus and unremarkable gastric mecca.

1i. Grossly positive lymph nodes. Sectioned.

1.1. Two grossly positive lymph nodes. Larger bisected and inked yellow.

1K. Groasly unremarkable lymph nodes.

1L. Grossly unremarkable lynph nodes.

2. ”Proximal cervical margin.” A 0.5 cm long segment of unremarkable
esophagus- 121D «5- 5

3. ”Lesser curve lymph node.” Two 0.3 to 0.5 cm lymph nodes.

Number of positive lymph nodes, the total number sampled is irrelevant: 7/10
Extranodal metastasis: None

Pattern of invasion: infiltrative

Esophageal and gastric resection margins involved: No

Deep resection margin involved: No

TNN classification: T3 N1 Mx

VERIFIED BY:
1. Esophagus and proximal stomach, resection: Adenocarcinoma arising at the
GE junction with extension to perigastric and periesophageal adipose tissue.
Free margins of excision. Seven of 10 lymph nodes positive for carcinoma. See
template.

2. Segment of esophagus, resection: Negative for carcinoma.

3. Lymph node of lesser curvature of stomach, excision: One of two lymph
nodes positive for carcinoma.
