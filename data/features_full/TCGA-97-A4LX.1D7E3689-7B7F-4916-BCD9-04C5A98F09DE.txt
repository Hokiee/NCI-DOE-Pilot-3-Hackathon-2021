CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
M ex-smoker (120 pack-years) with a 1.6 cm RUL nodule, 3.7 cm LLL
ground-glass mass and a 1 cm lingular nodule.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in seven parts, each labeled with the
patient's name.

1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'lingular nodule'. It

consists of a lingular segment of the lung measuring 15 x 7 x 3.5
cm. The staple line measures 17 cm which is shaved and the bronchial
around inked blue. The pleura is gray pink and glistening and
mottled moderately with ﬁne black streaks. Also noted is a precut
area on the pleura which reveals a sub pleural gray white ﬁrm
nodule, measuring 1 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm located 2 cm from the staple line
margin. The remainder of the bronchial is pink red blotchy and
crepitant. No other nodule is grossly identiﬁed. Frozen section is
performed on the nodule and resubmitted for permanent section.
Representative section of the specimen and entire nodule are

submitted.

2. Part two is labeled 'leit lower lobe wedge'. It consists of one
piece of yellow—pink soﬁ tissue measuring 2 x l x 0.5 cm. Entirely
submitted in one cassette.

3. Part three is received fresh, labeled 'margin of leﬁ lower lobe
wedge’. It consists of a stapled strip of light tan tissue

measuring 3.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The staple line is shaved and the soft
tissue is submitted.

4. Part four is labeled 'level #5 lymph node'. It consists of
multiple soﬁ red-black lymph nodes measuring 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm in
aggregate. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

5. Part ﬁve is labeled 'level #7 lymph node'. It consists of a 1.5
x 1 x 0.8 cm red-black lymph node. Entirely submitted in one
cassette.

6. Part six is labeled 'level #9 lymph node'. It consists of a 1.2
x 1 x 0.6 cm red-black lymph node. Entirely submitted in one
cassette.

7. Part seven is received fresh, labeled 'basilar segment left lower
lobe silk stitches on tumor location'. It consists of a segment of
lung measuring 20 x 14 x 4.5 cm. The bronchial margin measures 1.5
cm and the vascular margin measures 1 cm. The pleura is gray pink
glistening and mottled moderately with fine black streaks. There are
two staple lines measuring 8 cm and 5 cm in length. There is a
precut area on the pleura which is marked with a stitch. At this

area there is a grey tan ﬁrm mass, measuring 1.5 x 1 cm and located
1.5 cm from the bronchial resection margin, and 0.4 cm from the
closest staple line which is shaved and the bronchial is inked

black. The mass is located on the mediastinal surface of the lung.
The remaining of the bronchial is pink red blotchy and crepitant. No
other nodule is grossly identiﬁed. Representative sections of the
specimen and the entire mass area with adjacent tissue are
submitted.

MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY
KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS

Specimen #:

RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12A (c.34G>C) mutation in codon 12 of
the KRAS gene.

INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to
correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase
inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer.

COMMENT:

KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking
history.

This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of

the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected.

This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and
codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn
embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been
established in samples of colorectal cancer and non—small cell lung
carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other
tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e. g. tumors of
pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).

METHOD/ LIMITATION:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantiﬁed
and ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

EGF R Mutation Analysis

Specimen #:

Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma.

RESULTS: No mutation detected.

INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identiﬁed; in the sample
provided for analysis. Fewer than %5 of non-small-cell lung

carcinoma patients without identiﬁable mutations are reported to be
responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.

COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more cellularity is optimal for
this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 50% tumor
cellularity upon pathologist review.

A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was
identiﬁed. This polymorphism 15 known not to have clinical
signiﬁcance.

exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.
