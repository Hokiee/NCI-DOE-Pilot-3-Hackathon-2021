lntraogeratlve Consultation:

An lntraoperative hon-microscopic consultation was obtained and interpreted as: ‘Called to pick—up ‘utems, cervix,
bilaterd tubes and ovon‘es’ consisting of 935 gram hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectom; specimen. The
uterus measures 15 x 13x ll cm with smooth serosal surface Opened to show a large massl'lsl x 12.5 x ‘IO cm‘i

arising from uterine tundus. Mass is heterogeneous tanvorown and white. sort. partially cystic. Sampled for

study. In operating room, right achexa Is attached to uterus. left annexe is separated from uterus Both annexes are

unremarkable. Rest for pennanents," by‘

MICI'OSCOQIC DESCI’IQIIOH and Comment:

The endornetnal mess consusts of a blphasic tumor composed of a sarcomatous element con sisting of a high géde

serous carcinoma and sarcometous element with rhabdomyosarcomatous ditterantiation. Multiple

immunohistochemical stains were performed on 2 riflerent blocks The sarcometous tumor cells were strongly and
dlltusely positive for p16. The sarcomalous tumor cells were focally positive for desmin, smooth muscle actin and;
mfogenin Tumor cells were negative for ER, PR, oa‘ncvtokeratin. EMA and CAM 5.2. These lmmunostains confirm

the rhabdorwosarcomaws component.

formalin—filled specimen is markedly distorted but when examined fresh measured 15.0 x 13.0 x 11.0 cm: The serosal
surface is smooth. The cervrx measures 2 1 x 2.0 cm. The ectoceryix has a taanroWn, glistening mucusa with no
gross lesions seen. The en'docenrical canal has a tan appearance and measures 2.7 cm in length. The andometrlal
cavity is difficult to measure secondary to marked distdrtion, but appears to measure a least 9.0 'cm from
cornuto-comu by 6.5 cm in length. The endometrial cavity is filled by the previously described large poly'poidrnass
measuring 140 x 12.5 x 10.0 on. The mass is multiiobulated and multicystic vh'th abundant areas or greentan _
necrosis and friable tan, solid areas. The mass appears to. originate from the fundus aid the superior aspect of the
anterior endometrium invoivin gthe anterior myornetrium. The remainder of the endometrial mucosa has a rough;
nodular appearance. The myometn'um is thinned in multiple areas and has multiple nodules presantwithln the anterior
aspect which appear to be conli guou's with the lesion. The largest ofthese nodules measure 30 cm in greatest
dimension. The nodules extend to within 0.3 cm. of the serosal surface'whlch is smooth and glistening. The
myometriurn measures up to 1 2 cm in greatest thickness. Mulbple additional firm nodules are present in the posterior
aspect of the myometrium. These nodules have await-circumscribed ﬁrm. tan~white. whoried appearance, The
largest of dress nodules measure 06 cm in greatest dimension. The anterior myomelnum is also involved by multiple
firm wdl—crrc‘umscribed, tan-white, whorled-eppeering nodules with abundant calcification. The nodules measure up to
2.5 cm in greatest dimension. The right fallopian tube and ovary are slill attached to the uterus. The right fallopiai
tube measures 6.5 x 0.6 it 0.5 cm and has a fimbrialed end. The tube is sectionedto show a pinpoint lumen with no
additional legions seen. The rigit wary is atrophic and measures 1.6 x 0.8x 0.6 cm. The serosal surface is tan—white
and smooth The ovary is bisected to show a tan-white mottled parenchyma With no lesions seen. The left fallopian
tube and ovary are detached and present in the container. The left fallopian tube measures 4.5 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm and has
a fimbriated end. The tube is sectioned to show a pinpoint lumen with no iesrons seen. The ovary measures 2.5x 1.2
x 0.8 cm and has a pedunculded firm nodular mass attached which measures 2.2 x 1.6 x 1.0 cm. The ovary is
sectioned to show a white-tan. mottledappearing parenchy-ma with no gross lesions seen. The pedunculated
para-ovarian mass .5 sectioned to show a whorled. firm, white, solid appearance. The uterus is submitted as follows,
At - anterior cervix; A2 - contiguous section of anterior lower uterine segment; A3- contiguous segment of anterior

The second container is labeled ‘bladder peritoneal tumor." it contains a white-tan irregular fragment of tissue
measuring 2.0x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The specimen isentirely submitted as Bl. Jar 0.

The third container is labeled "gastrocolic omentum." it contains an irregular lobuleted yellow-brawn fragment of fatty
tissue measuring 53.0 x 7.0 x 1.5 cm. Thetissue is consistent with omentum and has a firm, nodular appearance to
the maionty of the omental tissue. The omentum is sectioned to show an’ infiltrative white appearance to a majority of
the fatty tissue with many areas coalescing to form nodules The lergostwell-ciroimscribed nodule measures 1.5 x 1.0

The fourth container is labeled "appendix with cecal peritoneum." it contains multiple irregular fragments of

yellowL brown tissue measwing 8.0 it 60 ii 2.5 cm in aggregate One of the fragments represents eppencix with
attached periappondiced adipose tissue The appendx measures 5.5 cm in length x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The serosa is
rough and irregular With multiple areas of hemorrhage and edhesions. The appendix is sectioned to show on
unremarkable star-shaped lumen with minimal amount of fecal material present. A firm. Well-circumscribed white area
is present in the solacent periappendiceal edpose tissue which measures 0.5 it 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The additional fragments
of tissue are irregular, yellow-brown and. appear to represent adipose dssue with glistening peritoneal surfaces The
tissues are sectioned to Show well-circumscribed firm, white areas The largest of the firm white areas measure 3 0 it

The fifth container is labeled "rectal serosa tumor“ it contains mu ltipie irregular tan-white ‘irm fragments ottissue
measuring 4 5 x 2,0 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. The fragments of tissue have an irregular and somewhatfriable
appearance. The fragments of tissue range from O 5 x 0.3 x 0.2 to 1 .8 x l 2 it 0.4 cm. The specimen is entirely
