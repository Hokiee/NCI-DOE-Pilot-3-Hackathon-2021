Tumor identiﬁer

Diagnosis:

A: Breast, left, mastectomy

- Non—proliferative fibrocystic change

No atypia or malignancy identified.
Sentinel lymph node #1, removal

One benign lymph node, negative for malignancy.
Sentinel lymph node #2, removal

One benign lymph node, negative for malignancy.
Breast, right, mastggtomy

— TEEEEEEEPEEEEET_Ea£cinoma, Overall grade 3. The tumor

size is 2.5“5ni' ‘

No

lymphovascular space

invasion is identified. Surgical margins are free of

invasive carcinoma.

— Tumor estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor

 

IOIWI

negative.
- HERZ/neu overexpressed (score=3+).
6" ~ Ductal carcinoma in situ, comedo subtype, nuclear grade 3
with
necrosis,

comprising approximately 5% of the tumor. The surgical
margins are negative

for

DCIS.

Comment:

Additional levels of the sentinel nodes performed as per
sentinel lymph

node

protocol are all negative for carcinoma.

Clinical History:

The patient is a -year-old female with right breast
carcinoma and a left

breast

mass who undergoes bilateral mastectomy and sentinel node
biopsy mapping.

aspect while a

short

suture marks the superior aspect;

the superficial margin is marked with blue ink and the deep
resection margin is marked

with black ink

lesions or

abnormalities

are noted grossly

Nipple/areola: the slightly retracted nipple measures 1.5
cm in diameter

surrounded by a grossly

unremarkable areola which measures 3.6 cm

Axillary tail: not present

Biopsy site: not identified

Residual tumor: no tumor is identified grossly

Location of tumor: not applicable

Distance of mass/biopsy site from surgical margin: not
applicable

Gross involvement of skin of fascia/muscle by tumor: not
applicable

Description of remainder of breast: yellow/tan lobulated
unremarkable

adipose is

admixed with focally dense and

coalescening pale pink/white breast tissue

without masses or nodules

appreciated grossly

Other remarkable features: none

Tissue submitted for special investigations: none

tissue or possible

lymph

node which are not identified

grossly

A7,A8 — representative sections of upper/outer quadrant
A9,A10 - representative sections of lower/outer quadrant

All,A12 — representative sections of lower/inner quadrant
Container B is additionally labeled "sentinel lymph node
#1" and consists

 

of an

ovoid, pale gray/tan lymph node measuring 1.8 x 0.8 X 0.6
cm. The lymph

node is

bisected and submitted in block Bl.

Container C is additionally labeled "sentinel lymph node
#2" and consists

of an

ovoid, gray/purple lymph node measuring 6 mm in greatest
dimension. The lymph

node

is bisected and submitted entirely in block Cl.
Container D is additionally labeled "right breast."
Specimen fixation: received fresh and placed in formalin
Type of mastectomy: simple

Size of specimen: 20.5 x 15.5 x 4.0 cm

Orientation of specimen: a long suture marks the lateral
aspect while a

short

suture marks the superior aspect;

the superficial aspect is marked with blue ink and the deep
resection margin is marked

with black ink

Skin ellipse dimensions: 13.8 x 4.2 x 0.2 cm; scars and
lesions are not

identified

grossly, however, the specimen

at the skin has previously been dyed blue at the time of
surgery

Nipple/areola: the grossly unremarkable nipple measures 1.5
cm in diameter

and is

surrounded by an unremarkable

4.3 cm areola

Axillary tail: not identified grossly

Biopsy site: not identified

Residual tumor: A 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm indurated, pale
gray/white,

previously dyed blue, well

circumscribed ovoid mass is identified.

Location of tumor: in the outer half of the specimen, at
the junction of the

upper

and lower halves

Distance of mass/biopsy site from surgical margin: the mass
extends to within

5 mm

 

 

of the deep resection margin,

is 7.5 cm from the inferior peripheral

margin, and 8.0

cm from the superior peripheral margin

Gross involvement of skin of fascia/muscle by tumor: absent
Description of remainder of breast: grossly unremarkable,
yellow/tan

lobulated

adipose admixed with focally dense,

pink/white breast tissue without additional masses

or nodules identified

grossly

Other remarkable features: none

Tissue submitted for special investigations: a 1.5 x 1.5 x
0.8 cm fragment of

tumor

is submitted to Tissue

Procurement
