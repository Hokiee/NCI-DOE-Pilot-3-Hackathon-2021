GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A.. The specimen is received fresh for intraoperative consultation
diagnosis and consists of a 110.6 g, 13.1 x 8.0 x 3.5 cm tissue
comprising of a 5.0 x 4.5 X 3.5 cm, well—circumscribed mass along with
attached adipose tissue and oriented with a short stitch indicating
right superior horn, long stitch indicating the left superior horn and
a medium sized purple stitch indicating the left lateral margin. The
specimen is inked blue along the superficial superior aspect, black
along the superficial inferior aspect, red along the deep superior
aspect and green along the deep inferior aspect. The left lateral
margin is submitted for frozen section diagnosis in cassette FsAl—AZ.

The nodule is located 9.5 cm from the superior margin and abuts the
right lateral, left lateral and inferior margins of the specimen. The
nodule is serially sectioned to reveal a tan to mahogany—brown, solid,
lobulated, homogeneous cut surface traversed by thin, white, fibrous
trabecula. The surrounding fat reveals the presence of two tan—brown

to black rubbery lymph nodes displaying a tan-black to white cut
surface.

Sections of the specimen are submitted as follows: Cassettes Al-A7—
representative sections from the mass; A8- one whole bisected lymph
node; A9— representative section of adipose tissue and one whole

possible lymph node; AlO— superior margin; All— right superolateral
margin.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:

FsAl—FSAZ. Thymus, resection:
- LEFT LATERAL MARGIN — PROBABLY NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR
(FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE AND LYMPHOID TISSUE WITH ANTHRACOTIC
PIGMENT PRESENT).

— CANNOT ENTIRELY RULE OUT PRESENCE OF LYMPHOID TISSUE FROM
THYMOMA

B. The specimen consists of a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm, tan—brown to black,
rubbery lymph node submitted in its entirety in cassette B.

C. The specimen consists of a 0.9 x 0.7 X 0.4 cm, tan~black to brown,

rubbery lymph node, bisected and submitted in its entirety in cassette
C.

D. The specimen consists of a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.1 cm, tan—black to brown,
possible lymph node, submitted in its entirety in cassette D.

E. The specimen consists of a 2.5 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm, tan—yellow to brown,
lobulated piece of tissue which is serially sectioned to reveal a
tan—yellow, lobulated cut surface. Representative section is
submitted in cassette E.

F. The specimen consists of a 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm, skin—covered tissue.
The specimen is inked, bisected and submitted in its entirety in
cassette F.

MICROSCOPIC EXAM
DIAGNOSIS:

A. Thymus, resection:

SPECIMEN: Thymus

PROCEDURE: Thymectomy

SPECIMEN INTEGRITY: Intact

SPECIMEN WEIGHT: 110.6 gm

TUMOR SIZE: 5.0 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm

HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Type AB thymoma

TUMOR EXTENSION: Not applicable

MARGINS: Margins uninvolved by tumor

TREATMENT EFFECT: Not applicable

LYMPH-VASCULAR INVASION: Not identified

REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: NO regional lymph node metastases
NUMBER EXAMINED: 4
NUMBER INVOLVED: O

PATHOLOGIC STAGING FOR THYMOMAS (MODIFIED MASAOKA STAGE): Stage 1
(grossly microscopically encapsulated; includes microscopic

invasion into, but not through, the capsule)
IMPLANTS/DISTANT METASTASIS: Not present
ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS:
— Focal cystic change in tumor
- Involuted thymic tissue away from thymoma
— 1x1 mm parathyroid tissue in the superior margin

B. Station 3 mediastinal lymph node, excision:
- CALCIFIED NODULE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR

C. Station 4L lymph node, excision:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR

D. Thymus lymph node, excision:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR

E. Mammary fat pad, excision:
- MATURE ADIPOSE TISSUE WITH A TINY LYMPHOID AGGREGATE,
NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR

F. Left chest, biOpsy site, excision:
- SKIN WITH DERMAL SCAR AND GIANT CELL REACTION, CONSISTENT WITH
THE PRIOR BIOPSY SITE

COMMENT: The thymoma is encapsulated; there is no tumor extension
through the capsule. The tumor consists of spindle/oval and focally
polygonal epithelial cells (positive for PCK and CK5/6 on
immunohistochemistry) which are intermixed with T~cells (positive for
CD3 and CD5 by immunohistochemistry). CD20 stains rare scaterred
B—cells. The neoplasm has a lobulated architecture, with traversing
fibrous bands. Occasional Hassal‘s corpuscles are present.

Sections of the fibroadipose tissue away from the mass, including the
superior and right superolateral margins, show involuted thymic tissue
(with lymphoid component predominantly in the cortical area and
epithelial component in the medullary area). Areas of cystic
degeneraton are present. By immunohistochemistry the epithelial
component stains positive for PCK and CK5/6; and lymphoid component
with CD3 and CD5. CD20 outlines B—cells in the germinal centers. The
left lateral margin (which was submitted for frozen section) shows
fibroadipose and lymphoid tissue, and no thymoma. Focal parathyroid
tissue (1x1 mm) is identified in the superior margin (positive for
chromogranin and AEl/3).

Mediastinal nodes Show focal granulomas. The result of AFB and GMS
special stains will be reported in an addendum.

Intradepartmental consultaton: was notified at
the time of frozen section.
