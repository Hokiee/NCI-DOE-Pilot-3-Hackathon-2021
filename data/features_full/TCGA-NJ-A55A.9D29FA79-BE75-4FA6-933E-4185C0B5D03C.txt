FINAL DIAGNOSIS

A. (Level 7 lymph node; excision): One reactive lymph node with anthracosis.

B. (Level 11 lymph node; excision): Fragments of reactive lymphoid tissue

with anthracosis.

C. (Level 11 lymph node; excision): Fragments of reactive lymphoid tissue

with anthracosis.

D. (Level 10R lymph node; excision): Fragments of reactive lymphoid tissue

with anthracosis.

E. (Right lower lung lobe; lobectomy): Moderately-differentiated
adenocarcinoma, measuring 3.2 cm in greatest dimension, with extension to
visceral pleura. Surgical, vascular, and bronchial margins free of tumor.

Stage pT2 N0. (See note).

Remaining lung parenchyma with emphysema and mild chronic inflammation.

F. (Level 2 lymph node; excision): Fragments of reactive lymphoid tissue with

anthracosis.

G. (Level 4R lymph node; excision): Fragments of reactive lymphoid tissue

with anthracosis.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION
E. FROZENZRIGHT LOWER LOBECTOMY (FROZEN ON BRONCHIAL MARGIN): Negative for

malignancy. (A91)

NOTE
E. TTF-l and cytokeratin 7 are positive in the tumor cells, and cytokeratin

20 is negative, supporting a primary lung neoplasm.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. The specimen is labeled level 7 lymph node. Received fresh is a 0.7 x 0.5
x 0.3 cm anthracotic lymph node that is bisected and entirely submitted in

cassette A1.

B. The specimen is labeled level 11 lymph node. Received fresh is a 1.5 x
1.2 x 0.8 cm aggregate of red-black lymphoid tissue. Sections are submitted
in cassettes as follows: BI and B2, intact lymph nodes. The entire specimen

is submitted.

C. The specimen is labeled level 11 lymph node. Received fresh is a 1.4 x
1.2 x 0.8 cm aggregate of anthracotic lymph nodes. The entire specimen is

submitted in cassettes C1 and C2. All cassettes contain intact lymph nodes.

D. The specimen is labeled level 10 right lymph node. Received fresh is a
1.7 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm aggregate of anthracotic lymph nodes that are entirely

submitted in cassette D1.

E. The specimen is labeled right lower lobectomy. Received fresh for frozen
section is 126 gram, 17.5 x 11.5 x 2.7 cm Iobectomy with stapled surgical,
bronchial and vascular margins of resection. There is a palpable mass which
appears to be puckering the overlying pleura. Serial sectioning reveals that

the tumor measures 3.2 x 2.4 x 2.2 cm. The remaining lung parenchyma is pink

and spongy with no additional masses. The specimen is submitted as follows:

E91, frozen section bronchial margin; E1, vascular margin; E2, surgical

margin; E3 through E5, tumor.

F. The specimen is labeled level 2 lymph node. Received fresh is a 1.5 x 1 x
0.8 cm aggregate of adipose tissue containing lymph nodes. The specimen is

entirely submitted in cassettes F1 and F2 containing intact lymph nodes.

G. The specimen is labeled level 4 right lymph node. Received fresh is a 2.1
x 1.1 x 1 cm aggregate of fibroadipose tissue containing anthracotic lymph
nodes. The entire specimen is submitted in cassettes 61 through G3 containing

intact lymph nodes.
