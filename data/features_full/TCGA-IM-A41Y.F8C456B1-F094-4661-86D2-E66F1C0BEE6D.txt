Gross Description:

A. Received fresh is a lymph node measuring 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm. Bisected and submitted in toto for frozen.

B Received is a portion of red tissue that measures 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. In toto in one cassette for frozen.

C. Received is a membranous portion of tissue measuring 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm. In toto in one cassette for frozen.
D Received in formalin is a right thyroid Iobectomy and segment of muscle weighing 128 grams. The whole

specimen measures 8.0 x 8.0 x 4.0 cm. There is a suture marking superior aspect of the
sternocleidomastoid muscle. Resection margin is inked black. Cross section through the specimen shows a
large ﬁrm papillary pale tan mass, measuring 6.8 x 5.0 x 3.5 cm, involving the entire thyroid lobe. A
segment of the mass close to the muscle shows multi-loculated cut surface with hemorrhagic material. It is

 

 

 

well separated by a capsule. The mass does not appear to be extending beyond the thyroid. No lymph

nodes were grossly identiﬁed. Sections submitted as follows:

Cassette #1 Muscle resection margin

Cassettes #2-17 Representative sections of the mass in relation with the margin (cassette #17 with section
of the loculated mass in relation with muscle. The ﬁrm area of the mass (papillary) was
submitted almost in toto)

E. Received fresh is a light brown tissue fragment less than 1 mm in diameter. in toto in one cassette or for
frozen.

F. Received fresh is a light brown tissue fragment 1 mm in diameter. In toto in one cassette for frozen.

G. Received in formalin is a thyroid (left lobe) weighing 9 grams, measuring 4.5 x 3.0 x 1.8 cm. The capsule is

brown and dusky, inked black. Cross section through the specimen shows a red-brown parenchyma. There
is an ill-deﬁned pale tan, markedly ﬁrm mass measuring 2.6 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm. The mass involves the isthmus
and a portion of the left lobe. Also, there is additional well-circumcised ﬁrm. pale tan nodule measuring 0.3
cm in diameter involving the middle aspect of the left lobe. Sections submitted as follows:

Cassette #1-6 The large mass submitted in toto (from isthmus to left lobe)

Cassette #7 The small mass in the middle aspect, submitted in toto
H. Received in formalin are multiple yellow-tan ﬁbroadipose tissue fragments, measuring 4.0 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm in
aggregate. Seven lymph nodes are grossly present measuring up to 0.3 x 0.2 cm in greatest dimensions.
Sections submitted as follows:

Cassette #1 Three lymph nodes in toto

Cassette #2 Four lymph nodes in toto
I. Received in formalin is a yellow-tan ﬁbroadipose tissue fragment measuring 3.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm in aggregate.
Six lymph nodes are present, measuring up to 1.0 x 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. Sections submitted as
follows:

Cassette #1 &2 Three lymph nodes in toto per cassette
