AddendumJJ

The case is discussed with Dr. “ by telephone The gross specimen is
reviewed in an attempt to find additional lymph nodes. Dissection reveals in the

periserosal adipose tissue one areai possibly

suspicious for metastatic tumor measuring 4

mm. No additional obvious gross lymph nodes are identified. The following additional

sections are submitted:

A10 — additional periserosal adipose
All—ls— additional periserosal adipose

tissue with suspicious nodule
tissue

In the sections. four additional small lymph nodes are fggnd. and these are negative for

malignancy.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in the fresh state from the operating room in three parts.

A. This is a subtotal gastrectomy specimen with adjacent tissues also resected. The
stomach measures 15 x 7 x 3 cm. The proximal and distal margins are stapled closed.
Present centrally is a red tumor which measures 3 x 2.5 x 1 cm. The tumor involves the
wall but does not penetrate through the all and is located 6 cm from the proximal margin
and 8 cm from the distal margin‘ Omentum attached to the specimen measures 18 x 18 x 4 cm.
There is no gross evidence of metastatic tumor in the omentum. The surgeon has tagged
subpyloric lymph node. No enlarged lymph nodes are found. Representative portions of the
tumor are removed by aseptic technique and are submitted for tumor banking. The following
sections are submitted:

Al - distal margin

A2 — proximal margin

A3.4 — whole prepyloric lymph node candidate
A5 — red nodules in omentum

A6—9 — gastric tumor

B. This is a 1 cm fragment of soft tissue, totally examined by frozen section as block Bl.

C, This is a 1 cm fragment of soft tissue: totally examined by frozen section as block C1.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION:

A. IMMEDIATE GROSS EVALUATION, SUBTOTAL GASTRECTOMY:
— TUMOR PRESENT IN CENTRAL PORTION OF SPECIMEN
~ SURGICAL MARGINS FREE OF TUMOR
~ TUMOR PROCESSED FOR TUMOR BANKING

B. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS, POSTERIOR VAGUE:
— PORTION OF NERVE PRESENT

C. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS. ANTERIOR VAGUS:
— PORTION OF NERVE PRESENT
