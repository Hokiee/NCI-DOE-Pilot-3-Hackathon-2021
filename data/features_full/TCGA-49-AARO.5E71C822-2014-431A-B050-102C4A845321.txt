INTERPRETATION AND DIAGNOSIS:

l. LUNG, LEFT UPPER LOBE (LOBECTOMY): INFILTRATING POORLY
DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE LUNG (2.5 CM) WITH PAPILLARY
FEATURES. THE TUMOR IS ADJACENT TO, BUT DOES NOT INVADE THROUGH THE
VISCERAL PLEURA. THE ADJACENT LUNG SHOWS CENTRILOBULAR EMPHYSEMA AND
SEVERAL FOCI OF ATYPICAL ALVEOLAR HYPERPLASIA. ALL SURGICAL MARGINS

(BRONCHIAL, VASCULAR AND STAPLED PARENCHYMAL MARGIN)ARE NEGATIVE FOR
TUMOR. THE PATHOLOGIC STAGE IS T1NOMX. SEE NOTE.

NOTE: This case was shown at the ‘

2. STATION 5 (DISSECTION): SIX (6) LYMPH NODES AND ASSOCIATED
FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

3. STATION 7 (DISSECTION): ONE (1) LYMPH NODE AND ASSOCIATED
FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

PART #1: LEFT UPPER LOBE
Resident Pathologist:

Th ‘ pecimen is received fresh labeled with the patient's name -
and designated as left upper lobe. It consists of a grossly
1 entifiable lobectomy specimen, measuring 18.0 x 8.2 x 3.3 cm and
weighing in aggregate 163 gm. In the epical half, on the lateral
aspect of the lobe, is a tumor mass, measuring 4.5 cm in greatest
dimension. The mass has an irregular infiltrating border and involves
the pleural surface, such that the pleura is puckered in the area
overlying the tumor. This area of puckering measures 2.5 cm in
greatest dimension. The tumor is approximately 0.5 cm from the hilar
bronchial margin and appears grossly to involve large branches of the
right upper lobe bronchus and blood vessels. On cut section, the
tumor is tan-white and gray, marbleized in appearance. There are two
staple lines on the specimen. The epical staple line measures 4.5 cm
in length and the more inferior staple line measures 6.0 cm in length.
The tumor approaches to within 0.5 cm of the epical staple line. The
staple lines are removed and the lung parenchyma adjacent is inked
blue. The pleural surface overlying the tumor has been inked black.
The specimen is serially sectioned, revealing no other lesions.
Representative sections are submitted.
