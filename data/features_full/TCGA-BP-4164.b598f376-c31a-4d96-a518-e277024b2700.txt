2) The specimen is received fresh, labeled,"Left Kidney and
Adrenal". It consists of a kidney, adrenal gland, an 8.2 cm long
segment of ureter. The specimen measures 21.0 x 12.0 x 9.5 cm
and weighs 950 grams. Bivalving reveals a large illeefined
tumor arising in the upper pole and measuring 13.5 x 8.0 x 7.8 cm
with one satellite nodule situated 0.6 cm from the main mass,
measuring 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. The tumor is rimmed by
golden, yellow—tan tissue with extensively hemorrhagic and
centrally fibrotic. Adrenal gland does not appear to be grossly
involved. Sectioning of the perinephric fat does not reveal
gross extension of tumor through the renal capsule. The tumor
extends to the upper peripheral portion of renal pelvis and renal
vein does not appear to be grossly involved. Representative
sections of tumor with surgical margin is submitted.
