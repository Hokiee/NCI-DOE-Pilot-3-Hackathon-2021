NOTE: The entire tumor has been submitted for histology and shows well differentiated
istoiogth and in many areas has an adenoma like appearance. Focal areas show bile
uctuiar reaction in the lesion as highlighted by CK"! and 19 stains. ”mete is focal
langiectasia also present, The CK? also shows positivity in many periseptai hepatocytes.
tain for glypican-S is negative, while Betawatenin, HSP70 and Amyloid A are negative.
lutamine synthetase shows a patchy map-like positivity. (3034 shows extensive staining in
a sinusoidal endothelial cells. The reticulin stain reveals that the hepatic cords are
ickened focally and there is mild cytologic atypia. Ovetall, the features are of a well

mmediately next to the tumor nodule grossly there is a large portal tract with a necrotic
ppearing tumor thrombus in a portal vessel, Histologically extensive sampling from this
tree shows this to be completely necrotic tumor associated with blood clot surrounded by
:iense scar and extensive hemosiderin laden macrophages. Although a deﬁnite venous wall
5 difﬁcult to identify around the necrotic tumor, this is interpreted as vascular invasion by the

urnor. Few thrombosed vessels are identiﬁed around this area as highlighted with EVG
stains. The case has been seen with Dr. who concurs.

rose Description:t

i
, Received fresh, labeled with the patients name and ”right posterior hepatectomy' is a segment of liver weighing 397
.. rams and measuring 14 x 12 x 8.5 cm. The capsular surface appears shiny and smooth. The surgical margin is
., entitled and inked black. The specimen to serially sectioned at 'i cm intervals and reveals a 3 x 2.5 x 2 cm tamahita.
: lt-circumscrihed subcapsular mass, partially with central hemorrhage and necrosis. A 1.5 x 1.5 cm adjacent area tilled
th necrotic material is present which appears to be tumor thrombus in a portal vessel which is about t) 4cm from the

diaoent area ﬁlled with necrotic material. cassettes 6-?-small libretto area to margin (between tumor and margin).
assettes 8-10=tumor with adjacent area ﬁlled with necrotic material and small libretto area. as per diagram, cassette

iatumor to normal liver, cassette 12=representative sections from normal liver. Cassettes 13-15:! tumor, cassette 16=
