SPECIMEN

A. Descending colon
B. Liver biopsy

CLINICAL NOTES

PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Descending colon cancer.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin labeled
"descending colon" is a 21 cm long portion of colon which has a
portion of omentum attached. The omentum is 25 x 13 x 4 cm. The
omentum is sectioned and palpated to show no discrete gross lesions
identified. The ends of the specimen are opened and are arbitrarily
inked blue and black. No orientation of the specimen is given. The
specimen is partially covered with pink-tan smooth glistening serosa
and abundant yellow lobular fat. The specimen shows a 2.7 x 2.7 cm
exophytic tumor which is equidistance between either end (5.7 cm).
The specimen shows otherwise pink-tan smooth glistening mucosa with
normal to abundant folds having an average circumference of 6.5 cm.
The cut surface of the tumor shows possible invasion into the
muscularis propria, coming within 2 cm of the deep margin. Lymph
nodes are grossly identified in the fat. Representative sections of
the specimen are submitted as follows: block 1 - representative
luminal margins; block 2 — representative section of omentum; blocks
3,4 - full thickness slices of tumor to radial margin

tumor to normal; blocks 6-9 - possible lymph nodes. _

B. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin labeled

"liver biopsy" are multiple red-brown irregular to
cylindrical tissue fragments which have an aggregate measurement of
1.2 x 0.4 x cm. pecimens are entirely submitted in one

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

A&B:

Histologic type: Invasive adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified.
Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated.

Primary tumor (pT): Tumor invades through muscularis propria in two
pericolonic fat (pT3).

Proximal margin: Negative for tumor.

Distal margin: Negative for tumor.

Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative for tumor.

Distance of tumor from closest margin: 5.7 cm from both proximal
and distal margin.

Vascular invasion: Not identified.

Regional lymph nodes (pN): 21 lymph nodes are all negative for
metastatic tumor (pNO).

Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: Not identified.

Distant metastasis (pM): Metastatic carcinoma is identified in the
liver core biopsy in specimen B (le).

Other findings: The attached omentum is negative for tumor. The
background colonic mucosa was unremarkable. The background hepatic

 

parenchyma was fairly unremarkable other than reactive changes to
the tumor and some mild steatosis.

5x1, 4x1

DIAGNOSIS
A. Colon, descending, segmental resection:
Invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, tumor
invades through muscularis propria into pericolonic fat (pT3).

Twenty one lymph nodes negative for metastatic tumor (pNO).
Resection margins are negative for tumor.
Omentum is negative for tumor.

B. Liver, core biopsies:
Metastatic adenocarcinoma compatible with origin from colonic
primary.
