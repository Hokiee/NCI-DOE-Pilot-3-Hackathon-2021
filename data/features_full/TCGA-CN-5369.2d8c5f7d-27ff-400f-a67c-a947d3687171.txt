My si station that I have personally reviewed the submitted
material(s) and the final diagnosis reflects that evaluation.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in nine parts.

Part 1 is received unfixed, labeled with the patient's name, initials, xx and
"selective node dissection right, levels 2 through 4, stitch at 2B". The
specimen consists of a solitary 9.6 x 5.0 x 1.6 fibrofatty, focally
hemorrhagic tissue fragment with a black suture that marks level 23. Lymph
nodes are dissected and are submitted as follows:

1A 13 representative level 2 lymph node

1C level 2, two nodes

1D level 2, four nodes

1E level 2, four nodes

1F level 2, two nodes

1G level 2b four nodes

1H level 2b three nodes

1I level 3, four nodes

1J level 3, four nodes

1K level 3, one node bisected

1L level 3, four nodes

1M level 4, four nodes

1N level 4, three nodes

10 level 4, three nodes.

Part 2 is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, initials xx
and "lymph node level 4". The specimen consists of a 2.5 x 1.6 x 0.5 cm
focally hemorrhagic fibrofatty tissue fragment. Lymph nodes are recovered
and

submitted as follows:

2A two nodes

2B one node.

Part 3 is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, initials xx
and "lymph node zone 2". The specimen consists of a 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm
fibrofatty tissue fragment. The specimen is submitted as follows:

3A one node

3B two nodes.

Part 4 is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, initials xx
and "lymph node 2—4". The specimen consists of an 8.3 x 3.0 x 1.2 cm
fibrofatty tissue fragment with a suture that demarcates level 2b nodes. The
specimen is submitted as follows:

4A level 2, node A
4B level 2, node B
4C level 3, node A
4D level 3, node B
4E level 3, node C
4F level 4, node A
4G level 4, node B

4H loose fragment of tissue (two nodes)

4I level 2, two nodes
4K level 2, two nodes
4J level 2, four nodes
4K level 2, five nodes
4L level 2, one node

4M level 2, two nodes

4N level 3, three nodes
40 level 3, four nodes
4P level 4, two nodes

40 level 4, three nodes

4R level 4, three nodes.

Part 5 is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, initials xx
and "maxillary mucosa". The specimen consists of a 3.0 x 4.0 x 1.0 cm
fragment of mucosal lined soft tissue. A representative section is submitted
in cassette 5A.

Part 6 is received unfixed for intraoperative consultation labeled with the
patient's name, initials, xx and "right inferior maxillary, suture right
lateral margin". The specimen consists of an oriented specimen with
resection

of the maxillary sinus. This specimen is 6.6 x 5.0 x 2.2 cm with a stitch
that demarcates the right lateral margin. The sinus mucosa is grossly
unremarkable. On the inferior aspect of the specimen there is a 4.5 x 3.0 x
1.0 cm focally hemorrhagic friable mass that breaks through the superior
cribriform plate. The tumor breaks through the bone; however, the anterior,
superior and nasal septal bony margins appear to be grossly free. The lesion
is 1.5 cm from the anterior margin, 1.5 cm from the medial margin and 0.6 cm

from the posterior margin. However, it is close, if not approximates, the
lateral margin. A digital photograph is taken of the inferior aspect of the
specimen with the tumor. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
6AFS tissue nearest right lateral margin

6B anterior shave

6C medial shave

6D posterior shave

6E anterior bone

6F nasal septal bony margin (decalcification)

6G superior bony margin (posterior) (decalcification)

6H 6I tumor with bone (decalcification)

6J posterior soft tissue with tumor

6K tumor in bone (decalcification)

representative sections of tumor.

- is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, initials xx
and "maxillary bone fragment." The specimen consists of an aggregate of
fragments of bone that is 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted for
decalcification in cassette 7A.
Part 8 is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, initials xx
and "additional margin maxilla, right lateral plus superior." The specimen
consists of a 5.5 x 0.1 x 0.3 cm focally hemorrhagic mucosa—lined tissue
fragment. The specimen is submitted in its entirety in 8A or 8B.
Part 9 is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, initials xx
and "additional margin lateral and inferior." The specimen consists of a 2.0
x 1.5 x 0.6 cm focally hemorrhagic, soft tissue fragment that is submitted in

s tirety in cassettes 9A through 9B.
