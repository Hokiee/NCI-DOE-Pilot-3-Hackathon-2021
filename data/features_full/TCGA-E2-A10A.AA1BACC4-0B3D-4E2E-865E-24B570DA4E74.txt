SPECIMEN:
Other
mastectomy
Block Number: D4
ER: Positive - Allred Score: 7 = Proportion score: 4 + Intensity Score 3
PR: Positive - Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3
COMMENT:
The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the
proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of
cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak
intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring
range from 0 to 8.
ER/PR positive is deﬁned as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is deﬁned as an Allred score of
less than or equal to 2.
Methodology: Fixation Type and Length: Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin ,

) for no less than 8 and no lonoerthan 94 hours. Antibody and Assay Methodology:
Mouse anti-human ER and PR, .
Comment: This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for hormone therapy (1).
ER and PR analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the ER (ER 1D5,
1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100) antibody provided by following the manufacturer's instructions
listed in the package insert. This assay was not modiﬁed, and adherence to all instruction and
guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical staining
characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (1), information provided by the
reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department.

Patthsion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit
Case No .
Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED
Clinical Interpretation of results
Ampliﬁcation of the HER—2 gene was evaluated with interphase ﬂuorescence in-situ
hybridization (FISH) on formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn embedded tissue sections using a chromosome
17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER—2 gene in the
I. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17
signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no
ampliﬁcation of the HER2/neu gene.
Block used D4 Source of case: RPCI
Tissue ﬁxation formalin-ﬁxed tissue Outside Case N0:NA
Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes
HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.21
This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of
CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic
mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded.

Method of ratio enumeration: manual count

No

Limitations

The Vysis Patthsion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is
intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free
and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding
adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into
consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status.

treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-

2/neu

gene ampliﬁcation status alone.
Overview of this test
FDA APPROVED REAGENT
Patthsion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of
patients for whom Herceptin® therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the
under the direction
of The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the
clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.
