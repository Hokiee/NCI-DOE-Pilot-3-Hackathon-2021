'FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
PART 1W. SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY —
A.

INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA,NOS TYPE, POORLY DIFFERENTIATED.
B. THE INVASIVE TUMOR S 2.0 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION.NOTTINGHAM GRADE 3 (TUBULE
FORMATION 3, NUCLEAR PLEOMORPHISM 3, MITOTIC ACTIVITY 3; TOTAL SCORE 9/9).
DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN-SITU (DCIS), NUCLEAR GRADE 3, MICROPAPILLARY AND PAPILLARY TYPES
WITH COMEDONECROSIS; CONSTITUTES 60% OF THE TOTAL TUMOR MASS AND IS PRESENT ADMIXED
WITH AND AWAY FROM THE INVASIVE COMPONENT.

D. LYMPH VASCULAR SPACE INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.
RESECTION MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA, HOWEVER THE INVASIVE CARCINOMA EXTENDS

E.
T0 0.5 CM FROM THE ANTERIOR MARGINDUCTAL CARCINOMA INoSITU EXTENDS TO <0.1 CM FROM THE
LATERAL MARGIN AND 0.2 CM FROM THE ANTERIOR MARGIN.

SKIN IS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES WITH DUCTAL EPITHELIAL HYPERPLASIA, PREVIOUS BIOPSY SITE CHANGES.

F.

G.

H. THE INVASIVE TUMOR CELLS ARE POSITIVE FOR ESTROGEN AND PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS AND
NEGATIVE FOR HER-2 (1+), AS PER PREVIOUS PATHOLOGY REPORT

C.

PART 2: BREAST, RIGHT, NEW DEEP MARGIN, SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY -

A. NO CARCINOMA IDENTIFIED.
B. FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES WITH DUCTAL EPITHELIAL HYPERPLASIA,COLUMNAR CELL CHANGE.

PART 3: LYMPH NODE, RIGHT AXILLA, SENTINEL #1, BIOPSY —

ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (011).
