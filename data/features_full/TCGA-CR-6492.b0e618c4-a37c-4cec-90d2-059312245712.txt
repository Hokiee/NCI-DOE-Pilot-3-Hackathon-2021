DIAGNOSIS:

1) MUCOSA, RIGHT DEEP MARGIN, EXCISION: INVOLVED BY SQUAMOUS CELL
CARCINOMA.

2) SOFT TISSUE, POSTERIOR MUCOSAL MARGIN, EXCISION: SQUAMOUS MUCOSA WITH
CHRONIC INFLAMMATION, NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.

3) SOFT TISSUE, LEFT MUCOSAL MARGIN, EXCISION: SQUAMOUS MUCOSA WITH CHRONIC
INFLAMMATION, NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.

4) SOFT TISSUE, NEW DEEP RIGHT MARGIN, EXCISION: FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE,
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.

5) LYMPH NODE, RIGHT NECK LEVELS 2-5, EXCISION: 1 OF 33 LYMPH NODES
INVOLVED BY SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA, LARGEST FOCUS MEASURING 2.4 CM,
(1/33), NEGATIVE FOR EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION.

6) SALIVARY GLAND AND LYMPH NODE, RIGHT NECK LEVEL 1, EXCISION: BENIGN
SALIVARY GLAND, 4 LYMPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (0/4).

7) PALATE, EXCISION: INVASIVE SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA, MODERATELY TO
POORLY-DIFFERENTIATED, 3.5 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION, INVOLVING THE DEEP
(BLACK) TISSUE EDGE; PERINEURAL INVASION PRESENT; BENIGN SALIVARY GLAND,
(SEE COMMENT #1).

8) SOFT TISSUE, ADDITIONAL RIGHT DEEP MARGIN, EXCISION: BENIGN SALIVARY
GLAND, NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY, (SEE COMMENT #1).

COMMENT #1: Although tumor is present at the deep tissue edge of specimen
#7, specimen #8 (additional R deep margin) supersedes this area, thus the

final margin is negative for malignancy. These findings correspond to AI CC
I Edition pathologic Stage III (pT 2, le, erMa).

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1) SOURCE: Deep Right Margin

The specimen is received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number along with the designation "deep right
margin" and consists of a 0.6 X 0.5 X 0.2 cm piece of red soft tissue. The
entire specimen is submitted for frozen section diagnosis.

Summary of sections: lAFSC, entire specimen, 1/ 1.

2) SOURCE: Posterior Mucosal Margin
Received fresh and submitted for frozen section is a 3.5 X 0.2 X 0.1 cm
piece of red-tan tissue with a mucosal surface. The tissue is submitted

entirely for frozen section.
Summary of sections: 2AFSC, 1/ 1.

3) SOURCE: Left Mucosal Margin

Received fresh in a container and submitted for frozen section labeled
"left mucosal margin" are 2 strips of tissue with a mucosal surface, each
measuring 1.0 X 0.3 X 0.3 cm. The tissue is submitted entirely for frozen
section.

Summary of sections: 3AFSC, 2/ 1.

4) SOURCE: New Deep Right Margin

The specimen is received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's

name and medical record number, as well as the designation "new deep right
margin" and consists of two pieces of cauterized red, soft tissue which
measures 4.0 X 3.0 X 1.0 cm and 4.0 X 2.0 X 1.0 cm. The entire specimen is
submitted for frozen section diagnosis.

Summary of sections: 4AFSC, tissue for frozen section diagnosis, 2/ 1.

5) SOURCE: Right Neck Levels 2-5

Received fresh labeled "right neck level 2-5 stitch superior" is a radical
neck dissection with a possible submandibular gland, a stitch through the
superior margin. The gland measures 3.0 X 2.5 X 2.0 cm. The remainder of
the neck measures 10.0 X 6.0 X 2.2 cm. Multiple metallic clips are
identified. No jugular vein is grossly identified attached to the specimen.
The metallic clips are removed. The outer surface of the gland is inked.

The cut surfaces of the submandibular gland are pale yellow-white, vaguely
nodular with a cystic area measuring 1.4 X 1.0 X 0.7 cm. The cystic area
contains brown-tan grumous material. Multiple candidate lymph nodes are
recovered.

Summary of sections: 5A-5C, submandibular gland, 1/1 each, level 3 lymph
nodes, superior to inferior 5D, 1 possible lymph node, 2/ 1; SE, 1 possible
lymph node, 2/ 1; SF, 1 possible lymph node, 5/ 1; 5G, 2 possible lymph
nodes, 2/ 1; level 4, superior to inferior possible candidate lymph nodes;

5H, 2 possible lymph nodes, 2/ 1; 51, 1 possible lymph node bisected, 2/ 1;
5], 1 possible lymph node bisected, 2/ 1; 5K, 1 possible lymph node
trisected, 3/ 1; 5L, 1 possible lymph node bisected, 2/ 1; 5M, 2 possible
lymph nodes, 2/1 each, level 5 lymph nodes superior to inferior 5N-5W, 1
possible lymph node in each cassette bisected, 2/1 each; 5X, 2 possible
candidate lymph nodes, 2/ 1; 5Y, 1 lymph node bisected, 2/ 1.

6) SOURCE: Right Neck Level 1

Received fresh in a container labeled "right neck level 1" is a 5 cm X 3 cm

X 2 cm piece of yellow lobulated tissue when palpated reveals 4 candidate
lymph nodes. Bisecting these lymph nodes reveals a firm white area with a
small portion of grossly normal appearing lymph node parenchyma.
Summary of sections: 6A, 2 lymph nodes bisected, 4/ 1; 6B, 1 bisected lymph
node with 1 smaller lymph node, 3/ 1.

7) SOURCE: Palate
Received fresh in container labeled with patient's name, medical record

number and palate, is a 4.5 X 4.0 X 1.2 cm palate eXCision. A stitch is
placed to indicate the anterior margin. There is a 3.5 cm X 2.7 cm

eXOphytic lesion on the mucosal surface of the palate eXCision. This lesion
is centrally located within the mucosal surface and is grossly 0.2 cm from
the posterior margin as its closest margin. It is located 0.3 cm from
anterior margin, 0.7 cm from superior margin, and 0.3 cm from inferior
margin. The deep margin has significant cautery artifact. The specimen is
inked in the following fashion: Deep cut surface black, anterior red,
posterior orange, superior yellow, inferior blue.

Summary of sections: The specimen is then serially sectioned from anterior
to posterior to reveal the eXOphytic mass eXtending into the deep tissue,
abutting the black inked margin. Grossly, the specimen appears not to
involve the remaining margin. Representative sections of each margin with
closest tumor are submitted.

Summary of sections: 7A, anterior and posterior margin, 2/ 1; 7B, tumor to
deep black margin, 2/ 1; 7C, tumor closest to yellow inked margin, 1/ 1; 7D,
tumor closest to blue inked margin, 1/ 1; 7E, representative tumor to blue
inked and black margin (this is not closest margin), 2/ 1.

8) SOURCE: Additional Right Deep Tissue

Received fresh in a container labeled "additional" are aggregates of tissue
measuring 3.0 X 1.0 X 0.6 cm. The tissue has cautery artifact associated
with submitted tissue. Tissue is submitted entirely over two cassettes.
Summary of sections: 8A-8B, M/1 each.
