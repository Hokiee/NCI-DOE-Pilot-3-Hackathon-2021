RECEIVED IN 2 PARTS.

A RECEIVED LABELED— RIGHT BREAST STITCH AT 12 O'CLOCK IS
A 2041 SIMPLE MASTECTOMY MEASURING 33.5 CM FRCM MEDIAL TO LATERAL, 28 CM
FROM SUPERIOR TO INFERIOR, AND UP T0 5.5 CM FROM ANTERIOR TO POSTERIOR.
THE NIPPLE IS INVERTED WITHIN A 31 X 17 CM SKIN ELLIPSE. A SUTURE '
DENOI‘ES 12 O‘CLOCK. 4 CM LATERAL TO THE NIPPLE AT 9 O‘CLOCK IS A
LOBULATED RED—TAN GLISTENING MASS MEASURING 2.2 CM FROM SUPERIOR TO
INFERIOR, 2 CM FROM ANTERIOR TO POSTERIOR, AND 4.5 CM FROM MEDIAL TO
LATERAL. THIS LESION IS 2.5 CM FROM THE DEEP MARGIN. TOWARDS THE
LATERAL EDGE THERE IS A 2ND NODULE ADJACENT BY LESS THAN 1 CM MEASURING
1 X l X 1 CM. THERE IS A RIBBON CLIP ASSOCIATED WITH THIS AREA. THE
REMAINING BREAST TISSUE CONSISTS OE‘ BLAND YELLOW FATTY TISSUE WITH FINE
FIBROUS BANDS. A WING CLIP IS IDENTIFIED IN THE LARGER LESION.
REPRESENTATIVE SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: Al-SNIPPLE, A2—-DEEP
