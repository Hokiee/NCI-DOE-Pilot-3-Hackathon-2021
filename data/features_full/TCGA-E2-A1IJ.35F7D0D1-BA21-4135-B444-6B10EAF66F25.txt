GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. RIGHT BREAST CANCER

. (C-E) by Dr.

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "right breast" is an oriented, 74-9,
7.6 x 6 x 4.3 cm needle localized lumpectomy specimen with two radiographs. The single suture
designates anterior, double-lateral, triple-superior. lnk code: Anterior-yellow, posterior-black, medial-
green, lateral-red, superior-blue, inferior-orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to
lateral into 6 slices, revealing a ﬁrm tan mass with granular cut surface, 2 x 1.2 x 1 cm, located 0.8 from

A2-A3: Mass and anterior, slice 2
A4-A5: Mass and medial, slice 2
A6-A7: Mass, inferior/ anten'or, slice 3

A10: Superior, slice 3

A11: Posterior, slice 3

A12: Mass, inferior/ anterior, slice 4
A13: inferior/anterior, slice 5

B4: Nodule
B5: Sen‘al sections
C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "Sentinel lymph node #1 " is a
fragment of ﬁbroadipose tissue, 3 x 2.3 x 1.1 cm showing one possible 2-cm lymph node. Touch
preparation is performed. The lymph node is entirely submitted in cassette C1.

D. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "Sentinel lymph node #2" is a
fragment of ﬁbroadipose tissue. 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm, showing a possible 2.3-cm lymph node. Touch
preparation is performed. The lymph node is entirely submitted, D1.

E. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #3

Received fresh labeled with the patient‘s identiﬁcation and designated "Sentinel lymph node #3" is a
fragment of ﬁbroadipose tissue, 3.1 x 2.2 x 1.1 cm, showing a possible 1 .5—cm lymph node. Touch
preparation is performed. The lymph node is entirely submitted, E1.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. BREAST, RIGHT, WIDE LOCAL EXCISION:

TSS ID

- INVASIVE LOBULAR CARgINOMA. SBR GRADE 2, MEASURING 1.5-CM

- LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU”

— SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS NEGATIVE FOR INVASIVE TUMOR

- LOIS PRESENT AT LATERAL AND MEDIAL SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS AND WITHIN 1 MM
FROM INFERIOR SURGICAL RESECTION MARGIN

- BIOPSY SITE CHANGES WITH FIBROSIS

- FIBROADENOMA

- SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT AND SEE NOTE.

B. BREAST. RIGHT. LATERAL MARGIN. EXCISION:

- INVASIVE LOBULAR CARCINOMA. SBR GRADE 2, MEASURING 0.6-CM
- LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU

- LCIS PRESENT WITHIN 1 MM FROM FINAL LATERAL MARGIN

- INVASIVE TUMOR PRESENT 2.5 MM FROM FINAL LATERAL MARGIN

- SEE NOTE.

C. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #1, RIGHT AXILLA. EXCISION:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1).

D. LYMPH NODE. SENTINEL #2, RIGHT AXILLA. EXCISION:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1).

E. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #3, RIGHT AXILLA. EXCISION:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (Ol1).

NOTE: The in situ and invasive tumors are negative for E-cadherin, compatible with Iobular carcinoma
phenotype. In part A., the main tumor mass is identiﬁed in slices #2 and 3. However, additional
scattered foci of invasive Iobular carcinoma are identiﬁed in slices #4, 5, 6 and 7. Moreover, the
additional submitted lateral margin (part B.) shows invasive Iobular carcinoma (0.6-cm). Therefore, this
tumor is considered multifocal. Lobular carcinoma in situ is identiﬁed throughout the submitted
sections.

The closest surgical resection margin to invasive Iobular carcinoma is the lateral (2.5 mm). LCIS is
identiﬁed at medial and within 1 mm from inferior and lateral surgical resection margins.
