Gross Description
Received are specimen containers A to E. Al1 requisitions and specimen containers are
labelled with the patient's name, ,. The cassettes and ' identifiers are
labelled with the surgical Number :;
A. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin, designated
as "A — lymph node group 8 at '. The specimen consists of an irregular portion of
fibrofatty tissue measuring 2.0 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm. Two possible lymph nodes are identified

ranging in size from 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm to 1.4 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm. Sections are submitted as
follows:

A1. two possible lymph nodes

A2. remainder of tissue submitted in toto

B. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin, designated
as "B - gallbladder at l. The specimen consists of a brown tan non-intact

gallbladder measuring 11.5 x 4.8 x 2.3 cm. The serosal surface is tan to dark brown,
smooth and congested. A surgical defect is identified at the fundus measuring 2.4 cm in
length. Cystic duct is patent. Cystic duct lymph node is not identified. The lumen
does not contain bile or calculi, however, two calculi are received with the specimen.
Both are black and ovoid. The smaller calculus measures 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. The larger
calculus measures 4.0 x 2.8 x 2.4 cm. There are tan and hemorrhagic exudate adherent to
the mucosa. The mucosa is brown and fibrotic. The wall is thickened and averages 0.6 cm
in thickness. Sections are submitted as follows:

Bl. cystic duct margin and representative sections from neck and body

32. representative sections from fundus including surgical defect

C. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin, designated
as “C - prepanreatic lymph node at ". The specimen consists of a rubbery irregular

portion of fibrofatty tissue measuring 2.5 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm. Specimen is submitted in toto
in one cassette.

D. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin, designated
as "D ~ Whipple specimen at ’. The specimen consists of a whipple's resection
including a portion of pancreas (7.0 x 4.0 x 1.5 cm), duodenum (25.0 cm in length and
averaging 6.0 cm in circumference), and attached peripancreatic soft tissue extending to
a maximum depth of 2.5 cm, as well as a small portion of attached mesentery extending to
a maximum depth of 2.0 cm. Proximal and distal margins are stapled. Specimen is inked
as follows: Body margin orange, vessel bed margin green, uncinate margin blue. The
common bile duct measures 4.0 cm in length and averages 0.7 cm in circumference. The
body margin of the pancreas measures 2.5 x 1.0 cm. The uncinate margin measures 6.0 x
2.5 cm. The pancreas is serially sectioned. A firm ill-defined yellow to light tan
variegated lesion is identified surrounding the common bile duct measuring 3.5 x 2.1 x1.8
cm. It is 0.5 cm from the common bile duct margin, 1.0 cm to the body margin, 0.1 cm to
the vessel bed, 1.2 cm to the uncinate margin, 0.3 cm to the posterior surface, 2.5 cm to
the anterior surface, 1.5 cm to the proximal margin, and 16.5 cm to the distal margin.
The serosal surface of the duodenum is tan and smooth and appears grossly unremarkable.

The mucosa is tan to brown and appears grossly unremarkable. Sections are submitted as
follows:

D1. common bile duct margin en face

D2-4. distal margin trisected

D5. proximal margin bisected

D6. shaved section body margin including pancreatic duct margin

D7-8. contiguous section bisected, demonstrating lesion in closest relation to the

vessel bed
margin also including uncinate margin

D9-10. contiguous section bisected, lesion in closest relation to uncinate margin
and posterior

surface which is inked purple

nil-12. contiguous section bisected, lesion underlying duodenal mucosa and including
vessel bed margin
D13. lesion in relation to anterior surface

D14. lesion in relation to posterior surface
