Gross Description:

1. The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "sigmoid and upper rectum".
It consists of a rectosigmoid colon that measures 15.5 cm in length and 5.4
cm in circumference. The open end indicates the proximal margin. The serosal
surface is intact and grossly unremarkable. The radial resection margin is
inked black and the specimen is opened to reveal a tumor that is located 9
cm from the proximal margin and 4.5 Cm from the distal margin. The tumor
measures 1.5 Cm in length and 1.3 Cm in width. Serial sectioning reveals
tumor invasion to a depth of 0.2 Cm, which is 1.5 Cm from the closest radial
margin. The remaining mucosa is unremarkable. Pericolic and peri-rectal
adipose tissue is thoroughly examined for lymph nodes, and all possible
nodes are submitted. Representative sections are submitted. TPS is
submitted.

Summary of sections:
PM - proximal margin
DM - distal margin
RM - radial margin

T - tumor

LN - lymph nodes

BLN - bisected lymph node

2). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Distal ring margin" and
consists of a ring of pink tan soft tissue measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm.
Multiple sutures and staples are attached. The mucosal surface is pink tan
and focally hemorrhagic. The sutures and staples are removed and the soft
tissue is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U - undesignated

3). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Proximal ring margin" and
consists of a ring of pink tan soft tissue measuring 1.7 x 1.7 x 1.1 cm.
Multiple sutures and staples are attached. The mucosal surface is pink tan
and focally hemorrhagic. The sutures and staples are removed and the soft
tissue is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U - undesignated

Addendum Diagnosis

Results of immunohistochemical staining for DNA mismatch repair proteins are
as follows:

MLH1: Staining present in tumor
MSH2: Staining present in tumor
MSH6: Staining present in tumor
PMS2: Staining present in tumor

Conclusion: Immunohistochemical staining for the tested DNA mismatch repair
proteins is retained in the tumor.
