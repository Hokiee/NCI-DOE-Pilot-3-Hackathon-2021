PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:

A. BRAIN, SITE NOT SPECIFIED, EXCISIONAL BIOPSY: GLIOMA, HIGH
HISTOLOGICAL GRADE, CONSISTENT WITH OLIGODENDROGLIOMA.

B. BRAIN, RECURRENT TUMOR, EXCISION: ANAPLASTIC OLIGODENDROGLIOMA.
C. BRAIN, RECURRENT TUMOR, EXCISION: ANAPLASTIC OLIGODENDROGLIOMA.
MIB-l PROLIFERATION INDEX: 50%.

SEE MICROSCOPIC AND COMMENT.

Operation/Specimen: Recurrent brain tumor; subfrontal dropped

metastasis.

Clinical History and Pre-Op Dx: year old woman with past history of
2 surgeries for oligodendroglioma. Currently, large recurrence,
multicystic.

GROSS PATHOLOGY :

A. Received fresh, one fragment, 0.5 cm across. Soft, tannish—gray.
In total #1.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, smears: Glioma (C/W
oligodendroglioma, high histological grade).

B .

SPECIMEN: 3, subfrontal dropped metastasis.

FIXATIVE: Saline.

GENERAL: A 1.1 X 0.7 x 0.3 cm. soft red—tan tissue fragment.
SECTIONS: 2 , all submitted.

C .

SPECIMEN: 2, permanent recurrent brain tumor.

FIXATIVE: Saline .

GENERAL: A 2.5 X 2.4 x 1.0 cm., 2.5 gm. aggregate of soft, red to
gray—tan brain tissue.

SECTIONS: 3—5 — all submitted.

MICROSCOPIC: A. Small fragments of brain infiltrated and focally
effaced by a glial neoplastic proliferation. The neoplastic cells have
round nuclei with occasional perinuclear halos. There is prominent
karyorrhexis, mitotic figures are found without difficulty, and there
is microvascular cellular proliferation.

B. Portions of a solid glial neoplasm. The neoplastic cells have
large round nuclei with moderate pleomorphism. The background is
finely fibrillary with microvesicular change. The vascularity is
capillary—type with focal "chicken—wire" pattern. There is prominent
endothelial and microvascular cellular proliferation, focally. There
are mitotic figures throughout the neoplasm. There is no necrosis.

C. Portions of brain extensively effaced by a glial neoplastic

proliferation similar to that one described for parts A and B.

In here, the neoplasm seems to be growing in the leptomeningeal space.
The focally surrounding white matter is rarefied and gliotic.
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP, MIB-l, and
factor VIII antigen were performed on sections from block #4.

The GFAP demonstrates numerous gliofibrillary oligodendrocytes and
minigemistocytes. With the MIB—l a proliferation index of 50% is
determined in the more active areas. The factor VIII depicts a high
density of microvessels and prominent microvascular cellular
proliferation.

COMMENT: The neoplasm present in the three specimens is an
oligodendroglioma with prominent cellularity, mitotic activity, and
microvascular cellular proliferation, features of an anaplastic
oligodendroglioma. The MIB—l proliferation index is 50%.

The neoplasm
seems to be growing in the leptomeninges.
