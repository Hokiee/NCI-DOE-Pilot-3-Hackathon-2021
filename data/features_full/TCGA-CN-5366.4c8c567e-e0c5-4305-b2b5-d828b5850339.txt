cinoma has focal areas with glandular—like differentiation, however,

it is negative for mucin utilizing mucicarmine and PAS with and without
diastase stains. This indicates that this is a squamous cell carcinoma,
acantholytic type.

  

My si estation that I have personally reviewed the submitted
material(s) and the final diagnosis reflects that evaluation.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in nine parts.

Part 1 is received in formalin labeled with the patient' s name, initials xx
and "level ZB right neck." The specimen is a 4.0 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm fibroadipose
excision with three lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 to 1.2 cm. The lymph nodes
are submitted in cassette A (largest inked black and bisected).

Part 2 is received in formalin labeled with the patient' s name, initials xx
and "level 2, 3, 4, right neck." The specimen is a 15.0 x 5.0 x 2.0 cm
modified radical neck dissection. No sternocleidomastoid muscle, external

jugular vein or spinal accessory nerve present. In level 2 is a 4.0 x 3.0 x
2.2 cm area of matted, grossly involved lymph nodes. Additionally are
multiple

separate lymph nodes, ranging from 0.1 to 1.3 cm. The lymph nodes are
submitted as follows:

2A—ZB — matted lymph nodes in level 2, full thickness section, bisected
2C — two level 2 lymph nodes

2D — six level 3 lymph nodes

2E — nine level 4 lymph nodes.

Part 3 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials xx and
"left neck, level 2, 3, 4." The specimen is a 13.0 x 4.0 x 1.0 cm modified

radical neck dissection. No sternocleidomastoid muscle, external jugular
vein

or spinal accessory nerve present. Multiple lymph nodes range from 0.1 to
1.7

cm are present, the largest lymph node in level 3. The lymph nodes are
submitted as follows:

3A — level 2, node A

33 — level 3, node A

3C — level 3, node B

3D — level 4, node A

3E — level 4, node B

3F — level 4, node C

3G — level 4, node D

3H — eight level 2 lymph nodes

3I — multiple level 2 lymph nodes

3J — one level 3 lymph node, bisected
3K — six level 3 lymph nodes

3L — three level 4 lymph nodes

3M — multiple level 4 lymph nodes.

Part 4 is received fresh and labeled with the patient' s name, initials xx
and

"larynx and pharynx." The specimen is a laryngopharyngectomy specimen
including a total laryngectomy (11.0 cm epiglottic tip to distal trachea, 6.0
cm right to left and 7.0 cm anterior to posterior" with attached 7.5 cm long
segment of pharynx (6.5 cm maximum circumference), 9.0 cm long by 1.5 cm
diameter hyoid bone, 5.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm thyroid gland with no identified
parathyroid glands and a 3.5 cm long tracheostomy site surrounded by a 4.5 x
3.5 cm piece of skin. Five tracheal rings are present in the laryngectomy
specimen.

Centered in the right inferior pyriform sinus of the hypopharynx is a 7.0 cm
long x 5.0 cm in circumference ulcerated tumor with white solid cut surface.
The tumor is up to 2.3 cm in maximum depth with extension very close to the
right superior piriform sinus soft tissue and 0.9 cm from distal esophageal
margin. The tumor extensively invades the larynx submucosally involving a
large poriton on the right, undermining of the right true and false vocal
cords and invading through the right anterior thyroid cartilage with
extension

into the right and anterior perilaryngeal soft tissues closely approximating
the right lateral soft tissue margin. The tumor extends towards the base of
the epiglottis and focally involves the pre—epiglottic soft tissue and
extends

inferorly involving the posterior aspect of the cricoid cartilage with
extension to, but not into the right superior thyroid gland. Separate from
the main tumor is a 0.3 cm mucosal nodule at the inferor right epiglotic
base.

The remainder of the laryngeal mucosa is tan without focal abnormalities.
Thyroid and cricoid cartilages are moderately—to—severely calcified.

INK CODE :
Pre—epiglottic soft tissue superiorly = green anterior lateral and posterior
perilaryngeal and pharyngeal soft tissue = black.

SECT ION CODE:

4A — superior pyriform sinus, shave margin (frozen section control)

4C—4D — sagittal section from epiglottis through anterior commisure
including pre—epiglottic soft tissue, bisected (4D submitted after decal)

4E — left true and false vocal cords

4F — left aryepiglottic fold (shave) and pyriform sinus (perpendicular)
margins (pyriform sinus inked orange)

4G—4H — right true and false vocal cord with underlying submucosal tumor
and tumor invading thyroid cartilage with adjacent lateral soft tissue
margin,

bisected and submitted after decal

4I — nodule at base of epiglottis in relation to underlying tumor with
tumor involving pre—epiglottic space

4J—K — circumferential section through pharyngeal tumor in relation to
thyroid cartilage and posterior margin, bisected (posterior margin in K)
4L—4M — cirumferential section of tumor in relation to cricoid cartilage,

thyroid gland and posteror margin, bisected (posterior margin in M)
4N — tumor to trachea

4O — additional right thyroid gland
4P — right tracheostomy

4Q — left thyroid gland

4R — left tracheostomy

4S — left soft tissue shave margin.

Part 5 is received fresh and labeled with the patient' s name, initials xx
and

"esophgeal margin, stitch right superior." The specimen is a 2.2 cm in
circumferential section of grossly unremarkable mucosa. Deep margin inked
blue. The specimen is entirely submitted as follows:

5A — true margin (frozen section control)

5B — remainder of specimen.

Part 6 is received in formalin and labeled with the patient' s name, initials
xx and "right base of tongue." The specimen is a 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm strp of

mucosa with a 0.9 cm white solid nodule. Deep margin inked blue. The
specimen

is entirely submitted in cassette 6A after frozen section examination.

Part 7 is received in formalin and labeled with the patient' s name, initials
xx and "upper pharyngeal wall." The specimen is a 3.5 x 2.8 cm piece of
pharyngeal wall, up to 1.3 cm thick with no grossly identified tumor. The
deep margin is inked black. The speicmen is entirely submitted in cassettes
7A—7D.

Part 8 is received fresh and labeled with the patient' s name, initials xx
and

"right base of tongue." The specimen is a 5.0 cm in circumference strip of
mucosa. Deep margin inked black and lateral half additionally inked yellow.

8A — true margin (frozen section contrl)

8B — remainder of specimen.

Part 9 is received in formalin and labeled with the patient' s name, iitials
xx and "right level 2 node." The specimen consists of a 0.9 cm lymph node

with surrounding adipose tissue. The specimen is bisected and entirely
ted in cassette A.
