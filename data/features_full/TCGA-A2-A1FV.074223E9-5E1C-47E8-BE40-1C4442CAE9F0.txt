FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued):

- NIPPLE/ SKIN INVOLVEMENT: NOT IDENTIFIED.
- ANCILLARY STUDIES (performed on core biopsy
- ESTROGEN RECEPTORS: POSITIVE.
- PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS: POSITIVE.
- HER 2 NEU by IHC: NEGATIVE.

D. SOFT TISSUE, NEW INFERIOR MARGIN, EXCISION:
— FIBROADIPOSE CONNECTIVE TISSUE AND SCATTERED ATROPHIC BREAST
PARENCHYMA; NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.

Comments:

Macroscopically, two masses were noted within the outer upper and outer
mid regions, separated by approximately 1.5 cm. However, sampling of the
intervening tissue confirms the presence of invasive lobular carcinoma.
The masses have a similar histologic appearance of invasive lobular
carcinoma, grade 2. Therefore, the upper outer/mid tumors are best
classified as a single mass and staged as pT3. A smaller separate tumor
is noted within the inner upper quadrant.

The prior core biopsy ) and ancillary studies are reviewed.

This case received prospective peer review.

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Patient : Specimen # :

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A: Received fresh, labelled with the patient's name _

and designated, "Sentinel Node #1" consists of 2.0 x 2.0 x 0.6 cm
irregular portion of red-yellow soft tissue. Sectioning reveals a single
1.3 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm pink-tan lymph node. The lymph node is bisected and
entirely submitted in 2 cassettes. '

B: Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name

and designated, "Left Axillary Tissue" consists of two irregular
shaped fragments of yellow lobular adipose tissue measuring 2.3 and 1.3 cm
in greatest dimension. Sectioning reveals six possible lymph nodes
measuring up to 0.2 cm in greatest dimension each. The specimen is
entirely submitted in three cassettes as follows: 31- five possible lymph
nodes; 82- one possible lymph node, bisected; 83- remaining adipose
tissue. ' ‘

C: Receiv:i fresh, labelled with the patient's name
and dc "giated, "Left Mastectomy (Long-Lateral; Short-Superior)" consists
of 30 gram mastectomy specimen oriented with a short stitch superior

21.0 cm r * to inferior; and 4.0 cm anterior to posterior. The
lightl' ed superficial skin ellipse measures 24.0 x 14.2 cm and
4* J cm centrally located, everted nipple. No discharge is

The deep margin is inked black. Serial sections reveal a 4.0

2'4. A 3:0 cr poorly defined mass in the mid-outer breast (mass #1). On
sectlrﬁilC t cut surface is firm, pink-white and shows a 0.3 cm
bloc ’ Jpsy cavity. The mass comes to within 0.5 cm of the deep

v Der/outer quadrant and lower/outer quadrant fibrous tissue
, mass is markedly dense and nodular. Located in the
u._;r, quae ant, adjacent to the superior-medial portion of mass #1,
is a sec: fairly well defined mass measuring 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. This
mass is located 2.0 cm from the deep margin. The second mass is located
approximately 1.5 cm from the first mass. The remainder of the specimen is
composed of lobulated, yellow-tan adipose tissue admixed with a moderate
amount of otherwise unremarkable fibrous tissue. Located along the
lateral edge of the specimen (at the junction of the deep and superficial
margins) there is a single 0.4 cm ill-defined induration. This lateral
margin is inked blue. No lymph nodes are identified. Representative
sections are submitted as follows: Cl- skin; C2- upper/outer quadrant
mass; C3- upper/outer quadrant deep margin (to C2); C4- outer mid (OM)
mass with cavity and deep margin; cs- deep margin, OM; C6- outer mid mass;
C7-C9- additional outer mid mass; C10-C11- induration along margin; C12-
upper/inner quadrant; C13- lower/inner quadrant; C14-lower/outer quadrant;
Cls-upper/outer quadrant; C16- nipple; C17— sections of firm areas between
first and second mass.

Matched sections of C1,C2,C4,C6-C9 and C12-C15 are submitted in OCT and
