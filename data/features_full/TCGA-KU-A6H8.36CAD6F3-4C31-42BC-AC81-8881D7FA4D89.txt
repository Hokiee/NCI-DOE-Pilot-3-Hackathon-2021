Gross Description:

Specimen #1 is received fresh, labeled with the patient's name. designated right posterior lateral tongue (stitch anterior) and
consists of a 4.5 x 3 cm pink-red segment of tongue excised to a depth of 0.8 cm. The tongue surface displays a 2 x 1 cm pink—red
area of ulceration located 0.5 cm from the inferior/deep margin. The superior deep margin is blue. the inferior deep margin is
black, and the specimen is serially sectioned from anterior to posterior to reveal tan-white, firm mass extending to within 0.1 cm of
the central inked margin. A representative section is submitted for frozen section and the entire Specimen is submitted for
permanent sections.

Summary of sections:

lAFS: frozen section remnant mass to deep

18: anterior perpendicular margin
1C-1 H: central sections from anterior to posterior
1|: posterior perpendicular margin.

Specimen #2 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation. labeled with the patients name, designated posterior/superior, clip
anterior and consists of a 3.7 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm tan-pink tissue, which is entirely submitted for frozen section labeled 2AFS.

Specimen #3 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation. labeled with the patient‘s name, designated posterior margin and
consists of a 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm tan-pink tissue which is submitted in toto for frozen section labeled 3AFS.

Specimen #4 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation, labeled with the patient's name, designated ﬂoor of mouth margin
(clip anterior) and consists of a 3.4 x 0.2 x 0.3 cm tan-pink tissue which is submitted in toto for frozen section labeled 4AFS.

Specimen #5 is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, designated anterior margin (clip dorsal) and consists of a 3.5
cm tan-pink tissue which is submitted in toto for frozen section labeled 5AFS.

Specimen #6 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation, labeled with the patient's name, designated anterior/superior (clip
anterior) and consists of a 3.5 cm tan-pink tissue which is submitted in toto for frozen section labeled SAFS.

Specimen #7 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation. labeled with the patient's name, designated deep posterior and
consists of a 0.8 cm tan—pink tissue, which is submitted in toto labeled 7AFS.

Specimen #8 is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name. designated right neck dissection level 18 and consists of a
5.5 x 3.2 x 1.8 cm tan-yellow, lobulated submandibular gland with attached adipose tissue to include two possible lymph nodes
measuring 1 and 2 cm. Representative sections are submitted to include all possible lymph nodes.

Summary of sections:

8A-88: representative submandibular gland
8C-8D: one lymph node. bisected per cassette.

Specimen #9 is received in formalin. labeled with the patient's name. designated right level 2A and 3 (stitch in level 2A) and
consists of an 8 x 6 x 2 cm irregular tan-pink nodular ﬁbrous tissue. A skeletal muscle and internal jugular vein are not identified.
Sectioning reveals multiple possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 cm to 4 cm. The largest lymph node displays tan-white. cystic
and grossly positive. The specimen is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:

9A—9D: level 2A largest lymph node quadrisected
9E-9H: level 2A remaining soft tissue

9i: level 3 three possible lymph nodes intact
9J: level 3 one lymph node bisected

9K-9L: one lymph node serially sectioned

9M-9N: level 3 one lymph node serially sectioned
QO-QP: level 3 one lymph node serially sectioned
10-1S: level 3 one lymph node serially sectioned .

Specimen #10 is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name. designated right level 28 and consists of a 2.5 cm tan-
yellow. ovoid unoriented tissue which is serially sectioned and entirely submitted labeled 10A-1OD.
