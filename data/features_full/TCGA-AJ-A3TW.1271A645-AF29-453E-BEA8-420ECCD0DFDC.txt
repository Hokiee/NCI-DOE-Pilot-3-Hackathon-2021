ROSS DESCRIPTlON:
Specimen is received in nine formalin ﬁlled containers labeled with the patients name '

A. ContainerA is additionally labeled #1 and contains a 2.8 x 2.1 x 1.4 cm yellow—tan tabulated ovary received with attached paraovarian soft tissue and
segment of ﬁmbriated fallopian tube. The fallopian tube is 3.0 cm in length and ranges from 0.4 to 0.6 cm in diameter. It is studded with multiple
uniloculated paratubal cysts up to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The cysts feature smooth inner linings and contains yellow-tan serous ﬂuid. Sections
through the paraovarian solt tissue reveal a ﬁbrovascular cut surface with no discrete lesions. The surface of the ovary is remarkable for focal ﬁbrous
adhesions. The cut surface is yellow-tan ﬁbrous with multiple gray-white corpora albicantia. Representative cocoons are submitted in cassettes A1 45
labeled aslgnated as follows; 1. Cross sedions of fallopian tube to include paratubal cyst: 2 and 3. Sections from ovary to include
surface aonesrons.

8. Container B is additionally labeled #2 and contains a 2.3 x 2.0 x 1.5 an purple-gray rubbery soft tissue sectioned to reveal a yellowtan ﬁbrovascular

cut surface. No nodules or lesions are identiﬁed. Specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes 81 and 2 labeled

C. Container 0 is additionally labeled #3 and contains a 70.4 gram uterus with attached cervix received devoid of adnexa. The 4.5 cm in length by 4.0 x
3.0 cm uterine corpus that is surfaced by pink—tan glistening serosa. The 2.8 cm in length by 2.7 x 2.5 cm uterine cervix is partialtysurfaced by pink—tan
glistening and focally erythematous ectocervlcal mucosa and features a central 1.0 cm patent as. The sol! tissues margins are inked and the parametrla
are taken on face. The endocenrlcal canal is yellowtan and mucoid with the usual folds. The endornetrium is ﬁlled by a 4.8 x 4.0 x 3.0 "cm pink-tan
fungating friable mass. A scant amount of normal appearing pink—tan glistening endometrium is identiﬁed. 0n section, the tumor invades 1.5 cm into a
2.0 cm thick pink-tan ﬁbrous myometrlum. The normal appearing endometrlum averages 0.3 cm in thickness. Within the myometrium are three well-
circumscribed gray-white intramural and subserosal nodules ranging from 0.6 up to 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. These nodules feature gray—white
wharled and bulging cut surfaces with no evidence of hemorrhage or necrosis. The largest nodule is focally certiﬁed. Additional nodules or lesions am
not identified' .

Reprosentat‘we sections are submitted in cassettes 01-13 labeled lesignated as follows: 1. Right parametriurn, on face; 2. Left
parametrium, on face; 3. Anterior endosctooervix; 4. Posterior endoectocervix: 5. Anterior lower uterine segment; 6. Posterior lower uterine segment: 7.
Full-thickness anterior andomyomctrium to include most normal appearing endometrium; 8. Full-thickness anterior endomyornetrium to include mass; 9-
11. Full-thickness posterior endomyometrium to include mass and deepest extent of invasion; 12. Whorlad nodules and additional mass; 13. Sections
from largest. focally calcined nodule. Additionally. a yellow. green and blue cassettes are submitted for ,. .. research each labeled

0. Container D is additionally labeled Right external iliac and contains a 6.0 x 4.3 x 1.5 cm aggregate of yellow-tan ﬁbrofatty son tissue. 0n palpation.
four ﬁrm lam macihlo lvmph nodes are identiﬁed ranging from 1.4 up to 3.0 cm in greatest dimension. They are entirely submitted in cassettes 01-3
labeled esignated as follows: 01. One whole possible bisected lymph node; DZ. Two whole possible lymph nodes; D3. Ono whole
possible bisected lymph node.

E. Contalner E is additionally labeled Right obturator and contains a 3.8 x 3.8 x 2.0 cm aggregate of yellow-tan ﬁbrofatty solt tissue. On palpation. ﬁve
ﬁrm fattv possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging from 0.1 up to 6.0 cm in greatest dimenslon. They are entirely submitted in cassettes E514 labeled
designated as follows: 131. Four whole possible lymph nodes; 524. One whole possible lymph node, serially sectioned.

F. Container F is additionally labeled Right common/lower aortic and contains a 2.8 x 1.7 x 0.7 cm yellow-tan ﬁbrofatty soft tissue. 0n palpation, a 3.0
cm yellovhtan ﬁrm fatty nodule is identiﬁed consistent with possible lymph node. This nodule is triseded and entirely submitted in cassette F labeled

G. Container G is additionally labeled Left external iliac and contains a 4.0 x 2.8 x 1.5 cm aggregate of yellow-tan fibrofatty sol! tissue. 0n palpation.
Two ﬁrm fatty possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed 05 and 3.0 cm in greatest dimension. They are entirely submitted in cassettes Gl-a labeled ‘
esignsted as follows; (31. One whole possible lymph node; 6243. One whole possible quadrisected lymph node. ,
