_eeenenen— one on

imaging has a

3.1 cm right heterogeneous mass involving basal ganglia, and frontal
and

temporal lobes, with central enhancement.

OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
TOC: 11 am Right temporal mass

Operation/Specimen: A: Right temporal tumor, resection
B: Right temporal tumor, excision biopsy

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:

A and B. Brain, right frontal, biopsy and excision:
1;; Glioblastoma, with leptomeningeal invasion.
'2.:.MEB—l proliferation index: 50%.

_See'Microscopy Description and Comment.

COMMENT

The specimen is portions of cerebrum that are slightly to heavily
infiltrated ' "

by a glial neoplastic proliferation. The neoplastic nuclei tend to be
round, _ I
- Aare distributed within a dense gliofibrillary background in the solid
. areas,

and have proclivity for the white matter. Focally, there is brisk
mitotic

activity {up to 20 mitoses / ten high power fields), and the MIBel
proliferation index is high at about 50% in the more active areas.
onone eleee'enen one— there
is glial

neoplasm with tumor necrosis, microvascular cellular proliferation,
and u
' ‘necrotizing vasculopathy with thrombosis.

The neoplasm is a glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV}.

 

In part A the tumor is very cellular. In part B the cerebrum is
-sparsely to

moderately infi ltrated by the neoplasm and the glioma is present
within the

leptomeninges.

'IInterpretation

 

NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected.

Results—Comments
Testing perfdrmed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block

H slide was examined and no microdissection was

oneeded. A“very low level
, amplification was detected in the first run (1 of 2 PCRs), but we were
unable

to reproduce this result in repeat PCR reaction. The amplicon level
appears to

be below our assay detection level. The housekeeping control gene
COLQAl

showed adequate amplification. Therefore, we favor the low level
positivity as

background. u

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT
promoter

have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents.
Assessment of

MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA
followed

by realntime PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and
unmethylated DNA

sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by
serial
I dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and
was‘

assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA.‘

Factors such as the presence of >50% non—neoplastic cells in the
sample, or

extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated
MGMT .,

***Electronically Signed Out***

 

Interpretation

There is deletion at telomeric locus (D181612) on chromosome 1p and
telomeric H

loci'on chromosome 19q (two loci— D195606, PLA2G4C) suggestive of
partial

deletion of chromosome arms of 1p and 19q.

'Informative loci: D18496, D181612, D198219, D198606, PLA2G4C

Results~Comments

Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. DNA
extracted from a corresponding blood specimen was used as normal
reference

control.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3
_ markers

on 1p are 1318548, DlSlS92, and DlSSSZ (with DlS468, DlSlGlZ, and
D13496 as _ '

backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D193219, D198412, and
PLA2G4C

(With D198606 and D1981182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites
(2 or 4

nt'repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat)

polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score,

'amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used
if .the

first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or
-otherwise

ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each

chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas
with 1p

and 19q deletion.

_Results«Comments

(TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tumor

' paraffin block

H slide was reviewed and no microdissection was
needed.

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular
target

in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated
in up
. to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant
III

(EGFRVIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR
that is

commonly eXpressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically
distinct

subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has

been .
,shbwn to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the

'- tumor

suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin
fixed, -

paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The
CDNA is ' 7

then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR

products
are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this

, assay has
‘been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal

cells.‘
