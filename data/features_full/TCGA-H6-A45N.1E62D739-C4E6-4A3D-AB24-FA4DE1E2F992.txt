Procedure:

(:35 a :1

Diagnosis HOS
Distal pancreas and spleen, excision — ’3“1' -
Poorly differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma, extending into f7 ' F7CX,{\<;(<<£<3LS5,
peripancreatic soft tissues (see microscopic description). (1 $225,Ca
Carcinoma extends at least near to outer resection margin, but not ’7’}1L
definitively identified at outer margin. Proximal margin negative for Ck’

high—grade dysplasia and carcinoma (see microscopic description).
Spleen without specific diagnostic abnormalities.
Metastatic adenocarcinoma in one of twelve (1/12) lymph nodes.

Microscopic Description:
The following template summarizes the findings in this case:

Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma. The specimen also has dilated ducts
lined by mucinous epithelium, including in the grossly separate cyst
submitted in blocks A3 & A4, compatible with (branch duct—type)
intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). See note below.

Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated

Primary tumor: pT3. Carcinoma extends into peripancreatic soft
tissues.

Margins of resection: Carcinoma extends at least near to the inked
outer margin, but is not definitively identified at this margin. There
is IPMN at the proximal margin, but it appears low grade at the margin,
without high grade dysplasia or carcinoma identified at the proximal
margin.

Regional lymph nodes: le. There is metastatic adenocarcinoma in one
of twelve (1/12) lymph nodes, with the positive lymph node in block
#14.

Distant metastasis: Not applicable
Vascular invasion: Not definitively identified

Other findings: There is perineural invasion by carcinoma, including in
areas that grossly appeared normal (block #5). The spleen is without
specific diagnostic abnormalities.

Note: It is uncertain if the poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma has
arisen from the IPMN, or if the IPMN is an incidental finding in the
background. This case has been reviewed in Intradepartmental
Consultation, with essential concurrence with the interpretation, with
most reviewers favoring the IPMN is incidental.

Specimen
Distal pancreas, spleen

Clinical Information
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Pancreatic cancer

Gross Description

Received fresh in a container labeled "distal pancreas, spleen" is a 9
x 5.5 x 3.5 cm portion of distal pancreas, which attached 110 g, 10 X
7.8 x 3.5 cm, spleen. The surface of the spleen is gray—tan and
wrinkled, and on cut surface it is dark red, smooth, and glistening,
with diffuse white stippling, without gross abnormality. There are a
few areas on the hilar surface of the spleen, approximately 2 cm in
greatest dimension, where the capsule is absent. The pancreas has a
stapled margin proximally. The staples are removed and this surface is
inked black. The remainder of the surface of the pancreas is inked
blue. A firm mass can be palpated from the outer aspect of the
specimen. The specimen is sectioned, and there is a white—tan ill
circumscribed mass 4.5 x 3.7 x 2.7 cm. The mass is 3 cm from the
proximal resection margin, and 3.5 cm from the spleen. The pancreatic
duct can be traced on cut surface to the tumor, but cannot be probed.
The pancreatic duct appears to be markedly stenotic and possibly
obliterated through the area of the tumor. The pancreatic duct lining
is inked green for identification purposes. There is some residual
normal appearing tan pancreatic tissue grossly identified outside of
the mass. There is an apparent cystic structure near, but not clearly
at, the proximal margin of the specimen, 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.
This cyst is 0.2 cm from the pancreatic duct. There are a few tan
lymph nodes identified in the surrounding adipose tissue. RS-lS,
following fixation.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — vascular margin; 2 - spleen; 3,4 — entire pancreatic
cyst, with black 3 including adjacent pancreatic duct margin; 5 -
grossly normal pancreatic tissue; 6-11 — tumor, including relation to
the pancreatic duct and outer margin; 12-14 — lymph nodes: 15 -
additional tissue from proximal pancreatic margin.
