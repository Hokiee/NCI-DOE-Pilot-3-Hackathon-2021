MUSCLE INVASIVE TRANSITIONAL CELL CARCINOMA OF BLADDER

Gross Description

A. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"left distal ureter margin—PS" is a 0.7 cm frozen section tissue
remnant with a pinpoint lumen identified. Wrapped and entirely
submitted in A1.

B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"right distal ureter margin—F5" is a 0.8 cm frozen section
tissue remnant with a pinpoint lumen identified. Wrapped and
entirely submitted in El.

C. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"distal urethral margin of radical cystectomy specimen-F3" is a

3 x 2 x 0.5 cm thick frozen section tissue remnant. Entirely
submitted in C1.

D. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"left pelvic lymph node" are four nodules of tan adipose tissue
consistent with lymphoid tissue ranging in size from 2 cm down
to 1.5 cm. The excess fat is trimmed. All four nodes are
submitted entirely as follows: D1= one lymph node bisected; D2:
one lymph node bisected; D3—D4= one lymph node bisected; D5-D6=
one lymph node bisected.

E. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"right pelvic lymph node" are four nodules of tan fatty tissue.
All four nodules are submitted as follows: E1—82= one lymph node
bisected; E3: one single lymph node; E4: one single lymph node;
E5-E6= one lymph node bisected.

F. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"bladder, prostate gland and seminal vesicles“ is a radical
cystectomy specimen with attached fat measuring 16 x 11 x 7 cm.
The attached prostate measures 4.5 x 4 x 4 cm. A 3 cm defect is
identified on the prostatic urethral margin. This is grossly
consistent with tissue taken for frozen section evaluation. The
specimen is inked black on the left and blue on the right. The
right seminal vesicle measures 5 x 1 x 1 cm. The right vas
deferens measures 7 cm in length. The left seminal vesicle
measures 5 x 1 x 1 cm. The left vas deferens measures 11 cm in
length. The left and right ureters are embedded in the fat and
have been previously taken for frozen section evaluation. The
bladder is opened anteriorly and in the dome of the bladder a
circumscribed tan, friable mass is identified measuring 2.4 x 2
x 1 cm. The remainder of the bladder mucosa has a retracted
cobble-stoned appearance. No additional gross tumor is
identified. The cut surface of the mass has a very friable tan
glistening appearance and grossly appears to have invaded into
the muscularis. The posterior bladder all on cut surface is
grossly unremarkable. The left and right lateral bladder walls
are serially sectioned and are grossly unremarkable. The right
side of the prostate is serially sectioned to reveal a focally
nodular tan—pink grossly unremarkable parenchyma. The left
prostate is serially sectioned and in the lower one third the
parenchyma reveals a 1 cm cyst that is lined with a smooth
tissue. The lumen contains a clear fluid. Representative
sections of the Specimen are submitted as follows: F1-F3: mass
at dome on right side; F4—F6: mass at dome on left side; F7—F8=
right posterior wall; F97F10= left posterior wall; F11-F13:
right lateral wall; F14-F16: left lateral wall; F17: right
trigone; F18: left trigone; FIB—F21: representative sections of
upper, mid and lower one third of prostate, right side; F22-F24:
representative sections of upper, mid and lower one third of
prostate, left side. Also, 924 demonstrates cystic structure on

left side of rost d. Additional sections

sections of prostate upper, mid and lower one third right side;
F28-F30: representative sections of upper, mid and lower one
third of prostate left side.
