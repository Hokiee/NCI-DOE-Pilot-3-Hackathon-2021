ACCESSION: OPER DATE: REG DOC:
PROCEDURE: VERIFIED BY:

-year-old male with has long history of achalasia.
Operative Procedure/Tissue Submitted: Transhiatal esophagectomy, J~tuba
placement. Cervical esophageal margin free; non-stapled margin. |wants to know
if there is malignancy.

PROCEDURE: 1 VERIFIED BY:

1. ’Nonrstapled margin, cervical esophageal margin.” Received fresh in a small
container is a 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm strip of mucosa. The mucosa is tan-grey and
slightly granular with submcosal hemorrhages. The non-stapled end is shaved.
1A. Shaved margin.

Frozen section control.

2. ”Proximal stomach and esophagus."

Received in formalin in a large container Is a 17.5 cm long sement of
esophagus with a 6.2 x 3.2 x 1.5 cm portion of proximal stomach. The
adventitia and red and ragged with a defect noted 2 cm away from the proximal
margin. A friable grey-tan tissue is extending from the defect. The esophagus
is dilated to internal circumference of 13.3 on that narrows at the
esophagogastric junction with an internal circumference of 2.8 cm. The mucosa
of the esophagus is granular grey-white, thickened, somewhat rugate'd mouse
with areas of granular grey-white scaly tissue. It is remarkable for a 5.2 x
4.3 x 2.2 cm red-grey verrucoid tuners that is 0.1 cm away from the proximal
margin. it is also located at the aforementioned perforation. The proximal
margin is inked blue. Tuner is extremely friable. The tumor has a maxim
depth of 0.2 cm and extends to the adventitia within the area of the
perforation. Multiple possible lymph nodes are identified. They range up to
1.0 cm. '

2A - 26. Tumor to proximal margin.

20 and ZE. Tumor to deep and perforation.

2F - 2N. A strip from proximal to most distal with the proximal end inked
blue.

20 - 2X. A second strip of esophagus from proximal esophagus to distal margin.
Proximal end is inked blue.

ZY. Granular scaly esophageal moose.

22. Possible lymph nodes.

Photographs have been taken.

3. "Cervical parsesophageal lynph nodes." Received in formalin in a small
container is a 1.7 cm lymph node. Bisected.

l1. ”Cervical lymh node.” Received in formalin in a small container is a 0.4
cm portion of yellow soft tissue.

5. ”Gastrosplenic lymph node. ' Received in formalin in a small container is a
0. 6 cm portion of arey- yellow soft tissue. Definite lyrrph nodes not
