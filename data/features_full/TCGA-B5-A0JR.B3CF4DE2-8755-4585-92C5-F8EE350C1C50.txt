CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm of the uterus.

GROSS ‘ EXAMINATION:

A. "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries (AF1)". Received is a 114
gram, 9 x 7 x 3.2 cm uterus, which is bivalved to reveal a 6.5 x 3.6 cm white,
friable, polypoid tumor that diffusely involves the anterior and posterior
endometrium. The tumor invades 1 cm deep in a 1.4 cm thick anterior wall and
1.1 cm into a 1.5 cm posterior wall. It does not grossly involve the
endocervical canal and measures 4.2 cm from the ectocervix on the anterior
portion and 4.6 cm from the ectocervix on the posterior portion of the

uterus. A minimal amount of uninvolved endometrium is identified. A 0.6 x
0.5 x 0.4 cm nodule is identified in the posterior endocervix. This lesion
appears well-circumscribed and is grossly consistent with a submucosal
leiomyoma. The remaining endocervix, and ectocervix are grossly unremarkable.
The specimen also demonstrates ovaries (left ovary—2.2 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm; right
ovary 3.4 x 2.2 x 0.4 cm) and fallopian tubes (left fallopian tube - 5 x 0.6 x
0.4 cm; right fallopian tube — 5 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm). Both ovaries are
hemorrhagic on cut surface but are otherwise grossly unremarkable. The left
fallopian tube is unremarkable; however the right fallopian tube displays an
area of cautery artifact and is discontinuous.

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon‘s operative report.

G. RIGHT COMMON ILIAC LYMPH NODES: FAT ONLY

NOTE

#1: Most of the nodal tissue in all specimens is fat.

#2: The tumor is poorly—differentiated tumor, consisting in part of sheets of
undifferentiated cells and in elsewhere, as expanses of tightly cluStered
small acini. Some areas are suggestive of showing slight squamous
differentiation. Because the tumor is composed of nuclei that are on the
smaller side and have minimal cytoplasm, an immunoprofile will be performed to
exclude the possibility of a neuroendocrine component. This will be reported
separately.

I certify that I persOnally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).

ADDENDUM l: '

Immunoperoxidase stains for chromogranin and synaptophysin are negative in the
tumor cells, i.e. there is no evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation. The
previous diagnoses are unchanged.

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).
