FINAL DIAGNOSIS ' ’

A) Lymph nodes, right neck contents, excision: Metastatic papillary thyroid
carcinoma involving one (of 12) lymph nodes.

B) Lymph nodes, right paratracheal, excision: Two benign lymph nodes
end portion of parathyroid gland identified.

C, D) Thyroid, right and left lobes and isthmus, resection: Muitifocai papillary
thyroid carcinoma identified in the left and right thyroid lobes (up to 0.5
cm); no extrathyroidal extension is identified and the margins are
negative for tumor. in addition, the thyroid shows nodular hyperplasla
and marked changes of chronic lymphoch (Hashimoto’s) thyroiditls.
Five perlthyroldal lymph nodes are benign.

See synoptic findings below.

E) Lymph nodes. central compartment, excision: Two benign lymph nodes.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A) Received fresh labeled “right neck contents” is an unoriented portion of red/tan to
yellow soft tissue measuring approximately 10.5 x 7.0 x 1.5 cm. The specimen is
dissected, revealing a gray/yellow to yellow/tan. necrotic-appearing mass measuring
approximately 2.7 cm in greatest dimension. The mass also appears focally
calciﬁed. A portion of this mass is collected for the - _ .. , _

Sectioning through the remainder of the specimen reveals 18 lymph node
candidates measuring up to 0.9 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections
are submitted as follows: Mass A1-A3, and lymph node candidates A4-A7.

Sections are decalciﬂed. as needed.

B) Received fresh labeled “right paratracheal lymph nodes" is a portion of
node-bearing adipose tissue measuring approximately 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm.
Dissection yields four possible lymph nodes measuring up to 0.7 cm in greatest
dimension. These are entirely submitted as Bi.

C) Received fresh labeled "right thyroid lobe and isthmus" is a 21-gram lobe of

thyroid and isthmus. The right lobe measures approximately 6.5 x 3.0 x 1.8 cm,

while the isthmus measures approximately 3.5 x 1.8 x 1.1 cm. The capsule grossly

an indurated grey/tan nodule in the isthmus measuring 0.6 cm in greatest
dimension. Within the right lobe, there is a well-circumscribed pink/tan to pink/red
nodule present measuring 1.6 cm in greatest dimension. This lies in the inferior
pole. in the superior pole, there is a smaller nodule measuring 0.8 cm in greatest
dimension. Lateral to the lobe. there is an adherent nodule weighing approximately
20 mg and measuring 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are
submitted as follows: isthmus nodule C1, random isthmus 02. largest right lobe
nodule in its entirety 03-05, smaller right lobe nodule 06, random right lobe 07-08.
and nodule lateral to right lobe 09. The remainder of the specimen is subsequently
submitted as 610-017.

D) Received fresh labeled "left thyroid lobe" is a 21-gram lobe of thyroid measuring
approximately 6.5 x 3.8 x 1.8 cm. The capsule grossly appears intact. The
specimen is inked on its surgical margins. Sectioning reveals one
well-circumscribed tan to red/tan nodule measuring 1.5 cm in greatest dimension.
The remainder of the thyroid appears grossly unremarkable. Representative
sections are submitted as‘foliows: Entire nodule D1 -D2 and random thyroid 03-06.

E) Received fresh labeled "central compartment" are two portions of node-bearing
adipose tissue aggregating to approximately 3.0 x 2.0 x 0.8 cm. Dissection yields
three possible lymph nodes measuring up to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. These
are entirely submitted as E1. ,
