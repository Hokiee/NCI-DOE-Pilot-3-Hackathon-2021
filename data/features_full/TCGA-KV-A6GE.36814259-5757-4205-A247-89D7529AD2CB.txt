COMMENT

Histologic sections of the right renal mass show a renal cortical neoplasm forming papillae with underlying fibrovascular cores ﬁlled
with foamy macrophages. No necrosis or high-grade nuclei are identified.

lmmunohistochemical studies show the tumor cells to be positive for CK 7, AMACR, and CD 10 supporting the diagnosis of
papillary renal cell carcinoma.

The tumor is present at the parenchymal margin in an area described by the surgeon as disrupted intraoperativeiy, and not
representing the final true margin (inked orange). The rest of this parenchymal margin is negative for tumor (inked blue).

Gross Description:

The specimen is received fresh for lntraoperative consultation and labeled as right renal mass and consists of an ovoid, grey-
brown, shaggy specimen measuring 4.0 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. One half of the specimen is covered in ﬁbrous and adipose tissue while
the other half consists of tan-brown, dull, renal tissue as identiﬁed by the surgeon. Also, as per surgeon. there is a 0.4 cm defect at
the parenchymal margin. this is inked orange. The rest of the parenchymal margin is inked blue. The capsular margin is inked
black. Note is made of another defect of the capsular margin measuring 0.3 cm in diameter, this inked green. Serial sections of
this entire specimen reveal a 2.1 x 1.7 cm ﬂeshy, yellow-brown. solid mass with hemorrhagic center. There is a 1.0 mm rim of
normal renal tissue grossly identiﬁed. Also submitted with the right renal mass are fragments of yellow-tan, ﬁbrofatty tissues with
an aggregate measurement of 5.0 x 4.0 x 1.0 cm. The entire specimen is submitted as follows:

1A—1 D: Serial sections of the entire mass
1E-1 F: mass in relation to the capsule perpendicularly sectioned
1G-1 L: entire ﬁbrofatty tissue that was submitted with the renal mass.
