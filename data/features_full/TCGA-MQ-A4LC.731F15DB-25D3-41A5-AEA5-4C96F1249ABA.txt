COMMENT: The tumor present in specimens B, C and F is formed by epithelial
cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm

, round nucleus and prominent nucleoli. These cells are arranged in glands and
form papilla as well as nests. The immunohistochemical studies confirm the
diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma: the tumor cells are positive for
calretinin, thrombomodulin , WT-l, cytokeratin and negative for 372.3, CEA, and
BEREP-é. v

gt C. Received fresh labeled right lung is a right extrapleural pneumonectomy

 

       

' .t 0‘ .I HIu“-o o-llvﬂo. 0. Cal
pleura is attached at the superior part of the specimen and measures 30 x 15
cm, with 0.2 cm thickness. The thoracic, diaphragmatic, and mediastinal
surface of the lung is almost entirely covered by granular, tan indurated
nodules. The lung is serially sectioned. The lung's parenchyma is soft, red,
and free of tumor, except at the mediastinal aspect of the lung where the tumor
appears to invade the lung parenchyma. The parietal pleura also shows multiple
nodules, the largest measuring 10 x 3 x 3 cm and appears to invade the lung.
