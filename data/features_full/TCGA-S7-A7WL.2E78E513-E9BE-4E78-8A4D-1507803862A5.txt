Gross:

Ovoid tumor with ﬁbrous capsule (130x100x90 mm, 640 g), on cut brown-yellow, spotted.
Material was procured in 6 blocks

Micro: Diffusely and solidly alveolarly shaped pheochromocytoma (right) formed from large
polygonal, focally spindle-shaped and somewhere else bizarre cells with hyperchromatic
nuclei, with focal ﬁbrotisation (trichrome) and with lymfoplasmacellular infiltration, with
signs of fresh and old hemorrhage (Fe).

Nor invasion neither into vessels, nor through capsule was found, surrounding adipose tissue
was not available for evaluation. In central part of the tumor, large foci of scarring were
found.
