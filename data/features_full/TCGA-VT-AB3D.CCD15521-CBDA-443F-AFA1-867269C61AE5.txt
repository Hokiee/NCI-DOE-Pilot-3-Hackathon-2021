excision and biopsy
Operative Findings: Unspecified
Operative Diagnosis: Unspecified
Tissue Submitted: l)lateral left arm mass margin;

2)superior left arm mass margin;

3)inferior left arm mass margin; 4)medial

left arm mass margin; 5) left arm mass
Instructions to pathologists: Sources 1—4 for frozen section. Source 5—
skin
anterior long suture proximal.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1) SOURCE: Lateral

Received fresh in a container labeled "", with

medical record number and "lateral" is a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm portion of
red-brown, irregular and beefy soft tissue. No orientation is provided
and

the specimen is submitted in toto for frozen section analysis.

Summary of sections: lAFSC, 1/1.

2) SOURCE: Superior

Received fresh in a container labeled "", with
medical record number and "superior" is a 1.1 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm segment of

dark red—brown, irregular and beefy soft tissue. No orientation is
provided

and the specimen is submitted in toto for frozen section analysis.

Summary of sections: 2AFSC, 1/1.

3) SOURCE: Inferior

Received fresh in a container for frozen section analysis labeled with

the

patient's name " ", medical record number, and "inferior" is

a single, unoriented, irregular red soft tissue fragment consistent
with

skeletal muscle measuring 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The entire specimen is
placed

in a filter bag and submitted in 3AFSC, 1/1.

4) SOURCE: Medial

Received fresh in a container for frozen section analysis labeled with
the

patient's name "", medical record number, and "medial" is a

single, unoriented, irregular red soft tissue fragment consistent with
skeletal muscle measuring 0.9 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm. The entire specimen is
submitted in 4AFSC, 1/1.

5) SOURCE: Left Arm Mass

Received fresh in a container labeled with patient's name "," medical
record number and designated "left arm mass" is an

ellipse of tan—pink skin (4.2 x 1.5 cm) oriented in a superomedial to
inferolateral manner. The skin ellipse overlies a globoid portion of
red—yellow soft tissue (4.5 cm proximal to distal x 4.5 cm medial to
lateral excised to a depth of 3.5 cm) that is oriented with a long
suture

to proximal. The skin surface demonstrates blue—purple ink with no
apparent

masses or lesions. The underlying soft tissue bears a firm, palpable
mass.

The external surface; however, is smooth and glistening with focal
areas of

cautery effect. The specimen is inked as follows: proximal=blue,
distal=green, medial=yellow, lateral=orange, deep=black.

The specimen is serially sectioned revealing a subcutaneous
well-circumscribed nodular lesion abutting all margins. The mass is 0.5
cm

beneath the epidermal surface. There is a dominant nodule measuring 2.5
x

1.8 cm. The dominant nodule is fleshy brown with focal area of
hemorrhage,

possibly consistent with previous biopsy site. The surrounding tissue

varies from red—tan to white and myxoid. The largest dimensions include
4.0

cm medial to lateral x 2.5 cm superficial to deep, and it spans the
entire

distance proximal to distal (approximately 4.2 cm). Representative
sections

are submitted. Gross photographs are taken and a portion of mass is

retained in glutaraldehyde for future possible studies. The remainder
of

the specimen is retained in formalin within its original container.

Summary of sections:

5A, representative perpendicular section of proximal margin with
proximal
skin tip, l/l;
SB—SE, representative full—thickness cross section quartered
SB, superficial medial, 1/1;
5C, deep medial, 1/1;
5D, superficial lateral, l/l;
5E, deep lateral, 1/1;
5F—51, representative full—thickness cross section quartered
5F, superficial medial, 1/1;
5G, deep medial, 1/1;
5H, superficial lateral, l/l;
SI, deep lateral, 1/1
SJ, perpendicular section of distal surface and distal skin ellipse,
l/l.

In some tests, analyte specific reagents (ASRs) are used. In the case
of

an ASR, this test was developed and its performance characteristics
determined by this laboratory. It has not been cleared or approved by
the

US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such
clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical
purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.
This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments of 1988 (CLIA '88) as qualified to perform high complexity
clinical laboratory testing.
