Pertinent Clinical Information
Pertinent history: A . HM with testicular mass (right).

Gross Description
Specimen Material: Right testicle.

Received fresh for tumor banking and labeled ”RIGHT TESTICLE," is 81.0
grams, 7.0 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm right testicle with 8.0 cm in length and 1.2 x 0.4
cm cut surface attached spermatic cord. The tunica vaginalis is present and
is inked blue. The'epididymis is 5.6 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm. The tunica vaginalis
strips with ease. The tunica albuginea is gray-white and smooth.

The testicle is bi-valved to show a tan-brown tumor mass almost entirely
replacing the testicular parenchyma. There is only small rim of grossly
normal testis identiﬁed at the lower pole of the testicle. The tumor has a
central white distinct nodule measuring 1.7 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The tumor is
abutting and pushing against the tunica albuginea but is grossly not
invading. The tumor is located 8.0 cm from the spermatic cord margin, 0.1
cm from the tunica vaginalis and its adjacent tunica albuginea. The
seminiferous tubules are tan~orange.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Cassette 1. Upper spermatic cord margin

Cassette 2. Middle spermatic cord margin

Cassette A3. Lower spermatic cord margin

Cassette A4-A12. Tumor to includes tunica vaginalis, seminiferous tubules,
rete testis and epididymis

Cassette 12. Additional section of tumor

Cassette A13. Interface of the rim of normal testis and tumor, grossly
normal seminiferous tubules

Cassette A14: normal testis

Pathology Resident

Microscopic Description

Right testicular mass is a mixed germ cell tumor, mostly consistent of

classic type seminoma and mature teratoma with hyaline cartilage. Seminoma
tumor cells are staining with c-kit. The tumor is conﬁned to the testicle

with no lymphovascular or perineural invasion. Focally, ITGCN and atrophy
are seen.
