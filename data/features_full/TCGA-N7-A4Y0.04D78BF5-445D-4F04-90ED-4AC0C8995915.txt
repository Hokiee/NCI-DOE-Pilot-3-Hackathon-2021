Gross Description

The specimens are received in seven containers of formalin, each labeled with
the patient's name "W" The first container is labeled "uterus.
tube and rt. ovary." It contains a previously opened uterus with attached right
adnexa, and a fragment of left adnexa, measuring 2.5 x 1 x 0.4 cm, grossly
consistent with atrophic ovary. No left fallopian tube is identified. The
description and measurements match the intraoperative consultation. There are
adhesions present at the anterior and posterior serosa. The ectocervix measures
1.5 x 2 cm, covered by hemorrhagic epithelium with an oval 05. A necrotic area
is present in the anterior cervix, measuring 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The endocervical
canal measures 2 cm in length. The endometrium is filled with the polypoid
tan—yellow mass, as described intraoperatively. The endometrium measures 2.5 cm
in width and 4 cm in length. The maximum dimension of the mass is 6.5 cm. The
mass is involving the lower uterine segment. Further sections show an
endometrial thickness of 0.1 cm and a myometrium thickness of l to 2 cm. The
tumor invades into the outer third of the myometrial wall. The right ovary
measures 2 x l x 0.4 cm and sections of the ovary are unremarkable. The right
fallopian tube measures 6 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter. One paratubal
cyst, measuring 0.4 x 0.2 x 0,1 cm is present. The surface of the fallopian tube
is unremarkable. Sections of the ﬁallopian tube are unremarkable. Labeled Al

endomyometrium; A4, A5 ~ the other strip of anterior cervix, endocervix, Lower

ovary; A14 - sections of the right fallopian tube; A15 - section of the possible
left ovary. Jar 2.

The second container is labeled "rt. pelvic lymph node." It contains a fragment
of yellow adipose tissue bearing lymph nodes, measuring 4 x 4 x 0.5 cm. A few
lymph nodes are dissected, ranging from 0.2 cm to 2.5 x 1 x 1 cm. The largest
lymph node is firm and white, consistent with tumor involvement. Labeled Bl —
section of the largest lymph node; 82, 83 — three lymph nodes, two bisected,
half in B2 and half in BB, included in Ba is another small intact lymph node.
Jar l.

The third container is labeled "left external iliac lymph node." It contains
multiple fragments of yellow adipose tissue, measuring 4.5 x 3.5 x 0.5 cm in
aggregate. A few lymph nodes are dissected, ranging from 0.2 cm to 2 x 1 x 0.5
cm. Sections of the lymph nodes are unremarkable. Labeled Cl, C2 — two

bisected lymph nodes; C3 - one intact small lymph node. Jar 1.

The fourth container is labeled "lt. obturator lymph node.“ It contains two
lymph nodes and a fragment of yellow fatty tissue, measuring 3 x 1 x 0.5 cm in
aggregate. The two lymph nodes measures 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm and 3 x 0.8 x 0.3

cm. Sections of lymph nodes are unremarkable. One possible lymph node,

measuring 0.3 cm in greatest dimension is also identified. D1 - larger lymph
node, bisected; D2 — bisected smaller lymph node and the other intact possible
lymph node. Jar 1.

The fifth container is labeled "rt. peri-aortic." It contains one fragment of
yellow adipose tissue, bearing lymph nodes, measuring 7 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm. A few
possible lymph nodes are identified. ranging from 1.2 to 1.5 cm in greatest
dimension. Sections of the lymph nodes are unremarkable. Labeled El to E3 «
dissected lymph nodes, one each, bisected. Jar 1.

The sixth container is labeled "1t. peri-aortic." It contains several fragments
of yellow adipose tissue, measuring 2 x 1 x 0.4 cm in aggregate. Two possible
lymph nodes are dissected, measuring 0.3 to 0.7 cm in maximum diameter.

Sections of the lymph nodes are unremarkable. Labeled Fl - bisected lymph node;
F2 — an intact lymph node. Jar l.

The seventh container is labeled "abdominal scar tissue." It contains a linear
fragment of white skin, measuring 14 cm in length, 0.6 cm in width to a depth of
0.3 cm. Two well healed linear scars, measuring 2 cm and 3 cm each are present
on the surface. Sections of the fragments are unremarkable. Labeled Gl —

random sections of the skin. Jar 1.
