DIAGNOSIS
(A) LEFT KIDNEY:

 

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (2.7 CM MAXIMUM DIMENSION), CONVENTIONAL TYPE

(100% CLEAR CELLS),

FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3, CONFINED TO THE KIDNEY.
Margins of resection free of tumor.
Adrenal cortical adenoma (1.7 cm maximum dimension).

COMMENT

The renal cell carcinoma in the left kidney does not invade into the
perinephric adipose tissue, renal sinus adipose tissue, or the renal
vein.

There is no metastatic renal cell carcinoma in the adrenal gland.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
(A) LEFT KIDNEY, STERILE - A radical nephrectomy specimen (20.0 x 10.0
x 8.0 cm) with an attached 2.5 x 0.4 cm segment of ureter, 1.5 x 0.4 cm
segment of renal vein and 7.5 x 6.5 cm unremarkable adipose tissue.

A fairly well circumscribed tumor (2.7 x 2.7 x 2.0 cm) is located
on the anterior aspect of the mid-portion of the kidney. The tumor is
well-circumscribed and abuts the renal sinus and perinephric adipose
tissue. The renal vein is free of tumor. The surface of the tumor is
yellow-tan and hemorrhagic.
No other lesions are identiﬁed within the kidney parenchyma, which is
othenNise unremarkable. The adrenal gland measures 3.5 x 2.5 cm and
shows a single 1.7 cm solitary nodule. The nodules has a bright
yellow-orange surface and fails to demonstrate any signiﬁcant necrosis.

INK CODE: Blue-perinephric adipose tissue.

SECTION CODE: A1, ureter, renal vein and artery, en face; A2-A8,
renal mass totally embedded (A2-A4, tumor and renal sinus; A5-A8, tumor
and perinephric adipose tissue); A9-A12, adrenal tumor totally embedded;
A13, unremarkable kidney parenchyma. -

CLINICAL HISTORY
None given.
