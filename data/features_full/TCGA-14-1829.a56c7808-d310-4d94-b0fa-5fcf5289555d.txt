uracil and subsequent PCR usin rimers s ecific for either methylated or the
modified unmethylated DNA ( The
PCR products were analyzed in duplicate parallel runs by capillary gel

electrophoresis. The sensitivity of the assay based on DNA dilution studies

is at least 1:1000.

RESULT:
The analyzed region of the MGMT promoter is UNMETYLATED.

INTERPRETATION:
MGMT (06 methylguaine DNA methyltransferase) is a DNA repair gene. Methylation
of the promoter leads to gene silencing and loss of MGMT expression. A recent
study that tested the methylation status of the same region of the MGMT
promoter in glioblastomas found that MGMT promoter methylation was an
independent favorable prognostic factor and was associated with a survival

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

COMMENT:
necrosis are present. Taken together, these findings are diagnostic for

glioblastoma with an oligodendroglial component. Fluorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH) for loss of heterozygous of Chromosomes 1P and 19Q, and
amplification of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) will be performed and
reported as an addendum to this report. MGMT Promotor Methelation Analysis
will be sent to an outside laboratory, and results will be addended to this

report.

SPECIMEN:
1. Left temporal brain lesion.
2. Left temporal brain lesion.

CLINICAL HISTORY/OPERATIVE FINDINGS:
Craniotomy for tumor (L). Brain lesion.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
Two Specimens are received, each labeled with the patient‘s name and medical

record number.

Specimen #1 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation and designated
"left temporal brain lesion.” The specimen consists of multiple fragments of
soft gray tissue meaSuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. Representative
tissue is submitted for frozen section diagnosis and the contents of the
cryoblock are transferred to cassette "FSlA." A touch preparation is made.
The remainder of the specimen is submitted entirely in cassette "lB."

Specimen #2 is received in formalin and labeled as "left temporal brain
lesion." The specimen consists of multiple fragments of brain tissue

measuring 5.0 x 5.0 x 1.5 cm in aggregate. Re resentative sections are
submitted in sssssssss "2A" through "."2F _ _;

FLUORESCENCE IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION

INTERPRETATION:
Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed using the above listed DNA
probes (Vysis Inc.). The probes were simultaneously hybridized to a section of

the formalin~fixed paraffin—embedded tissue submitted for evaluation.

Of 200 interphase nuClei analyzed, 24% demonstrated loss of signal for the

The results of this test should not be used alone as the sole basis for
diagnosis and/or treatment. These results may, howaver, prove useful when
used in conjunction with other diagnostic procedures and clinical evaluations.
Use of these results, in this manner, can be considered to fall within the

scope of practice of medicine. This test was develo ed and its performance
characteristics determined by 131*. It has not been
