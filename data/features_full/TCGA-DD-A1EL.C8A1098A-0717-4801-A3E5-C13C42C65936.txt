DIAGNOSIS:

A. Liver, seg nt III, resection: Grade 3 (of 4)
hepatocellular carcinoma forming a 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm mass. All
surgical resection margins are negative for tumor (minimum tumor
free margin, 0.8 cm). There is no vascular space involvement.
The histological features of the adjacent liver parenchyma will
be reported in an addendum.

B. Gallbladder, cholecystectomy: Mild chronic cholecystitis.
A single benign cystic duct lymph node is identified.

C. Liver, segment VII and VIII, resection: Grade 3 (of 4)
hepatocellularVéircinoma forming multiple (2) well—
circumscribed masses (7.5 x 7.5 x 6.8 cm and 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.6
cm). There is no vascular space involvement.

ADDENDUM:

The adjacent liver parenchyma shows mild steatosis and mild
portal lymphocytic infiltrates.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: A. Received fresh labeled "portion liver
segment III" is a 3.56 gram, 2.5 x 2.1 x 1.6 cm partial
hepatectomy specimen. A single 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm mass is
present 0.8 from the surgical margin. Representative sections
are submitted. B. Received fresh labeled "gallbladder" is a
7.2 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm gallbladder with a 0.2 maximum wall thickness
and patent cystic duct. A cystic duct lymph node is is
identified. No stones are present within the lumen. No masses
are identified. Cholesterolosis is not identified.
Representative sections are submitted.

C. Received fresh labeled "portion liver segment VII and VIII"
is a 370.0 gram, 11.3 x 11.0 x 7.5 cm partial hepatectomy
specimen. There are multiple (2) masses (7.5 x 7.5 x 6.8 cm and
1.5 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm) which are 1.1 cm from the closest resection
margin. Representative sections are submitted.
