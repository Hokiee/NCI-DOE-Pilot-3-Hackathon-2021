GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) SUBPLEURAL LN, LEFT LOWER LOBE — Received is a 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm anthracotic lymph node which is
submitted in toto in A.

(B) LEFT LOWER LOBE WEDGE — Received is an 8.5 x 2.6 x 1.0 cm lung wedge with a staple line margin along the
base. The staple line margin is removed and this parenchymal margin is inked black. Section reveals a 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.0

cm well-circumscribed tan-yellow mass 0.6 cm to the parenchymal margin. The remaining parenchyma is spongy tan-red
and unremarkable. The mass is submitted entirely.

INKCODE: Blue — pleura; black — parenchymal margin.

SECTION CODE: 81—82, mass with parenchymal margin, one continuous section; B3, B4, mass with
parenchymal margin, one continuous section; BS, uninvolved parenchyma.
(C) LlNGULA NODE - Received is a 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm piece of spongy tan-yellow soft tissue containing a 0.3 cm in
greatest dimension possible anthracotic lymph node. The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in C.

(D) STATION 9LN — Received is a 2.5 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm piece of tan-yellow ﬁbroadipose tissue which yields two possible

anthracotic lymph nodes measuring 0.6 and 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. Both lymph nodes are submitted entirely.
SECTION CODE: D1, two lymph nodes; D2, remainder of specimen.

(E) SPLEEN — A spleen (12.5 x 8.0 x 5.0 cm) has tan-brown smooth outer surface. Sectioning reveals a well-

circumscribed tan-brown fragile nodule (3.5 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm). The remainder of the spleen consists of tan-red congested

splenic parenchyma. SECTION CODE: E1, mass with splenic hilum; E2-E4, mass with splenic parenchyma,
representative; E5, normal spleen.
