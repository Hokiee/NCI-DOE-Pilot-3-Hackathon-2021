MICROSCOPIC REPORT

Specimens A 8. B Parietal pleura tumour

Samples from both specimens reveal thickened pleura, extensively inﬁltrated by epithelioicl tumour with a
predominantly papillary architecture. The epithelioid tumour cells exhibit a moderate degree of pleomorphism
and possess vesicular nuclei with small nucleoli and a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Focal
areas of tumour necrosis are present. Some of the sections include a small amount of adherent lung
parenchyma. which in areas shows reactive changes with organising pneumonia Focally there is evidence of
inﬁltration of the visceral pleura.

lmmunohistochemistﬂ - The tumour is positive for MNF116 and calretlnin (cytoplasmic and variable nuclear
staining). Shows patchy staining for WT1, focal weak staining for CK5I6 and diffuse membranous positivity for

EMA. Very focal staining for BerEP4 is noted, but most of the tumour is negative for this marker, as well as
TTF 1.

I

The appearances are those of epithelioid malignant mesothelioma.
