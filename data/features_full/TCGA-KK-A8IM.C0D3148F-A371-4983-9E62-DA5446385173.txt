DIAGNOSIS

(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 7 (4+3). (SEE COMMENT)
TUMOR CONFINED TO THE PROSTATE.
MARGINS OF RESECTION FREE OF TUMOR.
PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH-GRADE.
Right and left seminal vesicles, no tumor present.
Segments of right and left vasa deferentia. no tumor present.

COMMENT:

The prostate gland contains three foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, two in the peripheral zone and one in the transition zone. The
dominant tumor focus is located in the left lateral and left posterolateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 1.0 x 0.8 cm
in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in three cross sections, focally in the apex and extensively in the base
region. The second tumor focus is located in the right lateral and right posterolateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures
0.6 x 0.2 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in two cross sections and focally in the apical region. The
third tumor focus is located in the right transition zone. This tumor focus measures 0.3 x 0.2 cm in the largest cross sectional
dimension and it is present in one cross section and focally in the base region.

All tumor foci are confined to the prostate. The margins of resection are free of tumor.

GROSS DESCRlPTION

(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and attached segments of right
and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (5.4 x 3.3 x 2.7 cm, 31.0 gm, post ﬁxation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the right
posterolateral aspect Of the prostate appears more abundant than along the left side. A nodule is palpated in the left base region.
Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrative a ﬁrm area consistent with tumor in the left posterolateral peripheral zone of the
three cross sections of the prostate.

The seminal vesicles and segments Of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

Also included in the container is a portion of tissue (1.8 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm) consistent with seminal vesicle.

SECTION CODE: 01, 02, detached portion of tissue; 03-05, right seminal vesicle and segment Of right vas deferens
from the base towards the tip; 06-08, left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; 09. 010
prostatic base right border; C11, C12, prostatic base, right posterior border; 013-018, prostatic base central portion; C19, 020,
prostatic base left border; 021. 022, prostatic base left posterior border; 023, 024, apex anterior; 025, 026, apex left; 027, 028,

apex posterior; 029-031, apex right; 032-043, sections of the three cross sections of the prostate according to specimen
radiograph.

The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in
black. Blue ink (029-031, 34, 38 and 42) denotes surfaces that do not represent the true margin of resection.
