Tumor lD
Microscopic Description:

Sections demonstrate a hypercellular astrocytic neoplasm. The tumor is identiﬁed inﬁltrating cortical
grey matter. The neoplastic cells demonstrate moderate to marked cytoligic atypia. Many of the tumor
cells demonstrate signiﬁcant nuclear atypia, including hyperchromatic enlarged pleomorphic nuclei. The
tumor cells demonstrate features consistent with gemistocytic differentiation, including abundant
eosinophillic cytoplasm and nuclear p53 positivity. An occasional blood vessel demonstrates pervascular
lymphocytes. Signiﬁcant mitotic activity is not seen. The MIB—1 Ll is 2.8%. Microvascular proliferation

and necrosis are not seen. Elbe-Ova
