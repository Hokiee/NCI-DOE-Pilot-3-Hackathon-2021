SPECIMEN SOURCE:
1. Brain tumor — F3
2. Brain tumor (glioblastoma)

    

GENE
CONTROL —

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS:

Brain tumor (glioblastoma) I ICGA—32'1gm

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1. Received fresh for frozen section is a 2.2 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm tan red portion
of soft tissue. Serial sectioning reveals a tan red hemorrhagic surface. A
smear is made and a representative section is frozen on one chuck.

FROZEN SECTION AND SHEAR PREP DIAGNOSIS:
GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME.

The remainder of the Specimen is submitted in cassettes 13 and 1C.

2. Received in formalin are multiple tan white hemorrhagic soft tissue
fragments aggregating to 5.5 x 4 x 2.1 cm. Cut section reveals a tan
hemorrhagic surface. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes
2A—2C.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
1, 2. Microscopic performed.

DIAGNOSIS:

1. BRAIN. BRAIN TUMOR, BIOPSIES:
HIGH GRADE MALIGHBNT NEOPLASH CONSISTENT WITH GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME,
ADDITIONAL STUDIES TO BE PERFORMED (SEE COMMENT BELOW).

2. BRAIN, “BRAIN TUMOR“, RESECTION:
HIGH GRADE HALIGNANT NEOPLASM CONSISTENT_WITH GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME,
ADDITIONAL STUDIES TO BE PERFORMED (SEE COMMENT BELOW).

DIAGNOSIS:

COMMENT: -

The overall findings in this case are certainly consistent with glioblastoma
mnltiforme. Areas within the neoplasm have a differential which includes small
blue cell tumor, as well as a small cell variant of glioblastoma. Sprinkled
amongst the individual small neoplastic cells are tumor giant cells. In
addition, there are foci which raise the possibility of oligodendroglial
differentiation. Special stains will be performed and the case will be
reviewed lay—prior to submitting a final report.
