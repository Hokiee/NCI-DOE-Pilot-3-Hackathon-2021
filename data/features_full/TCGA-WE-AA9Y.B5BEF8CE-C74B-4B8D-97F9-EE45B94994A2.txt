HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

LAB No:
Supplementary report

CASE HISTORY:

Core biopsy, left groin. Left groin lymphadenopathy. Ultrasound
guided core biopsy—pigmented cores-? Melanoma

MACROSCOPIC:
No specimen details on pot.
6 cores of tissue, the longest 1.5 cm plus frags.

MICROSCOPY:
The biopsy contains pigmented epithelial raises/spindle cells with
in places extensive necrosis. The appearances would fit with

malignant melanoma metastasis, immunohistochemistry confirmation to
follow

LEFT GROIN, CORE BIOPSY: CONSISTENT WITH METASTATIC MALIGNANT
MELANOMA

REPORTED BY:
Dr. Consultant Histopathologist.

REPORT DATE:

HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

*SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT
LAB No:

CASE HISTORY:
Irregular shape and pigmentation. Atypical mole?

MACROSCOPIC:
2.5cm skin ellipse with a lcm pigmented nodule.

MICROSCOPY:

A compound naevus with features of a spindle cell naevus of Reed.
The lesion is largely symmetrical although at one edge there is a
more lentiginous proliferation with mild melanocytic atypia. There
is no evidence of malignancy and excision appears complete

DIAGNOSIS:
SKIN, LEFT KNEE: SPINDLE CELL NAEVUS

REPORTED BY:
Dr Eonsultant Histopathologist

REPORT DATE:
Supplementary report

The patient subsequently presented with metastatic malignant
melanoma in a left groin lymph node Review of the
original 4 sections confirm the above assessment. However,
additional levels were cut and revealed a mitotically active
atypical dermal proliferation with a lymphocytic reaction,
indicating malignant melanoma

HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT
LAB NO:

CASE HISTORY:

Metastatic melanoma invading into femoral artery and nerve. Unable
to get complete clearance

MACROSCOPIC:

1.(Specimen labelled no. 2 on pot) Left groin: ellipse 15 x 4.5 cm
up to 4 cm deep. The skin contains a 6 cm recent incision. Within
the specimen is a black metastatic node 6 cm diameter which extends
to less than 5 mm from the circumferential subcutaneous margins. 18

— closest peripheral margin.
2.Deep tissue femoral nerve: fatty tissue up to 2 cm.

MICROSCOPY:

l. Metastatic malignant melanoma confirmed. Maximum macroscopic
dimension 60 mm. The original lymph node has been obliterated but
tumour is present within fibroadipose tissue, presumably
representing extracapsular spread. It extends to 1.5 mm from the
closest surgical margin. BRAF was negative on a previous needle
biopsy. 7 other lymph nodes identified. These contain abundant
melanin—laden macrophages but are negative for metastatic tumour.
2. One negative lymph node identified

DIAGNOSIS:

LEFT GROIN LYMPH NODES: METASTATIC MALIGNANT MELANOMA IN 1 OF 9
NODES
