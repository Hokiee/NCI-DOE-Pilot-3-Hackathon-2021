Nature of material: Brain

Macroscopy: CQCLQ [13/4 I L3

Received in formalin irregular fragments of brain parenchyma measuring 4. 5
x 3. 5 x 3.0 cm. The surface shows well deﬁned gyri and sulci, covered by
delicate and congested leptomeningeal. To cuts, it is note softened and
whitish tissue area. Note: Material fully included for histological analysis.

Microscopy:

Histological sections stained with H & E show lesion of neoplastic glial
phenotype, consisting of relatively monomorphic cells with round nuclei,
slightly hyperchromatic and often surrounded by a clear halo. The lesion
exhibits rich vascular network support formed by thin and branched
capillaries. Displays also several areas with dystrophic calciﬁcations. The
lesion IS InﬁltratIve involving cortex and white matter. In cortical areas, there Is
often neuronal sattelitosis and subpial accumulation of neoplastic cells. It was
not observed mitotic ﬁgures, foci of necrosis, marked atypia or vessels with
multistrata endothelium.

Diagnosis:

Surgical resection product of left frontal brain lesion:

- Oligodendroglioma (grade ll, according to the classiﬁcation of OMS, 2007).
Award of 1p/19q deletion analysis:

The hybridizations were performed on 5 micrometers thick sections of
formalin-ﬁxed and parafﬁn embedded neoplastic tissue (FFPE) in the most
representative tumor area with 1p36/1q25 and 19q13/19p13 probe.
100 to 200 were evaluated in each slide cores.

in this case: The ratio of signals from 1p/1q probes was 0,82. The ratio of

signals from 19q/19p probes was 0,64. Conclusion. Diffuse oligodendroglioma
grade II WHO, with isolated codeletion 19q.
