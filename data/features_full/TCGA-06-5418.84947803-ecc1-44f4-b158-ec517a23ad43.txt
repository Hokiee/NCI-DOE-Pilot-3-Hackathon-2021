OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES

Glioblastoma

Operation/Specimen: A: Brain, left frontal tumor, resection
B: Brain, excision biopsy

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: .

A and B. Brain, left frontal, excision:

1. Glioblastoma.

2. MlB—l proliferation index: 40%.

See Microscopy Description and Comment.

COMMENT

Sections contain portions of portions of brain that are infiltrated

and

extensively effaced by a cellular astrOCytic neoplastic proliferation
that has

nuclear anaplasia, brisk mitotic activity, focal microvascular
cellular

proliferation, and extensive areas of tumor necrosis, the smaller ones
with ‘

pseudopalisading. The neoplastic cells tend to be small and have

round/ovoid
nuclei. The MIB—l proliferation index is high at about 40%.

The findings are those of a small cell glioblastoma, WHO IV/IV.
Results of molecu ' ill appear in addendum reports.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates dense gliofibrillary

background

within the neoplasm. The CD34 depicts a small vessel vascular network
with

focal microvascular cellular proliferation. With the MIB—l there is a
proliferation index of about 40% in many areas of the tumor.
