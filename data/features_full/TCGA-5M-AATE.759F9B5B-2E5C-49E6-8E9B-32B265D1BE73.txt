SPECIMEN: Ascending colon, cecum. terminal ileum, appendix
PROCEDURE: Right hemicolectomy with terminal iIeectomy

MACROSCOPY

- The specimen measures 22.5 cm in length and 5.5 to 7.5 cm in diameter.

- The terminal ileum segment has a length of 4.5 cm and a diameter of 2.5 cm. with no identiﬁable
macroscopic pathologic features.

- The cecum contains a vegetative, inﬁltrative. well delimitated lesion, continuous to the lumen of
the appendix and adjacent to the ileocecal valve, 5.5 cm away from the nearest surgical margin
(ileal margin).

- The lesion measures 6.5 cm and penetrates the full thickness of the bowel wall and the two
proximal thirds of the appendix.

- A number of lymph nodes were dissected from the pericolic fat; diameters ranging from 0.3 to
1.1 cm,

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION

- Moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma of the cecum, with extension to the appendix;

- Microscopic tumor extension: tumor penetrates the full thickness of the cecum wall, extending
to the pericolic fat;

— Perineural invasion: present;

- Lymph-vascular invasion: present;

- Moderate desmoplastic stromal reaction, with mild tumoral lymphocytic inﬁltrate.

- Surgical margins free of neoplastic involvement;

- Number of lymph nodes examined: 15; cg; fGD «C, a
- Number of lymph nodes involved: 0;
