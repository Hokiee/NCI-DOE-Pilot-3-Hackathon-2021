DIAGNOSIS:

A. Uterus, right and left ovaries and fallopian tubes,
hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingo—oophorectomies:
Residual FIGO

grade_2 (of 3) endometrial adenocarcinoma, endometrioid

type with

musinouswgimfwf.w nti atign, is identified forming a mass

(2 7 x 2 6 x

0.7 cm) located in the left cornu and posterior aspect of
uterine

fundus. No residual papillary serous component is
identified. The

tumor invades 1. 2 cm into Ithe myometrium (total wall
thickness, 2.0

cm). The tumor does not involve the endocervix.
Lymphovascular

space invasion is not identified. The margins are
negative for

tumor. The right ovary shows a peritoneal inclusion cyst.

The left ,
ovary shows a serous cystadenoma. Both fallopian tubes are
unremarkable. [AJCCpTlchMx].
. p53 shows weak and spotty immunoreactivity, supporting the
above
diagnosis.

PRELIMINARY FROZEN SECTION CONSULTATION:

A. Uterus, right and left ovaries and fallopian tubes,
hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingo—oophorectomies:
Invasive

endometrial adenocarcinoma. Hold for tumor typing.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

Received fresh labeled "uterus, bilateral tubes and
ovaries" is a

95.0 gram uterus with attached bilateral tubes and ovaries
and an

. with 1.2 cm

myometrial invasion (total myometrial thickness 2.0 cm).
