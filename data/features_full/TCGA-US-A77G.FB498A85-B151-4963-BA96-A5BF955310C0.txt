MICRO§§OEIC -

Sections of the tumour conﬁrm a well to moderately differentiated ductal carcinoma arising in the
posterior body/neck adjacent to the mid to distal common bile duct (C3D). The overall tumour
dimensions are 20 x 20 x 20mm. The tumour spreads alongside the mid common bile duct (with a
common bile duct margin of 10mm). Tumour shows a gland and ductal architecture with marked
desmoplasia and extensive peririeural infiltration. There is extensive perineural invasion and spread
into the peripancreatic tissue. Tumour invades the wall of the portal vein (Block 3) but does not reach
the lumen or involve the peripheral venous resection margin. The tumour comes to within 1mm of the
posterior soft tissue margin at the neck of pancreas (blocks 4 and 7) Lymphovascular space invasion is
noted (Blocks 4) with extension into a peripancreatic nodeCBlock 8) with a micrometastis in a
peripancreatic node (Block 4) and periuncinate node (block 15). Adjacent to the tumour high grade
PanlN is identiﬁed (block 8).

Sections from the pancreatic neck resection margin show chronic pancreatitis. No high grade PanIN is
identiﬁed. Sections from the proximal common bile duct margin show no evidence of malignancy and
uninvolved cystic duct node.

Representative sections from the arnpulla of Vater show reactive changes within the common bile duct
epithelium along with some epithelial hyperplasia. Representative sections from the pancreas
elsewhere show normal morphology of ducts without PanlN. Fatty inﬁltration of the pancreas is seen in
Blocks ll & 12 with associated fat necrosis. Representative sections from the gallbladder show
Rokitansky-Aschoff sinus formation with ﬁbrosis of the gallbladder wall and a mixed inﬂammatory
cell inﬁltrate. The gallbladder mucosa is attenuated and shows underlying haemorrhage.
Cholesterolosis is not identiﬁed. Representative sections from the proximal gastric margin are within
normal limits. Representative sections from the pylorus are within normal limits. Representative
sections from the distal small bowel margin are also within normal limits.

Three out of eight peripancreatic nodes contain tumour (including the one seen in Block 4 and
including the one seen in Block 8 and block 15). No lesser curve nodes are identiﬁed. Only one single
lymphoid aggregate is noted from the greater curve. There are two cystic duct nodes. This gives a total
of three out of eleven nodes involved.
