DIAGNOSIS:
. A. Lymph nodes, para—aortic above the inferior mesenteric
artery,
lymphadenectomy: Multiple (9) para-aortic lymph nodes
above the
inferior mesenteric artery are negative for metastatic

adenocarcinoma.

B. Lymph nodes, para-aortic below the inferior mesenteric

artery,
lymphadenectomy: Multiple (10) para—aortic lymph nodes
below the
inferior mesenteric artery are negative for metastatic
adenocarcinoma.

C. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(14) right

pelvic lymph nodes are negative for metastatic
adenocarcinoma.

D. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(13) left
pelvic lymph nodes are negative for metastatic

. adenocarcinoma.

E. Uterus, bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: FIGO grade 3 (of 3)
, endometrial T"‘ " ' A
$4' ageggcarcinoma, endometrioid type with squamouqrv

differentiation, is
identified forming an almost circumferential polypoid mass

(3.8 x

3.6 x 1.2 cm) involving the endometrial cavity. The tumor
invades

0.8 cm into the myometrium (total myometrial thickness,
2.1 cm).

The tumor does not involve the endocervix. Lymphovascular
space

invasion is identified. The margins are negative for
tumor. There

is a single intramural leiomyoma (0.8 cm in greatest
dimension) in

the myometrium. The bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes

PRELIMINARY FROZEN SECTION CONSULTATION:

A. Lymph nodes, para-aortic above the inferior mesenteric
artery,

lymphadenectomy: Multiple lymph nodes above the inferior
mesenteric

artery are negative.

B. Lymph nodes, para—aortic below the inferior mesenteric
artery,

lymphadenectomy: Multiple lymph nodes below the inferior
mesenteric

artery are negative.

C. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
lymph
nodes are negative.

D. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
lymph nodes
are negative.

E. Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy: High grade malignant
neoplasm:
grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma with squamous features
vs
malignant mixed Mullerian tumor. HOLD to classify and

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled "para-aortic nodes above IMA,
laparoscopic" is a 4.0 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm aggregate of adipose
and

lymphatic tissue. All lymphatic tissue submitted.

B. Received fresh labeled "para—aortic nodes below IMA,
laparoscopic" is a 2.8 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm aggregate of adipose
and

lymphatic tissue. All lymphatic tissue submitted.

C. Received fresh labeled "robotic right pelvic nodes" is
a 10.0 x

5.0 x 1.8 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.
All

lymphatic tissue submitted.

D. Received fresh labeled "robotic left pelvic nodes" is
a 7.0 x g

4.0 x 1.5 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.
All

lymphatic tissue submitted.

E. Received fresh labeled "uterus, left and right tubes
and

ovaries" is a 145.0 gram uterus with attached bilateral
tubes and

ovaries and an unremarkable cervix. The uterine serosa is
smooth.

There is a 3.8 X 3.6 x 1.2 cm polypoid mass in the
posterior wall,

left lateral wall and anterior wall of the endometrial
cavity which

grossly appears to invade 0.8 cm into the 2.1 cm thick
myometrium.

There is a single intramural leiomyoma (0.8 cm in greatest

dimension) in the myometrium. There is a 3.3 x 1.7 x 0.9
cm right

ovary with a smooth outer surface and a solid cut surface
with a

detached 11.2 x 0.5 cm right fallopian tube. There is a
yellow

nodule (0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm) on the surface of the right
ovary and a

brown nodule (0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm) in the right ovary.
There is a

2.4 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm left ovary with a ragged outer surface
with

adhesions and a solid cut surface with a 10.3 x 0.7 cm
left

fallopian tube with adhesions. Representative sections
submitted.
