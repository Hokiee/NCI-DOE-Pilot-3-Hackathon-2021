GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. ”Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries (AF1)", received fresh for
frozen section and placed in formalin at >n is a 293 gram,
13.5 x 8.5 x 5.5 cm total hysterectomy specimen with an attached 3.2 cm in
diameter cervix with a 0.6 cm patent 05. The specimen is opened to reveal a
3.6 x 5.2 x 2.1 cm tan-white, soft, friable, fungating mass lesion located at
the uterine fundus. This mass lesion is located 3.2 cm to the anterior lower
uterine segment, and 2.8 cm to the closest posterior lower uterine segment.
(A4— anterior lower uterine segment, A5— posterior lower uterine segment). The
mass lesion is sectioned to reveal an apparent 0.8 cm invasion into to a 2.1
cm thick trabeculated myometrium. A section with the apparent deepest
invasion at the fundus is frozen as AFl with the frozen section remnant
submitted in block Al. Sections of the anterior endomyometrium and posterior
endomyometrium with the aforementioned mass lesion are submitted in blocks
A6-7 respectively. The mass lesions comes to 1.5 cm to the closest serosal
surface. An additional representative section of the mass lesion is submitted
in block A8.

The remainder of the specimen demonstrates an endometrium of 0.1 cm overlying
a 2.1 cm trabeculated myometrium in the uninvolved uterus, within an
endometrial cavity of 6 x 5.1 cm. The uterus uninvolved by the aforementioned
mass lesion is remarkable for a 1.1 x 0.9 cm polypoid lesion in the posterior
lower uterine segment. The polypoid lesion is submitted in block A9. Also in
the posterior uterus are two white, whorled nodules, up to 1.8 cm in greatest
dimension. The smaller white, whorled nodule is submitted in block A7 with
the posterior endomyometrium. The larger white, whorled nodule submitted in
block A10. The cervix is sectioned to reveal a white—pink, firm, homogeneous
unremarkable cut surface. Representative sections of the cervix are submitted
in blocks A2—3 (A2- anterior, A3— posterior). The serosal surface is
pink—tan, smooth, glistening and grossly unremarkable.

Attached to the uterus are bilateral adnexa. The right ovary measures 3.8 x
1.5 x 0.8 cm in dimension, demonstrates a smooth unremarkable surface and is
sectioned to reveal a grossly unremarkable parenchyma. Adjacent to the right
ovary is a 9 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter fimbriated fallopian tube with
a 1 cm in greatest diameter serous filled paratubal cyst. Representative
sections of the unremarkable tube and ovary are submitted in block A13. The
left ovary is a 4.3 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm in dimension, demonstrates a smooth
unremarkable serosal surface and is sectioned to reveal an unremarkable cut
surface. The left fallopian tube is 6.2 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter and
is grossly unremarkable. Representative left tube and ovary are submitted in
block A14.

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

definite papillary serous tumor is identified. In the posterior lower uterine
segment (block A9), there is a mixed endometrial/endocervical polyp with a

small focus of carcinoma. However, carcinoma is not demonstrated to involve
the cervix itself.

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).
