INTRAOPERATIVE FROZEN CONSULTATION:

AFS: Right distal ureter
- carcinoma in—situ

BFS: Left distal ureter
— high grade dysplaeia

CPS: Additional right distal ureter
- focal high grade dysplasia

DFS: Additional left distal ureter
- carcinoma in—eitu

EFS: Additional right distal ureter
- no high grade atypia or tumor identified

FPS: Additional left distal ureter
- no high grade atypia or tumor identified

GFS: Apical urethral margin
- no high grade atypia or tumor identified

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

A-G: See final microscopic—diagnosis.

H: Sections of the bladder show multifocal urothelial carcinoma in situ (flat
lesion) [Hi—4,6-10} and both non-invasive and invasive poorly differentiated
papillary urothelial carcinomas (Hz-7,10), grade 4/4. Invasive carcinoma extends
through the entire bladder wall into perivesical soft tissue where it is associated
with multiple foci of lymphovascular invasion (H5). Two incidental right
perivesical lymph nodes are identified both of which are free of malignancy (0/2).
Soft tissue resection margins are free of malignancy. Final resection margins of
both right and left ureters are free of both urothelial dysplasia and malignancy
(EFS, FPS, J, K). Urothelial carcinoma in situ involves the initial apical
urethral margin (GFS), and along with non-invasive papillary carcinoma, is also
noted to involve the urethra (I) where it focally extends to the meatua.

I—X: See final microscopic~diagnosis.
