- Pathology Report

Microscopic Discussion:

Sections demonstrate a moderately hypercelllar glial neoplasm, the cells of which primarily
resemble fibrillary astrocytes. A small but definite oligodendroglioma component is also seen.
The tumor diffusely infiltrates gray and white matter. No microvascular proliferation or necrosis
are present. No mitotic figures are seen. Atypia is generally mild. Scattered moderately
atypical cells are present.

Addendum Discussion:

Scattered MlB-1 reactive cells are present. In the most proliferative areas, a labeling index of
6.1% is calculated. This is indicative of an intermediate level of proliferation and a level that can
be seen in either low or anaplastic tumors. The overall histologic features are indicative of a low
grade tumor. However, close follow up is indicated.

Final Addendum Diagnosis:
Oligoastrocytoma, astrocytoma predominant, low grade (WHO grade II)
