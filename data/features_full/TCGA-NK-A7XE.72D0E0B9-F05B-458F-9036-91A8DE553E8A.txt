FINAL DIAGNOSIS
a. (Bronchus, left tracheal bronchial angle, frozen): one benign lymph node

b. (pulmonary ligament, inferior): 3 benign lymph nodes

0. (lung, left, resection): Invasive squamous cell carcinoma, grade 2,
measuring 12 cm with extension into perihilar mediastinal ﬁbroadipose tissue.
Lymphatic permeation by tumor cells present. Intra and perineural invasion by
tumor cells also present. 3/8 perihilar lymph nodes show metastatic tumor.
Margins of resection free of tumor, including; bronchial, vascular and soft
tissue. Stage T4N2PL3.

d. (Lymph nodes; level 7, subcarinal): 3/14 lymph nodes with metastatic
squamous cell carcinoma with extracapsular extension

e. (Lymph nodes; level 9): 3 lymph nodes negative for metastatic tumor

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. The specimen is labeled left tracheal bronchial angle. Received fresh for
frozen section is a 0.9 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm irregular fragment of red-tan tissue
containing possible pink-tan lymphoid tissue. The specimen is entirely
submitted for frozen section with the remnant placed in cassette A1. Touch
prep and smear are prepared.

B. The specimen is labeled inferior pulmonary ligament. Received in formalin
is a 1.1 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm irregular fragment of soft red-tan tissue. The
specimen is trisected and entirely submitted in cassette B1.

D. The specimen is labeled level VII subcarinal node. Received in formalin is
a 2.5 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm lymph node and a separate 3.4 x 2.0 x 0.6 cm aggregate of
multiple roughened red-tan ﬁbroadipose tissue fragments containing possible
lymphoid tissue. Sectioning through the lymph node shows a solid pale tan cut
surface. Sections are submitted as follows: D1-3 - lymph node trisected, D4
and D5 - remaining fragments containing possible lymphoid tissue.

C. The specimen is labeled "left lung frozen on bronchial" is a 487 g left
pneumonectomy with anthracotic pleural surface measures 26.1 x 15.5 x 7.5 cm.
Both lobes where identiﬁed. Inked at the site of frozen section and it has a
staple line at the vascular margin.

The specimen was serially sectioned to reveal an indistinct gray tan mass
measuring 12.0 x 7.5 x 6.5 cm located in the upper lobe. The mass is
obstructing the main bronchus and is 1 cm away from the bronchial margin. The
mass is abutting pleural surface. Recovered total of 7 lymph nodes ranging in
size from 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm to 1.9 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. Rest of lung tissue is

spongy frothy dark red.

Sections are submitted as follow:

C1-2 vascular margin

C3 mass with a vasculature

C 4-5 mass with bronchus

C 6 representative section from the mass
C 7-8 LYMPH nodes

C9 bronchial lymph node bisected

C 10-11 unremarkable lung

E. The specimen is labeled level IX node. Received in formalin is a 3.5 x 2.5

x 1.0 cm aggregate of multiple red-tan ﬁbroadipose tissue fragments
containing 2 possible lymph nodes (1.3 and 2.3 cm in greatest dimension). The
specimen is entirely submitted as follows: El - largest lymph node, bisected,
E2 - one lymph node, bisected, E3 and E4 - remaining ﬁbroadipose tissue

fragments.
