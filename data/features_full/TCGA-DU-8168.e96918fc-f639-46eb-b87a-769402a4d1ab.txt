CLINICAL HISTORY

_oman has experienced headaches and difficulty

with tasks
at work for a few weeks. On imaging, there is a right frontal lesion

that is
mostly non—enhancing, but has internal nodular enhancing areas. The

tumor
extends to the body of the corpus callosum and minimally into the

contralateral frontal lobe.

OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
Brain tumor

Operation/Specimen: A: Brain tumor, excision
B: Brain tumor, excision

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:
A, B. Brain, site not specified, excision: Oligodendroglioma,

anaplastic
(WHO III).
See Microscopy Description and Comment.

COMMENT

The sections contain portions of cerebrum that are moderately to

heavily
infiltrated by a neoplastic proliferation of glial cells that have a
predominantly oligodendroglial phenotype. The neoplastic cells have

nuclear
anaplastic features, a high mitotic rate of up to 13 mitoses / ten

high power
fields, and a MIB—l proliferation index of about 50% in several, more

active
areas. There is focal microvascular mineralization. There is not

appreciable
microvascular cellular proliferation, and tumor necrosis is absent.

The features are those of an anaplastic oligodendroglioma (WHO III).

 

 

PROCEDURES/ADDENDA

Loss of Heteroz osit 1p, 19q Assay (LOH)

enema eeee eeeeeeee. _
Interpretation

POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm lp and chromosome arm 19q is

detected.

Informative loci are: DlSS52, D181612, D195412 and PLA2G4C.

Results—Comments

Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block
DNA extracted from a corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal
reference control.

a slide was examined and no micro dissection was
needed.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and qu. The 3
markers

on lp are D13548, D131592, and D18552 (with DlS468, DlSl6l2, and
D18496 as

backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D198219, D198412, and
PLA2G4C

(with D198606 and D1981182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites
(2 or 4

nt repeats) except PLAZG4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat)
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score,
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used
if the

first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or
otherwise

ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas
with 1p

and 19q deletion.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results
from a '

stand—alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its
performance

characteristics determined by the laboratory as

required by CLIA ' 88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved
for

specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA
has

determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are '

 

 

provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted
only in
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.

TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non—neoplastic cells in
the sample
may preclude the detection of allelic loss.

Interpretation
POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected.
Results-Comments

Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block

a slide was examined and no microdissection was
needed.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT
promoter

have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents.
Assessment of

MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA
followed

by real—time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and
unmethylated DNA

sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by
serial

dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and
was

assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA.

Factors such as the presence of >50% non~neoplastic cells in the
sample, or

extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated
MGMT

promoter sequences.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results
from a
stand alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its

performance
characteristics determined by the — laboratory as

required by CLIA '88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved
for

specific uses by the 0.3. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA
has

determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are

only in

the context of established rocedures and/or dia nostic criteria.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A.
"Brain tumor," received fresh, several fragments, 3 cm across in

aggregate.
Soft, grayish—purple, glistening, and somewhat diffluent. In total,

Al-AB.

Brain tumor, excision:

CONTAINER LABEL: brain tumor.

FIXATIVE: Formalin. NO. PIECES: several pale red tan soft fragments.

SIZE/VOL: 15 x l4 x 7 mm. in aggregate CASSETTES: 1, NS.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates a somewhat sparse
gliofibrillary

background, except in a zone where there are frequent gliofibrillary
oligodendrocytes and mini gemistocytes. The synaptophysin, NeuN, N82,
and

neurofilament highlight the moderate to heavy infiltration of the
tumor in the

cerebral cortex. The DC99 and EMA weakly react with the
neuropil. Only

a small minority of neoplastic cells appreciably over expresses the

p53
protein. The CD34 demonstrates a rather organoid microvascular

network with
focal hyperplastic areas. With the MlB—l there is a proliferation

index of
about 50% in the more active areas.
