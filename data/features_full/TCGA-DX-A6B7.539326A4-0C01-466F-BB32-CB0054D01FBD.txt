DIAGNOSIS:
1. Left retroperitoneal "mass" resection and left nephrectomy:

- High grade leiomyosarooma, involving renal vein and adjacent soft
tissue.

- Tumor size: 11.5 x 9 x 8.5 cm.

- Tumor shows areas of necrosis and hyalinization, comprising
approximately 20% of the mass.

- Tumor is present at the renal vein margin. present as an intra-luminal
tumor embolus.

- Within the soft tissue, the tumor is covered by thin fibrous tissue
grossly, which represents the surgical margin.

- Renal parenchyma shows a small fibrotic nodule (0.4 cm in the lower
pole) with a bland spindle cell proliferation: further immuno-work-up will
be performed for a more definitive classification. The remaining renal
parenchyma is unremarkable.

- Renal artery is not involved by tumor.

— One benign lymph node (0/1).

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL). AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

1.The specimen is received fresh. labeled "radical resection left
retroperitoneal mass and left nephrectomy', and consists of a
retroperitoneal mass with attached kidney, ureter, renal vessels, and
perinephric fat weighing 1510 g in total and measures 21 x 17 x 14 cm. The
retroperitoneal mass measures 11.5 x 9 x 8.5 cm. The mass is inferior to
kidney, partially bulging to the inferior aspect of the renal pelvis,
abutting to inferior aspect of renal parenchyma. The mass is covered by
intact white fibrous membrane. Cut surface of mass show white. firm,
nodular and whorling surface. There is focus of myxoid and yellow necrotic
area measuring 2 cm in greatest dimension, representing approximately 2% of
tumor volume. The mass is associated with the entire segment of renal vein
submitted and extends to the resection margin of the renal vein, which is
inked black. The renal vein measures 6 x 1 x 1 cm. The renal artery measures

2 cm in length and is grossly not involved by the mass. The potential ureter

is surrounded by the mass. The renal artery and ureter margins are grossly

unremarkable. An adrenal gland is not identified. The kidney measures 14.5 x

9 x 7.5 cm. The kidney is bivalved to reveal one tan firm nodule measuring
0.4 cm in diameter in the inferior pole, 1 cm from the retroperitoneal mass.
The renal pelvis is slightly dilated. Sections through the remainder of the
kidney reveal pink brown parenchyma, with a well-defined cortico-medullary
junction. The cortex measures 0.7 cm and the calyces appear normal. No lymph
nodes are identified in the perinephric fat. The specimen is photographed.
Represeutative sections are submitted for TPS and for permanent sections.
