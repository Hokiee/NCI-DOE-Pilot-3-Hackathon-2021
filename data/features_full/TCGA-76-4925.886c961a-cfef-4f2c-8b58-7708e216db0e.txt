Microscopic Description:

The tumor consists of pleomorphic glial cells. Mitotic figures are
present in tumor cells. Tumor necrosis is present. Tumor cells show
positive staining on the immunohistochemical stain for glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP). The tumor proliferation index as determined by
nuclear staining with the immunohistochemical stain Ki67 (M|B~1) is
