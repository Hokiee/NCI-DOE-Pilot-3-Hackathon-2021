Diagnosis:
A: Colon, rectosigmoid junction, resection

Tumor Histologic Type: invasive colonic adenocarcinoma (see
comment)

Histologic Grade: low grade, grade 2 of 4 (moderately
differentiated)

Tumor Size: 5.2 cm in diameter

Tumor Location: sigmoid colon, just proximal to rectosigmoid
junction

Depth of Invasion: through muscularis propria and into
pericolonic soft tissues

Lymphovascular Invasion: present
Perineural Invasion: not identified

Margins:

Proximal margin: negative, 6.5 cm away
Distal margin: negative, 5.0 cm away
Mesenteric margin: negative

Regional Lymph Nodes:
Total number with metastases: 6
Total number examined: 24

Additional Pathologic Findings: none
AJCC Pathologic TNM Stage: pT3 pN2a

Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information
available at the time of this report and is subject to change
pending clinical review and additional information.

Comment:

Immunostains for mismatch repair protein expression are pending.
The results will be issued as an addendum to this report.
Materials will be submitted to the for
microsatellite instability testing. These results will be issued

in a separate Molecular Pathology report.

Clinical History:
—year—old male with a clinical diagnosis of colon cancer.

Gross Description:

Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally
labeled "rectosigmoid junction, stitch is distal" and holds a 15
cm in length x 3.5 cm in open circumference segment of large
bowel oriented as stated above. The proximal mucosal margin is
inked blue, the distal mucosal margin is inked black, and the
tinea and surrounding yellow lobulated fat is inked green for
identification purposes. Approximately 6.5 cm from the proximal
mucosal margin and 5.0 cm from the distal mucosal margin, there
is a 5.2 cm proximal to distal x 4.0 cm circumferential tan firm
mass with central ulceration and raised edges.

The mass on section extends up to 1.2 cm through the muscularis
propria into the attached yellow lobulated fat. The mass comes
to within 0.8 cm from the yellow intact peritonealized surface.
The mass is present at the rectosigmoid junction and is not
surrounded by mesorectum. No additional abnormalities are

noted. Tumor and normal are submitted to tissue procurement.

Block Summary:

Al — Proximal en face mucosal margin

A2—A3 — Distal en face mucosal margin

A4 — Mesenteric vascular pedicle margin

A5 - Lymph node present at mesenteric vascular pedicle margin,
bisected

A6-A7 - Mass with extension into fat

A8 — Mass with respect to tinea

A9 — Additional section of mass with extension into fat
A10 — One lymph node trisected

A11 — One lymph node, trisected

A12-A13 - Multiple lymph nodes, each cassette

A14 — One lymph node bisected

A15—A16 - Multiple lymph nodes each cassette

A17-A19 - One lymph node each cassette, each sectioned

Tissue remains in formalin.

Addendum
To add the results of immunostains

Addendum Comment
Immunostains for mismatch repair protein expression are performed on

block A8 and show normal expression of MLH1, PMSZ, MSH2, and MSH6

within the tumor. Correlate with the results of microsatellite
instability testing.
