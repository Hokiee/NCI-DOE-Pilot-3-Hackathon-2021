CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
with hx of breast cancer, now with a RUL adenocarcinoma.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in five parts, each labeled with the
patient's name.

1. Part one is labeled 'lung, right upper lobe'. It consists of a

right lobe of lung, measuring 15.5 x 10.5 x 4 cm. The two staple
lines measures 6 cm and 5.5 cm which is shaved and the pleura around
the staple line is inked in black. The bronchial margin at the hilum
area measures 2 cm and the vascular margin measures 1.2 cm. The
pleura are gray pink glistening and mottled moderately with fine
black streaks. There is a puckered area measuring 2.5 cm in greatest
dimension. Beneath the puckered area there is a gray white firm
nodule with ill defined borders measuring 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm, located 3
cm from the bronchial resection margin, and 2 cm from the closest
staple line margin. The remainder of the parenchyma is red and
blotchy. No other nodule grossly identified. Multiple anthracotic
firm lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 cm to 0.6 cm identified from the
hilar and peribronchial area. Representative sections are submitted.

2. Part two is labeled 'station 10 lymph node'. It consists of
multiple soft red-black lymph nodes measuring 2.4 x 2 x 0.5 cm in
aggregate. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

3. Part three is labeled 'station 11 lymph node '. It consists of
multiple soft red-black lymph nodes measuring 2 x 1.7 x 0.6 cm in
aggregate. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

4. Part four is labeled 'station 2 and 4 lymph node'. It consists
of multiple soft red-black lymph nodes measuring 0.5 cm to 0.8 cm.
Entirely submitted in three cassettes.

5. Part five is labeled 'station 7 lymph node '. It consists of
multiple soft red-black lymph nodes measuring 2.4 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm in
aggregate. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS:

KRAS, EGFR and ALK were sent on- for patient

The test is to be performed on tissue from case

The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited

accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose
signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,
examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1B appropriate to
the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9
unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to- where the
subject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be
issued when the results of this molecular test are available.

ADDENDUM #2:

MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY

KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS

Referring Physician

Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung
Specimen Type: Slides

Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma

RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12V (c.35G>T) mutation in codon 12
of the KRAS gene.

INTERPRETATION:

Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to correlate with poor
prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in
patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.

COMMENT:

KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking
history.

This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of

the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected.

This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and
codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin
embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been
established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung
carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other
tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e. g. tumors of
pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).

METHOD/LIMITAT IONS:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified

and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

ADDENDUM #3:

EGFR Mutation Analysis

Referring Physician: —

Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: No mutation detected.

INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided
for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma

patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be

responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.

COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 4% tumor
cellularity upon pathologist review

A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was
identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
significance.

Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential
responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (T KI)
therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a
sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.

This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell

lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change
during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this
result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation

in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.

This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.

METHOD/LIMITATION:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.
