CLrNICAL HISTORY
who experienced sudden —
Imaging ‘

studies show a left frontal heterogeneous, somewhat enhancing intra-
axial
tumor.
OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
.Left frontal brain lesion.
Operation/Specimen: A: Brain, left frontal, excision biopsy
PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:
A. Brain, left frontal lesion, excision: Oiigodendroglioma (WHO Grade
II} {see
comment)
COMMENT
Sections show an oligodendroglioma with areas of microcystic change.
Focal -
. moderately hypercellular areas are present, however mitotic figures
‘are not
cdnspicuous. Vascular proliferation and necrosis are not seen p53
shows _
scattered weak to moderate reactivity. The Ki—67 labeling index is
approximately 4% in the most cellular areas. Positive and negative
controls ' ‘
show appropriate immunoreactivity.
Molecular studies show allelic loss for chromosome segments 1p and
19q,’and
-; u ‘ the presence “of MGMT promotor methylation. EGFRvIII mutation was not
.1? detected
“7 (see procedure addenda below).

PROCEDUREs/ADDENDA
Loss of Heterozygosity 1p, 19q Assay (LOH)

  
   

Interpretation
POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1p and chromosome arm 19q is

detected.

 

 

Informative loci are: D15548, D181592, D13552, D1932l9, PLA2G4C
Results—Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block
and a corresponding blood specimen for germline comparison.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and I9q. The 3
markers 7 i
V on lp are D18548, D131592, and D13552 (with D18468, DlSlGlZ, and

. D1 S496 as

backup markers) and the 3 markers on l9q are D198219, D198412, and
PLA2G4C

(with D198606 and D1981182 as backup) All markers are microsatellites
(2 or 4

nt .repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat)
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score,
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used
if the ' “

first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or

' Otherwise

ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas
with 1p

and 19q deletion.

the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.
TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non— neoplastic cells in

may preclude the detection of allelic loss.

***Electronically Signed Out***

Interpretation
.POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected.

Results~Comments _

Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block
‘ TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT
promoter

have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents.
Assessment of '

MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA
followed ‘

by real—timerPCR amplification {MethyLight) of methylated and
'_unmethylated DNA

 

sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by

' .serial

 

dilIution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and
was
assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. - ‘ I
Factors such as the presence of >50% non—neoplastic cells in the
sample, or w
extensive tissue necrosis may preclude the detection of methylated
' MGMT _ -~
promoter sequences.

NEGATIVE — No evidence of EGFRVIII mutation is detected
ReSults4Comments
TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tumor
paraffin block
TheIepidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive
: molecular target
inI glioblastomaI because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated
in- upI
to '40% to 50% of. patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant

III
(EGFRvIII) is an Ioncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR

that is
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically
distinct
‘ -subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has
. been
shown Ito sensiti tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the

.tumor
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin

fixed,
paraffin embeddedI tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The

cDNA is
then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR

.Iproducts ~

 

are detected byI geIl electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this
aesay has II

been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal
celIlIs.
