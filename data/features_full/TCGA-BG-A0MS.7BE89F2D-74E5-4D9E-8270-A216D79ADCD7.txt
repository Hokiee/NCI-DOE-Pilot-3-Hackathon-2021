PART 1: UTERUS WITH BILATERAL ADNEXA, 1 59.5 GRAMS, RADICAL HYSTERECTOMY AND BILATERAL SALPINGO-
OOPHORECTOMY —
A. POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA OF ENDOMETRIUM. ENDOMETRIOID TYPE, INVOLVING

90% OF ENDOMETRIAL SURFACE AND INVADING APPROXIMATELY 44% OF MYOMETRIUM (GRADE 3,
STAGE 33).

B. FOCAL LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IDENTIFIED.
C. ADENOCARCINOMA INVADES CERVICAL STROMA.
D. BILATERAL OVARIES WITH PHYSIOLOGIC CHANGES, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
E. RIGHT PARAMETRIA WITH DETACHED FRAGMENTS OF TUMOR CONSISTENT WITH TISSUE
CONTAMINATION (SEE COMMENT) AND WITH FRAGMENT OF FALLOPIAN TUBE.
F. LEFT PARAMETRIA WITH DETACHED FRAGMNENTS OF TUMOR CONSISTENT WITH TISSUE
CONTAMINATION (SEECOMMENT) AND WITH TWO BENIGN LYMPH NODES (0/2).
