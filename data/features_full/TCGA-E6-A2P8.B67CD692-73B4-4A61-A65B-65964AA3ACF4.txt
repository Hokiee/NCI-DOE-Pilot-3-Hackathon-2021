GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. UTERUS, TUBES AND OVARIES
Received fresh for frozen section is a 3189 TAH with 380. The uterus is Item from fundus to
ectocervix, 9cm from cornua to cornua and 7cm from anterior to posterior. The serosa is tan pink and
smooth. The attached cervix is 4.2cm in diameter and 5.3cm in length. The ectocervix is remarkable for
a 1cm patent slit like os. The specimen is bivalved into anterior and posterior halves to reveal a patent
endocervical canal 3cm. The endometrial cavity is 6cm in length and 5cm from cornua to cornua and
remarkable for a tan pink friable mass 5.4 x 4.5 x 3.2cm, occupying approximately 90% of the cavity.
The mass does not grossly appear to involve the cervix. A portion of the specimen is submitted in
FSAl-FSA2. The maximum depth of invasion of the mass in to the myometrium is 3.2cm. The
uninvolved trabeculated myometrium is 1.5cm and is remarkable for multiple tan white well
circumscribed leiomyomas, the largest of which is 2.5 x 2.3cm. The leiomyomas are sectioned to reveal

TSS:

a homogenous whorled cut surface without any areas of hemorrhage or necrosis. The attached right tan
pink ceribriforrn ovary is 3 x 1.5 x 1.4cm, is bivalved to reveal unremarkable parenchyma. The attached
right ﬁmbriated falIOpian tube is 4cm in length x 0.6cm in diameter. The tube is serially sectioned to
reveal a patent lumen. The attached left tan pink cerebriform ovary is 2 x 1.8 x 1.7cm, is bivalved to
reveal unremarkable parenchyma. The attached left ﬁmbriated fallopian tube is 3.4cm in length x 0.5cm
in diameter. The fallopian tube is serially sectioned to reveal a patent lumen. Gross photographs are
taken. Representatively submitted as follows:

FSA1-FSA2: mass with endomyometrium

A3: anterior cervix

A4: posterior cervix

A5-A7: anterior endomyometrium

A8-A10: posterior endomyometrium

A11: right ovary and fallopian tube

A12: left ovary and fallopian tube

B. PELVIC LYMPH NODE

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and ‘pelvic lymph node' is a tan pink lymph
node 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.40m. The specimen is serially sectioned. Toto B1.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
None provided.

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Endometrial carcinoma.
