GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received the following specimons in the Department of
Pathology, labeled with the parient's name and hospital #

A. Brain tumor
B. Brain tumor
A. The specimen is received fresh, deoignated ”Brain tumor" and

consists of multiple irregular and varying size fragmenta of beige to
pink—tan sof' tissue measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 om in aggregate. A
representative sampling is submitted for touch preparation and frozen

section. The resulting intraoperative diagnosis is "Diffuse infiltrating
qlioma. ," per 2 . Frozen section :iosuc is
resubmitted for permanent processing in cassette FSAl. The remaining
tiSSue is submitted in casoctte A2 with a repreoontativo sampling also
Submitted to the tumor bank.

8. The specimen is received fresh, designated "Brain tumor" and
consists of multiple irregular and varying size fragments of beige to

red—tan Soft tissue measuring 3.5 x 3.0 x 0.8 cm in aggregate. A
representative sampling is submitted to the tumor bank and remaining
specimen is submitted entirely in cassettes Bl~B3. W
"I, or my qualified designee, performed the qroos examination. I have
personally reviewed the gross description and performed a microocopic
examination on all referenced material. I have personally issued this
report on the basis of the qross and microscopic findings."
