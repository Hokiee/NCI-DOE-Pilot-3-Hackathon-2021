Radicai suetotai gastreotomy with separate hepatic- rtery subpyioric
and gastric serosai noduie; fihﬁiw

MACROECOPIC DESERIPTION

 

LBW/L103 (1.1M
i. Sgecimen‘container iabeiled “radical subtotal gastrectomy": A ‘3K95
subto a1 gastrectomy specimen which-measures up to 90mm from

proximai to distai by up to 50mm by 30mm; with a smaii amount of
attached greater omentums and 1esser omentums. Lying 10mm from the.;
distai reSection margin is.a geographic uicer Centred on the greater
curve which measdres up to-SOmm from proximai to distai by up to

45mm. The floor of the uicer has a covering of infiammatory slough.
The serosa over this point appears indurated and fecaiiy nodu3ar.

The remaining gastric mucosa aopears unremarkabie. The uicer lies

at least 38mm from the proxima resection margin, Within the fat
attached to the greater Curve there is a iarge pale lymph node
consistent with metastatic tumour. _

Blocks selected: (3'2 proxima1_resection margin, b~2 distai

resection margin“ c—l. d~1, e~1 tumour, f-x 1esser curve nodes. g~x,
hex, g and h are from the greater curve)

ii. Specimen container labelled "left subpyioric giand": A pale
iymph node measuring up to 20mm in maximum dimension; suggestive of
metastatic carcinoma. Specimen bisected.

Biocks seiected: (a~2}

iii. Specimen container iabeiied "serosai iymph node": A fragment
0f paie tissue which does not exceed 3mm in maximum dimension.
Biocks seiected: (a-l)

iv. Specimen container iabeiied "hepatic artery giand“: A
muitinoduiar mass of ga1e_tissue suggestive of a replaced lymph node
with a cut surface simiiar to that seen within specimen ii. The
seecimen measures up to 38m min maximum dimension.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
i. The tumour is a pooriy differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma

which is made up of sheets and cords of malignant ceiis extending
through the muscularis propria and into the subserosai connective

tissue. The tumour infiltrates under non~neoplastic mucosa in the
adjacent stomach-and permeates lymphatics in the region in and
around the tumour.

Portions of upto,5 lymph nodes are present in the sections from the
iesser curve nodes and these aii show reactive change but no

. evidence of metastatic maiignancy.

Sections of the tissue from the greater curve contain portions of
upto 7 iymph nodes. one of which contains metastatic tumour with
extra capsular extensidn.

Sections of the proximai resection margin.are free of tumour. IN
the sections from the distai resection margin there is tumour in
iymphatics in the submucosa,

ii. Sections of the left.subpyioric giand show almost compiete
gffacement of the gianduiar architecture by metastatic deposits of
umour. ‘

iii. Sections of the serosa] "iymph node" contains some miidiy
inflamed connective tissue with a smaii area covared by hyperpiastic
mesotheiiai ceiist

iv. sections of the he atic artery giand show a iymph node which is
almost tote] replaced y metastatic deposits of the adenecarcinoma.

PATHQLOGIST'S OPINION

i. Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma-extending through the wall
and into the subserosa] connective tissue;

Proximal resection margin is free of tumour.

The distal resection margin tissue contains tumour emboii in the
submueosa] 1ymphatics.

Metastatic tumour is present in one.of 7 lymph nodes from the
greater curve region.

ii. Left subpyioric gTand - Metastatic adenocarcinoma.

iii. Serosai iymph node - ﬁo evidenCe of tumour (the specimén
comprises connective tissue oniy).

iv. Hepatic artery gland*- Metastatic adenocarcinoma.
