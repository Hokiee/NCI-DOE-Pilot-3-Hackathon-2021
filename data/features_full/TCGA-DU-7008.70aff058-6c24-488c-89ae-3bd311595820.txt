MICROSCOPIC: Sections show an infiltrating oligodendroglioma with
microcystic change in some areas- Microgemistocytic cells are
frequently encountered. In more hypercellular areas, nuclear atypia
and mitotic figures are noted. Vascular endothelial hyperplasia and
necrosis are not seen. Labeling index of MlB—I is about 8%. The
tumor

is classified as a grade B oligodendroglioma.
