DIAGNOSIS(ES):
A. Pancreas and duodenum, pancreatoduodenectomy:
1. Adenocarcinoma of pancreas, infiltrating pancreas and multifocally peripancreatic adipose tissue,
moderately differentiated, with metastasis to 5 of 19 peripancreatic lymph nodes, not involving
duodenum, on pancreatic surgical margin (see ﬁnal pancreatic surgical margin status in part "B"), on
anterior peripancreatic surface and within 0.1 mm of posterior pancreatic surface.
2. Common bile duct, no carcinoma identified on margin.
3. Dysplasia, mild, focal, in distal common bile duct in ampullary region.
4. PanlN 1A, 1B and 2 head of pancreas.
5. Pancreas with foci of atrophy and chronic inflammation.
B. Pancreas, body, pancreatectomy:
1. Adenocarcinoma, moderately to poorly-differentiated, of pancreas with extension to peripancreatic
adipose tissue, not identified on new pancreatic surgical margin or anterior or posterior margins.
2. Chronic Iymphadenitis of4 peripancreatic lymph nodes, no tumor seen in lymph nodes.
3. Pancreas with focal atrophy and chronic pancreatitis.
4. PanIN 1B.
C. Stent, removal:
(Gross) Stent (removal).

GROSS DESCRIPTION: a “KM Wu.

The specimen iS received in 3 parts. Mk

Part A is received fresh from the operating room for frozen section diagnosis in a container labeled with the patient's
name and "head of pancreas and duodenum“. It consists of an en bloc resection of duodenum and the head of the
pancreas measuring 14.5 x 9.5 x 5.8 cm overall. The proximal stapled margin measures 10.8 cm in circumference.
The duodenal segment measures 14.5 cm with a distal margin measuring 10.8 cm in circumference. The portion of
pancreas measures 7.8 x 5.8 x 4.6 cm. A palpable mass measuring approximately 1.5 cm is noted 0.3 cm from the
pancreatic surgical margin. The pancreatic surgical margin, which occupies an area of 3.0 x 1.5 cm is marked with two

 

 

 

7 long black sutures by the surgeon and is submitted as AFS1, the false margin is inked yellow. The cut surface of the
pancreas is yellow. Dilated pancreatic ducts are not noted at the margin. The common bile duct margin is submitted
en face as AFSZ. AFS 3 pancreatic mass. The common bile duct is probed into the ampulla and appears
unobstructed. The proximal and distal duodenal margins are inked black. The duodenum and pancreas are serially
sectioned from proximal to distal revealing a firm off-white poorly circumscribed mass abutting the bile duct in the head

, of the pancreas and measuring approximately 1.5 cm. The mass abuts the anterior surface of the pancreas but does
not invade into the duodenal wall. The duodenal mucosa is unremarkable. Lymph nodes are identiﬁed in the
peripancreatic and duodenal fat. Representative sections are submitted in 20 cassettes labeled A1-A20. Anterior
surface inked green, posterior surface of pancreas black.

LEGEND:

AFS1 = True pancreatic

AFSZ = common bile duct margin

AFSB - pancreatic mass

A1 = New (false) pancreatic margin

A2 = New (false) common bile duct margin
A3 = Distal duodenal margin

A4 = Proximal duodenal margin

A5 = Random duodenum

A6 = Mass to anterior surface

A7 = Mass to anterior surface and bile duct
A8-10 = Mass to posterior surface

A11 = ampulla

A12-20 = fat for lymph nodes

Part B is received fresh from the operating room for frozen section diagnosis in a container labeled with the patient's
name and "body of pancreas blue suture on new margin". It consists of one piece of red to yellow soft tissue measuring
3.1 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. A suture marks the true margin, which is submitted en face as BFSt—Z. The false margin is inked

blue and the opposite margin yellow. The remaining surfaces are inked black. The specimen is submitted in toto in 5
cassettes labeled BFS1-2 and 81-3.

LEGEND

BFS1 = New pancreatic margin. pancreatic duct
BFSZ = New pancreatic margin

81—3 = remaining tissue

Part C is received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and "patient's old stent". It consists of one piece
of a blue rubber tube measuring 8.8 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm. The container is marked ”SAVE". GROSS ONLY.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION:

AFS1: Pancreatic margin with invasive carcinoma.

AFSZ: Common bile duct margin, no carcinoma identified.

AFSS: (Mass) Multifocal in situ carcinoma and foci highly suspicious for invasive carcinoma.

BF81 + BFSZ = New pancreatic margin. no carcinoma seen. PanlN1b and ? low-grade IPMN idetiﬁed.
