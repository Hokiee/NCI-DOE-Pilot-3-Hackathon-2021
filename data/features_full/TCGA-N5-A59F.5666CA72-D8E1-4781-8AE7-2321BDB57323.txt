DIAGNOSIS :
l. Uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries:
Tumor Type:
Carcinoearooma (Malignant mullerian mixed tumor) at endometrium
with homologous dizferentiation
Myometrial Invasion:
(>50%)
Measures 8 mm in maximum depth
Myometrium thickness measures 12 mm in the area of maximal tumor
invasion
Endooervioal Invasion:
Not identified
Lymphovascular invasion:
Identified
Endometrium:
Exhibits atrophy
Myometrium:
Exhibits sdenomyosis
Exhibits multiple leiomyometa
Adnexa:
Right fallopian tube exhibits:hydroealpinx
Right ovary exhibits:endometriosis, endosalpingiosis
Left fallopian tube exhibits:hydrosalpinx
Leﬁt ovary exhibits:endometrosis. tubal-ovary adhesion
Comment: The tumor has high proliterative index estimated at above 90%
by Ki- 67 labeling. Immunostains for Syneptophysin and Chronogrnin are
negative. There is no immunohistochemical support for neuroendocrine
differentiation.

2. Sentinel lymph node. right hypogastric: excision:

- One benign lymph node (0/1) with endoealpingiosis

— Additional HIE stained sections and immunohistochemical stains for
cytokeratins (AElzns3) show no evidence of metastatic

tumor

3. Sentinel lymph node, left external iliac; excision:

- One benign lymph node with endosalpingiosis (0/1)

- Additional HIE stained sections and immunohietochemical stains for
cytokeratins (331:Ax3) show no evidence of metastatic

tumor

4. Lymph node, right external iliac: excision:
- One benign lymph node (0/1)

5. Lymph node, right para-aortic; excision:
- One benign lymph node (0/1)

6. Lymph node, left para—aortic: excision:
- One benign lymph node (0/1)

7. Omentum. omentectomy:
- Benign fibroadipase tissue
~ One benign lymph node (0/1)

Some of the immunohistoohemistry and 153 tests were developed and their
performance characteristics were determined by the Department of Pathology.
They have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is
not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not
be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified
under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIL '88) as
qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL). AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.
