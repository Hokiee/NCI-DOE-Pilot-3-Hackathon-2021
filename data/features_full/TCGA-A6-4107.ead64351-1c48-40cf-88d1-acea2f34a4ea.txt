SPECIMEN
Right colon

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE~OP DIAGNOSIS: Right colon cancer.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
Received fresh labeled "right colon" is a previously
unopened 17 cm. segment of proximal right colon with

attached 13.5 cm. of distal ileum surfaced by smooth to slightly

scabrous tan—pink serosa with a copious amount of attached
mesocolon

and mesentery. A 4.7 cm. unremarkable appendix ranging from 0.5 to

0.8 cm. in diameter is present. The proximal and distal margins

measure 4.0 and 6.5 cm. in circumference respectively. On opening,

there is a circumferential, 7.8 x 4.6 cm. lobulated soft tan—pink

lesion 8 cm. distal to the ileocecal valve. A portion of tumor and

a portion of normal are submitted for tissue procurement as

requested. 0n sectioning, the tumor has a maximal thickness of 1.4

cm. and appears to grossly extend through the muscularis focally.

The tumor is greater than 3 cm. from the inked free serosal
surface.

The ileal mucosa is finely nodular tan—pink with irregular folds
and

the wall averages 0.5 cm. in thickness. The uninvolved colonic

mucosa is unremarkable glistening tan—pink with irregular folds
and

the wall averages 0.5 cm. in thickness as well. Multiple soft to

slightly rubbery tan pinkhred tissues in keeping with lymph nodes

measuring up to 1.4 cm. in greatest dimension are recovered from
the

attached mesocolon and mesentery. Representative sections are

submitted in 17 blocks as labeled. RS—l7

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Proximal and distal margins; 2—5 — central
tumor; 6 ~ closest inked radial serosal surface subjacent to tumor;
7 — ICV; 8 - random ileum and colon; 9 » appendix; 10—12 — eight
whole lymph nodes per cassette; 13, 14 — six whole lymph nodes per
cassette; 15, 16 - one trisected lymph node per cassette; 1? ~ one

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION
bisected lymph node.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

A summary of the microscopic findings for this right colon
resection is in the template below.

Histologic type: Invasive adenocarcinoma.
Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated.
Primary tumor (pT): Tumor invades through the muscularis propria
into the superficial pericolonic fat (pT3).
Proximal margin: Negative for tumor.
Distal margin: Negative for tumor.
Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative for tumor.
Distance of tumor from closest margin: 19 cm from distal margin
Vascular invasion: Not identified.
Regional lymph nodes (pN): Metastatic adenocarcinoma is identified
in 2/28 lymph nodes (leb).
Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: Not identified.
Distant metastasis (pM): Can not evaluate pr.
Other findings: The appendix demonstrates endometriosis.

COMMENT: MSI testin was requested by the surgeon. Block 2 has
been sent to i for MSI testing and that report will be

DIAGNOSIS

A. Colon, right, ileocolectomy:
Invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, invasive
through muscularis propria into fat (pT3).

DIAGNOSIS

20f 28 lymph nodes positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma
(leb).

Resection margins are negative for carcinoma.

Appendix with endometriosis.
