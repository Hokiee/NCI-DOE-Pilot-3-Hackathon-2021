Gross Description
A. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"loft distal ureter~FS' is a yellow/tan fibroadipose tissue
measuring 5 x 3 x 1 mm thick. Entirely submitted in Al.

B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"right distal ureter-F." is a yellow/tan soft tissue measuring 5
x 2 x 1 mm. Entirely submitted in 51.

C. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"right common and external iliac lymph nodes” is an aggregate of
tibroadipose tissue measuring 3 X 3 x 3 cm in compact

aggregate. There is a rather subtle induration. Entirely
submitted in Cl—C3.
D. Received in tormalin labeled with the patient‘s name and

fibroadipose tissue frrgments measuring 3 x 3 x 3 cm in compact
aggregate. One dominaxt area of induration is bisected in D1.
The remainder of the tzssue shows more subtle induration.
Entirely submitted in £2, D3.

E. Received in formalir labeled with the patient's name and
"right internal iliac lymph nodes" is fibroadipose tissue
measuring 2.5 x 2.5 x ”.5 cm in compact aggregate. Minimal
induration is encountered. Entirely submitted in El—EB.

E. Received in formaiir labeled with the patient‘s name and
”left common and interral lymph nodes" is an aggregate of finely
divided fat measuring i.5 x 2.5 X 2.5 cm in compact aggregate.
No definite gross lympr node. Entirely submitted in Fl—F3.

G. Received in formalir labeled with the patient's name and
