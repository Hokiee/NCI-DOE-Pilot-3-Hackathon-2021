GROSS DESCRIPTION
The specimens are received in five containers, each labeled with the patient‘s name

Part A is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis labeled “distal ureter margin right" and consists of a
0.7 x 0.4 x0 .2 cm portion of ten tissue, which is submitted in toto for frozen section diagnosis as FSA1.
The frozen section residue is submitted as (A1).

Frozen section diagnosis:
FSA1 ~ Right distal ureter margin - “No tumor seen.”
Examined by

Part C ls received in formalin labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes” and consists of a 5 cm portion of adipose
tissue. which contains eight 0.2 cm — 1.7 cm lymph nodes. The lymph nodes are submitted In their
entirety as (C1 HOS).

SLIDE KEY
C1 — four possible lymph nodes
C2435 — one bisected lymph node per cassette

Part D is received fresh labeled “bladder/prostate" and consists of a 8 x 5 x 4 cm urinary bladder. in
continuity with 2 x 0.5 cm segments of bilateral ureters, symmetrical 4 x 3 x 3 cm prostate gland with
bilateral 2 x1 x 0.5 cm seminal vesicles and a moderate amount of soft periveslcular adipose tissue.
There are multiple staples over the mid anterior aspect of the prostate and bladder. The right side of the
specimen is inked blue, the left side is black and the mid anterior aspect of the prostate Is inked orange.
The bladder is opened to disclose a 3 x 1.9 cm ulcer over the right posterior wall. mid posterior walls,
extending to left lateral wall and overlying the left ureteral orifice. Sections through the ulcer show a 2.9 x
2.5 x 1.2 cm firm gray-white mass within the left posterior wall and left lateral wall. The mass extends
through the bladder well, 1.6 cm from the left lateral soft tissue margin. The mass does not grossly
involve the prostate gland and is located approximately 4.5 cm from the urethral margin. The mass does
not grossly involve the right side of the bladder. The remaining bladder mucosa is tan and trabeculated
without additional gross lesions. Sections through the prostate gland show a well-deﬁned 0.4 cm white
nodule within the right side, near the apex. The remainder of the prostate gland consists of dense tan
tissue with focal ﬁne honeycombing. No gross lesions can be identified within the seminal vesicles. No
lymph nodes can be identiﬁed within the specimen. Fresh tumor is taken for TCGA. Representative
sections are submitted as (D1)—(D24). .

Part E is received in formalin labeled “left pelvic lymph nodes" and consists of a 3 cm aggregate of
adipose tissue, which contains a 2.5 cm partially fatty lymph node. The lymph node is submitted in its
entirety as (E1).

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Sections examined on multiple H&E-stained slides.

Surgical Pathology Cancer Case Summary, Urinary Bladder — Radical Cystoprostatectomy:

SPECIMEN: Bladder and prostate.
PROCEDURE: Radical cystoprostatectomy.
TUMOR SITE: invasive tumor ls noted along the left posterior and left lateral bladder wall.
TUMOR SIZE: 2.9 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm.
HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Urothellai cell carcinoma.
ASSOCIATED EPITHELIAL LESIONS: Focal carcinoma in situ also present.
HISTOLOGIC GRADE: High grade.
MICROSCOPIC TUMOR EXTENSION: Through detrusor muscle Into perivesical fat.
MARGINS: Not involved. Tumor does extend to within 0.7 cm of the left lateral perivesical fat margin.
LYMPHOVASCULAR SPACE INVASION: Present, extensive.
PATHOLOGIC STAGING:
Primary Tumor: pT3, tumor invades perivesical tissue. Grossiy, the tumor did appear to extend
through the detrusor muscle. However, a true extravesicular mass was not identiﬁed. As such, I
would favor that this is best categorized as a pT3a rather than pT3b.
Regional Lymph Nodes: pNO, no lymph node metastases.
Number of lymph nodes examined: 7.

Surgical Pathology Cancer Case Summary, Prostate Gland — Radical Prostatectomy:

PROCEDURE: Radical cystoprostatectomy.
PROSTATE SIZE: 4 x 3 x 3 cm. Cannot give accurate weight as the prostate was part of a larger
cystoprostatectomy procedure.
LYMPH NODE SAMPLING: Pelvic lymph nodes present.
HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Adenocarcinoma (acinar, not otherwise speciﬁed).
HISTOLOGIC GRADE:
Primary Pattern: Grade 3.
Secondary Pattern: Grade 4.
Total Gleason Score: 7 (moderately poorly differentiated).
TUMOR QUANTITATION: Tumor comprises approximately 2% of the submitted prostate tissue.
EXTRAPROSTATIC EXTENSION: Not identified.
SEMINAL VESICLE lNVASiON: Not identiﬁed.
MARGINS: Not involved.
TREATMENT EFFECT: Not identiﬁed.
LYMPHOVASCULAR SPACE INVASION: Not identiﬁed.
PERINEURAL INVASION: Present.
PATHOLOGIC STAGING:
Primary Tumor: pT2c, bilateral disease.
Regional Lymph Nodes: pNO, no regional lymph node metastasis.
Number of lymph nodes examined: 7, none involved (0/7).
