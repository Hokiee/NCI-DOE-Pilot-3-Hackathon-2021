and with following measurements: 9.5cm from Eundus to exocervix; 6.0cm from
cornu to cornu; 4.0cm from anterior to posterior. The right ovary and
fallopian tube measures 2.0 x 1.6 x 1.1cm and 6.0 x 0.5 x 0.4cm
respectively. The left ovary and fallopian tube measures 2.5 x 1.0 x 0.9cm
and 5.8 x 0.5 x 0.4cm respectively. The omentum measures 8.0 x 7.0 x 4.0cm.
The ectocervix is tan white and smooth. on opening, the endocervical canal
measures 2.0cm in length and 1.2cm across. It has a tan smooth mucosa. The
endometrial cavity measures 5.5cm in length and 3.8cm from cornu to cornu.
The endometrium is ten and focally nodular, polyploid mass on the anterior
and posterior wall, measuring 1.5 x 3.0 x 0.9cm in overall. The mass
appears to be confined in the mucosa, grossly. The myometrium measures
1.6cm in maximum thickness. The mass is located 0.5cm from the lower
uterine segment. There is a 1.0cm of tan-white. rubbery whorled and
well-circumscribed mass within the myometrium. The right and left ovaries
have tan—white smooth outer surface with several white corpora albicantia.
The both fallopian tubes have grossly identifiable pinpoint lumen with
Eimbristed ends. The omentum is serially sectioned and no gross lesion
identified. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

AFSC: Frozen section from posterior wall mass

3: Posterior cervix

c: Posterior endometrial lower segment

D-E: Posterior endometrial tumor with deepest invasion

F: Tumor at the fundus

G—H: Anterior endometrial tumor with deepest invasion

1: Anterior endometrial lower segment

J: Anterior cervix

K: Omentum with serosa of the fundus

L: Omentum

M-N: Entire right ovary

O—P: Entire right fallopian tube

Q—R: Entire left ovary

S-T: Entire left fallopian tube

U: Intramural mass

INTRAOPERATIVB CONSULT: High grade carcinoma, compatible with serous
carcinoma. no invasion seen.

2. The specimen is received fresh and labeled RIGHT periaortic lymph node.
It consists of a piece of tan-red soft tissue, measuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 0.9cm.
The specimen is entirely submitted in two cassettes labeled A, B.

3. The specimen is received fresh and labeled LEFT periaortic lymph node.

It consists of a piece of tan-red soft tissue. measuring 3.0 x 2.5 x 0.6cm.
