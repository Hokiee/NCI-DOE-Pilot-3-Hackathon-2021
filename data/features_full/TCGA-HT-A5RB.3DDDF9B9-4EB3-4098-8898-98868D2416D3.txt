Microscopic Description:

Permanent section of the frozen section specimen slide 1A as well as unfrozen 13 demonstrates a mildly
to markedly hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely inﬁltrates the gray and white matter. Atypia is
generally mild. Tumor cells tend to have a discrete triangular glial cap as well as a modest number of
ﬁbrillary processes. Although the nuclei tend to be round to oval, only equivocal perinuclear halos are
seen. No mitotic ﬁgures are identified. There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis.

Addendum Microscopic Description:

Sections demonstrate a mild to moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely inﬁltrates the gray
and white matter. In addition to the fibrillary astrocytoma pattern seen in specimen 1, there is a minor
area that shows classic oligiodendroglioma. Again, mitotic figures are not seen. There is no
microvascular proliferation or necrosis. Secondary structures including subpial condensation,
perineuronal satellitosis and perivascular accumulation are seen.

The neoplastic cells are diffusely immunoreactive for p53, consistent with astocytic origin. Scattered
MlB-l reactive cells are present. A labeling index of 2.8% is calculated in the most proliferative regions,
consistent with the low grade histologic features. ‘
