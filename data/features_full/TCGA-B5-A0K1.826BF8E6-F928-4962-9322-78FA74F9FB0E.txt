GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. "Uterus and cervix", received fresh for frozen section is a 173 gram, 10.1

x 7.8 x 4.8 cm uterus which contains a 7 x 6 x 1.9 cm friable white mass that
involves both the anterior and posterior wall of the uterus and fills the
endometrial cavity, extending 1 cm into a 2.2 cm thick myometrium. A full
thickness section demonstrating extent of invasion is frozen as AFl with the
frozen section remnant submitted in block Al. An additional full thickness
section of tumor involving the anterior wall is in block A2, with tumor
involving the posterior wall and A3. This tumor approaches but does not
appear to invade the unremarkable lewer uterine segment and cervix (anterior
lower uterine segment and tumor A4, anterior cervix in A5, tumor approaching
posterior lower uterine segment in A6, posterior cervix in A7). The serosal

surface is unremarkable.

B. "Right tube and ovary", received fresh is an 18.5 gram specimen containing
right fallopian tube (5 xvl cm) and ovary (3 x'l x 1 am) that are
unremarkable. Sections of tube and ovary submitted in block Bl.

C. "Left tube and ovary", received fresh is a 13.6 gram specimen consisting of
left fallopian tube (4 x 1 cm) and ovary (2.5 x l x 1 cm) that are
unremarkable (C1).

 

K } D. "Left pelvic lymph node", received fresh is a 10 x 4 x 1 cm aggregate of (
. L2" fibrofatty tissue that is examined for lymph nodes. This candidate is

‘ submitted as follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY: ,

Dl- four lymph node candidates

D2- four lymph node candidates

D3- one candidate, bisected

D4- one candidate, quadraSected

D5- one candidate, trisected

D6— one candidate, bisected

07- one candidate, bisected

DB- one candidate, trisected '

D9-10— one candidate, quadrasected and fully submitted in two blocks
D11-13— largest lymph node candidate (2 x 1 x 1 cm) in three blocks

E. "Right pelvic lymph nodes", received fresh is a 10 x 4 x 1 cm aggregate of
fibrofatty tissue that is examined for lymph nodes with candidates submitted

as follows:

El- three candidates

E2— two candidates

E3- one candidate, bisected
E4— one candidate, trisected
ES— one candidate, trisected

E6—7— one candidate, trisected and submitted in two blocks
EB—lO- largest candidate (4 x l x 0.2 cm), submitted in three blocks

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: {
. A. "Uterus and cervix":
' AFl (anterior endomyometrium full thickness with mass, 1 cm invasion into

—

a 2.2 cm thick myometrium)—adenocarcinoma FIGO I —

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: HYSTERECTOMY, OOPHORECTOMY & LYMPHADENECTOMY

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 6th Edition): ple pNO pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative prOcedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.
