Final Diagnosis

Breast, right, wide local excision: Inﬁltrating lobular carcinoma, Nottingham grade II (of
III)[tubules 3/3, nuclei 2/3, mitoses 1/3; Nottingham score 6/9], forming a 5.2 x 3.0 x 2.6 cm
mass. Lobular carcinoma in situ is present and represents less than 5% of the overall tumor
volume. Angiolymphatic invasion is present. The non-neoplastic breast parenchyma show
nonproliferative ﬁbrocystic changes. Calcifications present in benign ducts and acini. Biopsy

site changes present. The inferior and medial margins are positive for invasive carcinoma.

Breast, right, total mastectomy: Inﬁltrating lobular carcinoma, Nottingham grade II (of III),
involving the medial aspect of the biopsy cavity. Two additional nodules of Nottingham grade II
(of III) invasive lobular carcinoma are identiﬁed in the lower outer quadrant (0.7 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm,
located 1.4 cm from the deep margin; and 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm, located 1.2 cm from the deep
margin). Lobular carcinoma in situ is present and represents less than 5% of the overall tumor
volume. Angiolymphatic invasion is present. The non-neoplastic breast parenchyma shows
proliferative ﬁbrocystic changes. Biopsy site changes present. The tumor does not involve the
nipple, overlying skin, or underlying chest wall. All surgical resection margins, including the
deep margin, are negative for tumor (residual tumor in the biopsy cavity is located 2.2 cm from
the deep margin).

Lymph nodes, right axillary, dissection: Multiple (5 of 18) right axillary lymph nodes are
positive for metastatic carcinoma [AJCC pN2]. The largest is represented by a matted mass of
lymph nodes and measures 4.2 x 2.6 x 2.4 cm. Extranodal extension is present.

Comment: Final (mastectomy) surgical margins are widely free of involvement.
