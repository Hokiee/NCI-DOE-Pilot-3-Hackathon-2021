COMMENT:

Part 3: Elastic stain highlights the presence of visceral pleura invaslon (PLI). The neoplastic cells are positive for Trim.
and PAST). focally and weakly for p63 and are negative for CKSIE stains. All controls shew appropriate reactivity. .
The metastatic carcinoma in perlbmhahial lymph node shows: extracapsular extension into the peribronchlal connective
tissue. ‘ . _ '

Part 8: The malignant cells are highlighted by pancytokeratin stain whlla LCA stain highlights the lymphocytes. The
carcinoma cells extend mm the perinadal connective tisaue.
