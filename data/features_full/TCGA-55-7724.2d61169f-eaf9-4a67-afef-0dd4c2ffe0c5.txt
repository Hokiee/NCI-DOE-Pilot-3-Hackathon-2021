Specimen

#1 4R

#2 Level 7

#3 4L

#4 2R

#5 Left upper lobe wedge
#6 Level 5

#7 Level 6

Gross Examination

#1 Received fresh labeled 4R are fragments of yellow to black material, in
aggregate 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. It is completely submitted as single frozen
sections.

#2 Received fresh labeled level 7 are two fragments of gray—tan tissue, up to
0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm. Completely submitted as a single frozen section.

#3 Received fresh labeled 4L are fragments of black, focally yellow material,
in aggregate 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. Completely submitted as a single frozen
section.

#4 Received fresh labeled 2R are fragments of yellow to black material in
aiireiate, 0.4 x 0.4 X 0.3 cm. Completely submitted as a single frozen section.

#5 Received fresh labeled left upper lobe wedge is a 14.0 x 6.0 x up to 3.5
cm wedge of lung with a 15.0 cm long staple line along one edge. The pleura is
focally firm and discolored gray—tan over an area of 5.5 x 2.0 cm.

Approximately 2.0 cm from the staple line, the pleura is focally retracted.
Sectioning demonstrates a 1.2 X 1.0 x 0.8 cm ill—defined, gray—tan mass
corresponding to this area. The mass itself is 1.5 cm from the stapled
resection margin. The parenchyma is otherwise pink—tan to red—tan, soft and
spongy. There are multiple adjacent cystic spaces beneath the firm discolored
area on the pleural surface up to 0.5 cm. There are no additional lesions
identified. Following consent of the patient, tissue is submitted to the Cancer
