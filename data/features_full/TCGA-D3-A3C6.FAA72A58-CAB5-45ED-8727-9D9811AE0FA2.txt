GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) RIGHT INGUINAL CONTENTS TIL PROTOCOL - Received sterile and processed in the sterile hood for TIL protocol studies
is a 23.0 x 8.0 x 2.8 cm unoriented portion of ﬁbroadipose tissue partly surfaced by a 23.0 x 1.2 cm ellipse of pale tan, wrinkled
skin. Specimen is sectioned to reveal a 5.0 x 4.0 x 3.0 cm tan, ﬁrm mass with tan, rubbery, lobulated cut surfaces that grossly
comes to within 1.0 cm from the skin surface. The remainder of the adipose tissue is dissected to reveal ten possible lymph
nodes ranging from 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm - 2.6 x 1.6 x 1.1 cm. The majority of the mass is given to TIL protocol and a portion has
been given to tumor bank for research purposes.

SECTION CODE: A1, representative section of mass to skin; A2—A4, remainder of mass; A5, two possible lymph nodes;
A6, two possible lymph nodes; A7, one possible lymph node, bisected; A8, one possible lymph node, serially sectioned; A9, one
possible lymph node, serially sectioned; A10, one lymph node, serially sectioned; A11, A12, one possible lymph node, serially
sectioned; A13, A14, one possible lymph node, serially sectioned.
(B) RIGHT ILIAC AND OBTURATOR CONTENTS - A 6.0 x 4.2 x 1.0 cm portion of ﬁbroadipose tissue which yields ﬁve possible
lymph nodes ranging from 0.8 - 8.0 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are submitted entirely.

SECTION CODE: B1, two lymph nodes; 32. one lymph node; B3, B4, one lymph node, serially sectioned; B5-B9, one
lymph node, serially sectioned.

CLINICAL HISTORY
Melanoma.

ADDENDUM

This modiﬁed report is being issued to report special studies/lHC/Molecular studies and to include an additional, negative lymph
node in specimen B.

Addendum completed by '

(A) LYMPH NODES, RIGHT INGUINAL, TIL PROTOCOL, DISSECTION:
METASTATIC MELANOMA TO FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE. (SEE COMMENT)
Largest tumor deposit size: 50 x 40 mm.
Ten lymph nodes, melanoma is not identiﬁed (0110).
(B) RIGHT lLlAC AND OBTURATOR CONTENTS, DISSECTION:
METASTATIC MELANOMA TO ONE OF FIVE LYMPH NODES (1/5). (SEE COMMENT)
Largest tumor deposit size: 2.0 x 1.0 mm.
Location: Subcapsular.
Extracapsular extension: Not Identiﬁed.

COMMENT

Sections show metastatic melanoma involving adipose tissue; residual lymph node is not identiﬁed in this area. In part A, an
immunohistochemical study performed here reveals that the tumor cells are positive with an anti-melanocytic cocktail (HMB45,
anti-MART1, and anti-tyrosinase). This result supports the above diagnosis.

In part B. the tumor in the lymph node is histologically similar to the tumor in part A. This supports the above diagnosis.
