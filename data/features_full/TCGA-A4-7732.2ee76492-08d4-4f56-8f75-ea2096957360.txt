Clinical History
Right renal mass

Specimen
#1 Right kidney

Gross Examination

#1 Received fresh, placed in formalin and labeled right kidney is a 16.0 x
9.5 x 6.0 cm nephrectomy specimen. The specimen consists of a 358.7 gram, 13.0
x 8.5 x 5.5 cm kidney with attached perinephric adipose tissue and a 9.0 cm
long, 0.3 cm in diameter ureter. The adrenal gland is not present. Within the
upper to mid pole of the kidney is an 8.0 x 8.0 x 5.0 cm relatively
circumscribed mass. The mass has a soft, friable, variegated golden-yellow to
dull yellow and focally hemorrhagic cut surface. The mass is also focally
calcified. The mass abuts and pushes against the renal capsule, but grossly
does not appear to extend through it, and comes to within 0.2—0.3 cm of the
radial soft tissue margin (inked black). The mass is at least 2.5 cm from the
vascular margins. The parenchyma is otherwise maroon—tan with a distinct
corticomedullary junction (cortex 0.7 cm and medulla 1.2 cm). There are no
additional lesions identified. There are no lymph node candidates identified at
the hilum. The perinephric adipose tissue is serially sectioned to demonstrate

no gross focal mass or lesion. Followin the written consent of the atient
- - submitted to the_ and theﬁ
Ten representative sections submitted in seven: "A"—"G". Block

Summary: "A", vascular and ureteral margins, tangential; "B", mass with respect
to the renal capsule and radial margin, perpendicular; "C", additional section

of mass with respect to adjacent kidney and renal capsule; 'D"—"F"
respect to the pelvic adipose tissue; "G", uninvolved parenchyma.
