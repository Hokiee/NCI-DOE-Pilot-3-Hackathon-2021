carcinoma, poor differentiated, (high-grade)

2. Piece of cystoprostatectomy presenting the urinary bladder with cavity occupied by sizable tumor,
vegetative, developed on trigone level, intramural evolution, peri-OUS and invasive in the whole wall.

invasion of the entire bladder wall, prostate and seminal vesicles; stpT4. Numerous intramural tumoral
emboIi.

3. Right ureter without malign elements.

4. Right iliac intern, extern and obturator adenopathic block of 5cm with metastasis of low differentiated
carcinoma (high—grade).

5. Right para-rectal adenopathy, node max 1.0 cm with metastasis of urothelial carcinoma (high—grade).

6. Left iliac intern, extern and obturator adenopathic block of 4cm with metastasis of low differentiated
