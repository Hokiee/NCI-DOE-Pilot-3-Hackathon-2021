DIAGNOSIS

(D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 7 (4+3). (SEE COMMENT)
TUMOR CONFINED TO THE PROSTATE.
MARGINS OF RESECTION FREE OF TUMOR.
Right and left seminal vesicles, no tumor present.
Segments of right and left vasa deferentia, no tumor present.
PERINEURAL INVASION PRESENT.
No vascular/lymphatic invasion identiﬁed.
PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH-GRADE.

3 COMMENT

The prostate gland contains a single focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor is located in the right posterolateral, right
posterior, mid posterior, and left posterior peripheral zone. The tumor focus measures 2.5 x 0.9 cm in the largest cross-sectional
dimension, and it is present in the three cross sections of the prostate, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. The
tumor is confined to the prostate. The margins of resection are free of tumor.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES — A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (5.2 x 2.5 x 3.8 cm, 36 grams, post-ﬁxation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
posterolateral aspect of the prostate is abundant and more extensive along the right side. An area of firmness is noted on the
midline posterior surface of the prostate. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate an area of tumor in the mid posterior
region of the two cross sections of the prostate.

The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

SECTION CODE: 01-03, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; 04, 05,
left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; 06. prostatlc base right border; 07-09,
prostatic base right posterior border; 010-012, prostatic base central portion; D13, D14, prostatic base left border; 015, 016,
prostatic base left posterior border; D17, D18, apex anterior; D19, D20, apex left; 021, D22, apex posterior; 023, 024, apex right;
025-036, sections of the three cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.

The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in
black. Blue ink (07, 8, 10-12, 19—24, 27, 28, 32 and 36) and orange ink (031) denote surfaces that do not represent a true margin
of resection. Two blocks (025 and 29) submitted for decalcification. ‘
