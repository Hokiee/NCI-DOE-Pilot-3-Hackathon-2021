AJCC Staging pTla pNO

This staging information is based on information available at
the time of this

report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and
additional

information.

Clinical History:

The patient is a 'year-old female with left renal mass.
Radiology reveals a 10.7 x 5.8 cm exophytic mass arising from
the upper pole of the left kidney concerning for extension into
the perinephric space to Gerota‘ s fascia by imaging.

Gross Description:

Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally
labeled "left kidney."

Specimen fixation: fresh, and later placed in formalin

Type of specimen: laparoscopic left radical nephrectomy

Side of specimen: per requisition, left

Size and weight of specimen: 20.6 x 12.4 x 5.8 cm, 515 grams
with the majority of the fat removed

Orientation: The Gerota' s fascia fat remaining on the specimen
is inked blue.

Presence/absence of adrenal gland: absent
Tumor site: mid and superior pole, grossly appearing to arise
from the cortex

Tumor description: The tumor is somewhat circumscribed,
tan/yellow to red,

variegated with white fibrous areas throughout

Tumor size: roughly 7.5 x 6.0 x 4.5 cm
Presence/absence of multicentricity: absent
Confinement/non—confinement to the kidney: confined
Extent of invasion:

Perirenal adipose tissue: does not involve

Gerota' s fascia: does not involve

Renal vein: does not involve

Ureter: does not involve

Renal Sinus: does not involve

Pelvicaliceal: does not involve

Adrenal: not present

Other organs: n/a

Surgical margins:

Perirenal adipose tissue: negative

Renal vein: negative

Renal artery: negative

Ureter: negative

Description of kidney away from tumor: kidney parenchyma away
from mass is

red/brown with a distinct corticomedullary junction
Hilar lymph nodes: none identified

Other significant findings: none

Tissue submitted for special investigations: yes; Tumor and
normal are submitted to Tissue Procurement.

Digital picture: no
Block summary:

A1 — vascular and ureteral margin taken at the time of triage
A2,A3 - mass with respect to blue inked Gerota‘ s fascia,
perpendicular

A4,A5 - additional section of mass, different appearing areas
with adjacent

normal kidney

A6 — mass and sinus fat and adjacent normal kidney

A7 - additional section of mass, grossly different areas

A8 — representative section of normal kidney away from mass
