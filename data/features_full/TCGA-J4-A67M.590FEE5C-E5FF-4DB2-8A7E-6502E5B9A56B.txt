Gross Description
A. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"tissue anterior to prostate" is a 5.0 cm aggregate of tan
yellow fatty tissue with no palpable masses identified. The cut
surface has a fatty uniform appearance and is grossly
unremarkable. The entire specimen is submitted Al-As.
B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"left pelvic lymph node" are three nodules of tan fatty tissue
grossly consistent with lymphoid tissue, ranging in size from
1.8 cm down to 0.6 cm. The excess fat is trimmed and all three
nodules are submitted Bl—B3 with one possible lymph node in each
cassette.
C.
Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "right
pelvic lymph nodes" are three nodules of tan fatty tissue
grossly consistent with lymphoid tissue, ranging in size from
3.0 cm down to 1.0 cm. The excess fat is trimmed. The cut
surface of the largest nodule has a focal hemorrhagic glistening
appearance. All three nodes are submitted as follows:
C1-Cz=one lymph node that has been bisected; C3, C4=one lymph
node each. ’ ' ;
D. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"hernia sac" is an irregular fragment of tan—pink glistening
fibrofatty tissue measuring 5 x 3 x 1.0 cm maximal thickness. A
representative section is submitted in D1.
E. Received in formalin labeled "prostate gland seminal vesicle
and vas deferens” is a radical prostatectomy specimen which
includes a 40 gram prostate gland with attached seminal vesicles
and small segments of vasa deferentia. The gland measures 4 x
3.5 x 3.5 cm and has a shaggy capsule that is disrupted at the

bladder margin and the specimen has been previously inked black
on the left and blue on the right. The right seminal vesicle
measures 3.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm., The right vas deferens measures
4.0 cm in length. The left seminal vesicle measures 3.0 x 1.0 x
1.0 cm. The left vas deferens measures 3.0 cm in length. The
inferior prostate is sectioned transversely, removed from the
rest of the specimen, and then sectioned from anterior to
posterior parallel to the plane of the urethra. The remaining
gland is serially sectioned transversely and shows a firm,
focally nodular parenchyma. The seminal vesicles and vasa
deferentia show no gross abnormalities. Section code is as
follows: the inferior prostate demonstrating apical margin
submitted entirely anterior to posterior=E1—E10; bladder
margin=E11; complete section of mid gland anterior=Elz—El3;
posterior aspect=E14-E15; complete sections of upper third of
gland, anterior E16vE17, posterior aspect=E18-Els; remainder of
posterior gland submitted=E20-E22; right seminal vesicle and vas
deferens=E23; left seminal vesicle and vas deferens=324. Tissue
was also taken for research.
