GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. WLE VULVA
Received is a vulvectomy specimen measuring 4 x 1.7 x 1 cm. The surface of the specimen is tan-gray
and unremarkable. The single right stitch is arbitrarily designated 12 o’clock. The specimen is inked as
follows: 12 o‘clock, 3 o‘clock, 6 o’clock-blue, 6 o’clock, 9 o’clock, 12 o'clock-orange. The specimen is
serially sectioned from right to left and submitted in toto as follows:

A1: 12 o’clock right margin

A2-A4: full thickness sections from right to left

A5: 6 o’clock left margin
B. SLN #1: Received fresh is a tan pink lymph nodes 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.50m. The specimen is bisected,
touch preps are taken and the specimen is submitted in toto in FSB.
C. SLN #2: Received fresh is a tan pink lymph nodes 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.30m. The specimen is bisected,
touch preps are taken and the specimen is submitted in toto in C1.
D. SLN #3: Received fresh is a tan pink lymph nodes 1.0 x 0.5 X 0.5cm. The specimen is bisected,
touch preps are taken and the specimen is submitted in toto in D1.
E. SLN#4: Received fresh is a tan pink lymph nodes 1.5 x 1.3 x 0.50m. The specimen is bisected, touch
preps are taken and the specimen is submitted in toto in E1.
F. SLN#5: Received fresh is a tan pink lymph nodes 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.50m. The specimen is bisected, touch
pre . e taken and the specimen is submitted in toto in F1.
G$REASTz
Received fresh is a 474 gram simple mastectomy specimen measuring 21 x 19 x 3.5 cm. The
specimen is partially surfaced with a tan-pink ellipse of skin measuring 16 X 16 cm. The skin surface is
remarkable for a centrally located partially raised nipple 1 cm. The areola rim measures 1.3 cm. The
specimen is inked as follows: superior anterior—blue, anterior inferior-orange, posterior-black. The
specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 10 slices; slice serially sectioned from medial
to lateral in 10 slices; slice 1 the most medial, slice 10 the most lateral. The nipple is located in slice 5
and 6. The cut surface reveals a gray-white ﬁrm well circumscribed mass measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x1 cm,
located in slice 5 and 6 and measuring 0.7 cm. from the closest deep margin. The mass is retroareolar
measuring 2 cm. deep from the nipple. A second satellite nodule is identified in slice 8 measuring 1 x
0.9 X 0.8 cm, 0.4 cm. from the deep margin and 5.5 cm. from nodule #1. A third possible satellite
nodule is grossly identified in slice 7 measuring 0.4 cm. in greatest dimension, greater than 0.1 cm. from
the deep margin and 2.0 cm. from nodule #2 and 4 cm. from nodule #1. Nodule 2 and 3 are both
located in the lower outer quadrant. Remaining cut surfaces reveal predominantly yellow lobulated
adipose tissue inrterdispersed with gray-white ﬁbrous tissue. A portion of the specimen is submitted for
tissue procurement. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

G1: nipple serially sectioned slice 5

GZ: nipple serially sectioned slice 6

G3: upper inner quadrant slice 3

G4: upper inner quadrant with deep margin slice 4

G5: lower inner quadrant slice 3

G7: area immediately adjacent to mass #1

G10: upper central slice 5

G11: lower central slice 5

G12: skin adjacent no nodule #1

G13-G14: nodule #1 with closest deep margin slice 6

G15: area above nodule #1 slice 6

G16: immediately adjacent to nodule #1 with deep margin slice 7

G17: nodule #3 with deep margin slice 7

G18: lower outer quadrant slice 7

G19: area immediately adjacent to nodule #2 with deep margin Slice 7

GZO: upper outer quadrant with deep margin slice 8

621: inferior margin lower outer quadrant adjacent to nodule #2 slice 8

G22: nodule #2 with deep margin slice 8 lower outer quadrant

G23: area immediately adjacent tO nodule #2 with inferior and deep margin slice 9

- TUMOR (LARGEST FOCUS) IS 2.5-MM FROM THE DEEP SURGICAL
RESECTION MARGIN
- LOW NUCLEAR GRADE, DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, MICROPAPILLARY,
CRlBRlFORM AND PAPILLARY TYPES

. - PERINEURAL INVASION IDENTIFIED
- SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT AND SEE NOTE 2.

H. LYMPH NODES, LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS, DISSECTION:

. — SIXTEEN LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/16).

NOTE 1: Mild squamous dysplasia is present at the 12 o'clock-3 O'clock-6 o'clock margin in multiple
levels. Focally, this margin has cautery artifact which precludes the assessment of degree Of dysplasia.

NOTE 2: Three foci of invasive ductal carcinoma are identiﬁed; largest measuring 1.8-Cm is located
centrally. The other two foci measure 1.0-cm and 0.4-cm respectively. All surgical resection margins
are free of tumor. The closest margin is posterior (2.5 mm from the largest tumor mass).
