Microscopic Description and comment: _ ’ ' .
Sections of the uterus show extenSive papillary serous carCinoma, with1invasion

into the myometrium to a de th of 1d mm where the total myometrial wal

thickness is 15 mm. and wit _exten51ve lymphovascular space invasion. In
addition, carcinoma extends into the cautery artifact (that is, within 1 mm) at
the lower uterine.segment and parametrial soft tissue margins of excision.
Sections of the right fallopian tube show involvement of the mucosa by apillary
serous adenocarCinoma. Since the tumor involvement of the fallopian tuge is
continuous With the tumor arising in the uterus, we interpret the findings as
evidence of direct extenSion of papillary serous tumor arising in the

endometrium rather than as a second primary.
sections of the omentum show several foc1 of reactive mesothelial hyperplasig,

but no definitive evidence of metastatic tumor. has reviewe

It contains a white cassette that holds a 1.7 x 1.2 x 8.4 cm rozen section
remnant of.fallopian tube with the serosal surface inked in blue. Also in the
container is a 9.9 gram, 6 cm long fallopian tube with attached ovary. The tube
is dilated to a diameter of 1 cm or a length of approximately 3.5 cm. The
ovary measures 1.8 x 1.x 0.4 cm. There are also two tan—white spherical tissue
fra ments in the container. ‘The larger measures 0.8 cm in diameter and the
sma ler measures 9.5 cm in diameter. In the dilated segment of tube, the lumen
is entirely occupied by a soft papillar¥ mass. The serosal surface of the tube
is inked in blue. The fhmbriated end 0 the tube is easily identified. There
is no grossly apparent tumor in the ovary. Sections are submitted as follows:
A1 - F51; A2 through A5 - sections of di ated fallopian tube containing mass; A6
and A7 - sections of fallopian tube uninvolved by mass; A8 through A11 -
sections of ovar ; A12 ~ sections of spherical tissue fragments. Jar 0.
The second container is labeled "uterus — FSZ/x." It contains a 102.7 gram
uterus Without attached cerVix. The size and appearance of the uterus are

0.2 cm and the myometrial thickness is 1.4 cm. The posterior surface of the
endometrial cavity contains the exophytic polypoid masses described in the
intraoperative consultation. _The distal mar in of the 2 x 2 cm polyp is located
2.1 cm from the distal resection margin of t e speCimen. Sections are submitted
