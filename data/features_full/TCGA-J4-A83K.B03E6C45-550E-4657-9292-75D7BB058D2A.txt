PROSTATE CANCER

Gross Description

A. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"tissue anterior to prostate" are multiple yellow—tan adipose
tissue fragments measuring 3 x 2 cm. The specimen is entirely
submitted in A1—A3.

3. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
“prostate, seminal vesicles and vas deferens" is a radical
prostatectomy specimen which includes a 40 gram prostate gland
with attached seminal vesicle and vas deferens. The prostate
gland measures 4.5 x 4 x 4 cm and has a shaggy capsule that is
disrupted at the bladder resection margin and has been
previously inked black on the left and blue on the right. The
right seminal vesicle measures 3 x 1.5 cm. The right vas
measures 2 x 0.4 cm. The left seminal vesicle measures 2 x 1.5
cm. The left vas measures 2 x 0.4 cm. The inferior prostate
is sectioned transversely, removed from the rest of the specimen
and sectioned from anterior to posterior following the plane of
the urethra. The remaining gland is serially sectioned
transversely and shows a firm, focally nodular parenchyma. The
seminal vesicles and vase deferentia show no abnormalities.
Representative sections submitted as follows: inferior prostate
demonstrating apical margin submitted entirely anterior to
posterior in 31—35 ; bladder resection margin shaved,
perpendicularly sectioned and submitted in 36—37; complete
section of mid gland anterior 38-39; posterior 310-311; complete
section of upper third of gland, anterior 312-313; posterior
314-815; remainder of the posterior gland entirely submitted in
316-822; right seminal vesicle and vas def rens 323; left
