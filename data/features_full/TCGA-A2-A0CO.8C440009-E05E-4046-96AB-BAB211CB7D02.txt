- ll LYMPH NODES ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

- AJCC STAGE

COMMENT:THE AMENDMENT REFLECTS A CHANGE IN NUMBER OF LYMPH NODES FROM NINE
TO ELEVEN.

COMMENT:
AMENDMENT
Case amended to report results of HERZ-neu status by fluorescence in situ

hybridization.
HERZ-NEU: AMPLIFIED (5.0).

Note: The patient’s prior core biopsy, was negative for
HERZ—neu. The tumor in the current case has areas of poorly
differentiated carcinoma (so—called pleomorphic lobular carcinoma) not
identified in the initial core biopsy; these areas are strongly positive
for HERZ-neu gene amplification.

portion of the breast. The remainder of the cut surface is yellow,
lobular, with focal areas of white fibrous tissue and small cystic

. structures measuring up to 0.2 cm. No additional well-defined lesions or
nodules are noted.

Four representative sections are submitted for protocol with mirror
image sections in the following cassettes:

A1: Lymph node 0.7 cm.

A2: Skin from lateral edge of ellipse.

A3: Tumor lateral.

A4: Tumor medial.

A5: Grossly normal fibrous tissue approximately 5.0 cm from tumor.

Additional representative sections are submitted in cassettes A6 through
A20 as follows:

A6—A12: Tumor from medial to lateral in sequential order.
A13: Upper inner quadrant.

A14: Lower inner quadrant.

A15: Lower outer quadrant.

A16: Upper outer quadrant.

A17: Two possible lymph nodes.
A18: Five possible lymph nodes.
