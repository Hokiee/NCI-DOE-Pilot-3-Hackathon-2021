(A) ANTERIOR LYMPH NODE - A piece of ﬁbroadipose tissue (3.0 x 2.0 x 0.6 cm). NO deﬁnitive lymph nodes are identiﬁed within
the adipose tissue. The specimen is entirely submitted for microscopic examination on A1-A3. '

(B) ANTERIOR APEX - A piece of tan-pink soft tissue (0.6 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm) with one edge inked by the surgeon to indicate true
margin. This edge is reinked blue and the specimen is submitted entirely on edge in B for frozen section diagnosis. _

*FS/DX: BENIGN GLANDULAR EPlTHELlUM. NO CARCINOMA OR GLANDS PRESENT AT INKED MARGIN.

(C) LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES - A 6.7 x 4.5 x 1.0 cm aggregate of fibroadipose tissue. The tissue is dissected to reveal twelve
possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm - 6.5 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm.

SECTION CODE: Cl. two possible lymph nodes; CZ, four possible lymph nodes; CS, two possible lymph nodes; C4, one
possible lymph node bisected; C5, one possible lymph node serially sectioned; CS. C7. one possible lymph node serially sectioned;
C8-C11, one possible lymph node sen’ally sectioned.

(D) RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES - A 5.5 x 4.7 x 1.1 cm aggregate Of fibroadipose tissue. The tissue is dissected to reveal four
possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm - 9.4 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm.

DIAGNOSIS

(E) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES (INK AT F.S. MARGIN):
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 7 (4+3) WITH TERTIARY GLEASON GRADE 5
COMPONENT. (SEE COMMENT)
TUMOR INVADING LEFT SEMINAL VESICLE.
TUMOR EXTENDING FOCALLY INTO EXTRAPROSTATIC TISSUE.
MARGINS OF RESECTION FREE OF TUMOR.
VASCULAR/LYMPHATIC INVASION PRESENT.
PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH-GRADE.
Right seminal vesicle and segments of vasa deferentia, no tumor present.
SEE PREVIOUS REPORT FOR DIAGNOSIS OF PELVIC LYMPH NODES.

COMMENT

The prostate gland contains three separate foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, one on the transition zone and two in the peripheral
zone. The dominant tumor focus although not the one of the highest histologic grade (Gleason score 7/3+4) is located in the left
transition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.0 x 1.0 cm in the largest crossvsectional dimension, and it is present in one cross
section and extensively in the apex and base regions. This tumor focus invades the left seminal vesicle including intra and
extraprostatic portions. Focal extraprostatic extension is present in the left superior neurovascular bundle region. The extent of
extraprostatic tumor is less than 1.0 mm. The extraprostatic tumor is present in a perineural location. The second tumor focus
and the one of the highest histologic grade (7l4+3 with tertiary Gleason grade 5) is located in the left lateral, left posterolateral. left
posterior, mid posterior and right posterior peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 1.7 x 1.2 cm in the largest cross-sectional
dimension, and it is present in the single cross section of the prostate and extensively in the apex and base regions. The third
tumor focus is located in the right lateral peripheral zone, exclusively in the apical region. This tumor focus measures 1.0 x 0.2 cm

in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in two apical sections. Tumor foci #1 and 2 are confined to the prostate.
The margins of resection are free of tumor.

Please refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(E) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES (INK AT F.S. MARGIN) - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left
seminal vesicles and attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

Spec1men Date Tlme:

The prostate gland (3.5 x 2.7 x 3.7 cm, 35 grams, post-ﬁxation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present on the left
posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears slightly more abundant than along the right side. A nodule ls palpated on the left
base of the prostate. Serial cross sections after ﬁxation do not demonstrate carcinoma.

The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

SECTION CODE: E1-E3, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; E4-E6,
left seminal vesicle and segment Of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; E7, prostatic base right border; E8, E9.
prostatic base right posterior border; E13. prostatic base left border; E14—E16, prostatic base left posterior border; E17-E22, apex
anterior; E23, E24, apex left; E25-E28, apex posterior; E29-E32, apex right; E33, detached portions of margin of resection
according to specimen radiograph; E34—E37, sections of the single cross section Of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.

The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in
black. Blue ink (E18—E24)and orange ink denote surfaces on the anterior apical region (reinked) and anterior surface of the
prostate which do not represent the true margin of resection.
