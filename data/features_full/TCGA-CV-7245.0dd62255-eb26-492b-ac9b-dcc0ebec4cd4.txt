GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LARYNGOPHARYNGECTOMY, BlLATERAL NECK DISSECTION, CHECK MUCOSAL MARGIN ON THE PHARYNX
AND TRACHEA - A total laryngectomy specimen, including larynx (12.0 x 6.0 x 5.0 cm) and bilateral attached neck
dissections (12.0 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm). There is a pink-tan, exophytic tumor (5.5 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm) involving the left false vocal cords
that extends superiorly to involve the left aryepiglottic fold, the left pyrifonn sinus, and left epiglottis. The true vocal cords are
uninvolved. Posteriorly, the tumor appears to extend submucosally to the overlying hypopharyngeal mucosa. The tumor
measures 2.0 cm from the closest left inferior posterior pharyngeal mucosal margin and 6.0 cm from the laryngeal margin.
There is a tracheostomy site identiﬁed that is surrounded by a rim of tan-brown, partially wrinkled skin (6.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm) that
is grossly uninvolved by tumor. The uninvolved laryngeal mucosa appears grossly unremarkable. A portion of possible
thyroid tissue along the left neck is present (2.2 x 2.0 x 0.4 cm). Sections of tumor and normal laryngeal mucosa are taken for
tissue bank, and the specimen is submitted to the bone lab.

SECTION CODE: A1, right posterior inferior pharyngeal mucosal margin, en face; A2, left posterior inferior
pharyngeal mucosal margin, en face; A3, left lateral pharyngeal mucosal margin, en face; A4, right lateral pharyngeal mucosal
margin, en face; A5, tracheal margin en face; A6, A7, representative sections of tumor; A8, tumor relative to left aryepiglottic
fold; A9, tumor relative to left epiglottis; A10, tumor relative to overlying left pharyngeal mucosa; A11, uninvolved laryngeal
mucosa; A12, superior tracheostomy skin, en face; A13, possible thyroid tissue; A14, A15, each ﬁve possible paratracheal
lymph nodes; A16, four possible paratracheal lymph nodes; A17, seven possible left level II lymph nodes; A18—A22, each one
bisected possible left level II lymph nodes; A23, six possible left level III lymph nodes; A24, one bisected possible left level III
| e; A25, ﬁve possible left level IV lymph nodes; A26-A28, each one bisected possible left level IV lymph nodes.

9-A31, level II lymph nodes, A29, one serially sectioned lymph node; A30, four possible lymph nodes; A31, five
possible lymph nodes; A32-A34, level III lymph nodes, A32, one serially sectioned lymph node; A33, one bisected lymph
node; A34, four possible lymph nodes; A35, level IV lymph node, one serially sectioned lymph node; A36, level IV lymph

node, three possible lymph nodes; A37-A38, tumor in relation to the th ' rtilage left side; A39, tumor in relation to the
thyroid cartilage right side, will be submitt ecal.
*FS/DX: NO TUMOR PRESENT.
