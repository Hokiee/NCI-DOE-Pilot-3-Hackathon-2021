SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
Case Number :

Diagnosis:

Adrenal gland, left, laparoscopic adrenalectomy

— Adrenal cortical adenoma, 3.0 cm diameter, without
extracapsular extension, surgical margins not involved.

— Pheochromocytoma, 5.0 cm diameter, without extracapsular
extension, surgical margins not involved.

Clinical History:
-year—old female with left adrenal mass.

Gross Description:
Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally
labeled "left adrenal mass" and holds a disrupted adrenal gland
(6.0 x 1.4 x 0.2 cm) with two masses identified arising from
opposite ends of the adrenal gland. The first mass (mass #1: 3.0
x 3.0 x 2.0 cm) is well—circumscribed with a soft, orange/yellow
chalky cut surface. No areas of hemorrhage or necrosis are
grossly appreciated. The mass appears to expand and compress the
adjacent adrenal cortex and grossly abuts the blue inked
external surface. The second mass (mass #2: 5.0 x 5.0 x 4.0 cm)
is a poorly circumscribed homogeneous mass with a partially
solid partially cystic (0.7 to 1.5 cm cyst diameter) cut
surface. The majority of the mass is dusky red and hemorrhagic
with occasional firmer white randomly dispersed patches. No
definitive areas of necrosis are identified. The mass appears to
arise from the adrenal medulla and is compressing adjacent
adrenal parenchyma. Mass #2 grossly abuts the blue—inked
external margin. Representative sections are submitted per block
summary.

/

Sections of the 3 cm cortical nodule show bland cytology
reminiscent of zona fasciculata. No extracapsular extension is
noted.

The 5cm central nodule is cytologically similar to adrenal
medulla. Tmmunostains to clarify lineage were performed, and
show reactivity for synaptophysin and chromogranin, with
peripheral cortical reactivity for inhibin. This immunophenotype

supports a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. No extracapsular
extension is noted.
