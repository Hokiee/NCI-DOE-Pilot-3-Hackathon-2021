CLINICAL INFORMATION: None.
GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in two parts.

Part A is received unfixed in a container labeled with the patient‘s name and "sentinel node #1". It consists of one piece

of well circumscribed gritty ta‘n tissue with attached fat measuring 1.2x1.0x0.6cm. It is bisected and a portion of it is
submitted as AFS. The rest is submitted in one cassette labeled A1.

Part B is received unfixed in a container labeled with the patient‘s name and “left breast mastectomy tissue" consists of
a left radical modified mastectomy specimen measuring 21x17x3 cm. The skin measures 9.5x5x0.1 cm and has a
circumareolar scar which measures 4 cm in length. The nipple is mobile and everted. A firm area is palpable
underneath the scar. The deep (fascial) margin is inked black, the remaining margins are inked yellow. The axillary
tissue measures 9x5x1.2 cm. Several lymph nodes are palpable within it. One lymph node has been previously
bisected by the surgeon. The lymph nodes range in size from 2.5 to 0.5 cm. They are dissected, proceeding from the
axilla towards the breast.The specimen is serially sectioned at closely spaced intervals. Beneath the previously
described scar is an ill—deﬁned white firm area which measures approximately 3.8x3. 1x3 cm; it abuts the skin and is 3
cm from the deep margin. A second ill-deﬁned white, firm area is present In the outer, lower quadrant approximately 1
cm from the central lesion; it measures approximately 2. 5x2. 3x1. 8 cm and Is located 0. 5 cm from the deep margin and
1 cm from the superficial margin At its center Is a 1 cm firm area with a gelatinous appearance. The rest of the
specimen is composed of 40% breast tissue, and 60% yellow fatty tissue. Representative sections are submitted in 40

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
I. TYPE OF SPECIMEN: Left modified radical mastectomy
II. LOCATION OF THE TUMOR: Lower outer quadrant
II. LOCATION OF THE TUMOR: Central
Ill. TYPE OF NEOPLASM: Carcinoma, invasive lobular - pleomorphic, nuclear grade 3
Lobular neoplasia, type B (pleomorphic) widespread
IV. GROSS/MICRO FINAL INVASIVE TUMOR SIZE INTERPRETATION: 1.2 cm in greatest dimension, at least
V. BORDERS OF INVASIVE NEOPLASM: Ill-defined
VI. VASCULAR SPACE INVASION: Present in lymphatics
VII. CALCIFICATION: Present in benign areas
VIII. NIPPLE: Stroma involved by cancer
Lymphatics involved by cancer
Ducts involved by cancer

IX. SKIN: Uninvolved by cancer

X. ADJACENT BREAST TISSUE: Cystic disease, proliferative with atypia

 

 

" XI. ' SURGICAL MARGIN: No carcinoma is Identified on surgical margins
XII. AXILLARY LYMPH NODES: TOTAL: 13
LEVEL I: 4
LEVELII: 2
LEVEL III: 6

SENTINEL MODE: 1
XIII. POSITIVE LYMPH NODES: TOTAL: 4 Of 13

LEVEL I: 2 of 4
LEVEL II: 1~of 2
LEVEL IIIIO of 6

SENTINEL'NODE: 1of1
DEGREE OF INVOLVEMENT: Extensive replacement
EXTRANODAL EXTENSION: Absent
XIV. PECTORAL MUSCLE: No pectoral muscle identified

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Invasive carcinoma appears to arise multifocally. A definite second focus is identified in

the lower outer quadrant (826). Below the nipple, the fibrous scar tissue contains multiple separate foci of invasive
lobular carcinoma. Extensive lymphatic permeation is noted.

Receptor Expression Analysis Date Ordered: Status: Signed Out

INTERPRETATION
Test Performed on: Left breast

Specimen part: B
Slide#: 826

Results:

More than 50% of the invasive carcinoma cell nuclei stain with an immunohistochemical stain utilizing an anti-estrogen
receptor antibody.

Therefore, this tumor is considered strongly positive for estrogen receptor expression.

More than 50% of the Invasive carcinoma cell nuclei stain with an immunohistochemical stain utilizing an
anti-progesterone receptor antibody.

Therefore, this tumor is considered strongly positive for progesterone receptor expression.

Her-2/neu expression has been evaluated using the HercepTest. HercepTest score : 0.
No Her-Zlneu overexpression is identified in the invasive carcinoma cells.
