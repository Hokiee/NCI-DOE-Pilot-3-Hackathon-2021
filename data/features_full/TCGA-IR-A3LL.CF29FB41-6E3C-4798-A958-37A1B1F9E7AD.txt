DIAGNOSIS'
1. UTERUS, CERVIX, BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES, RADICAL HYSTERECTOMY:

- INVASIVE SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED
- THE TUMOR MEASURES 3.7 X 3.4 X 3.2 CM AND INVADES THE CERVICAL STROMA TO A
DEPTH OF 19 MN IN AN AREA THAT MEASURES 20 ml IN DIIENSION
- TUMOR IS PRESENT WITHIN 1.0 MM OF THE ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR SOFT TISSUE
MARGINS
- CIN III IS IDENTIFIED
- FOCI SUSPICIOUS FOR LIMPHOVASCULAR INVASION ARE IDENTIFIED
-THE PARAMETRIA ARE NOT INVOLVED
—PERINEURAL INVASION IS NOT IDENTIFIED
-UTERINE CORPUS EXTENSION IS NOT IDENTIFIED
- VAIN III IS PRESENT AT THE ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR VAGINAL RESECTION
MARGINS
-ALL MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR INVASIVE CARCINOMA
— WEAKLY PROLIFERATIVE ENDOMETRIUH AND UNREMARKAELE MYOMETRIUM
- BILATERAL OVARIES WITH STROMAL HYPERPLASIA
- BENIGN BILATERAL FALLOPIAN TUBES
- EIGHT PARAMETRIAL LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/3)

NOTE: REPRESENTATIVE SECTIONS WERE REVIEWED AT GYNECOLOGIC PATHOLOGY
CONSENSUS CONFERENCE TO DETERMINE THE STATUS OF THE LEFT PARAMETRIUM. TEE
CONSENSUS WAS THAT THIS STRUCTURE IS NOT INVOLVED BY CARCINOMA.

2. LYMPH NODE, RIGHT PEI-VIC; EXCISION:
- ONE BENIGN LYMPH NODE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/1)
