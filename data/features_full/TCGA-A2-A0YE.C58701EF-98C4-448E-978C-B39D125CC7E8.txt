profile will be performed and reported separateiy.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION
The specimen is received In seven separate containers Iabeier‘ slgnated A

through E.

A The container Is received fresh unfixed labeled "right sentinei lymph node #1 for frozen section"
and consists of an ovoid mass of apparent fatty material measuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.6 cm. Sectioning
reveals a 0.5 cm. pink-tan firm nodule. Touch prep and frozen section are obtained by Dr.

The entire specimen including frozen section Is submitted In two blocks.

B. The container is received fresh unﬁxed iabeied "right sentinel lymph node #2 for frozen section“
and consists of an irregular mass of apparent fat which is 1 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm in greatest overall
dimension. Sectioning reveals a 0.8 cm. purple-tan firm noduie. Touch prep and frozen section
are Obtained by Dr. . The entire specimen Including frozen section ls submitted In two

blocks.

0. The container Is received fresh unfixed iabeied “right sentinel iymph node #3 for frozen section"
and consists of an Irregular mass of apparent fat which Is 1 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm. In greatest overall
dimension. Sectioning reveals a pink-fan nodule 0.5 cm. in greatest dimension. Touch prep and
frozen section are obtained by Dr. . The entire specimen including frozen section is
submitted in two blocks.

D. The container Is received fresh unfixed labeled “right sentinel iymph node #4 for frozen section"
and consists of an Irregular mass of apparent fat which is 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The specimen ls
deferred for permanent. The entire specimen Is submitted in one block.

E. The container is received fresh unflxed labeled "right axillary contents“ and consists of an
Irregular mass of fat which Is 4.5 x 4 x 3 cm. in greatest overall dimension. Sectioning reveals
purple~tan nodules varying up to 2 cm. In greatest dimension. The specimen Is submitted in four

blocks.

F. The container is received fresh unfixed labeled "right breast lump" and consists of a 57 gm. ovoid
mass of apparent fatty and fibrous-encased tissue measuring 6.5 x 5 x 5 cm. In greatest overail
dimension. Sectioning reveals a tumor mass which is 6 x 5 x 5 cm. In greatest overall dimension.
There are two short sutures Indicating superior margin inked with red dye, inferior is inked yellow.
There Is a single short suture Indicating anterior margin inked with orange dye, deep Is inked with
black. There Is a single long suture indicating lateral margin inked with blue dye. medIaI Is inked
green. Gross margins are observed by Dr. The tumor mass grossly appears to be 0.6
away from the superior. 1 cm. away from the inferior. 1.5 cm. away from the anterior, 1 cm. away
from the deep and grossly appears to Involved the lateral or less than 0.1 cm. from the lateral; is
approximately 0.4 cm. away from the medial. The specimen Is submitted in ten blocks.

Key Note Block Summary. 1--superior. 2—Inferior. 3—anterior. 4—deep. 5——Iateral. S—
medial, 7 through 10—random.

G The container ls received fresh unfixed Iabeied “additional iaterai margin" and consists of a 7 gm.
irregular mass of apparent fatty tissue which Is 3 x 2.5 x 2 cm. in greatest overall dimension.
There Is an attached suture indicating new iaterai margin inked with black dye. Serial sectioning
reveals apparent fatty tissue. The entire specimen is submitted as six blocks.
