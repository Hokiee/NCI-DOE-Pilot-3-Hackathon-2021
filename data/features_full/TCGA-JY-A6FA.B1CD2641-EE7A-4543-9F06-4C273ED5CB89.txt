Diagnosis

1. Gastro-esophageal resection: Moderately differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma, distal esophagus.
PT2N1 be. 4 of 19 iymph nodes show metastatic deposits (4/19). The tumor invades the entire thickness of the
muscularis propria. The proximal and distal margins are clear of tumour. The circumferential margin is not involved but

close to tumor (1 mm). See synoptic report.
2. Stomach, tip: Negative for malignancy.

3. Esophagus, free and ﬁnal margin: Focal atypia of squamous mucosa in keeping with high—grade dysplasia.
Negative for malignancy. TC‘D'O «3

DIMENSIONS OF STOMACH IF PRESENT:
Length along lesser curvature 7cm

Length along greater curvature 9cm
Circumference of distal/gastric margin 18 cm

TUMOR:

- LOCATION: WITHIN GE JUNCTION
- CONFIGURATION: highly ulcerative
- DIMENSIONS: DIAMETERS 8.3 CM X 5.7 CM
DEPTH 1.8 CM
- DESCRIPTIVE CHARACTERISTICS: Solid and tan-white on cut surface

— DISTANCE FROM MARGINS:

PROXIMAL 2.5 cm

DISTAL 4.0 cm

RADIAL 0.05 cm (soft tissue margin closest to deepest tumor penetration)
- ESTIMATED DEPTH OF INVASION: adventitia

LESIONS IN NONCANCEROUS ESOPHAGUS: Non-identified
lesions in the noncancerous stomach: Non identified

LYMPH NODES: Multiple mediastinal and perigastric lymph nodes are retrieved ranging in size from 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm to
3.8 x 1.6 x 0.7 cm.

Tumor and normal mucosa samples bank: Yes

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

1A en face section of eSOphageai resection margin. frozen section resubmitted

13 en face section of gastric resection margin closest to tumor, frozen section resubmitted

1C-1 G one full thickness longitudinal strip from the esophageal resection margin to gastric mucosa distal to the tumor,
sequentially from proximal to distal (includes tumor at deepest invasion).

1H grossly normal gastric mucosa

1i—1K multiple paraesophageal lymph nodes each

11.. 1M one paraesophageai lymph node quadrasected

1N, 10 multiple perigastn‘c lymph nodes each

1P-1T each one perigastric lymph node bisected

1U one perigastric lymph node trisected

2. The specimen container labeled with the patient’s name and as “tip of stomach" contains a small segment of closed
Stapled bowal received in 10% buffered formalin. It measures 5.5 x 3.3 x 3 cm. there is very minimal perigastn'c fat
attached. The serosal surface is smooth and partly congested. On opening, one third of the mucosa is slightly
congested. The rest of the mucosa is grossly norrnai with prominent rugae. No lymph nodes identiﬁed within the fat.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

2A resection margin, margin painted with India ink

23 two sections from the congested area.

3. The specimen container labeled with the patients name and as “ﬁnal esophageal margin free and ﬁnal margin”
contains a short segment of esophagus received in 10% buffered formalin. It measures 2 cm long and 5 cm in
circumference. One end has a staple line and the other end is opened. Both the serosal and mucosal surfaces are
grossly unremarkable.

3A the open end margin is submitted in toto en face.

Quick Section Diagnosis

1. Distal esophagus and proximal stomach (for resection margins on both ends):
QSIA‘ proximal (esophageal) resection margin, EIT en face: negative for malignancy
QS1B: distal (gastric) margin, representative en face section from part of margin closest to tumor: negative

for malignancy.
