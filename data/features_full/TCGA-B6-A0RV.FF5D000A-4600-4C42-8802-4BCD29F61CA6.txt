CLINICAL HISTORY:
year old woman with a large right breast cancer.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Large’righﬁ breast cancer". Received fresh is right modified radical
mastectomy, 630 grams, and 25 x 16.5 x 3.6 cm. The overlying skin ellipse
measures 15.3 x 10.6 cm. The areolar is 6.8 cm in diameter, and the nipple,
1.5 cm. Serial sectioning reveals extensive involvement of the breast tissue
by a large, white/light yellow tumor 12 x 9.5 x 4 cm, which grows in an
infiltrative fashion and demonstrates focal calcification. It is located
approximately 0.5 cm from the closest superior margin, 1.5 cm from the
inferior margin, 0.1 cm from the deepest margin, 1.5 cm from the medial
margin, and 3 cm from the axillary appendage. Focal hemorrhage is present in
the subcutaneous portion of the breast. Dissection through the axillary
appendage demonstrates multiple enlarged lymph nodes up to 2.4 cm in size. A
portion of the fresh tumor tissue is submitted for ER/PR studies and for
tissue bank. The representative sections of the specimen are submitted.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

A1—A2— tumor and the closest deep margin.
A3- upper inner quadrant.

A4- upper outer quadrant.

A5- lower inner quadrant.

A6— lower outer quadrant.

A7- skin and underlying hemorrhage.
