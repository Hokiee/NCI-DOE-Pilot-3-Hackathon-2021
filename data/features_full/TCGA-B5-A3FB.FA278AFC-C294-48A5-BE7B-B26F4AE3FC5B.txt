A. "Left tube and ovary, uterus, cervix", received fresh for frozen section is
a 223 gram, 7.4 x 5.7 x 4.8 cm uterus with attached adnexa. Opening the
uterus reveals a 3.1 x 2.1 cm fungating, firm, friable tumor of the posterior
endometrium. Sectioning through the tumor reveals a tumor depth of 1.1 cm.
The remainder of the uterus is distorted with multiple subserosal, submucosal,
and intramural nodules that are firm, well encapsulated, and have a whorled,
tan—white cut surface. The largest of the these is 3.6 cm in greatest
diameter and has focal calcifications.

CLINICAL HISTORY: m
Malignant neoplasm corpus uteri. I

The endometrial cavity is 4.1 x 3.6 cm with an uninvolved endometrial
thickness of 0.1 cm. The myometrium is 2.4 cm thick. The endocervical canal
is 1.6 cm long and the squamocolumnar junction is distinct. The diameter of
the cervix is 4.8 cm and the 05 is 0.4 cm.

5.

The left adnexa consists of a 2.3 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm firm, tan—white, cerebriform
ovary with attached grossly unremarkable mesentery and fat. The attached
fimbriated fallopian tube is 4.6 cm and ranges in diameter from 0.6 to 0.9
cm. There is a 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm smooth paratubal cyst filled with a clear
serous fluid.

The right adnexa consists of a 2.2 cm long and 0.9 cm in diameter segment of
fallopian tube. No fimbria and no ovary are identified. Sectioning reveals
grossly unremarkable parenchyma.

A representative section of the endometrial tumor was previously frozen as AFl
and the frozen section remnant is submitted in block A1. A representative

section of para—ovarian tissue was previously frozen as AF2 and the frozen ta
remnant is submitted in block A2. ‘2

B. "Left pelvic node", received in formalin is a 6.5 x 5.2 x 2.4 cm aggregate
of firm, tan lymph nodes with attached fat. Approximately twenty three lymph
nodes are found and the largest is 2.6 cm in greatest dimension.

BLOCK SUMMARY:
Bl~2— six lymph node candidates in each cassette

B3~ three lymph node candidates
B4—7— one bisected lymph node candidate in each cassette

B8-9— two bisected lymph node candidates differentially inked black and blue
in each cassette

C. ”Right pelvic node", received in formalin is a 7 x 5.8 x 3.3 cm aggregate
of tan—pink, firm lymph node candidates with attached fat. Twelve lymph node
candidates are found and the largest is 2.3 cm in greatest dimension.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Cl—2— one bisected lymph node candidate in each cassette
C3—4— two lymph node candidates in each cassette

C5-6~ three lymph node candidates in each cassette

C7- two lymph node candidates

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
A. "Left tube and ovary, uterus, cervix":AFl—endometrial tumor-endometrial
adenocarcinoma, FIGO grade 2.

Superficial invasion at most. No
involvement of lower uterine segment.

AFZ—iaraovarian tissue— ovary

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: Hysterectomy and left salpingo—oophorectomy

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 6th Edition): ple pNO pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. "LEFT TUBE AND OVARY, UTERUS, CERVIX" (HYSTERECTOMY AND
LEFT SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY):

UTERUS: 233 GRAMS
ENDOMETRIUM:
TUMOR SITE: CORPUS
HISTOLOGIC TYPE: ENDOMETRIOID ADENOCARCINOMA.
FIGO GRADE: 3, SEE COMMENT.
TUMOR SIZE: 3.1 X 2.1 X 1.1 CM.
MAXIMUM DEPTH OF MYOMETRIAL INVASION: 0.1 CM, IN A 2.4 CM THICK WALL.
LYMPHATIC/VASCULAR INVASION: NEGATIVE
ADJACENT NON-NEOPLASTIC ENDOMETRIUM: ATROPHIC
REMAINING MYOMETRIUM: BENIGN LEIOMYOMATA (3.6 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION).
ADENOMYOSIS.
CERVIX: NO PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS.
SEROSA: FREE OF TUMOR.
SPECIMEN MARGINS: NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

LEFT OVARY: BENIGN FIBROMA, 2.4 CM, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
FALLOPIAN TUBES: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.

COMMENT: The grading of this endometrioid adenocarcinoma is somewhat
difficult. By gland/solid percentage area, this is a grade 2 tumor, but there

are areas of very poorly—differentiated growth with marked nuclear atypia,
making this a grade 3 carcinoma.

B. "LEFT PELVIC NODE" (LYMPH NODE DISSECTION):

TWENTY—ONE LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (0/21).

C. "RIGHT PELVIC NODE" (LYMPH NODE DISSECTION):
TWELVE LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (0/12).
