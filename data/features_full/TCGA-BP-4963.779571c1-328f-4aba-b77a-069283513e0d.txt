Gross Descrigtion:

i). The specimen is received fresh labeled "left kidney and adrenal" and consists of a kidney with attached ureter, renal vessels
and perinephric tat weighing 349 g in total. The kidney measures 12.0 x 5.6 x 3,? cm. The attached ureter measures 4.0 cm in
length and 0.3 cm in diameter. The attached renal vein measures 0.6 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter. The renal vessels and
ureter margins are grossly unremarkable. An adrenal gland is identiﬁed, measuring 6.5 x 1.6 x 0.4 cm. The kidney is inked black
and bivelved to reveal a well—circumscribed yellow variegated mass with central scar abutting the capsule located in the superior
pole measuring 6.5 x 5.9 x 4.0 cm. The lesion extend lnferlorly to compress the renal pelvis. and does not appear to involve the
sinus fat. . Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a pink brown parenchyma, with a well-defined cortico-medullary
junction. the cortex measures 1.0 cm and the calyces appear normal. No lymph nodes are identiﬁed in the perinephrlo fat. The
specimen is photographed. Representative sections are submitted for TPS and for permanent sectlons.
