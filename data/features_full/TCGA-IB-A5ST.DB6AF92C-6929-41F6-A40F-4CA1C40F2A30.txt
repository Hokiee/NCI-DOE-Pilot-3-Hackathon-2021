Gross Description

Received are specimen containers A to C. All reouisitions and specimen containers are
labelled with the patient's name, The cassettes and AP
identifiers are labelled with the Surgical uuuwer '“

A. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The
container is designated " Gallbladder" and consists of an unopened gallbladder, measuring
11.0 cm in length x 5.0 x 3.5 cm. The outer peritoneal surface is smooth and
unremarkable. The lumen contains green mucoid bile as well as an oval, slightly lobulated
gallstone, measuring 2.7 x 1.6 x 1.5 cm. On fracturing the stone has a typical
crystalline appearance of a cholesterol stone. The mucosa shows a focal sessile polypoid

area, 0.4 cm in greatest dimension, but is otherwise velvety and smooth and the
gallbladder wall has a thickness of 0.2 cm.A small cystic duct lymph node, 0.7 cm in

greatest dimension is present adjacent to the cystic duct resection margin. Sections are
taken as follows:

Al. resection margin with cystic duct lymph node as well as section from fundus

A2. sections or body with small polypoid protrusions

B. Specimen is received in formalin. The container is designated as " 8A node" and
consists of a old fragment of firm, grey tan tissue, measuring 2.0 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm.
Bisected and submitted in toto in one cassette.

C. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The
container is designated as " Whipple specimen". This consists of a
pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen. the segment of distal stomach and small bowel,
measuring 17.0 cm in length. The head of pancreas measures approximately 5.0 x 4.5 x 3.5
cm. The neck of the pancreas is painted blue, the uncinate process margin is painted
orange. The mucosa of the duodenum is unremarkable with no tumor. The ampulla of Vater is
unremarkable. The common bile duct is opened in the fresh state revealing a branching at
the superior edge of the pancreas where the cystic duct joins the common hepatic duct.
The common bile duct, measures 3.5 cm in length. The attached portion of cystic duct,
measures 2.7 cm and the attached portion of common hepatic duct, measures approximately
1.0 cm. The mucosal surface of the ducts are unremarkable. A coronal section into the
head of pancreas reveals a firm tumorish mass occupying much of the head of pancreas,
with dimensions of 3.2 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. The tumor appears to approach close to the
inferior and uncinate margins, but small portion of pancreatic tissue superior to the
tumor and extending to the pancreatic neck resection margin has a fibrous consistency.
The section of sott tissue around the head of pancreas reveals scatter lymph nodes.
Sections are taken as follows:

Cl. proximal resection margin common bile duct

C2. proximal resection margin cystic duct

C3. pancreatic neck resection margin, en face

C4~6. sections of ampulla of Vater with underlying tumor

C7~lD. tumor including uncinate margin and posterior soft tissue margin
Cll. possible lymph nodes in a fatty tissue operative curvature
C12v14. three possible large lymph nodes along superior aspect of head of pancreas
C15. three lymph nodes in gastroduodenal region

C16. proximal resection margin/antral mucosa

C17. gastroduodenal junction

C18/19. distal resection margin duodenum

Microscopic Description

A. Sections show mild acute and chronic inflammation involvrng the gallbladder with
focal polypoid protrusions in the mucosa bed without any evidence of dysplasia or
malignancy. The cystic duct lymph node shows slight granulomatosis and is negative for
malignancy.

B. Sections show lymph node tissue with lipogranulomatosis. There is no evidence of
malignancy.

C. There is an invasive well to moderately differentiated adenocarcihoma involvrng much
of the head of the pancreas. The carcinoma invades through the muscularis propria in the
vicinity of the common bile duct, but does not reach the duodenal mucosa. The common
bile duct mucosa is partly effaced by the invasive carcinoma. The tumor shows prominent
perineural invasion and extends into peripancreatic adipose tissue. The tumor lies close
to the uncinate resection marqin, but there is a narrow rim of fatty tissue with a clear
margin of approximately 0.2 cm. The posterior retroperitoneal margin is clear as well.
The pancreatic neck margin shows prominent fibrosis with loss of pancreatic tissue or

chronic pancreatitis, possibly related to the development of carcinoma. No
calcifications are present. The section from the proximal bile duct and cystic duct

margins Show mild inflammation and reactive changes, but no sign oﬁ dysplasia or
malignancy.

The carcinoma invades directly into two peripancreatic lymph nodes regarded as positive
for nodal involvement, although distant lymph nodes do not show tumor.
