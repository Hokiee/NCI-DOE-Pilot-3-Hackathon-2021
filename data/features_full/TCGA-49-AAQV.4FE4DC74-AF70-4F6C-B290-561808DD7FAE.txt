Consultant‘s Findings:

A c.2235ﬂ2249de1 (p.E7464A750del) mutation was
detected in Exon 19 of the EGFR gene. This mutation is
reported to correlate with RESPONSIVENESS to EGFR

tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non—small—
cell lung cancer.

growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be
associated with differential responsiveness/resistance to

targeted therapeutics for non—small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC).

Most data published pertain to Gefitinib . Similar
data have been seen in studies using Erlotinib

This test is validated for non?small cell lung carcinoma.
The clinical significance and utility of this test in other
tumor types is unknown.

Method: This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR
tyrosine kinase domain. Based on current literature, the vast
majority of mutations are expected to occur in these axons.
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant
tumor is selected for analysis. DNA is extracted from the
tissue and subject to PCR amplification using primers to
exons 18—21 of the EGFR gene. The amplification products
are analyzed by bi—directional direct DNA ’ ,
sequencing using capillary gel electrophoresis and
fluorescence detection. The analytical sensitivity of the
assay is 20% mutant alleles, or 40% tumor cells with a
heterozygous mutation; mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

PART #1: L 8 LYMPH NODE
Resident Pathologist:

Dictated by:

The specimen for Part 1 is received in formalin, labeled with the
patient's name,_and designated 'L~8 Lymph Node.‘ The
specimen consists of one (1) piece of red—tan—gray soft tissue
measuring 1 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is submitted in its entirety.

PART #2: LEFT LOWER LOBE
Resident Pathologist:

Dictated by:

The specimen for Part 2 is received in formalin, labeled with the
patient's name, _ and designated 'Left Lower Lobe. ' The
specimen consists of a 15.0 x 15.0 x 2.5 cm grossly recognizable lung
lobe weighing 167.5 gm. The pleural surface is red~purple, wrinkled
and glistening. A surgical incision is present over a grossly
apparent mass which measures 2.3 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. The pleural surface
overlying this mass appears puckered. The pleural surface overlying
the tumor mass is inked black. This tumor is located in the superior
aspect of the lobe, approximately 1.8 cm from the bronchial margin.
Three (3) staple lines are present on the lung measuring 6 cm, 4 cm
and 2 cm. The first two (2) staple lines are removed to reveal
underlying grossly unremarkable lung parenchyma which is inked
orange. The third staple line contains vessels which are sectioned
and submitted. A shave section of the bronchial margin is also taken.
No grossly identifiable hilar lymph nodes are present. The tumor
nodule is thoroughly serially sectioned to reveal that it abuts the
pleura and is 0.4 cm from the surgical resection margin. The tumor
mass appears to surround large vessels in the lung parenchyma.
Representative sections of tumor relative to pleura, vessels, and
surgical resection margin are submitted. Serially sectioning through
the remaining lung tissue identified two (2) subpleural nodules which
were suspicious for tumor involvement. Representative sections are
submitted. No other masses or lesions are identified within the lung.
The uninvolved lung parenchyma appears tan—red and grossly

unremarkable. Representative sections of the uninvolved lung are
submitted.
