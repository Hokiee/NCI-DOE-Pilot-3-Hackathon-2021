Gross Description:

A. Received without fixative labeled ”stomach margin"

are two irregular partial gastric wall excisions, 4.7 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm and 9.5 x

3.0 x 2.5 cm. There is minimal adherent fat. Multiple staple lines are present.
The mucosa is tan with the normal folds. A representative section is submitted
for frozen section microscopy, now in cassette A1. Additional representative
sections are submitted in cassette A2.

B. Received in formalin, labeled "left pancreas and

spleen" is a 4.9 x 3.3 x 1.8 cm distal pancreas with attached 136 gram. 9.5 x

8.0 x 4.3 cm spleen and a moderate amount of attached fat. Located 2.9 cm from
the resection margin is a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm smooth walled, uniloculated
pancreatic cyst, which comes to within 0.2 cm from the inked external surface.
This cyst appears to involve a side branch of the main pancreatic duct. The
remaining pancreas is tan and lobulated. No discrete solid lesions are

identified. The pancreatic duct appears probe patent, averaging less than 0.1
cm.

The capsule of the spleen is purple-pink, smooth, glistening and intact.

Sectioning reveals a red-pink, soft, homogeneous parenchyma with prominent white
pulp. No discrete lesions are present. Multiple tan-pink, rubbery lymph nodes

are identified in the attached fat, up to 0.5 cm.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

B1 cyst in its entirety to include inked external surface;

B2-6 pancreas submitted sequentially from proximal to distal (not
entirely submitted);

B7 spleen;

B8-9 multiple whole possible lymph nodes.

C. Received without fixative labeled “body of
pancreas margin" is a 2.3 x 1.8 x 0.2 cm tan, irregular soft tissue, submitted
in toto for frozen section microscopy, now in cassette C.

D. Received without fixative labeled "esophageal

margin" is a 4.5 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm irregular soft tissue, partially surfaced by a
tan, wrinkled mucosa. A representative section is submitted for frozen section
microscopy, now in cassette Di. ,

Representative sections of the remaining tissue are submitted in cassette DZ.

E. Received in formalin, labeled "esophagus" is a 5.5

cm segment of distal esophagus with attached up to 5 cm of proximal stomach with
a moderate amount of attached fat. Involving the proximal stomach, 0.6 cm from
the distal margin and 5 cm from the proximal margin is a 4.5 x 2.2 cm tan,
irregular well delineated, focally ulcerated raised mass. This mass on

sectioning is tan, ﬁrm, heterogeneous, focally cystic with a total thickness of

2.0 cm, extending to the muscularis propria with possible involvement of the
subjacent fat, coming within less than 0.1 cm from the inked deep soft tissue
margin. The uninvolved esophageal mucosa is tan-pink and wrinkled. The
uninvolved gastric mucosa is tan with the normal folds. The gastroesophageal
junction is well delineated. Multiple tan—pink, rubbery to firm lymph nodes are
identified in the attached fat up to 2 cm.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:
E1-2 mass to inked deep soft tissue margin;
E3 mass with adjacent uninvolved esophageal mucosa;
E4 mass with adjacent uninvolved gastric mucosa;
E5 gastroesophageal junction, uninvolved;
E6-7 multiple whole lymph nodes;
E8 one whole lymph node trisected;
E9 one whole lymph node bisected;
E10 one whole lymph node bisected;
E11 one whole lymph node bisected;
E12 representative section from one lymph node;
E13 representative sections from one lymph node.

Microscopic Description:

The final diagnosis of each specimen incorporates the microscopic examination
findings.
