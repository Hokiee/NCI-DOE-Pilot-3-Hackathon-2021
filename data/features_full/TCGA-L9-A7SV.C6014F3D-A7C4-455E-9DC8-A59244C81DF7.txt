GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A is labeled “level 7". is received in the unfixed state and consists of two pieces of
gauze from which the surface is scraped tan-black fragments of lymph node aggregating to 1
cm, entirely frozen in block A1.

8 is received in the unfixed state in the operating room labeled ”level R4". Multinle
black-tan pieces of lymph node aggregate to 1.2 cm. entirely frozen in block Bl.

C is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "chest wall lymph node" are
two anthracotic lvmnhoid tissue fragments which are 0.3 and 0.4 cm. submitted in toto in
cassette C1.

D is received in the unfixed state in the operating room labeled "left wedge upper lobe”.
The single wedge of lung measures 5 x 1 x 1 cm. The staple line is removed. The
parenchyma is blackish-red. There is an ill-defined 0.6 mm firm area in this area
beneath the pleura. This lesion is entirely frozen in block D1. Additional lung is
submitted in cassette 2.

E. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and “level 5 lymph node" is a 1.5
x 0.8 x 0.3 cm gray—black. focally disrupted anthracotic lymph node. The node is submitted
in toto in cassette E1.

F. Received in formalin labeled with the patient‘s name and ”level 10 lymph node” are two
blackened, delicate linear anthracotic lymph nodes. The nodes average 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm.
submitted in toto in cassette F1.

G. Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis and for tissue banking labeled "left lower
lobe“ is a 230 gram. 14.0 x 13.0 x 4.5 cm lobe of lung. The pleural surface is pinkutan to
red and congested with diffuse anthracotic marbling. The staples are removed. and the
bronchial margin is sampled for frozen section diagnosis. The pleural surface is puckered
in the region of the hilum. This region is inked blue and a section is placed
perpendicular down the length of the bronchus. There is a 3.7 x 3.3 x 3.0 cm tumor mass
present. The tumor is at the hilum and involves the bronchus. The tumor comes to within
1.6 cm of the bronchial margin at the bronchus. and adjacent to the bronchus is 0.3 cm to
the stapled bronchial margin. The tumor focally abuts and puckers the pleura and surrounds
the hilar vessels. The remainder of the parenchyma is congested predominantly in the
central aspect of the specimen. The parenchyma appears spongy superiorly and becomes
consolidated surrounding the hilum. The basilar parenchyma has a more normal. unremarkable
appearance. No additional lesions or tumor—like masses are identified. Tumor is selected
and sampled for tissue banking. and the bronchial margin is submitted for frozen section
diagnosis. The specimen is sampled as labeled:

Gl — bronchial margin frozen section residue

62 - vascular margins and hilar lymph nodes

GB — sections showing tumor to puckered pleura and bronchus

64—65 — additional perpendicular Section of tumor extending up bronchus
GS—G? — additional sections of tumor to pleura and bronchus

68-69 — sections of tumor to additional hilar structures to include vessels
GlD - sections from superior lower lobe

Gll — sections of mid lower lobe (adjacent to tumor)

612 ~ inferior. basilar aspect of lower lobe sampled

GROSS DESCRIPTION: (Continued)
H. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "level 10 lymph node“ is a 1.0
x 0.7 x 0.3 cm anthracotic lymph node. submitted in toto in cassette H1.

I. Labeled “new bronchial margin" are two tissue fragments with numerous embedded staples.
The tissue fragments include a 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm portion of focally anthracotlc to
pink—tan soft tissue and a nodular. linear 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm anthracotic lymph node. The
staples are removed. and the tissues are submitted in toto for frozen section diagnosis
with the frozen section residue in cassette 11.

J. Labeled “level 11 lymph nodes“. TWO black lymph nodes measure 0.5 and 0.8 cm. entirely
submitted in cassette J.

K. Labeled "level 5 lymph node". One irregular shaped black lymph node with some tannish
tissue measures 1.5 cm, entirely submitted in cassette K.

L. Labeled “level 6 lymph nodes“. TWO black nodes measure 0.6 cm. entirely submitted in
cassette L.

M. Labeled "level 4 lymph node". A single floating 1.1 cm soft tan piece of tissue is
entirely submitted. cassette M.

N. Labeled “level 10 lymph node“. A single 1.4 cm lymph node. has some staples removed
from the outer surface. The staple line is removed. The specimen measures 9 mm. entirely
submitted in cassette N.
