CLINICAL HISTORY
Left frontal brain tumor

OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES

Operation/Specimen: A: Left frontal brain tumor, biopsy

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:
Brain, left frontal tumor, biopsy: Glioblastoma (WHO Grade EV) (see comment}.

)MMENT
Sections show a highly cellular, moderately pleomorphic and moderately

vascularized glial tumor. Frequent mitotic figures are noted. Vascular
proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis are present in sections from
blocks A2 and A4. Results of immunohistochemical and molecular studies will be

reported in procedure addenda.

PROCEDURES/ADDENDA
MGMT Promoter Meth lation
Date Ordered: * Date Reported: _

Interpretation

POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected.

ResultSHComments
Testing performed on paraffin tissue block

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter

have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of

"GMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA followed
real—time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and unmethylated DNA

sequences.

stand alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its performance
"haracteristics determined by the— laboratory as

aquired by CLIA ' 88 regulations. It has not been.cleared or approved for
specific uses by the 0.8. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . The FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.

Immunohistology

Date Ordered: — Date Reported: —

Interpretation
Immunostains are consistent with qlioblastoma (see results below).

ResultSHComments
The tumor background is diffusely GFAP positive and occasional tumor cells are

GFAP positive.
The tumor is diffusely strongly p53 positive.

The Ki—ST labeling index is approximately 35%.

PCR for EGFR v ' I mutation
Date Ordered: W Date Reported: —

Interpretation
NEGATIVE — No evidence of EGFRVIII mutation is detected

Results—Comments

TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from tumor tissue
paraffin block

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular target
in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated in up
to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III
(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is
commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically distinct
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has been
shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor
suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin fixed,
paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is
then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR products
are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this assay has
been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells.
