Gross Description:

   

i). The specimen is received {rash labeled "right kidney, right adrenal gland and lymph nodes" and consists of a portion of
fibroedipose tissue and a kidney iNith attached ureter, renal vessels and perinephric fat weighing 667.5 g in total. The kidney
measures 12.6 x 7.5 x 6.0 cm. Tine attached ureter measures 9.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter. The attached renal vein
measures a 0.3 cm in length and 9.7 cm in diameter. The renal vessels and ureter margins are grossly unremarkable. An adrenal
gland is identiﬁed and measures 3.3 x 1.7 x 0.7 cm. The kidney is inked black and bivalved to reveal an 8.6 x ?.5 x 6.0 cm
well-deﬁned, yellow to light tan, tabulated tumor mass in the superior portion of the kidney. Grossly. the tumor appears to be
conﬁned within the renal capsule and compress the renal pelvis without perforating it. However. tumor thrombus is present within
the renal vein. Sections throughsthe remainder of the kidney reveal a pink brown parenohyma with a well-deﬁned
cortico-mertullary Junction. The cortex measures 0.5 cm and the calyces appear normal. The specimen is submitted for lymph
node dissection. Representative sections are submitted for TPS and for permanent sections. Gross photos are taken.

Summary of sections: :
UVM -- ureteral and vessel margins

T-- tumor :

THF-- tumor with hilar fat

TSF .. tumor with sinus fat

TK -- tumor with adjacent kidney

TRP — tumor wlth adjacent renal pelvis, including tumor thrombus in renal vein
RP - an additional renal pelvis representative section
K -- representative sections kidney

AD — adrenal gland I

PLN ~ possible lymph nodes

2). The specimen is received in formalin labeled. ”Falclforrn ligament" and consists of a segment of indurated fatty tissue
measuring 7.5 x 6.5 x 2.5 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a cylindrical white-tan ﬁbrotic tissue measuring 2.5 cm in
length by 0.7 cm in maximum diameter. The specimen is representativety sampled.
