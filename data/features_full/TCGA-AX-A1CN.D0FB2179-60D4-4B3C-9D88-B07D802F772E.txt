positive staining. Despite the primarily endocervical location. except for the positive CEA. these results are more
consistent with an andometrlai primary. Note that about 15% ol endomettiai primary tumors are CEA positive. In situ
hybridization for HPV is pending and the results will be reported in an addendum. Correlation at this inlormation with

The specimens are received in nine iormalimillied containers labeled with the patients name ' The iirst
container is further labeled 'uterue. cervix. bilateral tubes and ovaries.‘ it contains a uterus and cervix with attached
bilateral evades and iailoplan tubes weighing 300 grams post ﬁxation. The uterus and cervix measure 11.3 cm from
lundus to tip of cervix x 7.5 cm irom comu to come it 8.5 cm from anterior to posterior. The sarosai surface is tan-pink
to purple and without lesions. There is a probable subserosal ielomyoma measuring 1.3 cm in diameter. it is we!
clrcurnscribed and has a tan-gray whoried cut surface. The cervix measures 3.0 x 5 x 5 cm. The pericervical soft tissue
resection margin has been previously inked in black. There is a scant amount at parametrial soft tissue measuring 2.5
x 2.0 x 0.3 cm on the right and 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm on the leit. The tan-pink ectocerle has been previously incised. it
roughly measures 5.0 x 3.7 cm. There is a portion at vaginal cuff antarloriy measuring 4 x 0.5 cm. There is also a
portion of vaginal cuff located along the posterior cervix measuring 3.0 x 0.6 cm. The comical and vaginal mucosa is
without lesions except for a few petechial hemorrhages noted on the ectocervix posteriorty. The external 08 measures
~1.3 x 0.7 cm. Ten to maroon hemorrhagic tissue is seen within the as. The uterus and cervix have been previously
opened to reveal a poiypold tuner mass located within the upper endocervlcal canal. The point 01 attachment is within
the upper two-thirds oi the endocetvlcal canal. The tumor measures 4.9 x 2.8 x 3.0 cm. Sectioning through the tumor
reveals a tan-pink cut surface. The tumor appears to invade into the wall of the cervix. The maximal depth at hvaslon
appears to be 1.2 cm where the total ceniical wall thickness measures 1.4 cm. This deepest point of invasion is located
within the anterior cervix at approximately the 12 o'clock position. The tumor appears to to 0.2 cm Item the
paracervlcal sott tissue resection margin and 1.2 cm away from the vaginal cuff margin where it most closely
approaches deep margin. There are also some poiypold excrescencee noted more inferior to this main tumor mass
within the endocervlcal canal. They measure, in aggregate, 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.15 cm. This smaller mass appears rather
superficial and is located 1.0 cm from the extamai as. The endometrtsi cavity measures 3.7 x 3.2 cm. The endometriai
mucosa appears thickened and contains pciypoid tumor in both the anterior and posterior endometrlal wall. The
maximal endometrisi thickness measures 0.5 cm. The depth oi mycmetrlal invasion appears to be 1 mm where the
total myometriai wall thickness measures 22 cm. Within the myomatriutn. there are multiple probable leiomyomas with
clrcmnscribed borders and tan-pink to white whoried cut sudeces. They range in size from 0.7 to 1,7 cm in diameter.
The right ovary measures 3.5 x 1.3 x 1.3 cm. The serosal surlace is tan to purple and unremantable. Sectioning
reveals a tan-white to grey variegated cut surface with a yellow-orange corpus Iuteum. The right fallopian tube has
been previously cut and measures 5.0 cm in length with a diameter ranging item 0.3 to 0.9 cm. The serosel surtace is
pink to purple and contain a few subserosal cysts ranging in size from 0.1 to 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. Sectioning
reveals a pinpoint lumen with a wall thickness measuring 0.2 cm. The leit ovary measures 3.9 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. The
serosal surface is tan-pink to purple and unremarkable. Sectioning reveals a tan-gray to purple variegated cut surlace
with yellow-orange corpora lutea. There is one hemorrhagic focus measuring 0.9 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm. The left fallopian tube
measures 0.3 cm in length with a diameter ranging from 0.3 to 0.9 cm. The serosal surface is purple to grey with a few
