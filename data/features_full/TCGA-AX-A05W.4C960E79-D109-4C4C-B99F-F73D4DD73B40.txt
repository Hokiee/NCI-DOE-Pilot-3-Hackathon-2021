03 to DS - one entire node; 06 — one entire node bisected. Jar 1. _
The fifth container is labeled "left periaortic lymph node." It contains two
pieces Of yellow fatty tissue measuring 1.5 and 3.0 cm in greatest dimen5ion.
The smaller piece is dissected to show only fatty tissue. The larger piece shows
two utative tan lymph nodes measuring 0.3 and 2.0 cm in greatest dimenSion.
Labeged E1 — smaller lymph node; E2 and E3 — entire larger lymph node;
E4-remaining fatty tissue. Jar O. ,

The eighth container is labeled "uterus, tubes, ovaries, cervix." It contains a
compOSite specnmen weighing 89 gm that is composed of uterus and bilateral tubes
and ovaries. The uterus measures 8.0 cm from fundus to ectocervix, 4.5 cm from
cornu to cornu. and 3.5 cm from anterior to posterior. The ectocervix is
white—tan and focally hemorrhagic measuring 2.2 x 2.0 cm. The serosal surface is
tan—brown and glistening with no fibrous adhesions noted grossly. The
endocervical cavity is tan—brown with a herringbone pattern and measures 3.0 x

Grossly the endometrial lesion appears to extend to a maximum depth of 4 mm. The
average gross myometrial thickness is 1.1 cm. The attached right ovary meaSures

previously sectioned to show unremarkable w ite—tan ovarian tissue. The right
fallopian tube measures 5.0 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and has a well-developed fimbriated
end. It is unremarkable on section. The left ovary measures 2.8 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm
and has a gray-tan. focally hemorrhagic outer surface. It has been previously
sectioned to show unremarkable white-tan ovarian tissue. The left fallopian tube
measures 5.0 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and is sectioned to show unremarkable white—tan
tissue. The left fallopian tube is adhesed to the left ovary. Labeled H1—
anterior cervix; H2 - anterior lower uterine segment, including polypoid nodule:
