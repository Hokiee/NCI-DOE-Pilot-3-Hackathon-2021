MOLECULAR AN ATOMIC PATHOLOGY TESTING:

Block 3K:

A. HRAS mutation IDENTIFIED (p.Q61K, c.181C>A).

B. Mutations in BRAF, NRAS61, KRASlZ/l3 NOT identified.
C. FISH test for RET/PT C rearrangement is pending.

NOTE:

DNA was extracted in the amount sufﬁcient for testing.

BACKGROUND:

Mutations in either BRAF or RAS genes or RET/PT C rearrangements are found in
more than 70% of papillary thyroid carcinomas (l). BRAF V600E (T1799A)
mutation has been associated with more aggressive behavior of papillary
carcinoma (2, 3). The association between BRAF V600E mutation and features of
tumor aggressiveness have also been observed in papillary microcarcinomas (4).
Mutations in the RAS genes or PAX8/PPARg rearrangement occur in ~70% of
follicular thyroid carcinomas and with lower frequency in oncocytic (H?rthle

cell) carcinomas (5). Regarding the speciﬁcity of these mutations for cancer,
BRAF V600E mutation and RET/PT C and PAX8/PPARg rearrangements are overall
specific for malignancy in the thyroid, although they have been reported with

a very low frequency in benign thyroid lesions (6). RAS mutations occur in
malignant and benign thyroid tumors, being found in ~40-50% of follicular

and anaplastic carcinomas, 30-40% of follicular adenomas and 10-15% of

pa ill carcinomas (6).

MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS:

For parafﬁn-embedded surgical specimens, manual microdissection was performed
to collect tumor tissue. Specimens with the minimum of 50% of tumor cells in

a microdissection target are accepted for the analysis. Optical density

readings were obtained. Real-time PCR was performed on the LightCycler
platform to amplify BRAF codons 599-601, NRAS codon 61, HRAS codon 61, and
KRAS codons 12/13 sequences. Post-PCR melting curve analysis was used to
detect possible mutations. If required, the mutation type was confirmed by

Sanger sequencing of the PCR product on ABI3130. DNA from samples positive
for each of these mutations was used as positive controls. Ampliﬁcation at 35
cycles or earlier was considered sufficient for the analysis. The limit of

detection is approximately 10-20% of alleles with mutation present in the

backfround of normal DNA.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in nine parts.

Part 1 is received ﬁxed, labeled with the patient's name (initials xx) and

"left neck levels 2, 3, 4." Received is an unoriented portion of ﬁbroadipose
tissue measuring 11.1 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. The first third of the specimen
contains up to eight potential soft, tan-pink lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 to
1.1 cm in greatest dimension. The middle third of the specimen contains up to
two potential soft, tan-gray lymph nodes measuring 0.2 and 0.8 cm. The last
third of the specimen contains no grossly identifiable lymph nodes.

Cassette code:

1A 1B multiple potential lymph nodes, ﬁrst third

1C multiple potential lymph nodes, middle third

1D adipose tissue, last third

Part 2 is received ﬁxed, labeled with the patient's name (initials xx) and
"right neck levels 2, 3, 4 including 2B". Received is an unoriented portion
of ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 12.0 x 2.5 x 1.4 cm. A 2.2 x 1.4 x 0.8 cm
lymph node in the middle third of the specimen (designated level 2B) has a
ﬁrm, tan-white cut surface with central necrotic material and pinpoint
hemorrhages. Up to 6 other potential soft lymph nodes are identified in the
middle third of the specimen ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 cm. The ﬁrst, adjacent
third of the specimen contains the most connective tissue and is presumed to
represent level 3, having anatomically bent inferior to the middle third of
the specimen. The first third of the specimen contains two soft tan lymph
nodes measuring 1.3 and 2.2 cm. The opposite, last fatty third of the
specimen is designated as level 4 and contains multiple potential lymph nodes
ranging from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm to 1.0 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm.

Cassette code:
