GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. The specimen is labeled “pancreatic duct margin". The specimen consist of two reddish
tan pieces of tissue. I don't see any staple lines in the one. it looks like it may be
clot or maybe a lymph node. The specimen is entirely frozen in one block.

B. The specimen is labeled “common duct margin“. The specimen consist of a single gray
membranous red piece of tissue measuring about i x 0.6 cm, entirely frozen in block B.

C. The specimen is labeled “Whipple contents”. The specimen is received in the unfixed
state in the operating room and consists of a single specimen consisting of stomach. The
lesser curvature measures 6.5 cm. greater curvature 10.5 cm. proximal staple line measures
7 cm. The serosal surface of the stomach is grossly unremarkable. The duodenum and small
intestine measures 20 cm in length. The distal end is stapled closed. The surface of the
small intestine demonstrates some hemorrhagic adhesions along the anterior surface. The
gastric duodenal mucosa is opened revealing a small amount of mucoid blood. The attached
pancreas measures 6 x 4.7 x 3.5 cm. One long staple line is running across the edge of the
specimen. Some blue ink is placed along the uncinate process. A second smaller 1.3 cm
staple line is present in the area of the bile duct. I could probe the ampulla about 1.5 cm
then becomes stenotic. Representative sections of the unremarkable stomach and gastric
lymph nodes submitted in cassette C1. The ampulla is probed through the specimen, sections
of the ampulla and suspicious tumor in the pancreas in the area submitted for tumor banking
submitted in cassette C2. This is a section along the length of the duct. One smear
imprint is made of the suspicious area and this area is then sampled for tumor banking.

TWo additional parallel sections are submitted in cassettes C3 and C4. Tumor estimation
size on cross sectioning is 2.2 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. Representative sections of tumor submitted
through cassettes C10. One section including the inked margin. There is a small blue
suture at one margin submitted in cassette C7. Suspected lymph node submitted in cassette
C8, One complete crosg section including an area where the tissue is submitted for tumor
banking submitted in cassettes C11. 12 and 13. One additional cross section submitted in
cassettes 14 through 17.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:

The invasive adenocarcinoma originates from in situ carcinoma in the pancreatic duct and
extends into the wall of the duodenum and the mucosa of the ampulla. The tumor also
extends outward outside the pancreas into the surrounding fibroadipose vascular connective

tissue and inked margins. The tumor measures 2 mm from the uncinate process margin. There
is a fair amount of acute and chronic inflammation with extensive squamous metaplasia of
the pancreatic duct. This is also associated with the acute pancreatitis with abscess
formation.
