***Report Electronically Reviewed and Signed Out By—*

Microscopic Description and Comment: Histologic sections from the left ovarian mass show

a poorly differentiated Mullerian adenocarcinoma. The majority of the tumor is present

in solid sheets and nests; Some of the tumor, however, exhibits definite glandular
differentiation with oceasional areas of back to back glands diagnostic of endometrioid
differentiation. Other areas exhibit intraluminal complexity in the form of papilla With
markedly pleomorphic nuclei and numerous atypical mitotic figures consistent with serous
differentiation. Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in and around the left fallopian tube,
in a small nodule in the right mesovarium, extensively involving the serosal aspect of the
uterus and deep paracervical tissue with superficial invasion of overlying myometrium, in
the omentum, on the serosal aspect of the appendix, in a mesenteric nodule, in a sigmoid
nodule, and in the pelvis. A segment of the sigmoid colon has been resected. This segment is
unoriented but one resection margin exhibits metastatic adenocarcinoma.

History: The patient is ith a pelvic mass. - now undergoes evaluatiorl
under anesthesia, exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, with bilateral
salpingo—oophorectomy, omentectomy, appendectomy, sigmoid resection with renanastomosis, and
optimal tumor debulking.

Gross Description Received are eight containers, each labeled with the patient‘s name. The
first is further designated “cul de sac tumor.“ It contains a 1 x 1 x 1 cm aggregate of

friable tan tissue- —

The second container is further designated "uterus, cervix, B50." It contains a 200

gram uterine corpus with attached adnexae and attached cervix. The left adnexa is largely
replaced by a 7 x 4 x 4 cm friable tan tumor mass. The tumor has a finely papillary
appearance. Attached to the tumor is a 3 cm in diameter smooth—lined cyst. Grossly, the
tumor appears to be adhesed and possibly invading the serosal surface of the left uterine
corpus. The fallopian tube, which measures 3 cm in length and 1 cm in diameter appears to
be uninvolved, although it is adherent to the tumor mass. The right adnexa consists of -

a 2 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm firm white and tan ovary with multiple corpora albicans and a 4 cm in
length and 0.8 cm in diameter fallopian tube. There does not appear to be any evidence

of tumor in the fallopian tube or the ovary; however, in the mesovarium, there is a 8.5
cm firm white nodule. The uterine corpus which measures 4.5 cm superiorsinferior, 4 cm
cornu—cornu, and 4.5 cm anterior—posterior is adhesed to the left ovarian mass. Furthermore,
there are multiple nodules of tumor studding the serosal surface. The endometrial cavity
measures 2.5 x 2 cm with an endometrial thickness of 0.2 cm. The endometrium sounds to a
depth of 8 cm. The endometrial lining is remarkable for a 2 x 2 x 1 cm polyp protruding into
the endometrial cavity. Sectioning of the polyp reveals a central core with a firm white
lobulated appearance, measuring 2 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm. The core of this polyp appears to arise
from the underlying myometrium and is consistent with a submucosal leiomyoma protruding
into the lumen of the cavity with an intact endometrial lining overlying the leiomyoma.
There are also other intramural and subserosal unremarkable leiomyomas present, ranging
from 1 cm in greatest dimension to 1.6 cm in greatest dimension. The myometrium is 2.0m
in thickness anteriorly and 1.4 cm in thickness posteriorly. The cervix, which measures

3 cm in length and 3 cm in diameter with a round os measuring 0.5 cm in diameter, appears
to be unremarkable without evidence of papillary formations, masses or nodules. Labeled Bl

The third container is further desi hated "si oid tumor." It contains a 4 x 4 x 4 cm

The fourth container is further designated "sigmoid colon.“ It contains an unoriented
segment of bowel measuring 9 cm in length and 2 cm in diameter with a serosal surface that
is extensively involved by friable tan tumor. The tumor appears to extend very close to
the resection margin. The mucosal surface appears to be unremarkable. Labeled: D1 — one
resection margin; D2 — other margin; D3 — random section with tumor. -

The fifth container is further desi nated " elvic tumor.“ It contains a 1 x l x 0.5 cm
aggregate of friable tan tumor. ﬁ.

cm in diameter tissue covered with a glistening membrane. —
