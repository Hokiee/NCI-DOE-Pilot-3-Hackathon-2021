COMMENT:
High grade papillsry serous carcinoma involves both ovaries and has extenslve local extension and peritoneal spreading.
I favor the tumor Is bilateral ovarian primary with extensive pelvic and peritoneal metastases based on the large tumor
volume on both ovaries and the surface exophytic growth and extensive ovarian stroma invasion.
