CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm corpus uteri. Per E-browser: adenocarcinoma diagnosed at

outside hospital.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries (AF1)". Unfixed for frozen section and
transferred to formalin at is a 85 gram, 6 x 6 x 2.2 cm
uterus with bilateral adnexa.

The uterine serosa is tan and unremarkable. Sectioning demonstrates a 2.2 x 2
x 1.1 cm tan-pink, friable mass at the fundus extending into the posterior
endometrium. The mass does not grossly invade the myometrium (1.8 cm thick),
is 1.5 cm from the closest superior endocervix, and is 4.2 cm from the
cervical 05. The endometrium is otherwise tan and less than 0.1 cm thick. The
myometrium is unremarkable. The anterior endocervix is remarkable for a 1.1 cm
nabothian cyst. The ectocervical and endocervical mucosa are otherwise
unremarkable. Representative full-thickness section of the endometrial mass at
the fundus is frozen as AFl. The frozen section control is transferred to A1.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

A2—8 mass entirely submitted (full-thickness sections) from fundus to
posterior endometrium

A9 adjacent uninvolved posterior endomyometrium
A10 anterior endomyometrium

. All posterior cervix
A12 anterior cervix

The right fallopian tube (4.5 x 0.6 cm) has a tan, unremarkable serosal
surface and an unremarkable cut surface. The right ovary (2.5 x 2 x 0.8 cm)
has a yellow, smooth, glistening surface. The cut surface is unremarkable.
Representative right fallopian tube and ovary are submitted in block A13.

The left fallopian tube (4.5 x 0.5 cm) has a tan, smooth, glistening surface.
There are two paratubal cysts up to 0.3 cm in greatest dimension. The cut
surface is unremarkable. The left ovary (2.5 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm) has a yellow,
unremarkable external surface and an unremarkable cut surface. Representative
left fallopian tube and ovary submitted in block A14.

B. "ie‘t pelvic lymph node". Unfixed and transferred to formalin at on

is a 2.5 x 2 x 0.6 cm fragment of yellow fibroadipose tissue
dissected for lymph nodes. Two apparent lymph nodes up to 1 cm in greatest
dimension are identified and submitted in block B1. The remaining fibroadipose
tissue is submitted in block 82.

C. "Left pelvic lymph node". Unfixed and transferred to formalin at on

is a 3.4 x 2.2 x 0.8 cm aggregate of yellow fibroadipose tissue
dissected for lymph nodes. Three apparent lymph nodes up to 1.2 cm in greatest
dimension are identified and submitted in block C1. The remaining fibroadipose
tissue is submitted in block C2.

D. "Right pelvic lymph node". Unfixed and transferred to formalin at
on is a 4.5 x 4 x 1.5 cm aggregate of tan—yellow fibroadipose tissue
dissected for lymph nodes. Apparent lymph nodes up to 2.5 cm in greatest

' dimension are identified. .

accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.
