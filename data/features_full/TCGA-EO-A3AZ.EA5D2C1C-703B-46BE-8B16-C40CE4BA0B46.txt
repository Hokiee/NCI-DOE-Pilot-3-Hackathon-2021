Uterus:

MIXED SEROUS AND ENDOMETRIOID CARCINOMA OF ENDOMETRIUM:
' ~ serous component greater than 50%

- invasion into outer half of myometriai thickness

- extension into lower uterine segment. approaching but not into cervix

- Iymphovascular space involvement present

Other

- Leior'nyomata

Ovaries:
— Negative for carcinoma

Fallopian tubes:
- Negative for carcinoma

Cgmmm

The immunoproﬁie supports the diagnosis of serous carcinoma (p16 p53 positive; PR negative)’ In a portion ofthe
tumour. A viiioglanduiar component has the immunoproﬂle of an endometrioid carcinoma (ER positive p53. p18
negative), supporting the impression of a true mixed serous and endometrioid carcinoma.

1. The specimen container is labeled with the patient‘s name and as "Uterus: Cervix, Bilateral Tubes and Ovaries”. The
specimen consists of a total hysterectomy specimen with attached bilateral salpingeoophorectomy. The specimen has a
fresh weight of 52.5 g. The uterus and cervix measures 7.0 cm Si x 4.5 cm ML x 3.3 cm AP. The cervix has a maximum
diameter of 1.0 cm. The external os measures 0.4 cm and is oval. The right fallopian tube measures 5.7 cm length by 0.5
cm in diameter. The right ovary measures 1.3x 1.4 x 0.3 cm. The left fallopian tube measures 5.0 cm in length by 0.6 in
diameter. The left ovary measures 1.7 x 1.1 x 1.0 cm.

The uterine serosa is ten and smooth with a white nodule on the posterior aspect measuring 0.4 cm maximum dimension.
The exocervix is pink tan and smooth with query of the anterior exocervix is partly missing. The endocervical canal
measures 2.3 cm In length. The endometrial cavity demonstrates an ill-deﬁned friable tan-brown tumor measuring 2.5 cm
Si x 2.3 cm ML x 2.8 cm AP. The tumor measures 0.3 cm from the anterior serosal surface and 0.9 cm from the posterior
serosal surface. The myometrium Is tan and demonstrates a well circumscribed white nodule in the posterior aspect
measuring 0.6 cm. Betti fallopian tubes show fimbn‘a. The outer surface of the ovaries is white tan and partly cerebrifonn.
The cut surface of each ovary is tan and unremarkable. Within the paraovarian tissue there are two calciﬁed nodules the
largest measuring 0.2 cm. Tissue is stored frozen.

Representative sections:

1A longitudinal full thickness section of anterior exocervix to LUS

13-10 full thickness partially transverse section of anterior tumor with endomycmetrium

1E-1 F longitudinal full thickness section of posterior exocervix to LUS [section bisected]

16- 1H full thickness transverse section of posterior tumor with endomycmetrium and serosal nodule [section bisected]
1l- 1J full thickness transverse section of posterior tumor with endomycmetrium rectum section bisected]

1K right fallopian tube and flmbria,

1L- 1M remainder of right fallopian tube serially sectioned from comu to ﬁmbrial end

1N representative sections of right ovary

10 left fallopian tube and ﬁmbria

1P- 10 remainder of left fallopian tube serially sectioned from cornua to ﬁmbrial end
