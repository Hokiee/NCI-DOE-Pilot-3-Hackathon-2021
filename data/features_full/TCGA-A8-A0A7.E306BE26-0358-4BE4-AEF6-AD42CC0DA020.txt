Diagnosis:

1. Polymorphocellular undifferentiated breast, G II (maximum tumor diameter 2.8 cm)
showing infiltrative growth, with marked chronic secondary inflammation, focal
invasion of lymph vessels and spread to just below the skin.

The conventional histological findings are consistent with the polymorphocellular
variant of invasive lobylarbrveasstgarcinonla. The nodular tumor infiltration in the
axillary tissue described under 6. @1356. interpreted as a lymph node metastasis
extending beyond the capsule into the surrounding soft tissue. This gives rise to the
following summary tumor classification: G H, pT2pN1a(1/14)L1VORO, negative for
estrogen and progesterone receptors, positive for C-erb 8—2 oncoprotein.
