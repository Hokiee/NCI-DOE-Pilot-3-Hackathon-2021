Mb: 3 'A. P53 Protein (88342) A. Frozen Section Char e (m)
CLINICAL HISTORY: A CT

A revealed left temporal lobe mass with some associated edema.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received the following specimen in the Department of

Pathology, labeled with the patient's name and hospital #:

A. Left brain mass
A. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "brain lesion" and consists
of two rectangular pieces of cerebral cortex with underlying subcortical
white matter. Each piece of tissue measures 4.2 x 4.0 x 1,1 cm and 4.1 x
3.0 x 1.4 cm. The meningeal surfaces are smooth and beige—tan, with a
fine reticulated vasculature. The resection margin is cauterized and
focally necrotic. Sectioning reveals a clear demarcation between the
gray and white matter layers. No discrete lesion is identified, however,
there is focal discoloration of the white matter. A representative
section of this discolored white matter is submitted for frozen section.
Frozen section diagnosis is ”Malignant glioma," per —. The
frozen section tissue is submitted for permanent processing in cassette
FSAl. Additional representative sections are submitted in cassettes
A2—A7. m}
DIAGNOSIS:
A. "Left brain mass":
Glioblastoma multiforme with oligodendroglioma component'
(WHO Grade IV) (see comment)
COMMENT: This high grade glioma features areas of high cellularity,
mitoses, vascular endothelial proliferation and necrosis. The areas of
necrosis with apparent pseudopalisading are best represented in slide
"A1". Additional rather circumscribed foci of high grade
oligodendrogliomatous appearance are also seen. In such areas, the Ki~67
labeling index is 20—30%. P53 is reactive in abOut 20% of tumor cell
nuclei. GFAP is reactive in some tumor cells and in reactive-appearing
astrocytes. These results support the diagnosis.
