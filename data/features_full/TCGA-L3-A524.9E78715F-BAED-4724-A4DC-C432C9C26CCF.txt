SPECIMEN(S) RECEIVED:
A. Right upper lobectomy with en bloc resection of chest wall & portion of lower lobe — stitch
8. Right pulmonary lymph node

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh is a 477-gram, 13 x 11 x 6 cm resection of the right upper lobe lung, attached 7 x 5 x 3 cm
portion of the right lower lobe and attached 11 x 8 x 3.8 cm resection of the right chest wall which includes three
ribs and surrounding red-yellow soft tissue. The pleural surface is dusky and pink-purple with a large amount of
black anthracotic pigment present. There is a large 6.4 x 5 x 4.5 cm gray-white to gray-black mass extending from
the lower portion of the upper lobe into the attached portion of lower lobe and Into the attached portion of chest
wall. The lesion appears grossly to come within 3.2 cm of the staple line on the lower lobe and appears grossly to
invade into the central rib bone. The tumor grossly extends to within 3.2 cm of the peripheral margin of the
resected chest wall. The lung tissue unaffected by tumor is soft, spongy and dark red to gray-black. There are
numerous soft, gray-black anthracotic lymph nodes present at the hilum. Representative sections are submitted as
A1 - bronchial margin for frozen section; A2 — peripheral chest wall margin for frozen section; A3 — en face margin
from staple line on right lower lobe; A4-A6 — mass(A4 8. A6 Include tumor involving RLL); A7 — normal lung; A8 -
hilar lymph node, bisected; A9-A10 — intact hilar lymph nodes; A11-A12 - invasion of tumor Into rib bone after
decalciﬁcation.
