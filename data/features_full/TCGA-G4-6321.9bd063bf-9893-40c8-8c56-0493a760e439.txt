SPECIMEN(S):
A. RIGHT COLON

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. RIGHT COLON
Received without fixative, labeled "right colon", is an i|ea|co|ectomy specimen including one segment of
6—cm long ileum, 3.5-cm cecum with attached 6—cm long appendix, 30-cm long colon, with attached
mesenteric fat. The colon is approximately 3.5 cm in diameter. Both resection margins are stapled
closed. After removal of the stapled line, the specimen is opened and reveals one polypoid ulcerated
colonic lesion measures 2.2 x 1.5-cm and elevated above the colonic mucosa to 0.7 cm. This lesion is
11-cm to the colonic resection margin and 19-cm to Heal resection margin. The lesion appears to be
superficial and does not involve the colonic wall. Three additional polypoid areas are present and each
measuring 1.2, 1.5 and 2-cm in greatest dimension and are located 3.5, 4.5, and 8.0-cm to the colonic
resection margin. The uninvolved colonic mucosa and i|ea| mucosa are unremarkable. The appendix is
6—cm in length and 0.5-cm in diameter and is grossly unremarkable. Multiple possible lymph nodes are
present in the mesentery fat. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
A1. Distal colonic resection margin
A2. Proximal i|ea| resection margin
A3-A4: Full thickness of ulcerated polypoid lesion with attached mesenteric fat (inked black), bisected
A5. Additional section of ulcerated polypoid lesion
A6. Sections from polypoid area, 8.0-cm to the colonic resection margin
A7. Sections from polypoid area, 4.5-cm to the colonic resection margin
A8. Sections from polypoid area, 3.5-cm to the colonic resection margin
A9. Sections of ileum
A10. Sections of cecum and appendix
A11. lleocecal valve
A12-A14: Random sections of uninvolved colon
A15-A27: Multiple possible lymph nodes
A28: Tip of appendix

DIAGNOSIS:
A. COLON AND TERMINAL ILEUM, RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY:
- INFILTRATING MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA ARISING IN A SERRATED
ADENOMA (2.2-CM)
- SURGICAL MARGINS ARE NOT INVOLVED
- METASTATIC CARCINOMA INVOLVING THREE LYMPH NODES (3/44)

Tumor Site: Cecum

Tumor Configuration: Exophytic (polypoid)

Tumor size: 2.2cm Additional dimensions 1.5cm x 0.7cm
WHO Classification

Adenocarcinoma 8140/3

Histologic Grade: G2: Moderately differentiated

Extent of Invasion: Muscularis propria

Margins: Margin(s) uninvolved by invasive carcinoma (Proximal, Distal, Radial)
Distance of invasive carcinoma from closest margin: 11cm
Margin: distal

Venous/Lymphatic Invasion: Absent

Perineural Invasion: Absent

Additional Pathologic Findings: three hyperplastic polyps

Extent of Resection: R0: Complete resection with grossly and microscopically negative margins
Lymph Nodes: Positive 3 / 44

Extranodal extension: Absent

Pathological Staging (pTNM): pT 2 N 1 M x

Comment(s):

The tumor has a minor mucinous component with occasional, rare signet ring cells present..
Immunohistochemical studies were performed in blocks A3/A4-see below- to confirm presence of
metastatic disease and assess depth of invasion. Further studies to assess microsatellite instability will
be reported as an addendum.
