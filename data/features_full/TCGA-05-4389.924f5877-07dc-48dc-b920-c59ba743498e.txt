Mixed bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma.

Comment/supplementary remark: histoarchitecture and cell morphology of the tumor are
consistent with a bronchopulmonary origin of the tumor. This will be reviewed and confirmed
in immunohistological investigations. The tumor is completely removed by wedge excision of
sample 1.). The visceral pleura, the right upper lobe of sample 2.), including its resection
margin of the bronchus and vessels and all the lymph nodes removed are tumor-free. On the
assumption of a bronchopulmonary origin to the tumor: Tumor classification: pTl, pNO, R0,
stage 1A..
