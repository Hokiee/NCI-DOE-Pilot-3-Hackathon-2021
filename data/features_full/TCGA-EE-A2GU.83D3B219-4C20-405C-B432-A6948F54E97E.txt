fe‘ . -
lg Two specImens were received.

1,,"RIGHT GROIN DISSECTION LONG DISTAL LOOP PROXIMAL".

A piece of ﬁbroﬂitty tissue measuring 297 x 78 x 50mm. There are two sutures one is long and allocates
distal, the other one has a loop shape and allocates proximal. There is an area inked blue, it appears the tissue
has been taken from that area for tumour banking. Dissection has been undertaken from distal to opposite
end. There is an attached skin ellipse measuring 53 x 8mm. The skin ellipse appears macroscopically
unremarkable. The previously discussed nodule which has been banked for tumour banking measures 37 x

28 x 28mm. It appears partially pale, partially haemorrhagic and necrotic. Representative sections embedded
in blocks A - B.

A-B. Large Lymph node (tumour banked).

no extranodal spread. The tumour is positive for $100, HMB45 and Melan A.

2. A total of eleven lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy.
