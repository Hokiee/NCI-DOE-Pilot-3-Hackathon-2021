GROSS DESCRIPTION
1. Labeied "sentinei node. suture most proximai (right chest)": The specimen

consists of

a 5.0 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm c1uster of approximateiy 15 b1ack gray 1ymph nodes ranging
from 0.2 to

(2.01cm. Lymph nodes entireiy submitted as A — three 1ymph nodes each bisected
ye ow =

mgst proximai), B — 1ymph nodes, C — two 1ymph nodes each bisected, D - two 1ymph
no es

each bisected.

2. Labeied "segmentai resection superior segment right iower iobe": The specimen
consists

of a 6.0 x 6.0 x 2.5 cm wedge of deepiy biue—stained red purpie 1ung tissue. TWo
metaiiic

stapie 1ines are present on p1eura measuring 4.5 x and 5.0 cm. Wedge has been
previousiy

incised reveaiing a 2.0 x 1.7 x 1.7 cm deepiy b1ue—stained tan gray firm
weii—circumscribed

rubbery noduie. Noduie has been partiaiiy previousiy harvested. Noduie abuts
viscera

pieura but does not appear to invoive pieura. Nodu1e is approximateiy 1.5 cm from
nearest

sﬁapied resection margin. Remaining lung parenchyma is deepiy biue—stained with no
ot er

discrete 1esions identified. Representativeiy sectioned as A — tangentiai margin,
B-C -
representative section of noduie, D - uninvoived 1ung parenchyma.

Microscopic sections are prepared and interpreted.

MICROSCOPIC

COMMENT

Case findings have been discussed with , who reported a history of
fdesmo Tastic meTanoma of the forehead in The Tung tumor type is not cTear
rom t e

morphoTogic or immunohistochemicaT findings. DifferentiaT diagnosis may incTude
soTitary

fibrous tumor, atypicaT or Tow maTignant potentiaT, sarcomatoid carcinoma, and
desmopTastic

meTanoma metastatic. FoTTowing discussion with Drs. and

consuTtative

hopinion has been requested from Dr. at . Dr. from
TS

department considers it a sarcomatoid maTignant neopTasm. The previous biopsy
sTides have

subsequentTy been received for review and demonstrate remarkabTe
histoTogic

simiTarity to the current Tung tumor. Therefore, despite the Tack of 5-100 protein

expression, the Tung tumor probabTy represents metastatic meTanomav’ NevertheTess,
the

possibiTity of a Tow grade primary puTmonary sarcoma cannot be compTeteTy echuded.

DIAGNOSIS

l. SENTINEL LYMPH NODES, RIGHT CHEST, EXCISION.
— MULTIPLE BENIGN LYMPH NODES (0/15).

- SEVERAL LYMPH NODES CONTAIN FIBROCALCIFIC NODULES, PROBABLY REMOTE
GRANULOMAS.

- N0 MALIGNANCY IS IDENTIFIED.

2. LUNG, RIGHT LOWER LOBE SUPERIOR SEGMENT, SEGMENTAL RESECTION.

- SPINDLE CELL MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, MOST CONSISTENT WITH METASTATIC
DESMOPLASTIC

MALIGNANT MELANOMA.
