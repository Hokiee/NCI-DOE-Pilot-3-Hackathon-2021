MACROSCOPIC

One specimen submitted.

The specimen is labelled ‘left upper lobe' and consists of a lobe of lung
measuring 230 x 100 x 20 mm in the uninflated state. A number of bulious
structures are present at the apex of the lobe over an area 40 x 20 mm. There
is a small area of ﬁbrous pleural thickening on the lateral aspect of the lobe

over an area approximately 20 x 20 mm. Beneath this area of thickening is a
palpable tumour mass. The pleura moves over this mass and does not appear to
be involved. At ﬂee hiium there are two bronchial proﬁles, 10 and 8 mm in
diameter. Very few peribronchial nodes are included. A stapled resection

line, 70mm in length, extends posteroinferiorly from the hilum. Transverse
slicing reveals an. extensively necrotic tumour mass 25 x 25 x 20 mm, lateral to
the hilum and approaching the lateral pleural surface. Thecut surface or" this
tumour has a variegated grey and yellow appearance. Adjacent to the tumour is
an ill defined area of yellowish discolouration of lung parenchyma measuring
approximately 10mm in maximum dimension. There is also an ill-defined area of
parench‘ymai fibrosis adjacent to the tumour. Elsewhere the lung parenchyma
shows. severe emphysematous changes. [1A, bronchial resection margin; 18,
peribronchial' lymph nodes; 1C~1E tumour with overlying pleura; 1F, area of
yellowish discolouration; 1.6, ill-deﬁned ﬁbrous scar adjacent to tumour; 1H,
apical bulia; 11, uninvolved lung parenchyma superior to tumour; 1], involved
lung parenchyma inferior to tumour.]

, MICROSCOPY
Sections show moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma measuring 25mm
in maximum dimension. There is extensive tumour necrosis with associated foamy
macrophages and cholesterol clefts. The periphery of the carcinoma has a
growth pattern ﬁlling air spaces. Extensive vascular invasion is present at
the periphery of the carcinoma together with focal perlvascula-r lymphatic space
invasion. There is mild fibroelastotic scarring of the visceral pleura
adjacent to the tumour but no evidence of pleural invasion by the carcinoma.
The carcinoma isclear of- the bronchial resection margin which shows focal
squamous. metaplasia and mild squamous dysplasia. The area of yellow
discoloration adjacent to the carcinoma shows focal collapse, interstitial
ﬁbrosis and localised obstructive changes including dilated air spaces
containing numerous macrophages and proteinaceous fluid. Within this region
there is a mildly dilated bronchiole showing focal moderate squamous dyspiasia.
There is also an area of dense ﬁbrous scarring adjacent to the carcinoma. The
non-neoplastic lung shows scattered mixed dust macules and aggregates of
pigmented airspace macrophages. Apical bulious emphysema is present and this is
associated with subpleurai ﬁbrosis and prominent chronic inflammation together
with focal ﬁbrous obliteration of the pleural space and a small amount of

histiocytosis and mild carbon pigment deposition but no evidence of malignancy.
