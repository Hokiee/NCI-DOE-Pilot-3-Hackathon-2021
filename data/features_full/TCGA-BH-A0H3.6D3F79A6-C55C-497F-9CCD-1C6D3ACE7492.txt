A. INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA WITH IUBULARAND INVASIVECRIBRIFORMfEATURES.

W'FORMATIOWI, NUCLEAR PLEOMORPHISM 2, MITOTIC ACTIVITY 1,
TOTAL SCORE 4/9).
THE INVASIVE TUMOR MEASURES 1.6 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION.
DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), NUCLEAR GRADE 2, CRIBRIFORM AND MICROPAPILLARY TYPES.
DCIS CONSTITUTES 20% OF THE TOTAL TUMOR MASS AND IS PRESENT ADMIXED AND ADJACENT To
THE INVASIVE COMPONENT.
NO LYMPHOVASCULAR SPACE INVASION IS NOTED.
RESECTION MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.
INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA IS PRESENT 3.0 MM FROM THE POSTERIOR (CLOSEST) MARGIN; ALL
OTHER MARGINS ARE GREATER THAN 0.5 CM AWAY FROM INVASIVE CARCINOMA.
DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU IS PRESENT 4.0 MM FROM THE POSTERIOR (CLOSEST) MARGIN; ALL
OTHER MARGINS ARE GREATER THAN 0.5 CM AWAY FROM IN SITU CARCINOMA.
ATYPICAL DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA.
SCLEROSING ADENOSIS AND FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES.
PREVIOUS BIOPSY SITE CHANGES.
THE INVASIVE TUMOR CELLS ARE POSITIVE FOR ESTROGEN RECEPTOR AND PROGESTERONE
RECEPTOR AND NEGATIVF FOR HER-ZINEU (FISH NONAMPLIFIED) AS PER PREVIOUS PATHOLOGY
