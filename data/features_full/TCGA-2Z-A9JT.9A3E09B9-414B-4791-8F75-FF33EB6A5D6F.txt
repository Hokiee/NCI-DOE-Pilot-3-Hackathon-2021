Gross Description

A. The specknen is received fresh for frozen section consult, labeled “deep margin right kidney."
The spep'pn en consists of on unoriented, red-tan; rubbery fragment of renal tissue, 0.6 x 0.5 x 9.3 cm.
The specimen is submitted entirely intact in FSM.

The specimen is not submitted ﬁor Tissue Procurement Laboratory.

3. The specimen is received ireshv Iabeled “right partial nephrectomy‘ and consists of an
unoriented, encapsulated, rubbay nodule“ T5 grams, 2.9 x 2.3 x. 2.2 cm. The sapsule is intact with
focal adhesions, and inked black. Sectiomdj the cut surfaces exhibit darli tars, smooth, congested

not identified. The tissue extends to the capsule, however: does notextend through. Necrosis up to
10% is noted with focal hemorrhage. Representative sections are submitted in 31-84.

The specimen is submitted to Tissue Procurement Laboratory, as reflected in cassette 84.
