Gross Description

A. Specimen A is reoeived fresh, labeled “tight kidney" and consists of a kidney with moderate
oerinephric soft tissue, 462.3 g. 16.5 x 9.8 x 6.7 cm overall dimension. The adrenal gland is non—intact
and ragged, 3 x t5 x t cm. The kidney (12.5 x65 1:. 4.5 cm} is firm and inked black. The interior pole
exhibits an exophytir: encapsulated nodule of the lateral aspect 3.1 .x 2.6 x 2.5 cm. Sectioned. the
nodule is pole tan, solid and smooth. wrth scant necrosis (5%) and focal hemorrhage. The nodule
grossly originates from the parenchyma, and does not penetrate the renal capsule or pennephric tat.
The nodule does not involve the renal pelvis. mines or pelvic fat The renal artery, vein and ureter are
not affected by the nodule. Located in the superior and middle pole are several intraparenchymal
Cysts, containing clear serous ﬂuid, 1 to 2.5 cm diameter. The oyst lining is smooth with no papillary
exnreacences noted. The papillae are blunted and the cortex. is 8 mm thick. An external segment of
ureter is noted (5.4 cm length It 3 mm diameter} and is probe patent ‘el'he renal vein is firm with
moderate atherosclerotlc changes and appears 404093 occluded. A 5 mm orange—yellow ovoid
calculus is identiﬁed in the renal pelvis No constriction: or dilation of the calices is identified.
Representative sections including all margins are submitted In ﬁll-Ail} as labeled.
