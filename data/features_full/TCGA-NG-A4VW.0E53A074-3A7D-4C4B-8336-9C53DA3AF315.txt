INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:
FSA. Uterus, tubes, and ovaries:

- Poorly differentiated endometrioid carcinoma invading about 30% of myometrial thickness in one
section examined by Dr.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. UTERUS, TUBES AND OVARIES:
Received fresh is a uterus with attached tubes and ovaries which weighs 1095 grams and measures 8
x 5.5 x 4.5 cm. The ectocervix measures 3 x 3 cm with a white tan glistening mucosa. There is an
anterior sub-serosal nodule that measures 2 x 2 x 1.5 cm. The remainder of the serosa is
unremarkable. The uterus is opened laterally to reveal a maximal myometrial thickness of 1.5 cm.
There is a tan-brown friable polypoid mass arising in the fundus which ﬁlls the entire endometrial cavity
measuring, 4.6 x 3.2 x 3.0 cm. Sectioning through the myometrium reveals 30-40% invasion with focal
areas suspicious for greater than 50% invasion grossly. The endometrial cavity measures 4 x 3.5 cm.
Other than the large polypoid mass there are implants on the endometrial surface that range in size
from 0.5 cm. in maximum dimension up to 1.5 cm. in maximum dimension. These are scattered over

the endometrial surface. The right ovary measures 2.7 x 1.2 x 1 cm and the right fallopian tube
measures 8.6 x 0.3 cm in diameter. They are grossly unremarkable. The left ovary measures 2.5 x 1.5
x 1 cm and the left fallopian tube measures 7 x 0.4 cm in diameter. They are also grossly
unremarkable. The parametrium is inked in black. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

A1: frozen section to show myometnal invasion

A2: anterior cervix

A3: posterior cervix

A4: anterior lower uterine segment

A5: posterior lower uterine segment

A6: anterior fundal area with tumor to demonstrate invasion

A7-A8: anterior endomyometrium with subserosal nodule

A9: posterior endomyometrium

A10-A11: endometrium demonstrating surface implants

A12: representative section of tumor

A13: representative sections of right fallopian tube

A14: representative sections of right ovary

A15: representative sections of left fallopian tube

A16: representative sections of left ovary

A17: right parametrium

A18: left parametrium

B. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES:
Received in formalin are multiple fragments of ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 6.3 x 4.5 x 1.5 cm. Seven
possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed, the largest measures 4.5 x 2.3 x 0.5 cm. This large node is cut in
half and than bisected and submitted in toto in B1-B4. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

B1-B4: largest lymph node cut in half and bisected, submitted in toto

35-86: lymph node bisected and submitted in toto

B7: lymph node bisected and submitted in toto

B8: lymph node bisected and submitted in toto

89: one possible lymph node

B10: two possible lymph nodes
C. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES:
Received in formalin are multiple fragments of ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 6.5 x 3 x 0.9 cm. in
aggregate. Nine possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging in size from 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 to 0.9 x 0.6 x
0.5 cm. These are submitted in toto as follows:

01-02: large lymph node bisected

03: lymph node bisected and submitted in toto

C4: lymph node bisected and submitted in toto

CS: two possible lymph nodes

CB: one lymph node bisected and submitted in toto

C7: one lymph node bisected and submitted in toto

C8: one lymph node bisected and submitted in toto

09: one lymph node bisected and submitted in toto
D. PERlAORTlC LYMPH NODES
Received in formalin are four fragments of ﬁbroadipose tissue ranging in size from 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.3 up to
2 x 1.5 x 1 cm. Four possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed. These are submitted in toto as follows:

D1: one possible lymph node

D2: one lymph node bisected and submitted in toto

03: two possible lymph nodes submitted in toto
E. OMENTUM:
Received in formalin is a segment of ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 23 x 7.5 x 2.5 cm. There are no
obvious nodules or tumor implants on the surface. The specimen is carefully sectioned to reveal no
lesions or masses. Representative sections are submitted in E1-E3 for microscopic examination.

COMMENT:
This predominately polypoid tumor is composed of a glandular component taking the form of
endometrioid carcinoma, which is intimately admixed with a mesenchymal component in many areas.
The malignant mesenchymal element has a myxoid and occasionally chondroid appearance. It is
positive for vimentin and negative for CK AE 1/3. A few small foci of tumor show staining for

synaptophysin and chromogranin A. Portions of this case were reviewed at departmental conference on
and there was agreement with assessment.
