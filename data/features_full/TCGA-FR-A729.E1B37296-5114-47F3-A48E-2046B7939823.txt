Gross Description:

A: The specimen was received labeled with the patient' 5 name
and measured 14 x 9 x 4 cm. There is a 5.5 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm tan-
white mass. Fresh tissue from this mass is taken by tissue
procurement. The fibrofatty specimen is serially sectioned and
then placed in Lymph node candidates are identified
and submitted as Al—lO with blocks Al and A2 contained
representative sections of the mass. Tissue remains in formalin.

B: The specimen was received labeled with the patient' s name

and measured 5.5 x 5 x 2 cm. The tissue is entirely submitted as
B1—8,

C: The specimen was received labeled with the patient' 3 name
and measured 4 x 4 x 2 cm. The tissUe is entirely submitted as
C1—6,

D: The specimen was received labeled with the patient' 5 name

and measured 6 x 3 x 1.5 cm. The tissue is entirely submitted as
D1-6,

E: The specimen was received labeled with the patient' 5 name
and measured 2.1 x 2 x 1.4 cm. The tissue is entirely submitted
as E1—3,

F: The specimen was received labeled with the patient' 8 name
and measured 3 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm. The tissue is entirely submitted
as F1—3, '

G: The specimen bears a long suture indicating lateral and a
short suture indicating superior and measures 32 x 31 x 10 mm.
Viewing the specimen with the short suture at the 12:00 position
and the long suture at the 3:00 position, the margin
encompassing the 12:00—3:00 quadrant is inked green, 3:00—6:00
quadrant is inked yellow, 6:00—9:00 quadrant is inked black, and
the 9:00—12:00 quadrant is inked orange. Central sections to
include the 12:00 and 6:00 margins are submitted as block 1 and
2. Perpendicular sections of the 12:00—3:00 margin are

submitted as block 3 and 4, 3:00-6:00 margin as block 5 and 6,
6:00-9:00 margin as block 7 and 8, and 9:00-12:00 margin as
block 9 and 10,

Light Microscopy:
Light microscopic examination is performed by Dr. 8100 and Melan

A are positive in block Al thereby supporting the diagnosis of
metastatic melanoma.
