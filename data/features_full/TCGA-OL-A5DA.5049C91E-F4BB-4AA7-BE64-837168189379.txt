Breast Pathologic Parameters

1. Invasive carcinoma:

A. Combined gross and microscopic measurement: 3.20m
B. Composite histologic (modiﬁed SBR) grade II

- Architecture: 3

- Nuclear grade: 2

- Mitotic count: 1

C. Associated ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): Absent

2. Excisional biopsy margins: Free of tumor

- Invasive carcinoma 1mm from superior (closest) margin (slide B14)
- Additional margins greater than 2mm away

3. Blood vessel and lymphatic invasion: Absent

4. Axillary lymph nodes: Negative for tumor

5. Special studies (see

- Expression of ER 1n 68% of invasive tumor nuclei

- Expression of PR 1n 66% of invasive tumor nuclei

— HerZ/neu antigen (FISH): Non-ampliﬁed (ratio: 1)

6. pTNM: pT2, NO(sn), MX.

Clinical History:
This patient is a -year-old female with a right breast mass. The patient
self-palpated a breast mass in the right upper outer quadrant in

was sent for diagnostic mammography and ultrasound which revealed a
worrisome mass approximately 2.5 cm in size. An ultrasound-guided core biopsy
and clip placement was done. This was read as 3invasive mammary carcinoma with
lobular features4 by The patient underwent a breast MRI on the

which demonstrated an irregularly shaped, posteriorly

positioned mass at 11 o'clock in the right breast measuring 4.5 x 2.5 cm. The

lett breast and bilateral axillae were normal. The patient undergoes right
sentinel lymph node biopsy and right breast partial mastectomy with needle
localization.

Comment
The tumor cells are negative for E-cadherin consistent with a lobular phenotype.
AE 1/AE3 stain is negative on the sentinel node.

Specimens Received:
A: Right axillary sentinel lymph node
B: Right Breast Partial Mastectomy

Gross Description:
The specimen is received in two containers each labeled with the patient's name
and medical record number.

A. Part A is additionally designated 31 right axillary sentinel node #14.

Received fresh for frozen diagnosis is a 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm lymph node which is

bisected and entirely frozen and read as 3no evidence of metastatic tumor4 per
The remnant of frozen tissue is entirely submitted in cassette A1 FS.

B. Part B is additionally designated 32. right breast partial mastectomy4.
Received fresh on an AccuGrid with accompanying radiograph is a 185.5 gm partial
mastectomy specimen. The specimen bears two needle localization wires and a
double long stitch as well as double short stitch for orientation. The overall
measurements are as follows: superior to inferior 9.8 cm, medial to lateral 9.5
cm, anterior to posterior 3.7 cm. The requisition designates the double long
stitch as lateral margin and short stitch as superior margin. The accompanying
radiograph demonstrates an irregularly shaped stellate mass within the partial
mastectomy specimen overlying quadrant C2, C3, D3 and D2. There is a needle
localization wire which enters at A3 and terminates at E1. There is a second
needle localization wire which enters A5 and terminates at E4. The mass is in
between these two wires. Thereis a single clip in quadrant D2.

The specimen is inked as follows: anterior=black, posterior=red, lateral=violet,
medial=yellow, superior=blue and inferior=green. The specimen is serially
sectioned from lateral to medial into nine slices to demonstrate an irregularly
shaped, ﬁrm, white-tan mass present in slices #4 through #8. Needle
localization wires terminate in slices #3 and #8. The clip is not identiﬁed.

The dimensions of the mass are 2.8 x 2.4 x 1.5 cm. The mass is present 0.2 cm
from the anterior margin, 2.7 cm from the inferior margin, 1.6 cm from the
superior margin, and greater than 2 cm from both lateral and medial margins.
The remainder of the specimen demonstrates grossly unremarkable breast
parenchyma consisting of lobular, soft, yellow-tan tissue with intervening white
ﬁbrous septa. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

B1,B2: lateral margin, serially sectioned, entirely submitted

B3,B4: medial margin, serially sectioned, entirely submitted

BS: closest approach of mass to anterior margin, slice #5

B6: closest approach to superior margin, slice #6

B7: closest approach of mass to inferior margin, slice #6

BS: mass, representative section slice #6

B9: additional representative section of mass, slice #7

810: representative section of tissue at termination of localization wire,
slice #3 -

Bl l,B12: tissue at needle localization wire termination, slice #8

Bl3,Bl4: representative sections of nodular tan-white breast parenchyma,
slice #9

B15316: representative sections of nodular tan-white breast parenchyma,
slice #10

817: representative section of unremarkable breast parenchyma, slice #8
Bl 8: representative section of unremarkable breast parenchyma, slice #12

lntraoperative Consult Diagnosis:

AlF S. Right axillary sentinel lymph node: No evidence of metastatic tumor.
