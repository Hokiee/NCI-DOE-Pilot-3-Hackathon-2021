Diagnosis

1. Predominantly poorly differentiated, bilateral adenocarcinoma of the prostate, limited to the
organ. Gleason 4+5:9; tertiary grade 3 (Gleason 5: 30%, Gieason 4: 50%). Maximum tumor
diameter 4.0 cm. Multifocal extraprostatio tumor growth in the left anterior, left lateral and left
basal regions. Multifocal tumor involvement of perinenral sheaths. Multifocal tumor inﬁltration
of the surgical preparation margin in the anterior region on both sides and the right lateral region
(max. contact line in the left anterior region: ll mm); Gleason 5 portions here immediately at the
margin.

 

Additional foci of a prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (high-grade PIN) and signs of
myoglandular prostatic hyperplasia. Urothelium of prostatic urethra without dysplasia. Tumor-
free, regular seminal vesicles and seminal ducts.

2. Four tumor—free lymph nodes.
3. Two tumor-free lymph nodes.

Tumor classiﬁcation
p’IBa, Gleason 4+5=9, teltiary grade 3 (Gleason 4 = 50%, Gleason 4 [sic] = 30%), pN0 (0/6), Rl.

Remark
In contrast to the prior punch biopsies, a Gleason 5 portion of 30% is now identifiable in the
main preparation.

Additional immunohistochemical studies were initiated to clarify the vascular status. The results
will be presented in a follow—up report.

Follow-up report

Microscopy

(immunohistochemistry: CD31, D2—40)

In the innnunohistochemieal studies on two representative tumor blocks, there is no evidence to
suggest the presence of tumorous vessel invasion.

The final tumor classification is thus as follows:
p'l‘33. Gleason 4+5=9 (Gleason 4: 50%, Gleason 4: 30%), pN0 (0/3), L0, V0, RI.
