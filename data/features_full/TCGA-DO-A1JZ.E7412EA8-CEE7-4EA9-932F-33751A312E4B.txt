Gross Anatomic Description

(Dictated by Dr. ' on : Reviewed by Dr.

Specimen received in one container.

Specimen: Designated “total thyroidectomy (single short superior - left lobe; double short superior - right lobe; single long -
left lateral)" is received fresh for Tumor Bank labeled with the patient‘s name, and "total thyroid". Specimen consists of a
total thyroidectomy specimen weighing 44 grams with a left lobe measuring 5.3 x 4.8 x 2.5 cm, a right lobe measuring 4.5 x
2.5 x 1.3 cm connected by an isthmus measuring 1.0 x 0.4 x 0.1 cm. Normal tissue from right upper lobe is submitted for
Tumor Bank and tumor specimen from left lower lobe is submitted for Tumor Bank. No frozen sections are performed. The
external surface is smooth. On the left lower lobe, there is a protruding nodularity measuring 3.3 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm. On cut
surface, the nodularity is encapsulated and well circumscribed with a homogeneous white/tan parenchyma. The right lobe of
the thyroid comprises predominantly of gelatinous reddish-brown parenchyma within multiple ill-defined nodules. The mass is
well encapsulated and abuts the inked surface but does not extend beyond the capsule. The uninvolved left thyroid
parenchyma is beefy red and unremarkable. Photographs are taken.

lnking code: Black — anterior left; Green — anterior right; Blue — entire posterior specimen.

Section code: A1 — superior pole, left thyroid; A2 — superior extent of nodule; A3-A4 — full thickness section, superior portion of
nodule from medial to lateral; A5-A7 — full thickness slice of mass at area of maximum diameter; A8—A12 — inferior pole, left
thyroid, sections perpendicular to medial slices; A13 ~ isthmus; A14 — superior pole, right lobe; A15 — midportion of right
