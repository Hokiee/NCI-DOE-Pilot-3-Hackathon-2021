SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
Patient: Specimen #:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued):

— TUMOR PRESENT <0.l CM (0.9 MM) FROM THE DESIGNATED "NEW TRUE MARGIN"
(C8), SEE COMMENT.

D. BREAST, LEFT (ADDITIONAL DEEP MARGIN), EXCISION:
- BENIGN BREAST TISSUE
- NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.

COMMENT:

PART A.

The tumor exhibits a lobular growth pattern, which is confirmed by an
E-cadherin immunohistochemical stain. However, focal tubular formation is
noted in scattered portions of tumor. Based on morphologic and
immunohistochemical features, the tumor type is interpreted as being
infiltrative lobular carcinoma with focal ductal differentiation.

Assessment of the greatest dimension of tumor size is hindered by

the multifocal nature of the infiltrating lobular carcinoma. The greatest
dimension of 2.3 CM is based on the combination of microscopic and
radiographic findings in this case.

PART C.

The tumor exhibits features that are similar to those features seen in the
tumor in Part A.

This case received intradepartmental consultation.

Previous biopsy material was reviewed in conjunction with this
case.

POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
none provided

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A: Received fresh, labeled with the patient’s name , -J- . and
designated "Left Breast Lumpectomy" is a breast lumpectomy specimen with
accompanying radiograph, measuring 6.0 cm from superior to inferior, 3.5
cm from medial to lateral, and 2.0 cm from anterior to posterior. A 4.0 x
0.6 cm lightly pigmented, loosely adherent skin ellipse is noted on the
superficial surface. The specimen is inked as follows: superior - blue;
inferior - green; medial - red; lateral - yellow; anterior — orange;
posterior — black. Serial sectioning reveals a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm poorly
defined mass. The cut surface is tan-white, firm and focally congested
with an embedded metallic clip. The mass is located 0.5 cm from the
anterior, medial, and posterior margins, and 0.7 cm from the lateral
margin. The remainder of\the specimen is composed of markedly dense
tan—white fibrous tissue admixed with a minimal amount of adipose tissue.
Entirely submitted.

Cassette Summary:
Al-anterior—lateral margin with skin
A2-posterior—medial margin
A3—posterior-lateral margin
A4—posterior margin
AS-mass
A6-mass in relation to deep margin
A7 through A16 — remaining serial sections from superior to inferior, with
matched plane sections in Alo-All and A12—A13. J» A

B: Received fresh, labeled with the patient’s name - and
designated "Sentinel Node #1" is a single 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm pink—tan
lymph node. The specimen is trisected and submitted in cassettes Bl-BZ.
‘ . 3 A matched section of B1 is submitted in for CBCP protocol.

C: Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, .

_ and designated "Additional Superior Margin" is an irregular
fragment of pale yellow adipose tissue measuring 5.2 x 2.9 x 1.0 cm in
overall dimensions. Several metallic staples are present embedded on one
surface of the specimen; this surface is designated as the new true
margin. This surface will be inked orange and the opposing surface will
be inked blue. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a dense
tan-white fibrous cut surface. Residual tumor is not grossly identified.
The specimen is entirely and sequentially submitted in eight cassettes.

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
Patient: Specimen #: ‘3
GROSS DESCRIPTION (continued):

and designated "Additional Deep Margin“ is an irregular fragment
or tan—yellow lobulated adipose tissue measuring 2.3 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm in
overall dimensions. Several metallic staples are identified embedded in
one surface of the specimen; this surface is identified as the true new
margin. This surface is inked orange, and the opposing surface is inked
blue. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a homogeneous
tan—yellow cut surface without evidence of residual tumor. The specimen
is entirely and sequentially submitted in three cassettes. . 1
