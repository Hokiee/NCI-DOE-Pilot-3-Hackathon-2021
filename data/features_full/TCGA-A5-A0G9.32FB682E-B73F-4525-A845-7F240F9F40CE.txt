DIAGNOSIS:

l. UTERUS, FALLOPIAN TUBES, AND OVARIES, TOTAL ABDOMINAL
HYSTERECTOMY AND UNILATERAL SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY:
- Primary uterine adenocarcinoma, predominantly endometrioid-
-type with associated secretory, eosinophilic and squamoid
changes, focal mucinous type, and possible minor componenthof
tumor with clear cell features, FIGO grade III, nuclear «
grade md§E3377?‘”faaaII§”§ (see comment)
Uterine fundus, anterior uterine corpus and posterior
uterine corpus are extensively involved by tumor

- Myometrial invasion by carcinoma is present and
involves greater than 50% (about 65—70%) of the
uterine wall thickness in the deepest area of invasion

- Carcinoma extends into the posterior lower uterine
segment; invasion by tumor in the posterior uterine
segment is superficial

— Lymphovascular invasion by carcinoma is present

- Adenomyosis with and without secondary involvement by
carcinoma

— No extension of carcinoma into endocervix or
ectocervix

- No involvement of parametrial soft tissues by
carcinoma identified

— Non—neoplastic endometrium is scant and ranges from
inactive/weakly proliferative to hyperplastic; foci of
simple and complex hyperplasia with atypia are present

- Five uterine leiomyomas, third smallest of which is
present in the anterior lower uterine segment, second
largest of which shows extensive hyalinization and
calcifications and largest of which also shows extensive
hyalinization

- Two benign tiny posterior endocervical polyps with
associated inflammatory changes and stromal hyalinization

— Cervix also shows acute and chronic inflammation, focal
epithelial denudation, atrophic squamous changes,
squamous metaplasia, reactive epithelial changes, and
nabothian cysts

Labeled with the patient 5 name, designated "uterus, cervix",

received fresh in the Operating Room for intraoperative gross
consultation and subsequently fixed in formalin is an 84 gram total
hysterectomy specimen. The uterus measures about 7.4 cm from the
fundus to the ectocervix, 3.8 cm from cornu to cornu, and up to 4.1
cm from the anterior surface to the posterior surface. The uterine
serosa is tan—red, and generally smooth except for procedure—related
artifact. Attached to the uterus, there is a small amount of pink-
tan firm parametrial soft tissue. The parametrial soft tissues,
bilaterally, appears grossly free of tumor. The cervix is about 2.8
cm long and has a maximum diameter of 1.9 cm in the ectocervical
region. The mucosa lining the ectocervix is tan and smooth. The
external cervical os is patent and about 0.9 cm in diameter. The
uterus was previously incised on both sides at the time of the
intraoperative consult. The cervical transformation zone is
distinct. The endocervical canal is about 2.1 cm long and lined for

the most part by slightly rugose tan mucosa. In the posterior
endocervix, there are two tiny endocervical polyps, measuring about
0.2 and 0.3 cm in maximum dimension, each is composed of semi-soft
tan—white tissue. Cut sections of the cervix reveal multiple mucus-
filled cysts ranging from about 0.1 to 0.3 cm in diameter. The
cervix appears grossly free of tumor. The endometrial cavity is
about 5.0 cm long and up to 3.0 cm in diameter. The endometrial
cavity is largely occupied by an exophytic polypoid pale tan tumor
mass that has a friable and focally papillated surface. The tumor
mass measures about 4.2 x 3.0 cm in surface area and has a maximum
thickness of about 1.6 cm, including exophytic and endophytic
components. extensively involves the uterine fundus, anterior
uterine corpus, posterior uterine corpus, and extends into the
posterior lower uterine segment. Upon sectioning the uterus,
invasive carcinoma is seen involving the fundus, posterior uterine
corpus and anterior uterine corpus. In the posterior fundus

and posterior corpus, greater than 50% of the wall thickness is
involved by tumor. Tumor in the anterior uterus and in the posterior
lower uterine segment is more superficially invasive (involves less
than 50% of the wall thickness). Within the uterus, mostly in the
lower anterior corpus and lower uterine segment, there is a small
amount of uninvolved tan endometrium that has a maximum thickness of
less than 0.1 cm. Within the uterus, there are five sharply
circumscribed intramural leiomyomas that measure about 0.3, 0.5,
0.6, 1.2 and 1.5 cm in maximum dimensions. The smallest and second
smallest leiomyomas are in the fundus. The third smallest
leiomyoma is located in the anterior lower uterine segment. The
largest and second largest leiomyomas are located in the posterior
uterine corpus. The largest and second largest leiomyomas have firm
white cut surfaces without grossly evident areas of hemorrhage

or necrosis. The second largest leiomyoma is partially calcified.
The smallest and second smallest leiomyomas have firm tan—white
whorled cut surfaces without grossly evident areas of hemorrhage or
necrosis. The uninvolved myometrium is semi~firm, tan-pink, up

to 1.8 cm in thickness and shows trabeculations and focal minute
cystic spaces suggestive of adenomyosis.

2: RIGHT ADNEXA

Labeled with the patient's name, designated "right adnexa", received
fresh in the Operating Room and subsequently fixed in formalin, is a
salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The ovary is atrophic, about 2.6 x
1.1 x 0.1 cm and has a generally smooth, tan-yellow serosal surface.
Attached to the ovary, there is a translucent thin—walled
paraovarian cyst that contains clear pale yellow fluid. The

paraovarian Cyst measures about 0.7 cm in maximum dimension. Cut
surfaces of the ovary reveal relatively abundant yellow—tan cortical
stroma and several corpora albicantia, but no gross evidence of
metastatic tumor. The fallopian tube has fimbria at one end, is 9.2
cm long, ranges from 0.3 to 0.5 cm in diameter, has a smooth, tan-
red serosal surface, and a patent lumen, up to 0.1 cm in diameter.

Labeled with the patient's name, designated "left adnexa" and
received in formalin is a salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The ovary
is atrophic, about 2.3 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm and has a yellow-tan undulated
serosal surface. Attached to the ovary, there is a thin—walled
translucent unilocular paraovarian cyst that contains clear pale
yellow fluid and measures about 0.4 cm in maximum dimension. Cut
surfaces of the ovary reveal abundant yellow—tan cortical stroma and
a few corpora albicantia, but no gross evidence of metastatic tumor.
The adjacent fallopian tube has fimbria at one end, is 8.1 cm long,
and ranges from 0.3 to 0.4 cm in diameter. The serosal surface of
the fallopian tube is pink—tan and smooth. The fallopian tube has a
patent lumen, up to 0.1 cm in diameter and appears grossly free of
metastatic tumor.
