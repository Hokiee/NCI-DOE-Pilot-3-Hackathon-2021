Gross:

Right adrenal tumor with the encapsulated tumor with total dimensions 75x60x30, weight 96
g, with soft consistency and with central white scar. In the peripheral part, non-tumoral
adrenal with pressure atrophy with a cortea width less than 1 mm.

Micro:

Solidly and alveolarly and diffusely shaped pheochromocytoma with focal hemorrhages
consisting polygonal and profoundly atrophied cells and focaly spindle-formed cells. In some
vessels in tumor periphery, a piece of freely laying tissue was found — probably a result of the
procurement of soft tumor without previous ﬁxation, this finding does not fulﬁll criteria of
angioinvasion.

Immunohistochemistry:

Staining for $100 protein — sporadic sustentacular cells, large parts of the tumor are negative.
MIB 1 <2% positive cells.

Large nests or diffuse growth (>10% of tumor volume) 2 IC D 0'5
