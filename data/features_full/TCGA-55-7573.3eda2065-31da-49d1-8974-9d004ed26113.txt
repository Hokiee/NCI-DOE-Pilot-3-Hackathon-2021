COMMENTS:

The patient's history of prior renal cell carcinoma is noted. There is. however, no material identiﬁed in our ﬁles for review and comparison. Accordingly,
a limited series of immunohistochemical stains is performed on a representative block of a malignancy. Sections are examined along with appropriately
staining positive and negative controls, with the following results:

CK7- Positive.

CKZO - Negative.

1TH- Positive.

RCC— Negative.

Histologically, the malignancy does not resemble a typical renal cell carcinoma, and the staining pattern above essentially excludes the possibility of a
metastasis from the kidney. and is typical of a primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

The malignancy grossly approaches the stapled parenchymal surgical margin to within less than 0.1 cm. Following removal of the staple line. the inked
margin in this site is involved by malignancy. it is noted. however, that the nature of the stapling procedure itself precludes sampling of the true ﬁnal

surgical margin. Clinical correlation is suggested.
