interpreted by:

A. Received fresh labeled with the patient’s name and “renal mass" is a 5.5 x 4.5 x 4.2 cm partial nephrectomy specimen. The
margin is designated by a suture. The margin is inked black and the capsule is inked blue. The specimen is serially sectioned to
reveal a 5.5 x 4.5 x 3.9 cm encapsulated yellow gold mass that is adjacent to the margin but not extending through the margin
grossly. The mass is also adjacent to the blue capsule. The uninvolved kidney is tan-brown, pale and unremarkable. A
representative section of the mass to the margin is submitted in cassette A1 F8 for frozen and permanent sections. Additional
representative sections are submitted in cassettes A2—A7.

B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient’s name and "peritumor fat" are multiple tan—pink irregular unoriented tissue
fragments. No discrete mass is identified grossly. The specimen is submitted entirely in cassettes B1-B3.
