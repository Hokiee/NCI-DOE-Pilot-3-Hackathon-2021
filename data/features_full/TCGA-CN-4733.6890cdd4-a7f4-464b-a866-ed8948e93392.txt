GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen ls received in eight parts.

Part 1 is received fresh iabeled with the patient's name. Initials- medical record number and labeled "left longtie - stitch
anterior." The specimen consists of a portion of tongue which In totat measures 3.2 (anterior to posterior. 3.5 cm (medial to lateral)
x 2.8 cm (superior to inferior i dorsnrn to ventrum).

There is a mucosal lesion noted with a white-tan ring In the periphery and central roughened brown and slightly tan and roughened
muoosat area, which measures 1.9 cm fro anterior to posterior, 1.7 cm from medial to lateral, 0.6 cm deep into the mLIscle upon
cross—sectioning. The lesion comes to wit tin 0.3 cm of the posterior mucosal specimen margin (not this mar in}, 0.3 c from the
anterior specimen margin (not true margin) and 1.5 cm from the lateral margin (not two margin), 02 cm from a media specimen
margin (not true margin}.

Note: Tumor and normal tissue are backed for Head and Neck SPORE.

The specimen is serially sectioned Into 8 slices from anterior to posterior and sections are submitted as follows:

Part 2 Is received fresh labeled with the patient‘s name initiais ‘ medical record number and iabeled "deep margin. " The
specimen consists of a piece of ten tissue measuring 1. 3 x I. 3 x 0.3 cm which Is evaluated intraoperatlvely by frozen section and
the remainder of which is submitted In cassette 2AFS.

Part 3 is received fresh labeled with the patients name, initiais- medical record number and Is labeled “anterior margin.” The
specimen consists of a tan piece of tissue with mucosa measuring 1.8 x G 3 x 0.3 cm and evaluated intraoperatively, the remainder
of which Is entirely submitted In cassette 3AFS.

specimen consists of a tan piece of tissue measuring 0. 7 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm which‘ Is evaluated Intraoperaiively by frozen section and
the remainder of which' Is submitted' In cassette 5AFS.

Part 8 Is received fresh labeled with the patient's name initials- medical record number and Is labeled "posterior margin. "The
specimen consists of a tan piece of tissue measuring 1. 3 x D. 3 x O 3 cm which Is evaluated intraoperativety by frozen section the
remainder of which Is entirety submitted In cassette SAPS.

Part 7 Is received fresh. Iabeled with the patient's name. initials. - medical record number and is labeled “left neck, level 1A
and B". The specimen consists of two pieces of tissue, which consists of a submandlbuiar gland measuring 4.5 x 3.2 x 1.8 cm and
an additional piece of ﬁbroadlpose tissue measuring 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.4 cm. The specimen Is lotaliy submitted as follows:

7A ~ representative cross section of submandibular giand

YB a one lymph node, bisected

70 ~ one lymph node, bisected.

Part 8 Is received fresh, labeted with the patient's name initials '- medical record number and labeled "left neck level 2 and 4".
The specimen consists of a piece of fatty tissue of an apparent vascular groove and no InUscle attached measuring 9.0 x 8. 5 x I. 3
cm. which iS arbitrarily divided into three equivalent sections from superior to interior and submitted as iollows:
BA— 86 a superior (A— one lymph node B- C remainder of lymph nodes)
8E — 8E — representative lymph nodes from mid section

— 8d — I m 11 nodes dissected from interior section.
