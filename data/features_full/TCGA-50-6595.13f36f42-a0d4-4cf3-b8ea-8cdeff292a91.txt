Note:
KRAS codon 12113 mutations are found in approximately 10~3U% lung adenocarcinomas and associated with history of
smoking. The presence of KRAS mutation leads to resistanco to EGFR tarioted therapieo (1). EGFR exon 19 and 21

mutations are present in about 10% of-nd up to 40% in the opulatlon, common in —and

associated with the clinical response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors 2). These mutations are mutually exclusive and
their presance may have prognostic and/or therapeutic implications (3,4). Clinical studies ehow high EGFR gene copy
number by FISH analysis (amplification) to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical response, stable disease,

time to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced non-small celi lung‘ cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors. ‘

Approximately 3% of lung adenocarcinomae within the Asian population have an interstitial deletion and inversion in
chromosome 2p resulting in the EMLtl/ALK fusion gene (ALK+) which is sensitive to ALK inhibitors (5,6). The prevalence
of this abnormality in the Western population is still unknown. Detection of this abnormality is critical for identifying
patients eligible for therapies that target ALK enzymatic activity. EMM/ALK rearrangements are mutually exclusive with
KRAS and EGFR mutations.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

Summary Statement

The right upper lobectorny and superior sogmentectomy of the right lower lobe reveals a 2.4 cm poorly differentiated
mucin-producing adenocarcinoma of the right upper lobe, 2.4 cm in diameter, associated with angiolymphatio and
visceral pleural invasion with involvement of the right paratracheal lymph nodes, with all margins free. Pathologic stage:
T2 N2 MX.

PART 4'. LYMPH NODE, RIGHT PARATRACHEAL LYMPH NODE, BIOPSY -

EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION.

PART 5: LYMPH MODE. RIGHT" TRACHEOBRONCHIAL. ANGLE, BIOPSY -

FOUR (4) FRAGMENTS 0F LYMPH NODE WITH REACTIVE CHANGE. NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
COMMENT: .
The adenocarcinoma is an interesting one having both moderate and poorly differentiated areas, with the former
characterized by cells with abundant vacuolatod foamy, light eoainophilic cytoplasm surrounding pools of mucin. In
some areas, psammoma bodies are identified, and in atill other areas zones of solid growth are prominont. In several
areas, focal squamoua differentiation is seen, however, this comprises only a small percentage of the overall tumor
(<10%) and therefore, we have chosen not to classify thin as an adenosquamous carcinoma.
