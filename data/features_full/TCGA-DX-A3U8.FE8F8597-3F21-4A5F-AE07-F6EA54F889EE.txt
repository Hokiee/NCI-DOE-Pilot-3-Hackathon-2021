SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Patient:

 

Patient Address — —

Clinical Diagnosis a History:

Specimens Submitted:
1: Left spermatic cord with liposarcoma and left testis

DIAGNOSIS :
1. Left spermatic cord and left testis; radical orchiectomy:

— High grade leiomyosarcoma with spindle and epithelioid features
involving spermatic cord.

- Tumor is seen as two nodules, 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.0cm. and 3.5 x 2.8 x
1.5cm.

—Tumor wraps around spermatic cord and involves adipose tissue and
skeletal muscle.

- There is 15% gross necrosis.

- Mitoses: 20 mitoses per 50 high power fields.

- Vascular invasion is present.

- The spermatic cord margin is free of tumor. Tumor is seen within 1mm
of soft tissue margin 0! resection.

- unremarkable testis with preserved spermatogenesis.

- Skin with scar.

- One benign lymph node (0/1).

NOTE: Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumor is positive for
desmin, SMA and rare CD34 and MDMZ positive cells (nuclear staining). The
tumor is negative for myogenin. Even though rare positivity for CDK4 and
mum: is seen no obvious well-differentitated liposarccma component is seen.
A primary leiomyosarcoma is favored.

I ATTBST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDBS (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND A9PROVED
THIS REPORT.

1. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "left spermatic cord with
liposarcoma‘and left testis' and consists of a testis (5.0 x 3.0 x 2.2cm),
attached spermatic cord (13 x 1.3cm), adjacent soft tissue and ellipse of
skin (9.0 x 1.1cm) with a well-healed scar (7.2cm). The external surface is
inked black. On cut section, two discrete, well-circumscribed nodules with
similar cut surfaces are seen adjacent to the spermstic cord. These nodules
(T1, 4.5 x3.5 x 2.0cm. and T2, 2.8 x 3.5 x 1.5cm) have a fleshy, tan
consistency with central hemorrhage and approximately 15% central tumoral
necrosis. It appears to be 0.1cm from the closest inked surface.

The testis is unremarkable, and the cut section does not show any gross
abnormalities. There is a separate tan nodule within the adipose tissue, 0.8
x 0.6 x 0.5cm in dimension (?1ymph node).

The relationships to the margin are as follows: 3.8cm from the spermatic
cord margin; 0.1cm from the closest adipose (black-inked) surface.
Photographs and TPS are taken.

Summary of sections:

SCH - spermatic cord margin, en face

T1 - representative sections of nodule #1.

T2 - representative sections nodule #2

T12 - tissue between nodules #1 and #2

N nodule in adipose tissue

SCP - additional sections of spermatic cord (proximal)
SCD spermetic cord. distal

TE - unremarkable testis.

S skin with scar
