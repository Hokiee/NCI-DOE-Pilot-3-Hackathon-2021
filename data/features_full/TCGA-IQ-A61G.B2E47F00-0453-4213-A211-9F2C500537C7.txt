specimen is submitted in toto in one cassette for frozen section.

H. Received fresh labeled as "right posterior border of tongue" is a brown soft tissue fragment measuring 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.1 cm.
The specimen is submitted in toto in one cassette for frozen section.

I. Received fresh labeled as “middle deep tongue” is a brown soft tissue fragment (0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm). The specimen is
submitted in toto in one cassette for frozen section.

J. Received fresh labeled as "right lateral border of tongue" is one segment of tan brown soft tissue, measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x
0.1 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto in one cassette for frozen section.

K. Received in formalin labeled as "mandible bilateral neck dissection level 1-3” is an unoriented segment of mandible (8.0 x 7.3 x
3.6 cm) with attached fibromuscular tissue (12.0 x 9.4 x 2.0 cm consisting of an attached arbitrarily designated submandibular gland
(left) (3.2 x 3.0 x 4.0 cm) and arbitrarily designated submandibular gland (right) (3.8 x 1.5 x 3.2 cm). The floor of mouth measures
1.5 x 3.0 x 1.1 cm. The soft tissue of the exterior surface measures 14 x 3.5 cm in height. Both bone resection margins are
smooth with the arbitrarily designated left bone resection margin void of soft tissue for 0.7 cm and 0.6 cm on the right aspect. The
anterior soft tissue margin is inked black. The inferior margin is inked green and the floor of mouth is inked yellow. There is a well
circumscribed fungating red brown mass located at the floor of the mouth (5.3 x 1.2 cm). Sectioning of the anterior soft tissue

margin reveals a the tumor extending on the rig ht lateral aspect located 0.5 cm from the soft tissue resection margin, 0.5 cm from
the left soft tissue margin and 0.8 cm the inferior margin. On the posterior aspect the tumor is located 0.4 cm from the resection
margin and appears to grossly involve the salivary gland. On the left aspect of the neck dissection in arbitrarily designated
level 1 is a possible lymph node (3.0 cm in length x 1.4 cm in diameter and adjacent to the submandibular gland which grossly appears
uninvolved of tumor. An additional lymph node was found in level 1 measuring 1.8 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm. Located in arbitrarily
designated level II are two possible lymph nodes (2.1 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm and 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. Located in arbitrarily designated
level III are three possible lymph nodes, ranging from 1.1 to 0.5 x 0.3 cm to 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. Located on the right side is a
possible lymph node with a multilocular cut surface (3.0 cm in length x 1.6 cm in diameter adjacent to the submandibular
gland. Sectioning of arbitrarily designated level | reveals an additional lymph node (0.6 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm). Sectioning of
arbitrarily designated level 2 reveals three possible lymph nodes ranging from 1.5 x 0.9 x 0.6 cm to 0.5 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm and two

possible lymph nodes (1.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and 1.5 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm) in level 3. Representative sections are as follows:

L. Received in formalin labeled "left level 5 lymph node“ Is a yellow pink segment of fibroadipose tissue (4.7 x 1.8 x 1.1 cm).
No lymph nodes are grossly identified. The specimen is submitted in toto in seven cassettes.

M. Received in formalin labeled "right level 5 lymph node" is a pink yellow segment of fibroadipose tissue (8.0 x 1.7 x 0.8
cm). Sectioning reveals eleven possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm to 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm. All lymph nodes are
