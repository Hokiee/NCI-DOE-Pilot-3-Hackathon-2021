The material in Block A is an invasive carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma of the colon,
characterized here as a serrated adenocarcinoma of grade G2 with infiltration of the muscularis
pT2 with vascular infiltration L1, V1.

In the region of the mucosa, it also shows free mucosal margins with a regular mucosa,
submucosa and muscularis and regular fatty connective tissue in the direction of the central
ligature.

The material in Block D is additonally a polyp characterized as a serrated adenoma without
dysplasia (not a high-grade neoplasia), free lymph nodes with a marked resorptive
lymphadenitis, in relation to the macroscopically named adjacent node likewise a regular lymph
node and in relation to Block H the formation of a diverticulum, here typically in the sense of a
pseudodiverticulum with an eversion between the gaps in the muscle wall.

In relation to the the central resection margin: mature fatty connective tissue with dilated vessels
and, in relation to the lymph nodes, a chronic resorptive lymphadenitis.
