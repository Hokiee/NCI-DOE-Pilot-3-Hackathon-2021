Brain, right temporal lobe, excision: Negative for tumor.

  

TCGA - DB - 5275

Brain, right temporal tumor, excisions #1 and #2: Grade 3 (of 4) oligoastrocytoma (WHO, grade III).

FISH studies for 1p and 19q deletion will be performed and reported as an addendum.

ADDENDA:
1p and 19q FISH studies were performed on cells within parafÔ¨Ån sections from tumor. Two hybridizations were

performed: one with a 19q probe/control 19p pair and one with a 1p probelcontrol lq pair. The 19q and 1p probes
mapped to the regions that are commonly deleted in gliomas. The 19:21 to 19p probe ratio was 0.56. The 1p to lq
probe ratio was 1.02. For both probes, the normal ratio is approximately 1. Any ratio less than 0.80 is consistent
with deletion of the chromosomal region of interest.

 

The results are less than the normal range and suggest deletion of 19q. Approximately 90% of cells had 2 copies
of the 19q probe and 3-4 copies of the 19p probe, consistent with relative loss of 19q. In addition, approximately
80% of cells had 3-4 copies of the lp and lq probe. The results have been observed in other glioma specimens
with tumor aneuploidy (or polyploidy) and relative loss of 19q.

T test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by Laboratory Medicine and Pathology,
