lntraogeratlve Consultation:
An intraoperative non-microscopic consultation was obtained and interpreted as: 'Calied to pick up ‘uterus. 830. and

cervix.’ consisting oi a 107 gram uterus (9.2 x 6.2 x 3.3 cm) with attached bilateral fallopian tubes (right 5.7 x 0.7 x 0.6
cm; left 6 3 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm). and ovaries (right 3 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm; left 3 x 1.4 x 0.7 cm). The uterus Is blvaived to show a

pink-tan polypold exophytic mass occupying the entire endometrlal cavity (tumor measures 4.3 x 4.2 cm on the
posterior half. and 5.0 x 4.2 cm on the anterior half). The specimen is shown to the surgeon. Tissue is taken tor
and tumor bank Rest tor permanents, ' by ‘ ' ‘

Microsco lc Descri tion and Comment- -
The serous carcinoma in the left fallopian tube exhibits predominantly lntraiuminal growth, with muscular wall invasion
identified. While a second primary arisisng in the tube is in the dltlerentiai diagnosis, the consensus of the

“ is that this represents a metastasis from the endometrlai primary.

History:

The patient is a year old woman with no further history provided. Operative procedure: Exploratory laparotomy,
abdominal hysterectomy. and bilateral salpingo~oophorect0my

Gross Descri ﬂow

The specimens are received in eight lormalin-lilied containers. each labeled ' ' The first container is
labeled 'uterus, 380. and cervix.‘ it consists of a previously described 107 gram uterus measuring 9.2 cm from

lundus to cervix, 6.2 cm from comu to cornu. and 3.3 cm in the anterior/posterior plane. Both right and left ovaries and
fallopian tubes are present. The right ovary shows a tan-yellow, cerebrilorm external surface, and measures 3.0 x 1.5

x 0.8 cm. The right fallopian tube is grossly unremarkable and measures 5.7 cm in length and up to 0.7 cm In
