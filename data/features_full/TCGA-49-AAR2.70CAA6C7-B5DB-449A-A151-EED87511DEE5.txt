PART #5: FS: RIGHT MIDDLE & RIGHT LOWER LUBE
Resident Pathologist:

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:
Staff Pathologist:
Other Pathologists / PAS:
FS: Right middle and right lower lobes:

Stapled margin: Negative for tumor (3.0 mm from the tumor).
Bronchial margin: Negative for tumor.
Tumor: Adenocarcinoma (6.5 cm).

Dictated by:

The specimen is received fresh for frozen section labeled with the
patient's name, and is designated "right middle
and right lower lo es.“ T e specimen consists of a grossly
recognizable segment of lung weighing 538.2 gm and measuring 21.0 x
16.5 x 4.6 cm. Two lobes of lung are grossly recognizable and are the
middle and lower lobes respectively. There is a tumor palpable in
the lower lobe measuring approximately 6.5 x 5.0 x 4.5 cm. The
pleural surface is red—purple and smooth without noted areas of
puckering. The surface is also notable for two staple lines; a 6.0 cm
staple line in the middle lobe which is approximately 5.0 cm from the
nearest palpable mass and a 9.0 cm staple line adjacent to the tumor.
The staple lines are removed and the underlying lung parenchyma is
inked orange. The bronchial and vascular margins are shaved. The
bronchi are notable for white-tan tumor in the lumen of the bronchi.
The tumor appears grossly at the shaved bronchial margin. The lung is
serially sectioned to reveal a large multinodular and confluent
white-tan solid and partially necrotic tumor. This_1arge tumor
grossly involves the central and peripheral aspects of the lung lobe.
The tumor grossly approaches the pleural margin and is less than 1.0
mm grossly from the nearest pleural surface. The nearest staple line
is also closely involved by tumor and is grossly 3.0 mm from the
nearest stapled margin. One representative section of tumor adjacent
to the nearest staple margin and one representative section of the
bronchial margin are submitted for frozen section. Representative
sections of the tumor next to the nearest pleural surfacr and next to

submitted. The hilum reveals three possible lymph nodes ranging in

size from 0.3 to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. These lymph nodes are
entirely submitted.
