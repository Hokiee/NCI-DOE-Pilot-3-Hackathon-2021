Gross Description
Specimen A is received .fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, medical record number
and entitled "esophageal margin." It consists of a single piece of soft tissue that measure 2.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The

specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section evaluation with the remaining tissue being submitted in cassette
"A1FS." (Dictated by

Specimen B is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, medical record number
and entitled "left pharynx margin." It consists of a single piece of soft tissue that measure 2.8 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The

specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section evaluation with the remaining tissue being submitted in cassette
"BtFS." (Dictated by

Specimen C is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, medical record number
and entitled "right medial pharynx." It consists of a single piece of soft tissue that measure 2.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The
specimen is submitted entirely or frozen section evaluation with the remaining tissue being submitted in cassette
"C1FS." (Dictated by ‘ ‘

Specimen D is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient‘s name, medical record number
and entitled "right lateral pharynx." It consists of a small piece of soft tissue that measure 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The
specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section evaluation with the remaining tissue being submitted in cassette
"D1FS." (Dictated by ’

Specimen E is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, medical record number

Specimen F is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and entitled "total
laryngopharyngectcmy." It consists of a total laryngopharyngectomy specimen that measure 8.0 x7 .0 x 4.5 cm. It
consists of a portion of larynx that is 8.0 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm and a portion of hypopharynx and esophagus that is
approximately 7.5 cm in length and also possible left thyroid that is 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm in size and a possible right
thyroid that is 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm. The right side of the specimen is inked black and the left is inked blue. In the
hypopharynx there is a 4.8 x 3.1 x 3.0 cm white ﬁrm mass with areas of necrosis that involves the right aryepiglottic
fold, hypopharyngeal mucosa with some ulceration and circumferentially surrounds the thyroid cartilage but does not
appear to invade. Tumor appears to be 0.4 cm away from the mucosal lateral resection edge. 05 cm away from the
right medial superior resection edge and 2.0 cm away from the left pharyngeal edge and 3.0 cm away from the
inferior esophageal resection edge and 4.0 cm away from the tracheal resection margin. The cut edges of the
esophagus are grossly free of tumor. Tumor appears to abut the right lateral and posterior—lateral soft tissue
resection plans. It also appears to invade the right thyroid gland. It appears to be directly adjacent to the right upper
portion of the larynx. Representative sections of the tumor and normal is submitted for Tumor Bank. Section of the
tracheal resection margin was submitted en face for intraoperative consultation with the remaining tissue being

submitted in cassette “F1 F5." Gross photos are taken and are submitted as follows: Cassette summary is as follows.
