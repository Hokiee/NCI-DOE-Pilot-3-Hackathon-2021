Gross Description:

‘—
1)The specimen is received fresh labeled "tett kidney and proximal ureter" and consists of a kidney with attached ureter, {lanai
vessels and perinephric fat weighing 645 g in total. The kidney measures 15 .2 x a x 5.9 cm. The attached ureter measures 2.5
cm In length and 0.5 cm in diameter. The attached renai vein measures 3.1 cm in length and 1.2 cm in diameter. The renal
vessels and ureter margins are grossly unremarkable. An adrenal gland is not identiled. The kidney is inked black and bivalved to
reveal a welt—circumscribed mulli-tobulated yellow golden hemorrhagic mass measuring 7.6 x 6.0 x 5.5 cm . The mass is located
at the upper pole of the left the kidney and it appears to be abutting and confined within the renal capsule. The renal artery, vein
and ureters are not involved by the tumor. The mass invades the renal sinus fat, it is about 1.5 cm from the renal hilar fat. Tumor
grossly has 40% hemorrhage and 20 % necrosis. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a pink brown parenchyma.

with a well-deﬁned cortico-medullary junction. The cortex measures 0.8crn and the calyces appear normal. No lymph nodes are
identified in the perinephrto fat. Representative sections are submitted for TPS and for permanent sections. Photos are taken.

Summary of sections:

UVM - ureterai and vessel margins

T-- tumor

THF—- tumor with hilar fat

TSF -- tumor with sinus fat

TK -- tumor with adjacent kidney

RP —— renal pelvis representative sections

K -- representative sections kidney

ADD—additional section of ureteral margin and sinus fat

2). The specimen is received in formalin. labeled "paraortic lymph nodes" and consists of several red-ten lymph nodes ranging
from 1.5 to 4.3 cm in greatest dimension. which are entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:

BLN‘l .- bisected lymph node number one

BLN2 -- bisected lymph node number two

LLN—largest tymph node, sectioned and submitted in seven cassettes
SLN-trlsected lymph node

Summam of Sections:
Part 1: KIDNEY, LEFT AND PROXIMAL URETER: TOTAL NEPHRECTOMY
