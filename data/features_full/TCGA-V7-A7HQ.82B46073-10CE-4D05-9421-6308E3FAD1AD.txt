Final Pathologic Diagnosis
CORRECTED REPORT:

————-—————._____

A) SENTINEL NODE #1 (EXClSlON):
- One lymph node involved by metastatic carcinoma (111).

B) SENTINEL NODE #2 (EXCISION):

- One out of two lymph nodes, involved by metastatic carcinoma
(micrometastases) (1/2).

C) SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #3 (EXCISION):

- One out of two lymph nodes, involved by metastatic carcinoma
(micrometastases) (112).

D) RIGHT BREAST (MASTECTOMY):
- Invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 2.
- See synoptic report.

E) NEW INFERIOR MARGIN (EXCISION):
- Breast tissue with benign fibrocystic changes, including ductal

hyperplasia and apocrine metaplasia.
- Negative for malignancy.

NOTE: This corrected report is being issued due to a typographical error In the original report.
The initial diagnosis rendered by remains unchanged.

Diagnostic Comment

According to previous biopsy, 65% of tumor cells show moderate to strong nuclear staining
for estrogen receptors. 80% of tumor cells show nuclear staining show strong nuclear staining
for progesterone receptors. and Herz-neu gene Is not amplified by FISH (please see report

lntraoperative Diagnosis
TP A1: Touch prep positive for carcinoma. No frozen done.

TP 81: No touch preps done because first sentinel lymph node is positive.
TP C1: No touch preps done because first sentinel lymph node is positive.

irregular fragment of tissue measuring 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm. No lntraoperative procedure performed.

Entirely submitted for permanent sections.

Section code: B1 - entire specimen.

Specimegg Designated “sentinel node #3“ is received fresh for lntraoperative consultation on
labeled with the patients name and "sentinel node #3". Specimen consists of one yellowlian

fatty fragment of tissue measuring 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is bisected revealing one lymph

node. No lntraoperative procedure performed. Entirely submitted for permanent sections.
