 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS: “”9““? Date:
BREAST. LEFT. TOTAL MASTECTOMY (t 20.1 GRAMS) —

A. METAPLASTIC CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST, SPINDLE CELL TYPE, NOTTINGHAM GRADE II (TUBULE
FORMATION 3, NUCLEAR PLEOMORPHISM 3, MITOTIC ACTIVITY 1; TOTAL SCORE 719).

THE INVASIVE TUMOR MEASURES 3.8 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION.

N0 LYMPHOVASCULAR SPACE INVASION IS NOTED.

INKED MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA; HOWEVER, A FOCUS OF INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS LESS

THAN 1.0 MM (LESS THAN 0.1 CM) FROM THE ANTERIOR INKED MARGIN.

THE INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS LOCATED IN THE CENTRAL AREA.

THE NIPPLE DERMIS AND ADJACENT SKIN DERMIS. BUT NOT THE EPIDERMIS. ARE INVOLVED BY INVASIVE

CARCINOMA.

NIPPLE DUCTS WITH SQUAMOUS METAPLASIA.

PREVIOUS BIOPSY SITE CHANGES.

THE INVASIVE TUMOR CELLS ARE NEGATIVE FOR ESTROGEN RECEPTOR, WEAKLY POSITIVE FOR

PROCESTERONE RECEPTOR, AND NEGATIVE FOR HER~2, AS PER PREVIOUS PATHOLOGY REPORT-

(see comment).
J. NON-NEOPLASTIC BREAST WITH RADIAL SCARS.

COMMENT:
Due to the weakiy positive PR result on the core biopsy based on stains performed at , hormone
receptor immunohistochemistry will be repeated and an addendum wiIl follow.

positive and negative internal/external controls; the test for the presence of hormone receptor protein is performed by the
immunoperoxidase method according to the ASCO-CAP Guidelines. A positive Estrogen or Progesterone receptor tumor shows
nuclear immunostaining in greater than or equal to 1% of the tumor cells (Le and H-soore OH or higher). The ER and PR
Histologic Score (H~Score-. or H3) is calculated as the sum of intensity of staining times the proportion of cells staining and has a
dynamic range of 0 to 300. The semiquantitation immunostaining raw data used to calcuiate the H-score is also shown above in
the report. Generally. the H-score correlates to percentage of positive cells. According, to 7

, the correlation of mean H-score versus percent cells staining for ER is as follows: H~score of 251 (>75% cells staining); H-
score of 130 (51459:: ceIIs staining); H-soore of 42 (“360% cells staining): H—score of 4 (<1 0% ceils staining).
