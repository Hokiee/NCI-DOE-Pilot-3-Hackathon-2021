GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received unfixed labeled with the patient's name,
initials XXX

and "biopsy of right tonsil". The specimen consists of multiple tan—
gray, '

soft to firm fragments of tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm in
aggregate.

Following frozen section consult the specimens are entirely submitted
in

cassette labeled AFS.

Formalin exposure time: 33 hours

GROSSED BY:

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION:

A. SUFFICIENT FOR ANCILLARY STUDIES.
B. MALIGNANT.

C. SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA

MICROSCOPIC:

Microscopic examination substantiates the above diagnosis.

The following statement applies to all immunohistochemistry, Insitu
Hybridization Assays (ISH & FISH), Molecular Anatomic Pathology, and
Immunofluorescent Testing:

The testing was developed and its performance characteristics
determined by

the Department of Pathology, as required by
the CLIA

‘88 regulations. The testing has not been cleared or approved for the
specific use by the 0.8. Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA has
determined such approval is not necessary for clinical use. Tissue
fixation

ranges from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 84 hours.

This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments of 1988 ("CLIA") as qualified to perform high~complexity
clinical

testing. Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA, ASR's used in this
laboratory

have been established and verified for accuracy and precision.
Additional

information about this type of test is available upon request.
