Part A: Received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled "RIGHT NECK LEVEL 11
LYMPH NODE" and consists of two tan—pink

lymph nodes within fatty adipose tissue. The largest lymph node is 1.8 x

1.2 x 0.5 cm, the second lymph node is 1 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. The lymph nodes

are severally sectioned; the largest lymph node is tan-pink with a slight

central pale discoloration. The smaller lymph node is bi-valved, cut

surface is homogenous tan-pink. Touch preps are made. The largest lymph

node is submitted entirely for frozen section analysis in cassettes FSAl.

The remaining lymph node is entirely submitted in A2.

Part B: Received fresh labeled "RIGHT PHARYNGEAL SUPERIOR
MARGIN" is a 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm portion of tan-red tissue. One surface is
cauterized, and the opposite surface is not. The cauterized surface is
inked purple and specimen is submitted en face in a single cassette F SB.

Part C: Received fresh labeled "RIGHT INFERIOR CONSTRICTOR
MARGI " is a 2 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm portion of brown-red tissue. One surface is

cauterized, and the opposite surface is not. The cauterized surface is
inked purple and the specimen is submitted en face in a single cassette C.

Part D: Received fresh labeled "PRE EPIGLOTTIC FISSURE"

is a 1.2 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm portion of tan-red tissue. One side of the tissue
is cauterized, and the opposite side is not. The cauterized side is inked
purple, and the specimen is submitted en face in a single cassette C.

Part E: Received fresh labeled "RIGHT LATERAL ARYTENOID"

is a 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.2 cm portion of maroon-red tissue. One surface of the
tissue is cauterized, and the opposite side is not. The specimen is inked
blue and submitted en face and in toto in a single cassette E.

Part F: Received fresh labeled "RIGHT CRICOTHYROID

MUSCULATURE" is a 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm portion of tan-red tissue. One surface
of the tissue is cauterized, and the opposite side is not. The cauterized

surface is inked orange, and the specimen is submitted in toto en face in a
single cassette F.

Part G: Received in formalin labeled "RIGHT ARYTENOID

MARGIN" is a 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm portion of tan-red tissue. One surface of
the tissue is cauterized, and the opposite side is not. The cauterized
surface is inked red, and the specimen is submitted in toto, en face in a
single cassette G.

Part H. Received in formalin labeled "NECK DISSECTION RIGHT SIDE LEVEL
III," is an unoriented regular portion of ﬁbrofatty tissue measuring 4 x 3

x 0.5 cm. Vascular and muscular tissue is not identiﬁed. Multiple

possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm to 0.9 x

0.6 x 0.6 cm. The lymph nodes are submitted in toto in cassettes Hl four

possible whole nodes, cassette H2 ﬁve possible whole nodes, cassette H3

four possible whole nodes.

Part 1. Received in formalin labeled "RIGHT NECK DISSECTION LEVEL IIA," are
three irregular pieces of ﬁbrofatty tissue aggregating to 2.5 x 2.2 x 0.8

cm. Within the ﬁbrofatty tissue, four possible whole nodes are identiﬁed

ranging from 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm to 3 x 0.8 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is

submitted in toto in cassettes Il three possible whole nodes, cassette [2 is

one possible whole node.

Part I. Received in formalin labeled "RIGHT PHARYNGECTOMY," is a partial
pharyngectomy consisting of thyroid partial right strap muscles, portion of

the right thyroid cartilage, pharyngeal mucosa and a mass measuring
approximately 3.5 x 3.5 cm. The specimen measures 10 cm from superior to
inferior, 6 cm from left to right and 5.5 cm from anterior posterior. The

portion of thyroid cartilage measures 4.8 x 2.5 x 0.2 cm. The mass has 1.6

x 1 cm ulceration through the tan—pink mucosa. The mass is located 1.6 cm
from the thyroid cartilage, 0.2 cm from the pyriforrnis, 1.5 cm from the

right thyroid lobe and approximately 0.5 cm from the attached straps muscle.
The specimen is inked and serially sectioned to reveal the mass to be 5 x

3.5 x 2.6 cm. The mass is a tan-white homogenous cut surface it is located
0.2 cm from the superior aspect abuts the blue ink anteriorly, and 0.2 cm
from the nearest right (purple) margin. The mass extends inferiorly and

over the thyroid cartilage 0.7 cm, but not appear to involve the cartilage.

The thyroid lobe and anterior strap muscles are entirely uninvolved.

Serial sectioning to the thyroid reveals a tan parenchyma with no lesions.

Ink code:

Red superior
Blue anterior
Black posterior
Violet right

Representative sections are submitted as follows:
J 1. Superior aspect submitted en face

I 2. Mass to nearest anterior (blue) margin

J3 to J4. Mass to nearest right (purple) margin
J5. Mass to thyroid cartilage

J 6-] 8. Representative mass

J9. Representative thyroid

J10. Representative anterior strap muscles.

Part K. Received in formalin labeled "RIGHT SUBMANDIBULAR GLAND RIGHT
SUBMANDIBULAR GLAND," is a 10.3 gram, 4.3 x 3 x 0.6 cm tan-pink lobulated
gland. The ducts are identiﬁed. The cut surface displays golden-yellow

glandular tissue within interspersed ﬁbrous septae. There are no calculi or

masses identiﬁed. Representative sections are submitted in K1-K3.
