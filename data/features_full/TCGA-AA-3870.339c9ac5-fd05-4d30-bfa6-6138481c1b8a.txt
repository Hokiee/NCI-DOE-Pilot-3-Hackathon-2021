Diagnosis

1. Right hemicolectomy preparation with an ulcerated colon carcinoma characterized
histologically as a poorly differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma, located 1 cm
from Bauhin’s valve, encircling the intestinal wall at a length of 4.5 cm. Invasive
spreading of the tumor within all intestinal wall layers to the level of the subserosa
and to the mesocolic fatty tissue. Lymphangial branches in the area of the tumor
margin. The peritoneum of the mesocolon displavs small-nodular metastasis of the
colon carcinoma.

Colon mucous membrane otherwise with a tubulovillous adenoma with moderate
epithelial dysplasia (synonym: mild intraepithelial neoplasia). Ileum with evidence
of a chronic mechanical ileus. Appendix with postinﬂammatory fibrosis and fibroid
lumen obturation in the apical area. Oral and aboral resection margin as well as
greater omentum are tumor-free. Five of 23 local lymph nodes with extensive
metastases of the colon carcinoma, partly transcending the lymph node capsules. I_n
the mesenterium there is a clearly defined mesenchvmal spindle cell tumor,

measuring 0.5 cm.

2. Small nodular peritoneal metastasis of the colon carcinoma (roof of the bladder).

The tumor stage is therefore pT3 pN2 (5/23) L1, V0, M1 (- G3 R0
