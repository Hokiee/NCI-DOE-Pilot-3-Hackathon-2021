Gross Description:

2.The specimen is received fresh labelled "total thyroid, stitch marks right thyroid lobe" and consists of a thyroid weighing 12.5 g.
The right lobe measures 3.5x2x1.5 Cm , the left lobe measures 4x3x1 cm and the isthmus measures 1.2x1x0.6 Cm. The external
surface is covered by a thin ﬁbrous capsule. The posterior surface of the specimen is inked black. and the anterior is inked blue.
Sectioning reveals overall multlnodular thyroid tissue with one prominent nodule with white tan cut surface on the right lobe
measuring 1.5x1.2x1.0 cm. Sections through the remaining tissue reveal beefy red parenchyma. The remaining thyroid
parenchyma is red tan and beefy. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for TPS. The remaining tissue is serially
sectioned and representatively submitted.

Summary of sections:
N — nodule

RL - right lobe

LL — left lobe

iS - isthmus

3) The specimen is received in formalin labeled, "pretracheai tissue“, and consists of multiple pieces of red and tan soft tissue
measuring 0.9 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm in aggregate. Entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U—- undesignated

4) The specimen is received in formalin. labeled "right superior mediastinal tissue", and consists of two irregular fragments of
pink-tan soft tissue measuring 0.4 and 1.8 cm in greatest dimension. Submitted entirely.

Summary of sections:

5) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled ”left superior mediastinal tissue". and consists of an irregular fragment of pink-tan
soft tissue measuring 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. Entirely submitted.
