GROSSDESCHPHON

(A) TOTAL LARYNGECTOMY, BILATERAL LEVEL II, III, IV LYMPH NODE DISSECTION AND
LEFT THYROIDECTOMY — A total laryngectomy with attached bilateral neck lymph
node dissection measures 11.0 x 11.0 x 5.0 cm in toto. The attached left lobe
of thyroid is measuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. A tracheostomy is also present.

An ill—defined tan firm mass measuring 5.0 x 2.0 cm to the depth of 2.0
cm is present at left pyriform sinus with extension to left epi lottic fold.
The tumor invades into thyroid cartilage. The tumor is 0.4 cm rom the
closest left pharyngeal mucosa (additional margin from this side has been
additionally submitted (part C). The base of tongue is also submitted
separately (part B). The right pharyngeal mucosa is 1.0 cm from the tumor.

The thyroid, laryngeal mucosa, hyoid bone and thyroid are free of tumor.

A portion of the tumor and norma mucosa have been obtained for
additional studies.

SECTION CODE: A1—A7, lateral aspect of the tumor sectioned from superior
to inferior; A8, left soft tissue margin en face; A9, aryepiglottic fold; A10,
medial (right side) pharyngeal mucosa margin perpendicular (margin is inked in
blue); A11~A18. medial aspect of the tumor. Sectione from superior to
inferior; A19, tumor invading thyroid bone pending decalcification; A20, left
vocal cord; A21, right vocal cord; A22. tracheal margin; A23, tracheostomy;
A24, thyroid gland; A25—A29, left level II lymph nodes (A25 six lymph nodes,
A26, three lymph nodes, A27 two positive lymph nodes, A28 one positive lymph
node, A29 one positive lymph node (the largest positive lymph node measures
1.5 cm in the greatest dimension); A30, three left level III lymph nodes; A31,
two positive left level III lymph nodes; A32, four left level IV lymph nodes;
A33, three level IV lymph nodes; A34, two right level II lymph nodes; A35,
three right level II lymph nodes; A36, four right level III lymph nodes; A37,
two right level III lymph W8, one right left IV lymph node; A39, one
right evel IV lymph node. _

(B) LEFT BASE OF TONGUE — One piece of mucosa 3 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. Entirely
submitted for frozen section diagnosis in B. _

*FS/Dx: SQUAMOUS MUCOSA, NO TUMOR PRESE
(C) LEFT PHARYNGEAL WALL — One piece of mucosa measuring 7 x 3 x 0.2 cm with
attached hemostat which is designated as up end. The up end is inked in blue,
and the low end is inked in green.

SECTI - c1, up half of the specimen; C2, lower half of the
specimen.
