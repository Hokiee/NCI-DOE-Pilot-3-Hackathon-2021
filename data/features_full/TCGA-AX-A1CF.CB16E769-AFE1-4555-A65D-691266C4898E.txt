Sections of tumor and fallopian tube are submitted in formalin and frozen for study.

V. Received labeled "sigmoid serosa" are two ﬁrm, nodular, yellow tan tissues measuring 1.8 and 2 cm.
Both are bisected having gritty, ﬁrm yellow gray cut surfaces. Toto - 2 cassettes.

Vl. Received labeled "omentum" is 36.5 x 11.7 x 1.2 cm piece of fatty tissue. No masses are found on
sectioning nor are any ﬁrm areas palpated. RS-3.

Vll. Received labeled "left common node" is fatty tissue with two pink tan apparent lymph nodes
measuring 0.6 and 0.8 cm. Both are bisected. larger toto~A, smaller toto-B.

MICROSCOPIC: HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
HISTOLOGIC GRADE: G3; poorly differentiated.
MYOMETRIAL INVASION: Present.

EXTENT OF INVASION: Tumor replaces much of the endometrial surface and invades the superﬁcial
myometrium. A maximum 0.7 cm of a 1.7 cm section of endomyometrium contains tumor. Tumor also
focally involves the lower uterine segment and endocervical surface. Metastatic disease replaces the
right ovary and is present in the bilateral pericolic tissue and sigmoid serosal samples. The nodular
mass in the omentum contains metastatic tumor.

REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: Two sampled (left common area); both negative for tumor.
MARGINS: Uterine resection margins free of tumor.
VENOUSILYMPHATIC (LARGE/SMALL VESSEL) INVASION: None seen.

ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: Focal areas of the endometrial surface show better
differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma (grade 2). However, the vast majority of tumor is growing
in solid sheets with scattered areas showing bizarre tumor giant cells, high mitotic activity and abnormal
mitotic ﬁgures. An endometrial polyp is also present and shows focal atypical adenomatous
hyperplasia.

Areas of metastatic tumor show prominent necrosis. A transfer artifact is seen in the left ovary with no
evidence of tumor seen in the left fallopian tube and ovary. Right fallopian tube is not grossly or
histologically identiﬁed.

COMMENT(S): Findings are consistent with high grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma and are
consistent with an endometrial primary tumor with metastatic spread to the other involved sites.

lmmunohistochemical etalne: lmmunohistochemical stains for cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20, villin and
CEA are pending to evaluate this very moriy differentiated tumor. Findings will be reported in an
addendum report.

lmmunohistochemical stains: Cytokeratin 7. cytokeratln 20, CEA and villin were performed with
appropriate control reactivity. Cytokeratin 7 shows strong reactivity in the tumor cells with moderate
CEA expression and no cytokeratin 20 or villin expression. Although CEA positivity is present only in a
