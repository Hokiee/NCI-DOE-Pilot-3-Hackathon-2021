CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY:
Right breast cancer -year—old female.

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
None provided.

POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
None provided.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A: Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name ﬂ , 1d
designated, "Right Breast Sentinel Node #1" consists of three pink-tan
lymph nodes measuring 0.3 cm, 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm, and 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm
in greatest dimension. Sectioning the larger lymph node reveals pink-red
otherwise unremarkable parenchyma. The specimen is entirely submitted

as follows: Al— one lymph node, bisected; AZ— one lymph node; A3— one
lymph node. A matched section of A2 is submitted in OCT for

protocol. _ Time in formalin:

B: Received in formalin, labeled with the patient’s name _ and
designated, "Right Breast Sentinel Node #2" consists of a 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3

cm tan lymph node. The lymph node is bisected and submitted in its
entirety. _ Time in formalin:

C: Received fresh, labelled with the patient's name and
designated, "Right Breast Lumpectomy" consists of an ovoid portion of
firm, yellow—tan breast tissue oriented with a short stitch—superior; and
long stitch-lateral. The specimen measures 6.5 cm from superior to
inferior; 5.5 cm from medial to lateral and 2.0 cm from anterior to deep.
The specimen is inked as follows: superiorwblue; inferior-green;
medial-red; lateral—yellow; anterior—orange; and deepsblack. Serial
sections reveal a firm, gritty, pinkwtan mass measuring 4.0 x 3.5 x 1.5

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Patient: Specimen #:

GROSS DESCRIPTION (continued):

cm. The mass show well defined borders along the superior portion of the
specimen with patchy, ill defined distribution throughout the remainder of
the specimen, involving approximately 75% of the cut surface. The mass
abuts the superior, anterior, deep, and medial margins. The surrounding
breast tissue is dense, pink and white fibrous tissue. No other mass
lesions are identified. Representative sections are sequentially
submitted from superior to inferior as follows: c1-c2— mass with superior
margin; C3~C5— mass with additional margins; C6- adjacent normal; C7» mass
with additional margins; C8- mass with additional margins; 09— mass with
lateral margin; Clo- mass with additional margins; Cll— mass with
additional margins; C12- inferior margin. Matched sections of C3,C5,C7,
and C9—C11 are submitted in OCT and paraffin for ' protocol.

Time in formalin: 1
