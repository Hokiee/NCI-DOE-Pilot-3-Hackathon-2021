PECIMEN
Right colectomy

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Cecal cancer.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
Received fresh, for tissue procurement labeled "right
colectomy" is a previously unopened, 13 cm. segment of

proximal right colon with attached 10.5 cm. of distal ileum
surfaced

by smooth to scabrous serosa with a moderate amount of mesocolon
and

mesentery with multiple large palpable aberrant nodes. A 7.8 cm.

appendix averaging 0.7 cm. in diameter is present. The proximal
and

distal margins measure 4.2 and 8.5 cm. in circumference

respectively. On opening, there is a poorly defined, 9.0 x 5.5 cm.

rubbery to friable tan white—pink tumor mass occupying the cecal

pouch and extending up to the ileocecal valve. On sectioning, the

tumor has a maximal thickness of 2.0 cm., grossly extending into
the

muscularis to within 0.3 cm. of the inked free radial serosal

surface (see blocks 2 and 3). The ileal and remaining colonic

mucosa is unremarkable glistening tan pink with regular folds and

the walls average 0.5 cm. in thickness. Multiple soft to rubbery

tan white to pink gold tissues in keeping with lymph nodes
measuring

up to 4.8 cm. in greatest dimension are recovered from the attached

mesocolon and mesentery. The largest node appear grossly positive.

Representative sections are submitted in 16 blocks as labeled.

RSl6.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Proximal and distal margins; 2 and 3 — tumor
full

thickness to inked free radial serosal surface; 4 and 5 — tumor
full

thickness within cecal pouch (point of continuity inked red); 6 —

tumor to normal; 7 — ICV; 8 — random colon; 9 — appendix; 10—12 —

six whole lymph nodes per cassette; 13 and 14 — two grossly
positive

lymph nodes represented per cassette; 15 and 16 — one grossly

GROSS DESCRIPTION
positive lymph node represented per cassette. -

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Histologic type: Invasive adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified
Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated with grade 3 nuclei
Primary tumor (pT): Tumor invades through the muscularis propria
into the pericolonic fat (pT3)

Proximal margin: Negative for tumor

Distal margin: Negative for tumor

Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative for tumor

Distance of tumor from closest margin: 10 cm. from ileal margin
(proximal)

Vascular invasion: Prominent lymphatic space invasion is noted
(slide 5)

Regional lymph nodes (pN): Prominent lymph node metastasis is

documented with metastatic tumor in 11 of 23 lymph nodes (pN2b).
Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: Present with extension of tumor
beyond lymph node capsules.

Distant metastasis (pM): Cannot evaluate (pr)

Other findings: An adenomatous polyp is identified adjacent to the
tumor. The appendix is histologically unremarkable and the
background sections of colon are histologically unremarkable.
