FINAL DIAGNOSIS

A. (Level five lymph node; biopsy): Two lymph nodes, negative for

malignancy.

B. (Level eleven lymph node; biopsy): One lymph node, negative for

malignancy.

C. (Lung, left upper lobe; lobectomy): Invasive moderately differentiated
adenocarcinoma, measuring 2.2 cm in greatest dimension. Margins of resection
free of tumor. Six peribronchial lymph nodes, negative for malignancy. Stage

pT1b (PL 0) N0. See note.

0. (Level seven lymph node; biopsy): One lymph node, negative for

malignancy.

favor squamous cell carcinoma. (C91, TP, smear)

NOTE

C. lmmunohistochemical stains show that the tumor is positive for cytokeratin
7 and Tl'F—l and negative for cytokeratin 5,6 and P63, supporting the
diagnosis. immunohistochemistry controls are examined and show appropriate

reactivity.

GROSS DESCRlPTlON

A. The specimen is labeled level ﬁve lymph node. Received fresh are two
possible black lymph nodes (1.2 and 1.3 cm in greatest dimension). The larger
node is bisected in cassette A1 and the smaller is submitted intact in

cassette A2.

B. The specimen is labeled level eleven lymph node. Received fresh is a single
2.5 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm possible lymph node. The specimen is entirely submitted

intact in cassette Bl.

C. The specimen is labeled left upper lobectomy, frozen on tumor. Received
fresh for frozen section is a 22.5 x 11.2 x 3.7 cm left upper lobectomy
specimen. Serial sectioning reveals a well circumscribed, firm, gray-white
mass measuring 2.2 x 1.7 x 1.6 cm that is causing pleural puckering and is

closest at 8 cm from the bronchial and vascular margins. The pleura around

the mass is inked blue. A representative section is submitted for frozen

section analysis with remnants wrapped and placed in cassette C91. Touch prep
and smear prepared. Additional representative sections are submitted as
follows: C1, bronchial and vascular margin; C2, peribronchial lymph node; C3
and C4, mass with inked pleura; C5, mass with adjacent grossly normal lung;

and C6, lung away from mass.

D. The specimen is labeled level seven lymph node. Received fresh is a
single 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm lymph node with surrounding fibroadipose tissue.

The entire Specimen is submitted in cassette Dl.
