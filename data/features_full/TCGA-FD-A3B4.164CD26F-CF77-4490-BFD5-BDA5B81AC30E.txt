comment

The entire invasive portion of the tumor consists of keratinizing squamous
carcinoma. The in—situ component shows both urothe1ia1 and squamous ce11
carcinoma differentiation (siide 1abe1ed 311). Therefore, the tumor is
considered urotheiia1 carcinoma with extensive squamous differentiation.

Gross Description: . . _
The specimens are received in 16 containers each 1abe1ed with the patient's name
and medica1 record number.

Part A. is no additionai desi nation. Received fresh and piaced in formaiin are
2 eiiipticai portions of wrin ied brown skin. One is 7.1 x 2.3 cm, excised to a
maXimum depth of 0.3 cm, and the second is 6.2 x 2 cm, excised to a maximum

Page 2

depth of 0.4 cm. sectioning reveals no masses or lesions. A representative
section of each piece is submitted in A1.

Part B. is further labeled "2. Anterior pelvic exanteration". Received fresh and
placed in formalin is a specimen consisting of bladder and uterus which is
overall 20 x 11 x 5.5 cm. The bladder is 1 x 11.x 5.5 cm and covered with
lobulated yellow fibroadipose tissue with cautery artifact. The anterior wall
and around the urethral margin is inked blue. There is a small amount of
apparent labial tissue adgacent to the urethral margin. The labium is 5 x 3 x
0.4 cm and wrinkled gray— rown and unremarkable. The right ureter is 2 cm long
and 2.5 cm in diameter. The left ureter is 0.6 cm long and 0.6 cm in diameter.
After shaving the urethral margin, the bladder is opened along the anterior with
a Y~sha ed incision, revealing a partially ulcerated, partial y fungatin mass
along t e osterior and left wall, extending across the anterior partial y into
the right ateral wall. The overall dimensions are 8.5 x 7 cm, with a raised
portion up to 1.8 cm above the mucosa. The mass comes within 4 cm of the
urethral margin. Sectioning through the left ureter reveals that the mass
encases the ureter and extends to the blue inked margin. Sectioning through the
posterior wall reveals that the tumor extends to the cervix, with a maximum
depth of 3.5 cm. The tumor also extends into the right wall and comes within 0.1
cm of the inked margin. The uninvolved mucosa is edematous. No lymph node
caﬂdidates are identified in the attached adipose tissue. Gross photographs are
ta en.

Posterior to the bladder is a 9 x 6 cm portion of wrinkled pink-tan mucosa
consistent with vaginal wall at terminating in a cervical opening. The anterior
half of the cervix is a 1.3 by the 1.3 and a parent posterior ha f is missing
and consists of cauterized tissue. The attac ed uterus is 5 cm from cornu to
cornu 4.8 cm from fundus to lower uterine segment and 3.3 cm from anterior to
posterior. The serosa covering the uterus is glistenin red and unremarkable.
The left fallopian tube has a white clip. The left fal opian tube is 8 cm long
and up to 1.2 cm in diameter. The left ovary is 2.5 x 1.8 x 0.9 cm. The right
fallopian tube has no clip but is focally disrupted. The length of the distal
portion is 7 cm with a circumference of 0.7 cm. The right ovar is 2.5 x 1.5 x
0.7 cm. The bilateral ovaries are bisected to reveal unremarka le gray firm
tissue. The uterus is opened from anterior to posterior to reveal a 3.4 x 0.3 by
0.3 cm endometrial cavity with unremarkable tan lining. No masses or lesions are
identified in the uterus. Sectioning through the anterior and posterior
endomyometrium reveals an endometrial thic ness of less than 0.1 cm. The
posterior endomyometrium has a maximum thickness of 1.4 cm, and the anterior
endomyometrium as a maximum thickness of 2 cm. There is a single white whorled
nodule in the anterior myometrium which is 0.6 cm in greatest diameter. The
endocervical canal is 1.8 cm long with unremarkable tan trabeculated mucosa.
