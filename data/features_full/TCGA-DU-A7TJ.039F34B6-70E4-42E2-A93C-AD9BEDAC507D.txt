Clinical History
V-year-old man experiences headaches, memory problems. imbalance, and seizure. On imaging, there
is lesion in
the right inferior temporal lobe, with mass effect and questionable enhancement.
Operative Diagnoses
Brain tumor
Operation I Specimen ‘
A: Brain, right temporal, craniotomy
Pathologic Diagnosis
Brain, right temporal, excisional biopsy:
1. Diffuse astrocytoma, high grade, consistent with anaplastic astrocytoma, WHO grade 3
2. Negative for co-deletion of chromosomal arms 1p and 19q
3. Negative for IDH1I IDH2 mutation
4. Ki-67I MlB-1 proliferation index: up to approximately 10%
See Comment.
Comment
The portions of cerebrum show an inﬁltrating glial neoplastic proliferation that has an astrocytic
phenotype. Mitotic
figures are identiﬁed, and the Ki—67/ MlB-1 proliferation index is greater than 10%. There are abnormal
blood vessels,
with a mitosis identiﬁed in the endothelial layer of one vessel. There is no tumor necrosis seen.
Overall, the sections predominantly show a high histological grade diffuse glioma that is most consistent
with
anaplastic astrocytoma, WHO grade 3. However, the presence of mitosis in an abnormal blood vessel, as
well as

patchy post-contrast enhancement seen in the pre-operative radiology imaging studies, raise concern for
these

sections representing the periphery of a higher grade diffuse astrocytoma, i.e. glioblastoma. Correlation
with radiology
imaging studies is recommended for the overall clinicopathological diagnosis.

MGMT Promoter Methylation
Date Ordered: Date Reported:
interpretation
LOW POSlTlVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected.
Results-Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor parafﬁn block (A3)
H and E slide was examined and tumor DNA was enriched by microdissection

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit

from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulﬁte
treatment of

DNA followed by real-time PCR ampliﬁcation . of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The

analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors

such as the presence of >50% non—neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the

detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic
test. This test

was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the

as required

by CLIA '88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the US. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are

provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in the context of established
procedures

and/or diagnostic criteria.

Loss of Heterozygosity 1p, 19q Assay (LOH)
Date Ordered: Date Reported:

Interpretation

NEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1p and chromosome arm 19q is NOT detected.
informative loci are: D1S548, D1S552, D198219, PLA2G4C

Results-Comments

Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor parafﬁn block (A3). DNA extracted from a
corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.

H and E slide was examined and tumor DNA was enriched by microdissection

TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)/ Tumor DNA
pairs using 3

markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1p are 013548, 0181592, and D18552 (with D1S468,
D1 S1612, and

D1S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D198219, D1QS412, and PLAZG4C (with
0195606 and

D1981182 as backup). All markers are microsateilites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLAZG4C which is a
minisatellite (26

nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and
ease of

interpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or

otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at ail informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the

typical ﬁnding in oligodendrogliomas with 1p and 19q deletion.

TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in the sample may preclude the
detection of
allelic loss.

IDH1 Mutation Detection Assay
Date Ordered: Date Reported:
Interpretation
NEGATIVE - There is no evidence of lDH1 point mutation, as indicated by the absence of any nucleotide
changes in
codon 132 of the IDH1 gene compared to the electropherogram of the reference normal sample (wild
type).
Results-Comments
TEST DESCRIPTION: IDH1 Mutation Analysis
Test performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (A3)
H and E slide was examined and tumor DNA was enriched by microdissection
Mutation of lDH1 occurs early in glioma progression with somatic mutations of the R132 residue of IDH1
identiﬁed in

majority (>70%) of grades Ii and lil astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, as well as in secondary GBMs
that

developed from these lower grade lesions. Mutation analysis of closely related IDH2 revealed mutations
of iDH2

residue R172, with most mutations occurring in tumors lacking |DH1 mutations. Tumors with lDH1 or
lDH2 mutations

have distinctive genetic and clinical characteristics, and patients with such tumors have a better outcome
than those

with wild type lDH genes.

Mutations in iDH1/2 are detected by DNA sequencing procedures. The limit of detection of standard
bidirectional

sequencing is approximately 20-25%. in order to increase assay sensitivity tumor enrichment must be
performed by

manual microdissection when tumor cells in the block constitute less than 50% of nucleated cells.
