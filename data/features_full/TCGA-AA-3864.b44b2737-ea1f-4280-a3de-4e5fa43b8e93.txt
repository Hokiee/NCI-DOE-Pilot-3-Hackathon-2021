Diagnosis

Right hemicolectomy preparation with a cecal carcinoma histologically characterized as a
moderately differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma, almost completely covering the
cecum, and measuring 5.5cm in diameter at the widest point. Invasive spreading of the
tumor within all intestinal walls up to the bordering fatty tissue and the subserosa.

Oral and aboral resection margins are tumor-free as is the greater omentum.

21 mesocolic and mesenteric lymph nodes are tumor-free with uncharacteristically
reactive lesions.

Therefore the tumor stage is: pT3, pNO (0/21) L0, V0; G2
