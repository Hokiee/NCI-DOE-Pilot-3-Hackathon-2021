RECEIVED IN 4 PARTS.

PART A RECEIVED LABELED— RIGHT AXILLARY LEVEL 2 LYMPH
NODES IS A NODULAR PORTION OF YELLOW FATTY TISSUE MEASURING 3.7 x 2.2 x
0.7 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION. FOUR FIRM OVOID STRUCTURES ARE IDENTIFIED
MEASURING FROM 0.4 T0 1 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION. THE LARGER NODES ARE
EACH SECTIONED AND GROSSLY POSITIVE. ONE-HALF OF EACH OE THESE IS
SUBMITTED ALONG WITH THE UNSECTIONED SMALLER NODE LABELED A. THE
REMAINING NODAL TISSUE IS SUBMITTED PER CLINICAL BREAST CARE PROJECT
RESEARCH PROTOCOL LABELED 91—93.

PART B RECEIVED LABELED — RIGHT AXILLARY LEVEL 3 LYMPH
NODE IS A FIRM 0.8 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION NODULE AND AN IRREGULAR
PORTION OF NODULAR YELLOW FATTY TISSUE MEASURING 6 X 1.5 X 0.7 CM. FIVE
FIRM OVOID STRUCTURES ARE IDENTIFIED IN THIS PORTION OE‘ FATTY TISSUE.
THREE OF THE NODULES ARE SUBMITTED UNSECTIONED LABELED B1- ONE~HALF
FROM 2 SEPARATE GROSSLY POSITIVE NODES ARE SUBMITTED IN 82 WITH THE
REMAINING TISSUE FROM THESE 2 NODES SUBMITTED AS P4. THE LARGEST NODE
IIEASU'RING 1.4 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION IS GROSSLY FOCALLY POSITIVE. THIS
IS SUBMITTED BISECTED AS B3.

PART C RECEIVED LABELEE_ LEFT MASTECTOMY STITCH AT 12

ANTERIOR TO DEEP. THE NIPPLE IS UNREMQRIGBIE WITHIN A 14 X 5 CM SKIN
ELLIPSE. A SUTURE DENOI'ES 12 O'CLOCK. THE ANTERIOR ASPECT IS MARKED
WITH BLUE INK, THE DEEP MARGIN WITH BLACK. SECTIONING REVEALS THE
CENTRAL 50% OF THE SPECIMEN TO CONSIST OF DENSE TAN FIBROUS TISSUE- THIS
IS SURROUNDED BY A PERIMETER OF YEILOW FATTY TISSUE. NO MASSES ARE
IDENTIFIED-.- REPRESENTATIVE SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: -
Cl--NIPPLE, C2-—CENTRAL DEEP MARGIN, C3 AND 4--UPPER OUTER QUADRANT, C5
AND 6——UPPER INNER QUADRANT, C7 AND 8-—IWER INNER QUADRANT, C9 AND
10——-LOWER OUTER OUADRANT. ADDITIONALLY WITHIN THE CONTAINER AND
INCLUDED THE WEIGHT ARE ADDITIONAL MULTIPLE IRREGULAR E'RACD’IENTS OF
YELLOW—RED FATTY TISSUE IN AGGREGATE MEASURING 10 X 10 X 2.3 CM.
SECTIONING REVEALS ELAND YELLOW FATTY TISSUE AND REPRESENTATIVE SECTIONS
ARE SUBMITTED LABELED C11 THROUGH 13.

NOTE: MIRROR IMAGE SECTIONS OF THE NIPPLE ARE SUBMITTED AS P15 AND
MIRROR IMAGE SECTIONS TO C3, C5, C7, AND C9 ARE SUBMITTED FROZEN IN OCT
PER CLINICAL BREAST CARE PROJECT RESEARCH PROTOCOL.

PART D RECEIVED LABELED - RIGHT MODIFIED RADICAL
MASTECTOMY STITCH AT 12 O'CLOCK IS A 1460 GRAN RIGHT MODIFIED RADICAL
MASTECTOMY. THE MASTECTOMY PORTION MEASURES 24.5 CM FROM MEDIAL 'I'O
LATERAL, 26 CM FROM SUPERIOR TO INFERIOR, AND UP T0 6.5 CM FROM ANTERIOR
TO POSTERIOR. THE AXILLARY PORTION PEASURES 10 X 9 X 2-5 CM. TEE
ANTERIOR MARGIN IS MARKED BLUE. THE DEEP IS MARKED BLACK. THE NIPPLE
IS UNREMARKABLE AND SITS IN THE MORE SUPERIOR PORTION OF THE SKIN
ELLIPSE. THE SKIN ELLIPSE MEASURES 14 X 5.5 CM. THE 12 O'CLOCK SUTURE
IS JUST TO THE MEDIAL SIDE OF THE AREOLA. THE AXILLARY TAIL IS REMOVED
AND RED INK IS PLACED IN THIS AREA TO INDICATE THAT IT IS NOT TRUE
MARGIN. UPON A QUICK PALPATION OF THE AXILLARY TAIL THREE ARE 3
PROMINENT STRUCTURES. THE 151' IS A 0.8 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION LYMPH
NODE WHICH IS GROSSLY NEGATIVE AND IS SUBMITTED BISEC‘I‘ED AS D1. THE 2ND
IS A 2.5 CM GROSSLY NEGATIVE NODAL STRUCTURE SUBMITTED BISECTED AS D2.
THE 3RD STRUCTURE IS A 3.8 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION GROSSLY POSITIVE
LYMPH NODE OF WHICH ONE FULL CROSS SECTION IS SUBMITTED IN D3 AND 4. A
COIL CLIP IS IDENTIFIED AND THE AREA OF THE CLIP IS SUBMITTED IN D5.
THIS IS THE SAME NODE AS D3 AND 4. PORTIONS OF THIS LARGEST NODE ARE
ALSO SUBMITTED IN P5 AND 6. SECTIONING REVEALS THE CENTRAL PORTION OF
THE BREAST TO CONSIS‘I‘ OF DENSE‘. TAN FIBROUS TISSUE AND THIS EXTENDS TO AN
ILL-DEFINED GRAY-TAN MASS AT 9 O'CLOCK WHICH MEASURES 5.5 CM FROM MEDIAL
TO LATERAL, 8 CM FROM SUPERIOR TO INFERIOR BY PALPATION, AND 4.5 CM FROM
ANTERIOR TO POSTERIOR. GROSSLY IT IS 1 CM FROM BOTH THE ANTERIOR AND
DEEP MARGIN. SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: DS--NIPPLE, D7 THROUGH
