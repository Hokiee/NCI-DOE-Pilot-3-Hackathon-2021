Macroscopy
The eyeball mesures 27 mm main line with a segment of optic nerve of 7 mm.

At the section, a pigmented tumor nodule is observed. Tissue specimens are taken
for genetic studies and cryopreservation prior ﬁxation.

Microscopy

The tumor nodule observed macrocopically presents the morphology of an uveal
melanoma. This tumor is composed mainly of epithelioid cells, more rarely fusiform.
The cell atypias are severe. The pigmented load is mild. The mitotic activity is
moderate. The tumor is at distance from the optic nerve which is free on its entire
course. The ciliary body is also free. There is a focal tumor extension on the inner
third of the sclera, without extra~scleral exteriorisation. The cut end of the optic nerve
is free.

Conclusion

Uveal melanoma, mainly composed of epithelioid cells.
Tumor size: 15x15 mm main lines.

Mitotic activity: moderate.

Focal tumor inﬁltration of the 1/3 inner part of the sclera, without extra-scleral
extension.

Ciliary body, optic nerve on its entire course and optic nerve cut end free of tumor.
