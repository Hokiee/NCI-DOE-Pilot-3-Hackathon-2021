***Report EIeCtronicaiiy Reviewed and Signed Out By
Intraoperative Consuitation:
An intraoperative non—microscopic consu1tation was obtained and interpreted as:
"Caiied to_pick up '#1. uterus. cervix, BSO,‘ consisting of a uterus with
attached bi atera faIIopian tubes and ovaries, weighing 80 grams and mea5uring
7.5 cm from fundus to ectocervix, S cm from cornu to cornu. 4 cm from anterior
to posterior. Opened in the 0.R. to Show a poiypoid mass protruding into the
anterior endometriai caVity. measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. A mass measuring 3.5
x 2.4 x 0.9 cm is present in the posterior endomyometrium. The unremarkabIe
right faiiopian tube measures 8.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm, and the right ovary mea5ures
2. x 1.5 x 1 cm. The 1eft fa1iopian tube measures 5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. and the
Ieft ovary measures 2.5 x 1 5 v 1 cm. Tumor and normal taken for . Rest for

Microscopic Description and Comment:
Microscopic sections show a pooriy differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma,
FIGO grade III/III. with invoivement of Iower uterine se ment and endocervicai
giands with no ev7dence of cerVTcaI strDmaI invasion. T e maximum depth of
invasion of tumor measures 1.2 cm from totaI thickness of 1.5 cm. No definitive
Wymph-vascuiar space invasion is identified. Foci of adenomyosis and'
endometriosis (Ieft ovar ) can be appreciated. No evidence of metastatic tumor
in totai of 211regicra1 ymph nodes (0/21).

Gross Description

The specimens are received in five formalin-fiiied containers, each Iabeied

" ” The first container is additionaIIy Iabeied
"uterus, cervix, $50." The measurements and weight are consistent with the ones
described in the intraoperative note. Additiona 1y. the ectocervicaI canal
mea5ures 3 x 1 cm, and is ye110w~tan and smooth. The endometrium measures 3.5 x
2.5 cm, and is rougth trianguiar. The entire endometriai cavity is repiaced by
tumor. In addition to the poiypoid protuberance, the underIying myometrium
shows a gross invasion of 0.5 cm. Labe1ed A1 to A4 ~ contiguous sections of
anterior endomyometrium to anterior cervix; A5, A6 - additionai sections of
anterior endomyometrium with tumor; A7 to A9 — contiguous sections of posterior
endomyometrium to posterior cervix; A10. A11 - posterior endomyometrium with
tumor; A12 - right ovary; A13 - right faIIopian tube; A14 - Ieft ovary; A15 —
Ieft faIIopian tube. Jar 2.

The second container is Iabe1ed “Ieft peric 7ymph nodes." It contains fatty
fragments of tissue measuring 7.5 x 6 x 1 cm. Labeied 81 to 86 - one lymph node
bisected each. Jar 1.

The third container is Iabeied "right peivic Iymph nodes." It contains an 8 x
5.5 x 1 cm fatty tissue. Labeied C1 to C7 ~ one 1ymph node bisected each. Jar
l.

The fourth container is TabeIed ”right periaortic iymph nodes.“ It contains a 4
x 3 X 1 cm fragment of fatty tissue. Labeied 01 to D4 - one 1ymph node bisected
each. Jar 1.

The fifth container is Iabeied “Ieft periaortic Iymph nodes." It contains two
fragments of fatty tissue measuring 2 x 1 x 1, and 1.5 x 1 x 1 cm. Labeied El
