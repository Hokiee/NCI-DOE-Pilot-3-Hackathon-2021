GROSS DESCRIPTION: '

A. Received in the unfixed state in the operating room labeled "level 7 lymph node". The
specimen consists of multiple tan—red fragments of tissue aggregating to 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.3
cm. One smear imprint is prepared. All the specimen is frozen in one block.

B. Labeled "level 4 lymph node“. The specimen is received in an unfixed state in the
Operating Room, consistent with a single 0.5 cm reddish tan piece of tissue entirely frozen
in one block.

C. Part 3 labeled "R4". Received in formalin, is a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm mildly anthracotic
to pink/tan lymph node. The node is submitted in toto cassette C1.

D. Part 4 received fresh for Tissue Banking, labeled with the patient's name, and "right
upper lobe, is a 224 gram, 16.5 x 8.5 x 4.0 cm upper lobe of lung. This is also received
fresh for frozen section diagnosis. The surgeon changed his mind. The pleura is pink/tan
and spongy to red with anthracotic marbling. The lung is sectioned to have a 1.5 x 1.5 x
1.0 cm tumor mass. The mass appears circumscribed and possibly within a vessel. The mass
is 2.0 cm from the bronchial margin and does not involve the pleura. The tumor appears to
have an adjacent smaller nodule, which ranges up to 0.5 cm. The lung is sectioned fresh to
have a peripheral pink/tan spongy appearance on the anterior surface in the superior
aspect. The tumor has a central location adjacent to the hilar structures. There is focal
scant mucin filled bronchioles in the area of the tumor. The parenchyma demonstrates mild
congestion inferiorly. No additional masses or lesions are identified. Sections are
sampled as labeled in the following cassettes:

D1 — frozen section residue of bronchial margin
D2 ~ hilar lymph nodes
D3 - vascular margins

GROSS DESCRIPTION: (Continued)

D4 — perpendicular section of bronchus from margin towards tumor

D5—D7— representative sections of tumor to include separate small nodule of tumor
D8 - parenchyma from superior aspect of lobe

D9 — parenchyma adjacent to tumor from mid aspect of lobe

Dlo — inferior sections of parenchyma sampled

The specimen is dissected in an unfixed state for Tumor Banking. Received a call from

the Operating Room just before ~ stating that wanted a bronchial

resection margin frozen. The Tumor Banker brought the specimen over but at that time,
"id not want the bronchial resection margin frozen. "' ’

E. Part 5 is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and "level 10" are two
hemorrhagic to focally blackened anthracotic portions of possible lymphoid tissue. The

tissues include a 0.4 cm fragment and a 0.6 cm fragment. The tissues are submitted in toto
cassette E1.
