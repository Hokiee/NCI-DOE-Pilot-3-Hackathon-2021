The Gerota's fascia around the tumor is inked black. The tumor

fascia. The distance from the tumor to the nearest Gerota's
fascia is 0.2 cm and to the renal pelvis 0.3 cm. ?he renal vein

2) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled ”Paracaval
Lymph Nodes". It consists of two pieces of fibroadipose tissue
measuring 1.5 x 1 x 1 cm and 3 x 2 x 1 cm. Few lymph nodes are
