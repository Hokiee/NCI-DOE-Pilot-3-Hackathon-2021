COMMENT:
PAS I PAS-D and mucicarmlne stains are negative. Elastic tissue stains show pleural Invasion.

The squamous cell carcinoma shows an interesting pattern of subpleural growth, in a Iepldic fashion, with lymphatic
infiltration. in these areas, it tracks along the visceral pleural surface, which seems to coincide with an airspace-filling
pattern of growth In the main tumor mass.
