HER-2(neu AMPLIFICATION ANALYSIS (FISH)

AS PER THE REQUEST OE‘ FLUORESCENCE IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION‘ (FISH) WAS PERFORMED ON SURGICAL __ (BREAST
CANCER) USING THE VYSIS DNA PROBE FOR THE HER-Z/neu GENE THE RATIO OF HER-Z/neu SIGNALS TO
CHROMOSOME l7 CEN’FROMERE SIGNALS WAS DETERMINED TO BE 2.05. A RATIO OF 2.0 OR GREATER IS CONSIDERED
AMPLIFIED; THEREFORE, THIS' SPECIMEN IS AMPLIFIED.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

ESTROGEN RECEPTOR (0- 20%; 1+ 30‘: 2+ 30%; 3+ 20%) HSCORE OF 150. ESTROGEN RECEPTOR IS INTERPRETBD as
POSITIVE

PROGESI'ERONI RECEPTOR (0- 10‘; 1+ 10‘: 2+ 20‘; 3+ 60‘!) HSCORI OF 230. PROGIBTIRON’I RECEPTOR IS IMERPRETED
AS POSITIVE

HSCORE: <= 15 NEGATIVE

> 15 <= 30 BORDBRLINE

> 30 POSITIVE .

HER-2/N'EU - DAKO HERCEPTEST: A HEAR TO MODERATE COMPLETE MEMBRANE STAINING IS OBSERVED IN MORE THAN 10% OF
THE TUMOR CELLS. HER-2/NEU Is INTERPRETID AS WE! POSITIVI (SCORE 21-) .

NOTE: Her-Zlﬂeu FISH was ordered.

The Her-2/Niu and estrogen assays were performed with FDA approved methods. The progesterone receptor
