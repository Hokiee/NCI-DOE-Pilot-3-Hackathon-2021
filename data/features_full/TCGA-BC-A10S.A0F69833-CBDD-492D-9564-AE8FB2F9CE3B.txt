5%: AVer CJA- a
far '7/-1/o

CLINICAL INFORMATION
The patient is with a history of hepatocellulat Wong .mdergoes resection of the left liver lobe.

GROSS DESCRIPTIONS

One appropriately labeled, formalin-filled, container is received. It holds a 362 gram, 13.5 x 10.5 x 5.0
cm. tan/gray liver lobe with an 8.0 x 7.5 x 5.0 intact tumor mass protruding from the surface. There is a
roughly spherical defect in the base of the specimen where tumor was given to tissue procurement. The
surgical margin has been inked black. The cut tumor surface demonstrates central regions of
yellow/orange necrosis and hemorrhage. The tumor appears well circumscribed and its closest distance

to the surgical margin is 1.2 cm. No other masses are identiﬁed in the hepatic parenchyma. Representative
sections are submitted as per block summary.

BLOCK SUMMARY

1-5 - tumor

6 - uninvolved parenchyma
7-8 - surgical margin

LIGHT MICROSCOPY

Light microscopic examination is performed.

Sections show a well circumscribed and apparently encapsulated tumor nodule composed of enlarged
hyperchromatic hepatocytes arranged predominantly in a trabecular pattern. There is both a micro-
trabecular as well as a macro-trabecular pattern. Focal pseudo-acinar structures are also

seen. There are focal areas of tumor necrosis and hemorrhage. Focal changes suspicious for
Iymphovascular space invasion are observed in the capsule(section #8). There was a single nodule of
tumor without any apparent satellite lesions. The tumor appears to be well differentiated and does not
involve in the surgical margins. The adjacent liver tissue has a normal hepatitic architecture without
signiﬁcant ﬁbrosis. Steatosis was also absent.
