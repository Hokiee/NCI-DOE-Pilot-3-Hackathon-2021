BACKGROUND:

Mutations in either BRAF or RAS genes or FIET/PTC rearrangements are found in more than 70% of papillary thyroid carcinomas
(1). BFI’AF V600E (T1799A) mutation has been associated with more aggressive behavior of papillary carcinoma (2. 3). The
association between BFIAF V600E mutation and features of tumor aggressiveness have also been observed in papillary
microcarcinomas (4). Mutations in the FIAS genes or PAX8/PPARg rearrangement occur in ~70% of follicular thyroid carcinomas
and with lower frequency in oncocytic (Hiirthle cell) carcinomas (5). Regarding the speciﬁcity of these mutations for cancer. BRAF
V600E mutation and FIET/PTC and PAX8/PPAFlg rearrangements are overall specific for malignancy in the thyroid, although they
have been reported with a very low frequency in benign thyroid lesions (6). FIAS mutations occur in malignant and benign thyroid
tumors, being found in ~40-50°/o of follicular and anaplastic carcinomas, 30-40% of follicular adenomas and 10-15% of papillary
carcinomas (6).

MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS:
For paraffin- -embedded surgical specimens, manual microdissection was performed to collect tumor tissue. Specimens with the minimum of 50% of
tumor cells in a microdissection target are accepted for the analysis Optical density readings were obtained. Real-time PCR was performed on the

’ ’ platform to amplify BRAF codons 599-601, NRAS codon 61 HFiAS codon 61, and KRAS codons 12/13 sequences. Post-PCB me/tIng
curve analysis was used to detect possible mutations If required, the mutation type was confirmed by _, r sequencing of the PCFI product on

‘ ‘ DNA from samples positive for each of these mutations was used as positive controls. Amplification at 35 cycles or earlier was

considered sufficient for the analysis. The limit of detection is approximately 10- 20% of alleles with mutation present in the background of normal
DNA

Block 1A:

D. Loss of heterozygosity IDENTIFIED at 1p, 10g, and 13g.
E. Allelic loss 38% (5/13 informative loci).

F. Loss of heterozygosity of 1p IDENTIFIED; Loss of Heterozygosity of 13q (R81) IDENTIFIED.

NOTE:
The quantity and quality of Isolated DNA was acceptable for testing.

BACKGROUND: .
Loss of tumor suppressor gene alleles is known to occur in parathyroid neoplasms and to correlate with tumor progresSIon. As
reported in the literature, parathyroid carcinomas frequently have a mean fractional allele loss of ~ 63%, and many of these tumors
have retinoblastoma gene deletions at 13q14 (1,2). Parathyroid adenomas typically have lower frequency of LOH, frequently fewer
than 11% (1). Some studies have shown that parathyroid adenomas and carcinomas often have identIfIable LOH on chromosome
1 p, while hyperplasia is less commoniwaﬁected by this genetic loss (1,3). However, not alltumors reveal such a correlation and.
therefore, the LOH profile should be interpreted in the context of the cytologic and histologrc ﬁndings and the patent s clInIcal

LOSS OF HETEROZYGOSITY ANALYSIS: . . ' . '
For cytology samples, extraction of DNA was performed from the fluid or sample provided. For surgIcaI spec/mans, manual microdIssectIon was
performed to include neoplastic tissue and normal adjacent tissue. Specimens with the minimum of 50% of tumor cells In atmrcrodissection target
are accepted for the analysis. DNA was Isolated using standard laboratory procedure. Optical densIty readings were obtaIned. SIxteen
microsatellite markers (D1S407(p21,1p36.21), D181161 (p21, 1p35.1). D181183(HHPT2, 1q25.3), 0381516 (VHL, 3p25.3), 058659 (APC,

with known tumor suppressor genes were used for analysis. PCFI was performed using fluorescent/y labeled primers and the products of
amplification were detected using capillary electrophoresis on ‘ ‘“‘ 3 platform. Relative fluorescence was determined for individual alleles and
the ratio of peaks was calculated , ‘ ' ‘ 7). Normal tissue was examined to determine whether the patient is heterozygous at the
marker (genetically informative) and neoplastic tissue was then analyzed to detect loss of heterozygosity. Thresholds for significant allelic

imbalance were determined using normal (non-neoplastic) specimens for every marker. Loss of heterozygosity was determined using (NL / N5)/

(TL/T5) formula and reported when allelic ratio for a particular marker was below 0.5 or above 2.0. When normal tissue was not available, peak
M112 Ilinn nIIfsirln nf 2 SDs beyond the mean for each polymorphic allele paring were assessed as showing loss of heterozygosity.

RET/PTO Methodology Description:

Probe: FiET/PTC Probe (10q11.2) and HET/PTCI Dual-Color Fusion Probe 10q11.2-10q21

Probe Description: The RET probe (labeled SpectrumGreen) is a 207 kb DNA probe located at band 10q11.2.

The H4 and 369 probes are approximately 100kb each (labeled in SpectrumOrange), and are located at band 10q21.

FIET/PTC rearrangement is suggested to be present when three RET signals are identified in greater than 8% of the analyzed
cells.

FiET /PTCi rearrangement detection is as follows: Normal cells without the RET/PTC1 rearrangement show two pair of green and
orange signals separated. Cells with the RET/PTCI rearrangement show two pair of signals (green and orange) in juxtaposition
and one green and one orange signal separated in greater than 8% of analyzed cells within the targeted area.

RET/PTO FISH analysis was manually performed and quantitatively assessed by analysis of a minimum of 60 cells using the PTC
(369/H4) SpectrumOrange and the RET SpectrumGreen probes.
