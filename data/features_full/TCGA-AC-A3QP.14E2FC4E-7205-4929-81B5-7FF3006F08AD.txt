PROCEDURE

Right breast lumpectomy.

SPECIMEN:

A. R. breast lump. Nylon suture at posterior margin. Beige suture
superior margin.

B. Sentinel node #1.

C. Sentinel node #2.

D. Right breast tissue (black suture most superior margin).

E. Right breast tissue (black suture at most anterior margin).

HISTORY
Right breast cancer.

GROSS ,
A. Received fresh in a container labeled Iright breast tissue" is a
fragment of fibrofatty breast tissue (5.7 cm in medial-lateral
dimension, 7 cm in superior-inferior dimension, 1.8 cm in
anterior~posterior dimension) oriented by attached sutures. An
accompanying specimen radiograph reveals abundant radiodense
tissue.

The density corresponds to a sclerotic, gray-white, hard tumor mass
(2.8 cm in greatest dimension) which is within 1-2 mm of the
anterior margin, 0.5 cm from the posterior margin, 0.6 cm from the
medial margin, approximately 1.4 cm from the lateral margin and 1.2
cm from the superior margin. The remaining parenchyma consists of
abundant firm white fibrous tissue with scattered cysts up to 2-3 mm
in diameter, along with dilated ducts containing opaque yellow-tan,
paste-like material. Total fixation time in formalin is
approximately 28 hours. A representative portion of the tumor is
submitted for the

1. Superior margin. -_-

2-3 and 4-5. Full thickness bisected cross sections, including
nearest radial margins.

6-7. Indurated parenchyma away from tumor.

8. Inferior margin. “'

B. Received in formalin in a container labeled “sentinel node #1“
is a 1.8 cm in greatest dimension, blue-gray, fatty lymph node.

c. Received in formalin in a container labeled “sentinel node 02'
is a 0.6 cm, firm, tan and gray lymph node.

B. Received in formalin in a container labeled “right breast
tissue, black suture most superior margin” is a sheet of fibrofatty
tissue (4 x 3 x 1.2 cm) oriented by an attached suture.

Ink Code:
Black ~ superior margin (adjacent to suture).
Blue - opposing margin.

The tissue is serially sectioned and submitted in its entirety in
three cassettes

E. Received in formalin in a container labeled 'right breast tissue
black suture most anterior margin~ is a fragment of fibrofatty
tissue (2.9 x 1.6 x 0.9 cm) oriented by an attached suture.

Ink Code :
Black - anterior margin (adjacent to suture).
Blue — opposing margin.

The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted in its entirety in
two cassettes.

MICROSCOPIC
See diagnosis.

DIAGNOSIS
A. Right breast lump, lumpectomy:
Invasive lobular carcinoma (see comment).

B. Sentinel lymph node #1, excision:
One lymph node involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma (largest
metastatic focus 2 mm) (1/1).

C. Sentinel lymph node #2, excision:
One benign lymph node, free of tumor (0/1).

D. Right breast tissue, excision:

Microscopic foci of invasive lobular carcinoma (up to 5 mm in
greatest dimension).

Tiny focus of lobular cancerization.

Neoplasm is approximately 4-5 mm from most superior margin
(black inked margin, adjacent to suture) and at blue inked
opposing aspect.

E. Right breast tissue, excision:
No tumor is seen.

COMMENT
BREAST CARCINOMA SUMMARY:
SPECIMEN: Partial breast.
PROCEDURE: Lumpectomy.
SPECIMEN INTEGRITY: Single intact with additional margin submitted
in parts C (superior margin) and D (anterior margin).
SPECIMEN LATERALITY: Right breast lumpectomy.
SPECIMEN SIZE: 5.? x 7 x 1.8 cm.
TUMOR SIZE: 2.8 cm.
TUMOR FOCALITY: A 2.8 cm focus of invasive lobular carcinoma, and
additional tiny foci (up to 5 mm) of invasive lobular carcinoma away
from tumor.
SKIN INVOLVEMENT: Skin not present.
NIPPLE INVOLVEMENT: Nipple not present.
SKELETAL MUSCLE INVOLVEMENT: Skeletal muscle not present.
DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCISI: Negative.
LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU (LCIS): Present.
HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Invasive lobular carcinoma.
GRADING (NOTTINGHAM): Tubular formation score: Score 3.
NUCLEAR PLEOMORPHISM SCORE: Score 2.
MITOTIC RATE SCORE: Score 1.
COMBINED GRADE (NOTTINGHAM): Grade 2 (intermediate grade).
LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION: Not identified.
MARGIN OF EXCISION: Final margins appear free of tumor (closest
margin is superior. approximately 4-5 mm. part D).
LYMPH NODES: One sentinel lymph node involved by metastatic lobular
carcinoma (sentinel lymph node '1, part 3 (largest tumor focus is 2
mm) (1/2).
MICROCALCIFICATION: Not identified.
OTHER FINDINGS: Fibrocystic changes, usual ductal hyperplasia.
HORMONE RECEPTORS: Reported (estrogen receptor positive (70%,
strong): Progesterone receptor positive (over 90%, strong).
HER-ZINEU: Reported (equivocal (2+) by immunohistochemistry,
FISH pending.
PATHOLOGIC TNM (AJCC . EDITION): T2 Nlmic Mx.
NOTE: A cytokeratin El/E3 immunohistochemical stain was performed
on parts 3 (sentinel lymph node #1) and C (sentinel lymph node #2).
It is strongly positive on part B (sentinel lymph node #1) within
the metastatic tumor cells, and supports the diagnosis. It is
negative within part c (sentinel lymph node #2), consistent with
benign lymph node.
