INTERPRETATION AND DIAGNOSIS:

l. LUNG, RIGHT LOWER LOBE (WEDGE RESECTION): INFILTRATING SQUAMOUS
CELL CARCINOMA, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED (2.5 CM). THE VISCERAL
PLEURA, BRONCHIAL MARGIN AND VASCULAR MARGIN ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

SCATTERED NECROTIZING GRANULOMAS. SPECIAL STAINS FOR MYCOBACTERIA
(AFB) AND FUNGUS (GMS) ARE NEGATIVE.

2. LYMPH NODE, STATION 7 (BX.): ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
3. LYMPH NODE LEVEL 9 (BX.): ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

NOTE: The pathologic stage is T1 N0 MX.

SURGICAL
PATHOLOGY

PART #1: RIGHT LOWER LOBE WEDGE
Resident Pathologist:

The specimen is received fresh labeled - and
designated right lower lobe wedge. It consists of an identifiable
wedge of lung weighing 200 gms, and measures 12 x 9 x 4 cm. There is
a palpable nodule present. The margin is stapled close, and there are
grossly identifiable vessels and airways present at the margin.

The tumor measures 2.5 cm and is located approximately the central
portion of the specimen. It approaches within 1 cm of the stapled
margin. The tumor is gray/white and firm, well demarcated from the
surrounding low parenchyma. It approaches to within 1 cm of the inked
pleural surface. The uninvolved lung parenchyma shows mucous plugging
focally. The remaining parenchyma is beefy red and otherwise
unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted.

SUMMARY OF SECTIONS:

1 - A ~ 4 (VASCULAR AND BRONCHIAL MARGINS)

l - B - 3 (PARENCHYMAL SHAVES AT THE NEAREST
STAPLE MARGIN)

1 ~ C — l (TUMOR AT CLOSEST VISCERA PLEURA)

2 - D—E - 1 EA. (TUMOR(

1 - F — 1 (TUMOR AND ADJACENT BRONCHUS)

1 - G — 1 (REPRESENTING TUMOR)

2 - H—I - 1 EA.(PARENCHYMA REMOTE FROM TUMOR)

9 — TOTAL - 9

PART #2: STATION 7 LYMPH NODE
Resident Pathologist:

The specimen is received fresh labeled _ and
designated station VII, lymph node. It consists of black tan soft

tissue measuring 2.7 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm. The specimen is bisected and
one half of the lymph node is submitted for tumor bank, and future
studies. The remainder is submitted for permanent sections.

SUMMARY OF SECTIONS:

1 - A - 1
1 - TOTAL — 1

PART #3: LYMPH NODE LEVEL 9
Resident Pathologist :

The specimen is received fresh labeled ~ and
designated lymph node level IX. It consists of one piece of black tan
soft tissue measuring 1 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is bisected and
one half is submitted for tumor and future studies. The remaining
half is submitted for permanent sections.
