Molecular Anatomic Pﬁhologv testing:

A. KRAS Exon 1 mutation iS IDENTIFIED (Gly120ys).

[-3. EGFR Exon 19 mutation NOT identified.

C. EEGFR Exon 21 mutation NOT identified.
Note:
KRAS codon 12113 mutations are found in approximately 10-30% lung adenocarcinomas and associated with history of
smoking (1). EGFR exon19 and 21 mutations are present in about 10% of non-Asians and up to 40% in the Asian
population, common in noriusmokers and associated with tho tumor response to treatment with EGFR inhibitors (2).
These mutations are mutually exclusive and their presenca may have prognostic and/or therapeutic implications (3,4).

min Pr ' d o oncin Anal Sis

For cytology samples, extraction of DNA was performed from the ﬂuid or sample provided For surgical specimens, tumor mlcrodissoction was
porfor‘med. DNA was riSolatod using Standard laboratory procedure. Optical density roadingS were Oblafnod. For the detection of mutation DNA
was amplified with primers ﬂanking Exon 1 in the KRAS gene and axons 19 and 27 of the EGFR geno. Then, forward and reverse sequencing was
portonnod using the EligDyo Terminator Kit on ABI3130 {Applied Blosystomo). The known notspots were analyzed for the presence of mutations

PROBE: VySiS LSI EGFR SpectrumOranuel CEP 7 SpectrumGroenTM Probe _
Fluorescence in-Silu hybridization studies performed On the adenocarcinoma S QWS a ratio of EGFR gone to tho centromoro of

chromosome 7 of 1.2 indicating no EGFR amplification in the targeted region. The rate of hyperploidy iorthe contromero of
chromosome 7 was 26% of the analyzed coils. The Signal to nucleus ratio (SNR) for the EGFR gene was 2.5.

 

Interpretation guidelines tor EGFR Gene Copy Number by F ESH:
Ratio of EGFR to the oentromoro of chromosome 7:
Less than 2.0: No EGFR ampliﬁcation
Greater than 2.0: EGFR amplifioation
Hyperploidy: Greater than two centromore copies/cell.
SNR: The averago number of EGFR signals per analyzed coll within the targeted region.
Clinical studies Show high EGFR gene copy number by FISH analysis to be associated with favorable clinical beneﬁt (clinical

response, stable dispose. time to progression, and survivaii'in patients with advanced nonSSmall cell lung cancar treated with
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
