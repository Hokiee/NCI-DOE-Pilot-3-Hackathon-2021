Microscopic

Microscopic examination reveals an oligodendroglioma characterized by a
proliferation of neoplastic cells with round to oval nuclei and prominent
perinuclear halos. Overall, the tumor appears moderately cellular. The
neoplastic cells demonstrate moderate nuclear atypia. A rare cell demonstrates
more marked atypical features characterized by enlarged hyperchromatic folded
or clefted nuclei. Microgemistocytes are scattered throughout the tumor. The
background neuropil demonstrates focal areas of microcystic change, as well as
acute hemorrhage. Only one mitotic figure per 10 high power fields is counted.
No necrosis or microvascular proliferation is identified. Overall, these histologic
features are consistent with an oligodendroglioma.

Addendum

The MlB-1 labeling index ranges up to 2.1% consistent with a low grade
neoplasm.

Diagnosis

Oligodendroglioma grade II
