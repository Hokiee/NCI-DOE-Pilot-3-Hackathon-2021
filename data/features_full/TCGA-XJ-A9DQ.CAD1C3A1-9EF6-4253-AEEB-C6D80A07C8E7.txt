Interpreted by:

A. Received fresh labeled "prostate" is a radical prostatectomy specimen measuring from 4.2 cm from right to left 3.8 cm from
apex to base and 3.0 cm from anterior to posterior. The right seminal vesicle measures 2.2 cm in length and 1.5 cm in diameter.
The right vas deferens measures 1.4 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter. The left seminal vesicle measures 2.3 cm in length and
1.3 cm in diameter. The left vas deferens measures 1.7 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter. The external surface is of the prostate
is tan—white and smooth. The right side of the prostate is inked black and the left side is inked blue. The prostate is serially
sectioned to reveal a tan-yellow band in the posterior aspect of the prostate that measures 2.5 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm that comes within 0.1

cm of the closest margin. The remainder of the cut-surfaces is tan-pink, smooth and glistening. The specimen is submitted as
follows:

A1 Right bladder neck margin (radially sectioned).

A2 Left bladder neck margin (radially sectioned).

A3 Right distal urethral margin (radially sectioned).

A4 Left distal urethral margins (radially sectioned).

A5 Right and left seminal vesicles and vas deferens margin
A6 Section from the right mid—anterior prostate.

A7 Section from the left mid—anterior prostate.

A8-A17 Entire posterior right lobe. from apex to base.
A18-A28 Entire posterior left lobe, from apex to base.
