GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A: The specimen is received fresh from the 0.R. and labeled "Right distal ureter
F8". It consists of a segment of ureter that measures 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The
specimen is entirely submitted for frozen in a single cassette.

B: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Left distal ureter
FS". It consists of a segment of ureter that measures 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The
specimen is entirely submitted for frazen in a single cassette.

C: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Peri~aortic node FS“.

It consists of a fragment of pale-tan tissue with attached yellow adipose tissue
with an overall measurement of 4.0 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm. Sectioning reveals two lymph
nodes one measuring 1.6 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm and the other measurng 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm.
Half of the specimen is embedded for frozen. The remaining half of the specimen is
saved for research purposes.

D: The specimen is received fresh from the 0.R. and labeled "Urinary bladder
uterus and bilateral tubes and ovaries“. It consists of a radical cystectomy
specimen with attached uterus and bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes with an
overall measurement of 29 x 17 x 4.0 cm. The bladder measures 10.? x 3.0 x 3.0 cm
with attached peritoneum that measures 13.0 x 10.0 x 4.0 cm. The peritoneum and
outer surface of the bladder are unremarkable. Opening the bladder reveals a
thickened bladder wall which measures 1.2 cm and a pink-tan multifocal papillary
slightly friable tumor the largest focus measuring 3.5 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm and located
at the trigone. This largest focus of tumor appears to involved the urethra and is
located 2.2 cm from the vaginal urethral margin. other foci are seen at the left,
right, and posterior bladder wall. Serial sectioning show none of the foci of
tumor to invade into the perivesical connective tissue whos radial margin has been
inked in blue. The right ureter measures 10.4 cm in length and 0.7 cm in
circumference and the left ureter measures 8.0 cm in length and 2.0 cm in
circumference. The mucosal surface of the ureter is pink-tan grey and smooth with
no lesions identified. The uterus measures 6.8 cm superior to inferior, 4.8 am
right to left and 3.2 cm anterior to posterior. The serosal surface is
predominantly smooth with a few tan nodule ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 cm. The cervix
measures 1.8 cm in length and 3.8 cm in diameter and is covered by a smooth
pink-tan ecto-cervix. The endocervical canal measures 1.5 cm in length and is
covered by a tan granular mucosa. The endometrial cavity measures 1.5 cm from
cornu to cornu and 3.5 cm in length and is covered by a thin endcmetrial stripe

which averages 0.1 cm. Serial sections to the endomyometrium show a ink-
parenchyma with no significant lesions identified. The right ovary measures 3.6 x
1.8 x 1.0 cm and the left ovary measures 3.4 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm. Both ovaries have a
yellow-tan surface with sectioning revealing multiple corpora albicans. The right
fallopian tube measures 9 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter and the left
fallopian tube measures 11 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter both fallopian tubes
are grossly unremarkable. Careful dissection and palpation of the perivesical
adipose tissue reveals rare candidate lymph nodes. At the request of the surgeon,
an intraoperative pathologic consultation is performed in order to aid in the care
of this patient. Representative sections are submitted in 25 cassettes.
