_’ Final diagnosis

Breastflgftﬂide local excision: lnﬁltratingductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade III (of III)
[tubules 3/3, nuclei 3/3, mitoses 2/3, Nottingham Eco-re 8/9], forming a 1.7 x 1.6 x 1.2 cm mass
[AJCC pTlc}. Ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate nuclear grade, comprising less than 5% of
tumor volume. Angiolymphatic invasion is absent. Biopsy site changes present. All surgical
resection margins, after re-excisions of the medial and superior margins, are negative for tumor
(minimum tumor free margin, 0.9 cm, superior margin). A single intramammary lymph node,
present at the medial margin, is positive for metastaticcarcinorna. The involved lymph node
measures 1.5 mm in maximum dimension.

Lymph nodes, leﬁ axillary sentinel, excision: A single (of 2) leﬁ axillary lymph node is positive
for metastatic carcinoma [AJCC le]. Blue dye is identified in both left axillary sentinel lymph
nodes. lmmunohistochemical cytokeratin stain was performed on the parafﬁn embedded sentinel
lymph node tissue and confirms the H&E impression.

Lymph nodes, left axillary, dissection: Multiple (36) left axillary lymph nodes are negative for
tumor.

Faxitron done.

Estrogen and progesterone receptor analysis and Her-Z/N EU have been ordered on parafﬁn
embedded tissue.
