FINAL DIAGNOSIS ——————————— Pathologist: —

l. LYMPH NODE, R4 (RESECTION): ONE (1) LYMPH NODE AND E 'JIRTZD
FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.

 

2. LYMPH NODE, L4 (RESECTION): ONE (1) LYMPH NODE AND ASSOCIATED
FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.

3. LUNG, RIGHT UPPER LOSE (LOBECTOMY):

SPECIMEN TYPE:
Lobectomy

TUMOR SITE:
Right upper lobe

HISTOLOGIC TYPE:
Adenocarcinoma, solid type with clear cell change

TUMOR SIZE:
Greatest dimension: 7.5 cm

HISTOLOGIC GRADE:
G3: Poorly differentiated

LYMPH NODES:
All I? nodes negative for tumor (includes parts la?)

DIRECT EXTENSION OF TUMOR:
The tumor extends subpleurally but does not involve the pleural
surface

EXTENT OF INVASION (7th Edition, AJCC):

PRIMARY TUMOR:

pT3: Tumor which is >7 cm or invades chest wall, diaphragm,
mediastinal pleura, or parietal pericardium, or involves main
bronchus <2 cm from carina or associated with total atelectasis or
separate tumor nodule in the same lobe

REGIONAL LYMPH NODES:
pNO: No regional lymph node metastasis

DISTANT METASTASIS:
pMa: Cannot be assessed

MARGINS:

Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma

Distance of invasive carcinoma from nearest margin: 4.0 cm (bronchial
margin)

VENOUS/ARTERIAL (LARGE VESSEL) INVASION:
Absent

LYMPHATIC (SMALL VESSEL) INVASION:
Absent

ABDETIONAL PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS:
Immnnohistochemistry demonstrates that the tumor cells are TTFWI
(diffuse) and Napsin—A (variable) positive. An immunostam

shows patchy, variable staining of the tumor cells.

pattern supports the diagnosis.

Background lung shows emphysematous changes and organizing lung
injury (fibroblast foci) adjacent to the tumor.

4. LYMPH NODE, STATION 1 (RESECTION): ONE (1) LYMRE NODE AND
ASSOCIATED FIBROADIROSE TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

5. LYMPH NODE, R4 (RESECTION): ONE (1) LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR
TUMOR.

6. LYMPH NODE, 10R (RESECTION): THREE (3) LYMPE NODES, NEGATIVE FOR
TUMOR.

7. LYMPH NODE, STATION 7 (RESECTION): ONE (1) LYMPH NODE AND
ASSOCIATED FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

Note: EGFR and KRAS mutation analysis studies are pending and will
be reported separately.

ADDENDUM ———————— Pathologist:
KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS IS NEGETIVE. NOEMUTATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED AT
CODONS 12 AND 13 OF THE KRAS GENE.

EGFR MUTATION ANALYSIS IS NEGATIVE. NO MUTATIONS WERE DETECTED AT
