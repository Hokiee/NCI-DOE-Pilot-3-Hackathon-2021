DIAGNOSIS:

1: UTERUS AND VAGINAL CUFF, RADICAL HYSTERECTOMY:

—Invasive, poorly differentiated sguamous cell carcinoma of
cervix, miiEd‘ﬁBﬁTkeratinizing and keratinizing types (see
comment)

~Involvement of Cervix by carcinoma is circumferential

-Tumor measures about 3.5 cm in diameter, about 2 cm in
maximum thickness and involves about a 3.5 cm long segment of
tissue extending from the lower uterine segment to the
vaginal cuff

-Invasion of the cervical wall by tumor is transmural

-A 2.5 x 1.0 cm transmural cervical wall defect involving the
anterior endocervix is present

—Tumor invades paracervical soft tissues (so—called
paracervical parametrium) and focally extends to the

margin of the paracervical soft tissues

-Lymphatic invasion by tumor is present within lower uterine
segment, cervix, vaginal cuff, and paracervical soft tissues
—Vascular (arterial and venous) invasion by tumor is present
in cervix
—Tumor invades the wall of the upper vagina (vaginal cuff)
anteriorly and posteriorly

-Invasive carcinoma is present less than 0.5 mm from the
inked deep margin of the wall of the anterior vaginal cuff,
about 2 mm from the inferior surgical margin of the

anterior vaginal cuff, and within less than 5 mm of the
posterior vaginal cuff

—Involvement of the wall of the lower uterine segment by tumor
is nearly transmural, anteriorly

—Involvement of the posterior wall of the lower uterine
segment is about 50% of the thickness

-Uterine corpus and fundus are negative for carcinoma
-Mucosa1 surface of the tumor is extensively ulcerated
-Endocervical canal is obstructed by tumor (near total
stenosis)
-Acute and chronic inflammatory reaction and fibrosing stromal
reaction to invasive carcinoma are present
—Tumor associated necrosis is present

 

 

—Other findings include:

-Benign non—phasic endometrium (non-functional basalis
endometrium, weakly proliferative endometrium, and some
endometrium showing secretory glandular changes)

-Uterine leiomyoma

-Subserosal mullerianosis (endosalpingiosis), posterior
lower uterine segment

COMMENT: The non—keratinizing component of the tumor predominates.
No intracytoplasmic mucin is detected within the neoplastic cells

on mucicarmine stains. Elastin and trichrome stains were used to
further investigate the blood vessel invasion by tumor. The
transmural defect in the uterine wall may have been produced by a
combination of factors including transmural wall involvement by
invasive carcinoma, tumor perforation, and technical difficulties in
removing the specimens due to adhesions to surrounding structures,

In light of Dr. absence from the medical center,
preliminary pathologic findings were discussed with Dr. on

1: UTERUS AND CERVIX

Labeled "uterus and cervix", received fresh in the Operating Room and
subsequently fixed in formalin, is a 100 gram radical hysterectomy
specimen with an attached 1.5 to 2.5 cm long cuff of superior vaginal
tissue and paracervical/paracorporal parametrial soft tissues,
measuring up to about 1.8 cm in width. The uterus measures about 8
cm from the fundus to the ectocervix, 5 cm from cornu to cornu, and
a maximum of 5 cm from the anterior to the posterior surface.
External examination of the specimen is remarkable for a 2.5 x 1.0 cm
transmural defect with an irregular shaggy border involving the
anterior endocervix. The margins of the tissues bordering the

defect are inked blue. The rest of the serosal surface of the
uterus is tan—pink, intact, and relatively smooth. The paracervical
soft tissues are focally involved by tumor. The margin of the

of the vaginal cuff is painted with black ink. The cervix is
virtually replaced by an exophytic and endophytic tumor that focally
protrudes through the external 05. The tumor is circumferential,
about 3.5 cm in diameter, and involves about a 3.5 cm long segment
of tissue extending from the lower uterine segment into the wall

of the upper vagina. The mucosal aspect of the tumor is amber-

tan to reddish—tan and ulcerated. The endocervical canal shows
subtotal stenosis with obstruction due to occupation by tumor. On
cut sections, the tumor involves the entire wall of the cervix and
has a maximum thickness of about 2.0 cm. Invasion of the wall of
the anterior lower uterine segment by tumor is also nearly full
thickness. Invasion of the wall of the posterior lower uterine
segment is less. The tumor invades the wall of the upper vagina.
Involvement of the vaginal wall is nearly full thickness. Tumor
within the wall of the vagina extends very close to the vaginal cuff
margin, inferiorly. The overlying vaginal mucosa is tan—pink and
appears grossly uninvolved by tumor. Little, grossly uninvolved
tan, intact squamous epithelium is grossly evident in the cervix.

As stated above, the endocervix is virtually replaced by tumor. The
endometrial cavity is about 4 cm in length and has a maximum width
of about 2.5 cm. The endometrium lining the uterine corpus and
fundus is tan, smooth and has a maximum thickness of about 0.1 cm.
The uterine wall measures about 2.2 cm in maximum thickness. Cut

sections of the uterus are remarkable for a 1.5 cm diameter,
circumscribed leiomyoma with a typical firm, white, whorled cut
surface involving the upper posterior uterine wall near the fundus.
There is no gross evidence of invasion of the uterine corpus or
fundus by tumor. Representative sections are submitted.

2: RIGHT PELVIC NODE

Labeled "right pelvic nodes" and received in formalin is a 4 x 2.5 x
1 cm fragment of yellow fatty tissue within which are embedded
total of nine lymph nodes. The lymph nodes range from about 0.
1.5 cm in diameter. The largest lymph node is firm and on cut
sections subtotally replaced by white tissue consistent with
metastatic carcinoma. The other eight lymph nodes are tan and soft.
All identified lymph nodes are embedded.
