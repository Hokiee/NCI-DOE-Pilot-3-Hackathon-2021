Frozen Section DiaFnosis: SFS NEGATIVE MARGIN OF RESECTION PER I

Gross Description: Received fresh for frozen section evaluation is a 797
gm, 20.0 x 20.0 x 5.5 cm right pneumonectomy. It is covered by a pink—red
to purple focally anthracotic stained pleura having up to 2.0 cm of
attached bronchus. The bronchial resection margin is submitted for frozen
section evaluation and the frozen section residue is submitted in one
block. In the hilar area, adjacent to the bronchus is a 7.0 x 5.0 x 3.0

cm firm mass having tan anthracotic stained cut surfaces. The remaining
cut surfaces of lung range from areas which are tan-pink and crepitant to
areas which are red—purple, soft and glistening. There are multiple
palpable hilar lymph nodes, 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. The cut surface
of each is gray-black and anthracotic stained. Representative sections

are submitted in eleven blocks.

Designation of Sections: 5FS frozen section bronchial resection margin, 5A
vascular margins, SB-SF tumor, 5G—5H random lung sections, 51-5K hilar
lymph nodes

2. Mediastinal lymph node, level 9, excision:
- No tumor seen in four lymph nodes (0/4).

3. Right level 4 lymph node 3, excision:
