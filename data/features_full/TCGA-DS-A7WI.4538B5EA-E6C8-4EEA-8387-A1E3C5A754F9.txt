E. UTERUS. CERVlX

Labeled designated “uterus, cervix’, and received fresh and subsequently pinned and
ﬁxed in formalin is a 246 gram, intact hysterectomy specimen. The uterus measures 12.2 x 7.6 x 5.8 cm.
The cervix measures 6.2 cm long and up to 6.0 cm in diameter. The vaginat cuff along the anterior
aspect extends up to 1.2 cm away from the cervix and along the posterior aspect extends up to 1.6 cm
away from the cervix. The endometrial cavity measures 3.5 cm wide and 5.7 cm long. The endometrium
ranges in thickness from 0.2 to 0.4 cm in maximum thickness. The mycmetrium ranges in thickness from
1.0 to 2.8 cm in maximum thickness. The right paracervical soft tissues extend up to 1.4 cm away from
the cervix and the Iett paraceivical sort tissues extend up to 1.6 cm away from the cervix.

The serosa is smooth, glistening and red-tart. Within the cervix there is a large, fungating, pinlotan focally
necrotic mass with areas of hemorrhage present measuring 1.8 x 7.5 x 1.4 cm. The mass is fully
circumferential with possible involvement at the anterior and posterior lower uterine segments. The cut
surface of the mass reveals semifirm pale tan tissue intermixed mucous ﬁtted cyst that range from 0.3 to
0.7 cm in greatest dimension. Also the mass also grossly invades greater than 50% of the cervical
stroma and comes within 0.2 cm otthe inked serosa and 0.? cm of the vaginal cufl resection margin. The
paraoervicsl soft tissues appear grossly free of tumor. No additional lesions are identiﬁed.

The remaining ‘endornetrium is focally granular with pinpoint areas of hemorrhage. The myometrium
consists of soft to rubbery pink-tan tissue. Aiong the uterine fundus one subserosal ieiornyoma is
identiﬁed measuring 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. No polyps are identiﬁed. The paracervical soft
tissues are entirely submitted. A portion of the tumortrom the 3:00 position of the cervix and normal
endometn’um from the fundus are released to the biorepository for pcssibie future studies.
Representative sections of remaining tissue are submitted. Gross photos are taken.
