FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS
A. Left pelvic lymph nodes; dissection:
- Metastatic urothelial carcinoma in a matted lymph node (1/ 1).

- Tumor extensively involves perinodal adipose tissue and lymphovascular spaces.

B. Leﬁ pelvic lymph nodes; dissection:

- Metastatic urothelial carcinoma in four of four lymph nodes (4/4).

- Tumor present in perinodal adipose tissue and lymphovascular spaces.
- Segment of vas deferens, no tumor present.

C. Right pelvic lymph nodes; dissection:
~ Metastatic urothelial carcinoma in ﬁve of nine lymph nodes (5/9).
- Tumor extensively involves perinodal adipose tissue and lymphovascular spaces.

D. Bladder and prostate; cystoprostatectomy:

- Urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder, high grade, transmurally invasive
into

the perivesical and the leﬁ perivesicular adipose tissue.

- Urothelial carcinoma in situ.

present.

effect.

Interpretation performed by the Attending Pathologist and reviewed with the
Resident/Fellow [L MD
Electronically Signed Out by [] MD

Clinical History:
The patient is a year-old male with urothelial carcinoma undergoing a
cystoprostatectomy with lymph node dissection.

Specimens Received:

A: Left pelvic lymphnode

B: Left pelvic lymphnode

C: Right pelvic lymphnode

D: Bladder and prostate

E: Left distal ureteral stitch non margin
F: Left peri uroretral tissue

G: Right distal ureter stitch non margin

Gross Description:
The specimens are received in seven containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.

A. The ﬁrst container is additionally identiﬁed as, "left pelvic lymph node".
Received fresh for intraoperative consultation is a 4 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm aggregate

of matted, ﬁrm, ﬁbroadipose tissue adherent to a lymph node measuring 4 x 3.5
x 1.7 cm. A representative section of the lymph node is frozen and read as,
"metastatic urothelial carcinoma" per Dr. U. The remaining lymph node is
serially sectioned and entirely submitted as A2-A12. The remaining fibroadipose
tissue submitted as A13. The specimen is entirely submitted.

B. The second container is additionally identiﬁed as, “left pelvic lymph

node". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 5.5 x 4.2 x 1 cm aggregate of
yellow, lobulated ﬁbroadipose tissue. The specimen is dissected to reveal for
lymph node candidates ranging from 0.3-3 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen
is entirely submitted as follows

Bl : 2 lymph node candidates

B2: 1 lymph node candidate

B3-B4: l lymph node candidate, serially sectioned
B5-B9: Remaining ﬁbroadipose tissue

C. The third container is additionally identiﬁed as, "right pelvic lymph
node". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 6 x 4 x 1.5 cm aggregate of
soft, yellow, lobulated adipose tissue. The specimen is dissected to reveal 7
lymph node candidates ranging from 0.3-3.7 cm in greatest dimension. The
specimen is entirely submitted as follows

Cl: 3 lymph node candidates

C2-C4: l lymph node candidate, serially sectioned
C5: 1 lymph node candidate, serially sectioned
C6-C9: 1 lymph node candidate, serially sectioned

C 10-C12: l lymph node candidate, serially sectioned
C l 3-C14: Remaining ﬁbroadipose tissue

D. The fourth container is additionally identiﬁed as, "bladder and prostate".
Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 365.96 g, 19 x 11.5 x 5 cm

cystoprostatectomy specimen consisting of a 6.5 x 5.5 x 3 cm bladder with
attached mesenteric fat and a 5.3 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm prostate. The right seminal
vesicles measure 2.0 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm and right vas deferens measures 4 x 0.5 cm.
The left seminal vesicles measures 2.0 x 2.5 x 1.3 cm and left vas deferens
measures 4 x 0.5 cm. The right ureteral stump measures 2 x 0.4 cm, the left
measures 0.4 x 0.3 cm, and each demonstrates an intact, patent lumen. The
urethral stump measures 0.6 x 0.6 cm.

The right half of the prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left half is
inked black. The bladder and prostate are opened anteriorly along the urethra.
The outer surface of the prostate is reddish tan and shaggy. Sectioning
demonstrates diffuse white-tan, ill-deﬁned lesions, which cluster together
throughout the entire prostate. The ill-deﬁned white lesions abut black ink. A
gross photograph is taken.

The opened bladder reveals a 3 x 2.2 cm yellow-tan ulcer with a hyperemic border
in the leﬁ posterior and leﬁ lateral wall. On cut section, the mass measures

5.8 x 3 x 2.5 cm and extends into and through the muscularis propria into the
perivesical fat, abutting the lateral left margin and 0.1 cm ﬁ'om the deep

margin. Gross photographs are taken. The surrounding bladder mucosa is
wrinkled, pink-tan with a uniform 1.3 cm wall thickness. Bilateral ureteral
oriﬁces, adjacent to the trigone, are identiﬁed and probe patent.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

D1: Distal prostatic urethral margin

D2: Right ureter resection margin

D3: Left ureter resection margin

D4-D5: Prostate apex

D6-D8: Right prostate (apex to base)

D9-D1 1: Left prostate (apex to base)

D12—D13: Additional right side of prostate (near base)

D14: Representative right seminal vesicles and vas deferens
D15: Representative left seminal vesicles and vas deferens
D16: Right lateral wall

D17: Left lateral wall

D18: Trigone

Dl9: Anterior wall

D20: Posterior wall

D21: Dome

D22: Mass extending into pericystic fat, abutting lateral margin
D23: Mass closest to deep margin

D24—D26: Additional sections of mass

D27: Mass w/adjacent normal bladder parenchyma

E. The ﬁfth container is additionally identiﬁed as, "left distal ureter
stitch non-margin". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 0.3 cm portion

of ureter with a diameter of 0.3 cm oriented with a stitch on the non-margin
side. The opposite side is inked black and submitted en face El.

F. The sixth container is additionally identiﬁed as, "left periuroretral
tissue ". Received fresh and placed in formalin is an unoriented fragment of

yellow-tan soft tissue measuring 1.4 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted
in toto as F1.

G. The seventh container is additionally identiﬁed as, "right distal ureter
stitch on margin". Received fresh in place in formalin is a 1.3 cm portion of
ureter with a diameter of 0.3 cm and oriented with a stitch marking the
non-margin side. The opposite side is inked black and submitted en face G1.
