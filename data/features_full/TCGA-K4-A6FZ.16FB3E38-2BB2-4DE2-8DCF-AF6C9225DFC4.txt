a stitch measuring 1 Cd in length. Sectioning into the mass
shows that it invades the muscularis and appears less than 0.1

sectioned showing a cystic parenchyma. The right fallopian tube
is serially sectioned showing an unremarkable pinpoint lumen.
The left ovary is serially sectioned showing a cystic
parenchyma. The left jallopian tube is serially sectioned
showing a pinpoint and unremarkable lumen. No uterus is
identified. No lymph nodes are grossly identified in the fatty
tissue. The specimen .s represented as follows: urethral margin
