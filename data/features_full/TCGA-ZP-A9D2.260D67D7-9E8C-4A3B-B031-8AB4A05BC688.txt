A. The specimen is labeled "gallbladder." Received in
formalin is a 29 gram, 7.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm, gallbladder. The
cystic duct margin is removed and the specimen is opened to
reveal a pink-tan velvety mucosa with a wall thickness of
0.1 cm. Representative sections are submitted in cassette
A.

Accession #:

B. The specimen is labeled "tumor in border of segment 7
and 8." Received in formalin is a 34.6 gram, 4.8 x 4.5 x
3.5 cm, portion of liver. The specimen has been previously
incised to reveal three nodules. The first nodule measures
2.0 x 2.0 x 1.7 cm and is 0.3 cm from the closest
parenchymal margin and 0.5 cm from the closest capsular
margin. The second measures 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and abuts
the capsule and is 0.5 cm from the closest parenchymal
margin. The third measures 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and is 0.1 cm
from the capsule and 1.6 cm from the closest parenchymal
margin. The parenchymal surface is inked black.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Cassette Designation:
Bl«2 Representative section of first,
second, and third nodules with closest capsular
margin for all three and
closest parenchymal margin for nodules 2 and 3.
83 Representative section of first
nodule with closest parenchymal margin

C. The specimen is labeled "left lateral segment and
section segment 4." Received in formalin is a 324 gram,
16.0 x 12.5 x 3.5 cm, portion of liver; The specimen has
been previously incised to reveal a 3.3 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm firm,
tan, nodular lesion which is 0.5 cm from the capsular margin
and appears to abut the parenohymal margin. The remaining
portion of the liver is grossly unremarkable without
identifiable masses or lesions. The parenchymal margin is
inked black. No large identifiable vessels are noted.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Cassette Designation:

C1 Portion of liver nodule with
closest capsular margin

C2w3 Portion of liver lesion abutting
black inked parenchymal surface

C4 Additional representative section
of liver lesion

C5 Representative section of grossly

B and C. The specimens are histologically similar and are
described together. Sections show portions of liver
parenchyme that demonstrate mixed macro~ and micronodular
cirrhosis highlighted by a trichrome stain performed on
specimen C. Multiple large nodules of moderately
differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma are present that
exhibit an architecture with small cell change and
pseudocanalicular structures with prominent admixed
vasculature. The tumor cells contain bubbly lipid~laden
cytoplasm and pleomorphic nuclei with vesicular chromatin
and very prominent nucleolus as well as a high nuclear
cytoplasmic ratio. The tumor cells are present as nests and
pseudoglandular structures and exhibit occasional mitotic
figures and apoptoses. The tumor cell infiltrate involves
the cauterized and black inked parenchymal margin for
specimen C. However, the remaining nodules in the specimen
are well—circumscribed by dense fibrous capsule. A
reticulin stain performed on specimen B and C highlight
reticulin fiber loss within the tumor cell nodules and
thickening of cell plates as well as highlighting the
regenerative nodules in the uninvolved liver. The
background liver exhibits mixed macro— and micronodular
cirrhosis with portal areas that exhibit dense
lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with focal areas of bile duct
proliferation. A Prussian Blue stain for iron demonstrates
mild siderosis (+1) in the form of intrahepatic and kupffer
cell iron. Controls stained appropriately.
