cornu, and ~5.5 cm anterior posteriorly. The peritoneal
reflection is smooth; The endometrial cavity measures 6 cm in‘
length and 72.5 cm from cornu to cornu. The endometrial cavity is
pinkish-tan and shows a submucosal leiomyoma anteriorly, which
measures ~2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm. There are several well-circumscribed
intramural leiomyomas identified ranging in sire from 0.5 to ~l cm'
in greatest dimension. All leiomyomas show uniform grayish—white
cut surfaCes with prominent whorling patterns and are rubbery firm
in consistency. There is no hemorrhage, necrosis, or fleshy I
discolored areas identified. There is a large, fungating, focally
ulcerated mass in the cervix which measures ”6.5 x 6 x 3 cm. The
mass appears to arise from the transitional zone. The attached
vaginal cuff is ~1.2 cm to the closest inked margin, anteriorly,
and 1.3 cm posteriorly. After serial sectioning, tumor was found
to be the most deeply invasive in the anterior cervix where it is
”0.5 cm to the closest inked non-peritonealized margin. No
parametrial invasion is present. The myometrium averages 52 cm in
thickness. The right ovary measures 2.5 x 1.7 x 1.3 cm, with a
grayish-pink, wrinkled external surface, and shows an unremarkable
cut surface. The right fallopian tube measures 6.5 cm in length
and averages ”0.5 cm in diameter. The serosal surface is
grayish~pink, smooth, and grossly unremarkable. The left ovary
measures 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm. The external surface is grayish~pink,
wrinkled. and with focal areas of excision. The cut surface shows
a cystic space filled with clear fluid and measures ~1.1 cm in
diameter. The fallopian tube measures ~6.5 cm in length and
averages ”0.5 cm in diameter. The serosal surface is grayish-pink,
