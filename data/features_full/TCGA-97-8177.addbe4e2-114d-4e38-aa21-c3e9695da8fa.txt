CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Lung cancer

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh in five parts, each labeled with the
patient's name.

1. Part one is labeled 'station 7 lymph node'. It consists of a 0.7
x 0.6 x 0.3 cm irregular portion of pink yellow soft adipose tissue.
Entirely submitted in one cassette.

2. Part two is labeled 'station 11 lymph node'. It consists of a
1.5 x 1 x 0.6 cm aggregate of black soft rubbery anthracotic
lymphoid tissue. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

3. Part three is labeled 'station 12 lymph node'. It consists of 1

x 0.6 x 0.2 cm aggregate of black soft rubbery anthracotic lymphoid
tissue admixed with pink yellow soft adipose tissue. Entirely
submitted in one cassette.

4. Part four is labeled 'left lower lobectomy'. It consists of a

left lower lobectomy specimen measuring 15 x 13 x 5 cm. The
bronchial margin is (1.6 cm diameter) and vascular margin at the
hilum are grossly free of tumor. The pleura is grey-pink, glistening
and mottled; a 3 cm puckered area is noted at the upper outer aspect
of the lobe (inked in black). A staple line measures 5 cm in

length, which is shaved and the pleura around it is inked in black.
Beneath the puckered area, 1.2 cm from the bronchial resection
margin; a 4 x 4 x 3 cm grey-white firm tumor with ill-defined
borders is noted. The remainder of the parenchyma is pink-red,
blotchy and crepitant. Multiple peribronchial anthracotic firm
lymph nodes, ranging from 0.2 up to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension,
are identified from the hilar area. Representative sections are

submitted.

5. Part five is labeled 'station 5 lymph node'. It consists of a

2.3 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm aggregate of black soft rubbery anthracotic
lymphoid tissue admixed with yellow soft adipose tissue. Entirely
submitted in one cassette.

EGFR Mutation Analisis

Body Site: Lung

Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: Positive for the L858R mutation in Exon 21.

INTERPRETATION: The L858R mutation is reported to correlate with
responsiveness to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in
patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma.

COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 8% tumor
cellularity upon pathologist review.

A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was
identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
significance.

Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential
responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (T KI)
therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a
sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.

This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell

lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change
during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this
result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation

in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.

This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.

METHOD/LIMITATION:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY
KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS

Body Site: Lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma

RESULTS: Wild-type gene.

INTERPRETATION:
No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.

COMMENT:

Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor
prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS
mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking
history.

This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of

the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for
use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh,
frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular
the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal
cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these
mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor
KRAS mutations (e. g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,
etc.).

Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide
additional information regarding this patient's probability of
response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if

clinically indicated. See references.

METHOD/LIMITAT IONS:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.
