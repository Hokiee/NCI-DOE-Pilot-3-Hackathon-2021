 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
PART 1:

KIDNEY, RIGHT, RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY —

A. RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CLEAR CELL TYPE.
FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE IS 3 of 4.

THE GREATEST DIAMETER OF THE NEOPLASM IS 10.6 cm. .
THE NEOPLASM EXTENDS OUTSIDE THE RENAL CAPSULE INTO THE PERINEPHRIC FAT.

NO EVIDENCE OF ANGIOLYMPHATIC iNVASION IS IDENTIFIED. .

UPPER POLE SOFT TISSUE RESECTION MARGIN IS INVOLVED BY NEOPLASM (ALSO SEE PART 2).
NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY ADJACENT TO TUMOR SHOWS MILD INTERSTITIAL CHRONIC INFLAMMATION,
MODERATE ARTERIAL AND ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS.

H. TNM STAGE: pTSa NX MX.

 

PEEP???

PART 2:
SOFT TISSUE, RIGHT UPPER POLE MARGIN, RESECTION -

A. RENAL CELL CARCINOMA WITH FAT INVASION.
B. MARGIN IS INVOLVED BY CARCINOMA (SEE COMMENT).

PART 3:
ADRENAL GLAND, LEFT, ADRENALECTOMY (31.5 GRAMS) --

A. ADRENOCORTICAL ADENOMA (2.0 CM).
B. NO INVOLVEMENT BY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA.

COMMENT: ' ' " " '
Grossly and microscopically, the tumor shows extracapsular extension at upper pole with positive margin at disrupted

edge in part1. Upper pole margin received separately in Part 2 shows the margin involved by cauterizecl turner.
