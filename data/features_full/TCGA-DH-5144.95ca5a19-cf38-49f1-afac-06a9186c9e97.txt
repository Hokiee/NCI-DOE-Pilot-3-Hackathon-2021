SPECIMEN{S) SUBMITTED/ PROCEDURES ORDERED:

 

CLINICAL HISTORY: Tumor, right frontal region.
GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received the following specimen in the Department of
Pathology, labeled with the patient's name and
A. Brain tumor ‘
A. The specimen is received fresh, designated "brain tumor," and
consists of a 4.8 x 4.4 x 2.0 cm domed-shaped portion of cortical gray
matter and underlying subcortical white matter. There is focal
hemorrhage on the cortical surface and the deep surfaces are cauterized
and irregular. Cut sections reveal smudged gray— —white junction with an
ill— defined mass homogenous soft beige tissue. A representative portion
is submitted for frozen section. Frozen section diagnosis is,
“infiltrating glioma, sus ect oligodendroma, grade deferred to permanent
sections," per Dr. The frozen tissue is submitted in cassette
FSAI and additional sections are submitted in cassettes AZHAS. -

DIAGNOSIS:

A. "Brain tumor, right frontal, resection":
Anaplastic oligodendroglioma (WHO Grade III)(see
comment)

COMMENT: Extensive areas of diffuse "low grade" oligodendroglioma are
noted in this well—sampled lesion. However, there are also several foci
of increased cellularity having mitoses and early vascular endothelial
proliferation. The Ki—67 labeling index in areas of increased
cellularity is around 7—12%. GFAP is reactive in microgemistocytic forms
and so— called "gliofibrillary oligodendrocytes” The results of FISH
analysis to determine the status of chromosomes 1p and 19q will be added
as an addendum to this report.

"I, or my qualified designee, have performed the gross examination and
description and I have personally reviewed the gross description and
specimen preparations referenced herein, and have personally issued this

report."

characteristics determined by Some tests
have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

The FDA has determined that such clearance is not necessary. These tests
are used for clinical purposes and should not be regarded as
investigational or for research. This laborator is certified under the
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of as qualified
to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

ADDENDUM:

FLUORESCENCE IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION (FISH) WAS PERFORMED ON REPRESENTATIVE
PARAFFIN-EMBEDDED TUMOR TISSUE

IN THIS CASE, DELETIONS OF BOTH 1P AND 19Q WERE IDENTIFIED.

CLINICAL STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT COMBINED LOSS OF CHROMOSOME 19 AND

 

19¢ IN OLIGODENDROGLIAL BRAIN TUMORS MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH PROLONGED
SURVIVAL AND ENHANCED RESPONSE TO CHEMOTHERAPY (REFS 1—5).
