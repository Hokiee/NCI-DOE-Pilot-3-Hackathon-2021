CLINICAL NOTES
CLINICAL HISTORY: Left frontal brain tumor.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS
FSA) Left frontal - At least anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade
III). Final grade deferred to permanent sections.

FSB) Brain tumor — Predominantly clude rare
microscopic involvement by tumor. _

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Received fresh for frozen section, labeled "brain tumor"
are irregularly shaped fragments of hemorrhagic tissue that

measure 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm. in dimension. Half of the spe is
frozen and the remainder is taken for permanent section.
B. Received fresh for frozen section, labeled "b umor"

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Microscopic sections of the left frontal brain tumor
reveals a malignant diffuse glioma. The tumor does have

diffuse high grade astrocyti s suggested by the
patient's prior core biopsy . The current material,
however, does have what app godendroglial
differentiation suggesting the lesion is actually a mixed glioma.
For tha con up

review se d
categorized it as an anaplastic oligoastrocytoma WHO grade III. They

will be doing a FISH study for the 1P/19Q deletion which is seen in
oligodendrogliomas. That result will be reported separately.
