tubes and ovaries. The 170 gram hysterectomy specimen is 10.0 cm from
fundus to exocervix, 7.0 cm from cornu to cornu, and 3.5 cm anterior to
posterior. The serosa is dusky pink—tan and smooth. The cervix is 3.0
Cm long, and 3.5 cm wide. The ectocervical mucosa is gray-white,
smooth, glistening with a 0.3 cm slit-like 05. The specimen is bivalved 3;

friable fragmented mass that is raised above the endometrium; llo cm;
The mass occupies the entire endometrium and approaches the lower
uterine segment. The mass is sectioned to reveal a 0.3 cm depth of
invasion into the upper myometrium on the anterior aspect. The mass is
located 1.9 cm from the serosa, and 3.0 cm from the ectocervical mucosa.

pinkstan and smooth. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a
complete pinpoint lumen. The attached right enlarged cerebriform like
ovary is 6 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm. The external surface is tan—gray and
uniformly hemorrhagic. The specimen is sectioned to reveal multiple
subcortical cysts ranging form 0.2 to 0.3 cm, some of which are filled
with clotted blood and some of which contain clear solid fluid. All of ' .
the subcortical cyst have a smooth inner lining. Located centrally in
the ovary is one large fluid filled Cystic structure, 1.5 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm
that has a smooth inner lining. The remaining cut surface is tan—gray
and glistening. A portion of the ovary is submitted for frozen tissue
bank. The attached left fimbriated fallopian tube is 4.0 cm in length
and has a uniform diameter of 0.7 cm. The mucosa is dusky purple—pink
and smooth. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a complete
pinpoint lumen. The attached left enlarged cerebriform like ovary is 4
x 3 x 2.5 cm. The external surface is tan—gray and focally hemorrhagic.
The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal multiple subcortical cysts
ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension, some of which are
filled with clear straw—like fluid and some of which are filled with
mucinous material. All of the subcortical cysts have a smooth inner
lining. The remaining cut surface is tan-pink and glistening.
