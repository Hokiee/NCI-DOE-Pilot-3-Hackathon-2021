Diagnosis
1. Carcinoma inﬁltrates in four of seven lymph nodes, right (4/7).

2. Four tumor-free lymph nodes, leﬁ (3/4).
3. Soft tissue with extensive inﬁltrates of a poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma.

4. Poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma of theabladder with inﬁltration of all parietal
layers, melu'drng'tlfe’periveshi‘cal”'fatty‘t’iss‘ue e’xtending as far as the surgical preparation
margin, the right seminal vesicle and the right ureter. Multifocal invasion of the lymph and
blood vessels. Dysplasia of preserved urothelial sections.

Prostate shows inﬁltrates of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate on both
sides that is conﬁned to the organ, above all in the right peripheral area (Gleason 4+5=9).
Gleason 4: 40%; Gleason 5: 30%. The few parts showing Gleason 3 pattern are by deﬁnition

not included in the ﬁnal Gleason score. Maximum tumor size 0.9 cm.

Tumor classiﬁcation of urothelial carcinoma:
pT4b, L1, V1, R1, pN2 (4/11).

Comment

In the previous frozen sections, parts showing carcinoma in situ were still found in the area of
the right ureter resection margin. The follow-up resection material was free of tumor and
dysplasia. But inﬁltration of the pelvic wall and involvement of the cystectomy preparation
margin gave R1 status.
