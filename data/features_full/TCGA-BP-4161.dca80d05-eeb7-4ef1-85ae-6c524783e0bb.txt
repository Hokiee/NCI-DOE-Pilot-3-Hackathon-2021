l) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right kidney,
adrenal and ureter and pericaval lymph node". It consists of a
right kidney, segments of a ureter, renal blood vesaels and
attached perinephric adipose tissue, weighing 500 grams overall.
The kidney measures 10 x 5 x 4.5 cm and a portion of unremarkable
ureter measures 8 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. The
kidney is bivalved to reveal a bright yellow, wellwdemarcated,
renal tumor and measuring 5.5 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm. Gerota's fascia is
inked. The tumor is serially sectioned to reveal that it does
not extend into the perinephric adipose tissue, The renal
capsule surrounding the tumor is intact. The pelvicalyxeal
system is free of tumor. The rest of the renal parenchyma is
unremarkable. After careful examination of the perinephric
adipose tissue, no adrenal gland is identified. The renal vein is
free of tumor. The hilar region of the kidney is free of tumor.
No lymph nodes are identified despite extensive sectioning.
Representative sections are submitted. Gross photographs of the
specimen are taken. Tumor submitted for TPS.

Summary of Sections:

SM — Ureteral and vascular surgical margins

T — Tumor

K ~ Normal kidney . 7
SAT — Hilar adipose tissue.

2} The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Portion of

right 11th rib“. It consists of fragments of rib bone, measuring

5 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm in aggregate. Representative sections are
submitted after decalcification.

Summary of Sections:
U — Undesignated

3) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Perinephric
fat". It consists of fragments of adipose tissue, covered by
glistening membrane, measuring in aggregate 13 x 8 x 3 cm. The
cut surface of the specimen is unremarkable. Representative
sections are submitted in three cassettes.

Summary of Sections:
U — Undesignated
