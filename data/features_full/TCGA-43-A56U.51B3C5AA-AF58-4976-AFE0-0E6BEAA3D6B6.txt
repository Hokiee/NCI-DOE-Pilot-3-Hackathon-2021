Procedure:

Diagnosis
A,B,C. Lymph nodes, L10, level 11, and level 5, excisions ~
Negative for malignancy.

D. Lung, left upper lobe, excision —

Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (see microscopic
description).

Margins negative for malignancy.

Two hilar lymph nodes negative for malignancy

Microscopic Description:

Histologic type: Squamous cell carcinoma comprising the mass lesion in
the left upper lobe, part D

Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated

Primary tumor (pT): The tumor is 2.1 cm in greatest dimension, without
pleural invasion present (ple)

Margins of resection: The bronchial and vascular resection margins are
negative for tumor

Direct extension of tumor: Not identified

Vascular invasion: Not identified

Regional lymph nodes (pN): pNO. The separately submitted lymph nodes
in parts A, B, and C, as well as two hilar lymph nodes that are
identified in part D, are negative for tumor

Distant metastasis (pM): Not applicable

Comment: has reviewed this case and concurs with the
interpretation

Specimen

A. L10 lymph node
B. Level 11

C. Level 5

D. Left upper lobe

Clinical Information
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Lung cancer

Gross Description

A. Received fresh in a container labeled "LlO lymph node" are multiple
irregular soft pink— black tissue fragments, in aggregate 1 x 1 x O 3
cm. Due to fragmentation, it is not possible to enumerate lymph nodes.
AS 1, following fixation

B. Received fresh in a container labeled "level ll" is a 0.8 x 0.5 x
0.3 cm soft pink-red irregular tissue fragment. ASvl, following
fixation.

C. Received fresh in a container labeled "level 5" is a l x l x 0.5 cm
soft black-pink irregular tissue fragment. It is sectioned. AS-l,
following fixation.

D. Received fresh in a container labeled "left upper lobe" is a 25 x 8
x 4 cm lobe of lung compatible with left upper lobe. The pleural
surface is pink—tan, smooth, and glistening, with diffuse black
stippling present. The pleural surface is inked blue. Sectioning

through the lung reveals a firm pink nodule located toward the inferior
aspect of the lobe, spanning an area 2.1 x 1.7 x 1.7 cm. There is no
umbilication of the overlying pleura, without gross evidence of pleural
invasion, and the lesion is 5.5 cm from the hilum. The remainder of
the lung is pink—red and spongy, without additional focal lesion. The
bronchial and vascular margins are grossly unremarkable. There are a
few possible soft hilar lymph nodes present. Tissue is taken for
tissue procurement per the clinical request. RS—7, following fixation,
according to the accompanying block summary.

BLOCK SUMMARY: Dl - hilar lymph nodes; D2 - bronchial & vascular
margin; D3‘D6 - entire lesion; D7 — lung away from lesion.
