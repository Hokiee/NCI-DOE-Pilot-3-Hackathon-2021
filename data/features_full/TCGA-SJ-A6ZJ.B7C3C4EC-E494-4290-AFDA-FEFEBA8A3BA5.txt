Qmsg Description
The specimen is received in 4 parts:

A. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section labeled "UI‘ERINE CORPUS, TUBES, OVARIES” and consists of a 690 g.
previously opened, enlarged and distorted uterine corpus without cervix. 11 cm from fundus to the resection margin. 9 cm from cornu
to comu and 8 cm from anterior to posterior. There are bilateral attached adnean‘he serosa is tan-pink. smooth and glistening with
approximately 8 subserosal nodules. up to 7 cm in greatest dimension. The anterior portion is inked red and the posterior portion is
inked black. Within the endometrial cavity is a 8 x 5 x 2.5 cm tan. papillary, friable mass that comes to within 5 cm ﬁom the posterior
margin of resection and 7 cm from the anterior margin of resection. The mass is 20% on the anterior aspect and 80% en die posterior
aspect. The mass involves the outer half of a 4 cm thick endoemtrium. At the deepest site of invasion the mass measures approxmately
2.5 cm in thickness. The uninvolved endometrium is tan—pink. glistening and up to 0.2 cm thick. Within the myometrium are
approximately Sand white, ﬁrm, whoried bulging nodules. up to 3.5 cm in greatest dimension. No areas of hemorrhage or necrosis
within the nodules is identiﬁed, however the largest subserosal nodule is focally calciﬁed.

The left adnexal unit consists of a ﬁmbriated fallopian tube. 4.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter and ovary, 3 x 2.5 x 0.8 cm. The
right adnexal unit consists of a fallopian tube, 5 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter. and an ovary, 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The outer surfaces
of the ovaries are tan pink and cerebriform. Sectioning reveals variegated and unremarkable cut surfaces. The mess of the fallopian
tubes are grey purple. smooth and glistening. Sectioning reveals patent. pinpoint lumens. Rep. sections are submitted as follows:
Al-FSA l, posterior endomyometrium with mass

AZ-anterior lower uterine segment

AS-posterior lower uterine segment

A4-A5-anterior endomyometrium
