SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

SPECIMEN
A. sigmoid colon
B. Distal margin

CLINICAL NOTES

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. Received fresh, then fixed in formalin, labeled

"sigmoid colon", is an 18 cm. long portion of colon, opened
at one end (inked blue) and stapled at the opposite end (inked
black). The specimen is partially covered with pink—tan, smooth and
glistening serosa. Externally, there is a focus of adhesions, 4 x 3
cm., located 3.5 cm. from the nearest luminal margin (inked black).
The mucosa is pink—tan, smooth and glistening, with normal to
abundant folds, and average circumference of 6 cm. There is a 4 x
3.5 cm. ulcerated tumor, 3.5 cm. from the nearest luminal margin
(inked black), and contiguous with the focus of serosal adhesions.
This focus of adhesion is inked blue. The tumor shows gross
invasion into the muscularis propria, and appears to penetrate
through the fat, to within 0.3 cm. of the surgical margin of the
adhesion. The focus of the radial margin is grossly unremarkable.
The remainder of the mucosa is pink-tan, smooth and glistening, with
two polypoid lesions, 0.3 cm. in greatest dimension, located within
2 cm. of the black inked margin and 5.5 cm. of the blue inked
margin. These show no gross invasion. Lymph nodes are identified
in the fat. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as
follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - Representative luminal margins; 2 - polyps, full
thickness; 3—5 - representative sections of tumor, including
representative to normal and representative to surgical margin; 6 -
six possible lymph nodes, with representative cross sections of
vasculature; 7 - nine lymph nodes; 8 - seven lymph nodes; 9 — three
lymph nodes. RS-9

B. Received in formalin, labeled "distal margin", is a 1.5

cm. long portion of annular tissue, which is stapled at one
end and opened at the opposite end. The staples are irregular. The
staples are removed and the remainder of the specimen is entirely
submitted in one cassette. AS—l

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma (sigmoid colon).
Histologic grade: Moderately-differentiated.
Primary tumor: carcinoma penetrates through muscularis propria, but
does not reach serosal surface (pT3).
Margins (Proximal, Distal, Radial): Negative.

Distance of tumor from closest margin: 1.5 cm (radial)
Vascular invasion: Not identified. lmmunostains for CD34, CD31,
and desmin performed to exclude large vessel invasion, along with an

elastic stain. Regional lymph nodes (le): Carcinoma present
in 3 of 25 lymph nodes (3/25).

Non-lymph node pericolonic tumor: Not identified.

other findings: Hyperplastic polyps (2).

Comment: portions of this case (lymph nodes) were reviewed with

[A few of the antibodies used in our laboratory may be classified as
analyte specific reagents. These antibodies are monitored and
controlled in our laboratory and their performance for in vitro
diagnosis is well described in the medical literature. They have

not been cleared or approved by the FDA.]

DIAGNOSIS
A. Colon, sigmoid, Segmental resection:
Adenocarcinoma, moderately-differentiated.
Carcinoma penetrates through muscularis propria, but does
not reach the serosal surface.

Margins of excision negative.
Carcinoma is present in three of twenty-five lymph nodes

(3/25).

B. Colon, Distal Margin, Segmental Resection:
No malignancy identified.
