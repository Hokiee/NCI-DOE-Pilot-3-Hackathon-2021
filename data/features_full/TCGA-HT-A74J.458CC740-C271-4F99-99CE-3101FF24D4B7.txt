Diagnosis:

Left temporal brain tumor
Oligoastrocytoma, grade ll
MlB-l Ll= 5.1%

Discussion:

oligodendroglia lineage. Scattered MlB-l reactive cells are present with a labeling index
of 5.1%.

Microscopic Description:

Sections demonstrate a variably but generally moderately hypercellular diffusely
infiltrating glial neoplasm. Rare markedly hypercellular foci are seen. ATPase
consistently mild. The tumor includes both classic oligodendroglioma and ﬁbrillary
astrocytoma phenotypes. A rare mitotic figure is seen in the most hypercellular region.
There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis.
