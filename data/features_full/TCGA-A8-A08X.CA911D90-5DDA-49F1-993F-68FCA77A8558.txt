Diagnosis:
Poorly differentiated invasive, du‘ctal carcinoma with focal intraductai components and

angioinvasion (maximum microscopic tumor diameter: 4.0 cm).

Diagnosis:

1. Ablateglereast sample with extensive further invasive and angioinvasive
tumor components, as well as foci of further intraductai tumor components in the
cavity region of the sample excision (maximum spread: 8 cm). Massive subepidermal

carcinomatous lymphangitis of the skin spindle. Dorsal resection margin tumor-free.

Comment:
The massive subepidermal carcinomatous lymphangitis in the region of the skin
spindle could correlate closely with the clinical appearance of an inflammatory

carcinoma, although there is no ulceration of the skin spindle.

This gives rise to the concluding tumor classiﬁcation NOS, G lll, pT3N3aL1V1RO.
