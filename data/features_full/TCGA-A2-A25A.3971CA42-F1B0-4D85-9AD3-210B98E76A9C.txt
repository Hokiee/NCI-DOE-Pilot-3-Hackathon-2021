SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Patient: Specimen #:

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. LEFT BREAST MASTECTOMY received fresh is a 243.0 gram simple mastectomy
specimen, 15.5 x 15.0 x 3.3 cm, with overlying ellipse of nipple bearing
skin, 4.8 x 3.3 cm. The skin and nipple are unremarkable. The specimen is
oriented with sutures (longalateral, short=superior) and inked as follows:
Blue-superior superficial, green-inferior superficial, and
black-posterior. Sectioning reveals a 3.2 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm tumor centrally
extending into the upper inner quadrant. The tumor has poorly defined
stellate borders and a firm, tan, gritty cut surface. It is located 0.3 cm
from the inked posterior margin. The remaining tissue is predominantly
fibrous with a few admixed fluid filled cysts. Sections of skin, tumor,
and grossly unremarkable fibrous tissue harvested for the CBCP protocol;
matching paraffin sections are as follows:

A1: Skin, medial tip.
A2: Tumor, lateral portion.
A3: Fibrous, 1.0 cm inferior to tumor.
A4: Fibrous, 2.0 cm inferior to tumor.
A5: Fibrous, 5.0 cm inferior to tumor.

Sections through the nipple are placed in cassette labeled A6. There is no
surgical scar visible. There is a detached fragment of skin measuring 3.4
x 2.1 x 1.6 cm. A representative section from this tissue fragment is
placed in cassette A7. Representative sections of tumor are placed in
cassettes A8 through A10. Other representative sections are as follows:

A11: Upper inner quadrant.
A12: Lower inner quadrant.
A13: Lower outer quadrant.
A14: Upper outer quadrant. 14CFSS.

B. RIGHT BREAST received fresh is a 336.0 gram simple mastectomy specimen,
18.0 x 12.5 x 2.5 cm. The specimen is oriented with sutures (long-lateral,
