CLINICAL INFORMATION
The patient is with a liver biopsy performed at an outside hospital which showed hepatocellular ominom‘.
The patient now undergoes right hepatic lobectomy.

GROSS DESCRIPTIONS

One appropriately labeled, formalin—ﬁlled, container is received. It contains a portion of right lobe of liver
weighing 321.2 grams and measuring 6.5 x 13.2 x 6.2 cm. cm. A small portion of tissue at the medial
side was sent for tissue procurement. The surgical margin is black. There is a 7.2 cm. (lateral to medial),
3.6 cm. (anterior to posterior), and a 5.2 cm. (superior to inferior) ﬁrm, well demarcated mass at the
lateral side of the specimen. The mass is tan/white with focal bile staining. Grossly, the mass approaches
the the capsule on the anterior, posterior, and inferior surfaces, however the capsule appears intact. The
mass is 1.5 cm. away from the surgical margin. There is also a 0.7 cm. well demarcated small nodule
adjacent at the medial site which is separate from the main mass. The remaining liver parenchyma is
unremarkable. The attached gallbladder has been previously opened. The gallbladder appears
unremarkable. No stones are identiﬁed.

LIGHT MICROSCOPY

Light microscopic examination is performed.

Sections reveal that both of the grossly identiﬁed masses are moderately differentiated hepatocellular"
carcinomai'he tumor cells have a cord-like distribution and display moderate nuclear atypia. The tumor
closely approaches the hepatic capsule, but does not invade through it. Apparent lymphovascular space
invasion is present within the liver in the area of the gallbladder bed. The surrounding, non-neoplastic
liver shows some bile stasis, which is predominantly intrahepatocellular. There is mild bile duct
proliferation and scattered neutrophilic aggregates within portal areas and sinusoids. These ﬁndings are
suggestive of a biliary obstruction, possibly secondary to the tumor. Also present are mild portal
lymphocytic inﬁltrates, consistent with a mild (Grade 1) chronic hepatitis. Viral cytopathic

effect is not noted. An iron stain shows no evidence of iron accumulation within the liver. There is no
evidence of ﬁbrosis or cirrhosis. Small foci of macrovesicular steatosis are noted.

 

DIAGNOSIS

LIVER, RIGHT LOBE, LOBECTOMY - MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED HEPATOCELLULAR
CARCINOMA, TWO FOCI (7.2 AND 0.7 CM. GREATEST DIMENSIONS)

- LYMPHOVASCULAR SPACE INVASION IDENTIFIED

— SURGICAL MARGIN FREE OF TUMOR

GALLBLADDER, TOTAL REMOVAL - NO SPECIFIC PATHOLOGIC ABNORMALITY
