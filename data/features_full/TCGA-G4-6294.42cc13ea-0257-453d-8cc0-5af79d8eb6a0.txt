SPECIMEN(S):
A. RIGHT COLON RESECTION B. LIVER BX

CLINICAL HISTORY:
with ca. colon

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

RIGHT COLON RESECTION
Specimen consists of resected short segment of right colon measuring 15 cm in Iength.,with attached
adherent indurated adipose tissue. Large firm palpable mass occupies mid portion of the specimen
,which when the specimen is opened, shows an obstructing circumferential exophytic tumor measuring
4 x 3.7 x 3.5 cm, involving cecum and extending to ileocecal valve and seen 3 cm from ileal margin and
6 cm from distal colonic margin of resection. The tumor on sections shows a tan-cream-white surface
and infiltrates entire colonic wall with apparent extension to subjacent adipose tissue. Tumor occludes
cecal lumen. Attached adipose tissue measures 11 x 5 x 2.5 cm. Appendix is not identified. Multiple
sections submitted and labelled as follows.

A1 -A4: one transverse section of tumor divided into four sections

A5-A7: additional tumor representative

A8: colonic margin

A9: representative of colon

A10: representatives of ileum

A11: distal ileal margin

A12: three lymph nodes, one bisected and inked

A13: three lymph nodes, one inked and bisected

A14: three lymph nodes

A15: one bisected lymph node
LIVER BIOPSY
Received in formalin is a portion of tan brown soft tissue measuring 1.2x0.7x0.5cm. which is previously
iartially bisected. The specimen is further sectioned and submitted completely in cassette B.
