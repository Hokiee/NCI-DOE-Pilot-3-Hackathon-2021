GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) ABDOMINAL WALL NODULE — An irregular piece of adipose tissue 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm. There is a white. hard area at the
center which is 3.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm. The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted for fr ‘ ' .

*FS/DX: POORLY DIFFERENTIATED CARCINOMA, COULD BE MULLERIAN. m
(B) ANTERIOR ABDOMINAL PERITONEUM ~ The specimen consists of a fragment of II we Ipose issue (5.0 x 2.0 x 0.3 cm).

The specimen is involved by tumor (4.2 cm). Representative sections are submitted in cassettes Bi and 82. 9
(C) SMALL BOWEL NODULE — Two tan—pink nodules (0.4 x 0.4 x 0.3 and 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm). Specimen is en Ire 3.! submitted in

 

—
(o) MESENTERY SMALL INTESTINE; ‘an-pink nodule (0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm). Spet tn is entirely submitted rm
(E) RIGHT TUBE AND OVARY — A friab- papillary tumor mass (9.0 x 5.0 x 3.2 cm). The fallopian tube is 9.5 cm . cm
in average diameter. The cut surface of the falicpian tube contains tumor nodules (0.3 cm in diameter). Frozen section was
performed. Sections are submitted as follows.

SECTION CODE: E‘l-E2, frozen section; E3-E1 1, samples of tumor; E12, sample of fallopian tube with

tumor.
*FS/DX: HiGH—GRADE CARCINOMA WITH PAPILLARY AREAS CONSISTENT WETH PRIMARY OF THE OVARY.

E, LEFT OVARY — The specimen consists of a portion of fallopian tube (7.0 cm in length, 0.8 cm in diameter), and a
tumor-replaced distorted ovary (6.5 x 5.0 x 4.0 cm). The tumor involves the entire ovary and it shows extensive involvement of the
surface. Sectioning of the tumor shows areas with different appearance. The majority of the tumor has a pink~red cut surface.
Other areas show a white—yellow cut surface. The fallopian tube appears able.

SECTION CODE: F1—F10, ovary and tumor; F11, fallopian tube. m
(G) CUL—DE—SAC TUMOR — The specimen consists of an ovoid fra men 0 an ttissue (4.2 x 2.6 x 2.0 cm). The cut surface is
tan—yellow. Representative sections are submitted in Gt-G4. i
(H) CUL-DE-SAC TUMOR #2 — Three irregular hemorrhagic friable soft tissue fragments (2.7 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm in aggregate).
Representative sections are submitted.

SECTION CODE: H, tumor. 7
(I) UTERUS AND CERVlX — Uterus without adnexal structures (10.7 x 7.2 x 4.0 cm) with multiple friable tumor nodules
predominantly on the posterior/inferior aspect. The remainder of the serosal surface is unremarkable. One sessile polyp is
present on the anterior uterine wail (1.0 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm). The remainder of the endometrium is unremarkable and is 0.2 cm in
greatest thickness. The myometrium is 2.4 cm thick and contains two ieiomycmata measuring 0.3 and 1.5 cm in greatest
diameter. The endocervical and cervical mucosa are unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted.

SECTlON CODE: I1 and I2, polyp; i3, anterior endometrium; I4, anterior lower uterine segment; I5, posterior
endometrium; l6, posterior lower uterine segment; i7 and i8, leicm oma' IQ right cervix; liO, left cervix; l11-ltT, tumor on the
serosal aspect, I14, tumor around the lower uterine segment. h
(J) OMENTUM — An irregularly shaped segment of omentum (18.0 X 5.0 X 20.0 X 4.2 cm) with multiple tan—white firm tumor
nodules ranging from 0.3 to 9.0 cm in greatest diameter. Representative sections are submitted.

SECTION CODE: J1-J7, tumor.
