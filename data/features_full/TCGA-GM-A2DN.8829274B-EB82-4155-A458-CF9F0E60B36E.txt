COMMENT
In the left mastectomy specimen, there is extensive DCIS which is associated with both feel of invasive carcinoma. The DCIS
involves an area of breast tissue which is estimated to measure 7 to 8 cm. The two foci of invasive carcinoma are separated by
approximately 2.0 cm of breast tissue which has foci of DCIS. There is a morphologic spectrum of DCIS ranging from low grade
to high grade with necrosis. Both invasive carcinomas have an associated prominent lymphocytic response. The nuclear grade

of the invasive carcinoma ranges from intermediate to high grade.

The additional submitted margins and final margin status were discussed with Dr. The additional submitted margins
(specimens D-F) appear to cover the superficial aspect of both tumors.

 

Specimen D has skin and breast tissue and the true surgical resection margins (superior/lateral aspect of the specimen) are
negative for invasive and in situ carcinoma. There are some glands at the deep aspect of this specimen which are most likely
benign but are difficult to interpret due to cautery artifact. This area does not correspond to true surgical margin.

Specimen F has skin and breast tissue, and the true surgical resection margins (inferior/lateral aspect of the specimen) are
negative for invasive and in situ carcinoma. In this specimen, there is a small focus of a cauterized atypical ductal proliferation
present at the superior edge of the specimen which does not represent true margin in this specimen. The differential diagnosis
includes a small focus of residual DCIS, atypical ductal hyperplasia or secretory change with cytologic atypia.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT AXlLLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1. NOT BLUE, COUNT 9 - A single lymph node (1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm). The
specimen is serially sectioned and four touch preparations are performed. Entirely submitted in A1 -A2.

"TP/DX: NO TUMOR IDENTIFIED.

(8) LEFT BREAST, AXILLARY CONTENTS, SHORT STITCH AT 12 O‘CLOCK - A radical mastectomy specimen measures 27.0
x 18.0 x 4.0 cm with an ellipse of skin (5.5 x 5.0 cm), unremarkable nipple (0.8 x 0.8 cm) and axillary contents (9.0 x 4.0 x 3.0 cm).

The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 16 slices. The nipple is located on slice 7. Located at the
outer upper quadrant, 1 o'clock, approximately 7.0 cm from the nipple is an ill-defined firm, white mass (2.5 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm). The
mass is approximately 0.6 cm from the closest superior superficial margin. Another ill-defined firm area (1.5 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm) is
inferior to the first mass in the lateral aspect of the breast at approximately 2 o'clock. This lesion is approximately 2 cm from the 1
o’clock tumor, does not appear to be connected to the 1 o'clock tumor, and abuts the inferior superficial margin. There is an
exophytic granular area on the skin surface at about 11 o‘clock, measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The remainder of the specimen is
unremarkable. The specimen is radiographed after slicing. The suspicious areas are marked by the radiologist. Multiple lymph
nodes are identified.

Representative section of the normal and tumor tissue are submitted for tumor bank.
