Physician{s):

STORY

oman presented with partial seizyre, and has a
left frontal mass with focal enhancement.

OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
Not Given

Operation/Specimen: Brain tumor, biopsy

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:

A. Brain, site not specifieds cxcisional biopsy: Olicodendro lioma.
B. Brain, site not specified, excisional biopsies

Oligodendroqlioma, focally anaplastic.
Sec Comment and Microsc0py Description.

COMMENT
Part A is portions of cerebrum with an oligodendroglioma WHO

grade II/IV.
The morphology of the neoplasm is consistent with a positive LOH

tumor.
Part B contains tumor similar to that one in part B, but with a

focal
area of anaplasia, i.e. an oligodendroglioma WHO grade III/IV.
Overall the neoplasm is a grade II oligodendroglioma, but it has
a small
zone with anaplastic change
The morphological findings may be correlated with clinical,

imaging, and
operative findings for their final interpretation and patient's follow

up.

products

detected by gel electrophoresis.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results
from a

stand-alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its
performance

characteristics determined by the AP Molecular Pathology laboratory as
required by-egulations. It has not been Cleared or approved

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Part A.

Portions of cerebrum diffusely infiltrated by a neoplastic
proliferation of

uniform round nuclei with perinuclear haloes and slight pleomorphism..
The

neoplasm infiltrates the cortex, with perinuclear satellitosis and
intervening

reactive astrocytes. The mitotic rate is about 2 mitoses/10 high
power fields

(40x). The vessels are focally prominent, but there is no
microvascular

cellular proliferation. There is no necrosis

Part B.

From the Tumor Tissue Bank, sections contain portions of cerebrum with
a neoplasm similar to the one in part A. In this specimen, however,
there is a

focal area of tumor necrosis surrounded by neoplasm with microvascular
cellular proliferation.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP depicts a spares gliofibrillary
background.

About 20% of the cells over express the p53 protein. With the MIB—l
there is

a proliferation index of about 12% in the more active areas.
