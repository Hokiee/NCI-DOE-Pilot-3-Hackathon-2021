Surgical Pathology Consultation Report

SPECIMENIS) RECEIVED

1. Thymus: THYMUS GLAND, THYMOMA, AND PERICARDIUM (long stitch on
pericardium, short stitch on left lobe of gland)

DIAGNOSIS
1. Thymus gland
a) Thymoma with focal microscopic extension beyond limiting capsule
into immediately adjacent
mediastinal fat, 3.0 cm maximudeimension.
See comment
b) Background non—neoplastic thymus shows involution consistent with
patient's age
c) No significant lymphoid hyperplasia evident

COMMENT

The sections show a "predominantly mixed" (Lattes/Bernatz), "cortical
type" (Muller Hemelink), “Type 32" (WHO) thymoma. In most areas this
lobulated tumor is confined by an external capsule and is well within the
external margin of the specimen as indicated by prior AgNO3 application.
However, the tumor does extend directly through the capsule into the
adjacent mediastinal connective tissue in several areas and in at least 2
such areas the tumor appears to be essentially juxtaposed to the external
margin of the specimen. By convention therefore the tumor is considered
to be a malignant thymoma and consideration should be given to the
possibility of incomplete resection. There is no tumor extension to or
into the patch of pericardium which was marked by a long stitch.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

The specimen container labeled with the patient' 3 name and as "thymus
gland, thymoma and pericardium (long stitch on pericardium, short stitch
on left lobe of gland“, contains a single piece of oriented yellow fatty
soft tissue measuring 13.0 x 11.0 x 2.5 cm in thickness received in 10%
buffered formalin. The specimen weighs 63.2 grams. The entire specimen
is painted with silver nitrate. The Specimen is oriented as short stitch
on left lobe and long stitch on pericardium. A piece of grayish—tan
pericardium tissue measures 2.4 x 1.5 cm. The edges of the pericardium
are over coated with green dye, 0n sectioning, there is a tumour on the
mid aspect of the left lobe measuring 3.0 x 1.3 on maximum dimension.
Sections are submitted as follows:

1A to 13 - Representative transverse sections of the tumour in relations
to the adjacent soft tissue and pericardium.

11 - Representative section from the lower left lobe.

1J — Representative section frOm the upper left lobe.

1K — Representative section from the upper right lobe.

1L — Representative section from the lower right lobe.

Three pieces of tumoral tissue and three pieces of thymic tissue are
taken for tissue frozen.
