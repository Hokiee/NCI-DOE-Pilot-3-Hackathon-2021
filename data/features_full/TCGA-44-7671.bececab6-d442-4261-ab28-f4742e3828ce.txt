SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Date Coll: -

SPECIMEN
A. Right upper middle lobe
B. Level 7
C. R4
D. R2

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Lung mass

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. Received fresh in a container labeled "right upper

middle lobe" is a 197 gm, 19 x 11.8 x 3.5 cm, portion of
lung tissue, compatible with right upper and middle lobes. The
pleural surface is tan-pink to gray-black, and mottled. There are
bronchial stumps averaging 1 cm in length associated with each of
the upper and middle lobes. In the hilar region surrounding each
bronchial stump there are several gray-black soft rubbery lymph
nodes. There is a 3.2 x 2.8 x 2.2 cm. rubbery pale tan lesion which
appears to be within the middle lobe, and which extends to within 1
cm from the bronchial stump. The lesion grossly extends to beneath
the pleural surface, but does not appear to involve the pleura. The
pleural surface overlying the tumor is inked blue. Tissue is
submitted for tissue procurement per the clinical request. The
parenchyma away from the mass is spongy and tan-pink-red, with some
bleb form in the upper lobe. There are no additional mass
lesions.

BLOCK SUMMARY: A1 — bronchial margin, right upper lobe; A2 —
vascular margins; A3 — hilar lymph nodes right upper lobe; A4 —
bronchial margin right middle lobe; A5 — hilar lymph nodes right
middle lobe; A6-A10 - tumor, including relation to pleural surface
and adjacent parenchyma; A11,A12 - representative right upper lobe;
A13,A14 — right middle lobe away from mass.

B. Received fresh in a container labeled "level 7" are six

slightly fragmented portions of soft gray-black tissue

atible with lymph nodes, up to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension.

C. Received fresh in a container labeled "R4" are five

pieces of soft gray-black to tan-gold tissue up to 0.8 cm
in greatest dimension. There appear to be three lymph nodes
present.

D. Received fresh in a container labeled "R2" are six

fragmented soft gray-black to tan-yellow pieces of tissue
ranging from 0.3 cm up to 1.1 cm in greatest dimension. Due to the
degree agm ation, it is difficult to enumerate the lymph
nodes.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
The following template summarizes the findings in this
case:

Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma (mixed papillary and not otherwise
specified), comprising the mass lesion in the right middle lobe in

part A.
Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated.
Primary tumor (pT): pT2a. The tumor is 3.2 cm in greatest

dimension. Pleural invasion is not identified.

Margins of resection: Negative for tumor

Direct extension of tumor: Not identified

Vascular invasion: Not definitively identified

Regional lymph nodes (pN): pNO. The hilar lymph nodes identified in

part A, as well as the separately submitted lymph nodes in parts B,
C, and D, are negative for tumor.

Distant metastasis (pM): pMX

Other findings: Emphysematous change with bleb formation in the

upper lobe, with bronchiolar metaplasia, and subpleural fibrosis.

Note: This case has been reviewed in Intradepartmental Consultation

with concurrence with the interpretation.

DIAGNOSIS
A. Lung, right upper and middle lobes, excision
- Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, 3.2 cm in
greatest dimension (pT2a), margins negative for malignancy
(see microscopic description).
- Emphysematous changes, with bleb formation.
— Lymph nodes negative for malignancy.

B,C,D. Lymph nodes, level 7, R4, and R2, excisions
— Negative for malignancy.
