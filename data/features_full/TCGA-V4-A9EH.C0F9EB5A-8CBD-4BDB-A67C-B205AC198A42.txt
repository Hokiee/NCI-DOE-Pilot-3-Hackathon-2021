Left eye enucleation

gm

The eyeball measures 25 by 25 by 25 mm with a posterior segment of optic nerve of 8 mm. At
the section of the eyeball there is a tumor of 12 by 10 mm. Samples have been made for

cryopreservation and genomic proﬁling and the specimen has been then included entirely
after ﬁxation.

Macroscopy

Microscopy

The tumor seen macroscopically correspond to a choroidal melanoma. The tumor cells are
mostly non pigmented and fusiform. They are organized in crisscrossing bundles. There are
atypical ovoid nuclei which show few mitotic ﬁgures with l mitosis

by 10 ﬁelds at the 400 magniﬁcation. The tumor is distant from the emergence of the optic
nerve and distant from the ciliary processes. However it inﬁltrates the whole thickness of the
sclera with extra sclera extension visible (specimen D and E). There are tumor cells around
the extra scleral vessels without visible neoplastic embolus in the lymphatic channels.
