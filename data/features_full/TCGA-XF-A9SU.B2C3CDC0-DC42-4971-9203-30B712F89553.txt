ORDERING PHSYCIAN:
Ordering Physician:

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Bladder CA

POST-OPERATWE DIAGNOSIS:
Same

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
A—D: See final microscopic~diagnosis.

E: Sections of the bladder show multiple extensive areas of high- grade invasive
urothelial carcinoma, penetrating into perivesical fat but sparing adjacent organs
(uterus and cervix). Extensive multifocal lymphovascular space invasion is
present. Also present are several foci of the deceptively bland trabecular pattern
superficially invading the lamina propria

Sections of the cervix show cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN III) with
gland duct involvement No invasive cervical squamous cell carcinoma is
identified. Architecturally while the urethra is involved with urothelial
carcinoma, the ectocervix and cervical stroma are not, thus the two processes are
physically discontinuous.

labeled “Inter aortal caval upper limits of dissection". It consists of lymph node

measuring 2 x 2 x 0.5 cm. One cassette is submitted for frozen section and one
cassette is submitted for permanent section.

D: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. for rapid frozen analysis and
labeled "Apical urethral margin F/S“. It consists of section of mucosa measuring 4
x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section.

E: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. for intraoperative consultation
and labeled "Bladder". It consists of radical cystectomy specimen measuring 11 x
13 x 4.5 cm. The peritoneal surface measures 13 x 8 x 0.1 cm. There is no
puckering or erythema. The bladder measures 7 x 7 x 2 cm. The bladder is opened
along its anterior aspect to reveal several ulcerations with overlying pseudo
membranes as well as a pedunculated lesion. The largest ulcer measures 4 x 3 cm
and extends grossly into to perivesical fat. A 2.5 x 2 cm ulcer is located
superior to the right ureteral orifice. A 1.5 x 1 cm ulcer is located in the right
aspect of the dome. A 1.5 x 1 cm ulcer is located inferior to the left ureteral
orifice and 1 x 0.5 cm ulcer is located at the urethral margin. The pedunculated
lesion measures 2 x 1 cm and is located in the left anterior aspect of the dome of
the bladder. The mucosa, which is uninvolved with ulceration, is inflamed and
edematous. The right distal ureter measures 5.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in
circumference. The left distal ureter measures 4 cm in length and 1 cm in
circumference and contains a stent. Received in continuity with the specimen is 12
x 8 x 2 cm uterus and adnexa. The uterus measures 5 x 8 x 2 cm and is pear shaped.
The uterine serosa is smooth. The right fallopian tube measures 5.5 cm in length
and 0.5 cm in diameter. The right ovary measures 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm and is grossly
unremarkable. The left fallopian tube measures 7.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in
diameter. The left ovary measures 1.5 x l x 0.5 cm and is grossly unremarkable.
Several small peritubal cysts, which are clear and thin—walled, are noted on the
surface of the left fallopian tube. The ectocervix measures 3.5 cm in greatest
diameter. The cervical os measures 0.3 cm and is unremarkable. The uterus is
opened to reveal a 3.5 cm endocervical canal lined with mucoid tan epithelium and a
4.5 x 1.5 x 0.1 cm endometrial canal lined by a velvety tan endometrium. The

DIAGNOSIS:

Carcinoma-in-situ with pagetoid spread was noted in the patient‘ 5 bladder. urethra. and also in the cervical
specimen. In order to determine the origin of these processes, and whether or not they were related or separate,
we performed immunohistochemical studies on the bladder tumor (slide E7). the cervix (slide E17), and the
urethra (slide 82). The studies demonstrate the following:

E7 E17 82
Bladder Cervix Urethra

0K7 ++ ++ ++
+/- squamous mucosa

CK20 + + +
- squamous mucosa

CPV

High Background High background High background

These results indicate that the carcinoma in situ process is reIated, and of transitional cell origin. Thus, the
transitional cell carcinoma is extending by pagetoid spread widely throughout the anterior exenteraticn specimen.
