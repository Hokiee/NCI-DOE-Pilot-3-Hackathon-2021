SPEClMEN(S);
A: Gallbladder

hi" ‘7
B: Right lobe of liver

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
B. Liver, right lobe, partial hepatectomy:
— Well-differentiated hepatocellular neoplasm; with features of
so—called adenoma like hepatocellular carcinoma (see microscopic)
- Tumor measures 6.5 cm
- Resection margins free of tumor
- No lymphovascular invasion
— Peliosis and extramedullary hematopiesis present in tumor
- Hemorrhage suggestive of prior biopsy site
- Steatosis with inflammation in the non-tumor liver

- See microscopic for tumor checklist
A. Gallbladder, cholecystectomy:
- Cholelithiasis

— No evidence of malignancy

listed special stains, and used them with my medical judgement to

determine the final diagnosis.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
The patient is 3 year-old man with history of liver cancer who

undergoes partial hepatectomy.

GROSS:
Two specimens are received, each labeled with the patient's name and

hospital number.

A. Specimen A is designated "gallbladder." The specimen

consists of a blue—green gallbladder measuring 7.3 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm. The
specimen is opened revealing approximately 20 mL of light green viscous
bile intermixed with a single brown-black gallstone measuring 0.5 cm.
The mucosal surface has a granular green appearance and a uniform wall
thickness of 0.1 cm. The bile duct is opened and is unremarkable. No
additional stones are identified. The specimen is sampled in cassette

A.

B. Specimen B is designated "liver, right lobe." The specimen
consists of a 1160 gm right hemihepatectomy measuring 20.0 x 14.0 x 5.0
cm. The surgical cauterized margin is inked black. The specimen is

sectioned perpendicular to the margin revealing a 6.5 x 6.0 x 4.6 cm

tan-red lobulated and essentially solid appearing lesion located 0.2 cm
from the closest surgical. The surgeon is notiﬁed. The specimen is
photographed. The surrounding parenchyma has a tan-red, yellow soft
coloration and consistency. No additional lesions are grossly
identified. Representative tissue is secured for potential future

studies.

MICROSCOPIC:

Microscopic examination is performed.

The sections show a well differentiated hepatocellular neoplasm that is
partially encapsulated and partially blending with the normal liver.
There are pseudo—portal tracts within the mass, with vessels but no bile
ducts. There is minimal nuclear atypia but no glandular or
pseudoglandular formation. The tumor also shows areas of steatosis,
peliosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis. We do not see vascular
invasion. There is some hemorrhage and an infarct—like area, which we

suspect may represent the prior biopsy area.

Based on these H\T\E features, we favored a hepatocellular adenoma.
There was an outside biopsy called hepatocellular carcinoma, which we
have not reviewed. case was reviewed at the

called hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in part based on

focal loss of retiCUlin meshwork and focal glypican staining. Given our

questions about the diagnosis of HCC, we elected to perform some

additional studies on this case.

Immunostains show that the tumor has only membranous staining for
beta-catenin, without nuclear staining. This is a pattern that is

typical for adenoma, although it is reported that some
well—differentiated HCCs also lack nuclear beta-catenin. A CD34 stain
shows that most of the has a well—formed sinusoidal vascular pattern but
in scattered areas, this becomes difficult to define. I also performed
reticulin stains on all 6 blocks of the tumor, and again, in

much of the tumor, there is good plate formations which are one or two
cells thick; there are areas where the reticulin meshwork is poorly
defined, and some ball-like collections are present. A glypican

immunostain is still pending.

Overall, the histologic and special stain features are equivocal for the
differential of adenoma versus well-differentiated HCC. What pushes me
over the line for a diagnosis of HCC is the age and sex of the patient

I year old man), which is quite atypical for adenoma. Studies have
shown that even tumors with classic features of adenoma present in
patients 9particula|ry men) older than have sometimes behaved like
well-differentiated HCC. Taking that information with the histology, I
think it is best to classify this as a very well—differentiated

adenoma-like HCC.

The native liver shows moderate macrovesicular steatosis (25 percent),

and some modest chronic inflammation, without the hepatocellular

ballooning of a true steatohepatitis. There is no evidence of

significant fibrosis or cirrhosis in the non-tumor liver.
