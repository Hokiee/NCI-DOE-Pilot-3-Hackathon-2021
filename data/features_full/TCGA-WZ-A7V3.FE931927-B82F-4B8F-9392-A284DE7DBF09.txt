CLINICAL INFORMATION

Right testicular mass

SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPTION

SOURCE: Right testicle tumor

Received fresh labeled "right testicle" is a 5.5 x 4 x 3.2 cm testis with

an attached 10 cm in length x 1.6 cm in diameter spermatic cord. The tunica
vaginalis is intact. The outer surface of the testis is inked blue. _.

The testis is bivalved revealing a heterogeneous. 4.2 x 2.7 x 2.7 cm tumor

mass. One-third of the tumor is soft. friable. tan-pink with the remainder

being solid tan-pink. The surrounding normal parenchyma of the testis is

unremarkable. The tumor mass is 11 cm from the spermatic cord resection

margin, approaches the tunica albuginea but does not extend through it and
.. 99%..th 3.91333: toinvolve the 5.3.1 2t. 1 .cm epididvmis. .. .

Representative portion of both portions of tumor are submitted on one chuck
for frozen section diagnosis.

INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION SECTION: "Germ cell tumor
with non-seminomatous component." is rendered by

Tissue is taken for possible ancillary study.

Representative sections are submitted in 15 cassettes as follows:

1. Frozen section of tumor

2-5. Representative soft friable tumor to albuglnea and vaginalis and
adjacent normal parenchyma

6. Solid tumor and vaginalls

7. Solid and soft tumor and normal parenchyma and albuginea

8-12. Random tumor

13. Mid spermatic cord

14. Epididymis, remote from tumor

15. Spermatic cord margin
