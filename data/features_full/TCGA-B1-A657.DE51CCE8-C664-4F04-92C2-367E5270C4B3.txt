COMMENT:

Thie tumor has an interesting morphology with a papillary architecture but In areas has elongated and angulated tubular
growth pattern reminiscent of muclnoua and tubular apindle cell carcinoma. No distinct mucin ia Identiﬁed and there are
many foam cells In the background. lmmunoatalne were perlonned and show that tumor cells are positive for GK] and
racemaae. focally positive for CD10 and negative for CAI. While we favor tl'IIa to represent a papillary renal cell carcinoma.
our dlfferentlal diagnosis also includes an unusual variant ol muclnoua tubular spndle cell carcinoma.

MOLECULAR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY FLUORESCENCE IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION ANALYSIS

Comment: Fluorescent in-eitu hybridization (FISH) tests show monosomy of chromosome 1 and 2 in approximately 86%
and 54% of the tumor cells. Trlsomy of chromosome 17 la seen in 25% of tumor cells.

This FISH proﬁle is suggestive of a mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma. However a papillary renal cell
carcinoma cannot be ruled out.

Specimen type: Renal tumor.

Result:
1 Signal 2 Signals . 3 or more Signals
cam 40 (65.6%) 21 (34.4%) o (0%)
CEP2 36 (53.7%) 29 (43.3%) 2 (3.0%)
CEP7 13 (21.3%) 44 (72.1%) 4 (6.6%)
CEP17 11 (18.0%) 35 (57.4%) 15 (24.63)

Abnormality detected:

Monoeomy of chromosome 1 and 2 Is seen In approximately 66% and 54% of the tumor cells. Trlaomy of chromosome 17
is seen in 25% of tumor cells.

Interpretation guidelines:

Chromosomal losses are considered signiﬁcant if present in greater then 30% of cells. The loss is indeterminate if present in
20-30% of cases. The loss is considered artifactual If seen in less than 20% of cases.

Chromosomal gains are considered Signiﬁcant if present In greater than 20% of cells. The gain is considered artifactual if seen in
less than 20% of cases.
Results

Probes used: CEP1 (1pl1.1q11.1). CEPZ (2p11.1q11.2). CEP7 (7p11.1q11.1). CEP17 (1Tp11.1q11.1).

At least 25 cells are analyzed. The signal distribution for targeted féci of renal carcinoma is recorded. If the test results are not
consistent with the clinical ﬁndings. andlor diagnostic. a consultation between pathologist and treating physician is warranted.

Thls test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the . Department of Pathology,
as required by the CLIA '88 regulations.
