Right total mastectomy with axillary node dissection and sentinel node biopsy

Pre Operative Diagnosis:

Breast ductal carcinoma

Specimen(s) Received.-

A: Sentinel node #1 count ._. -. FS
B: Sentinel node #2 count I. FS
C: Right total mastectomy

Gross Description;
A. Received fresh is a segment of tan-brown ﬂbroadlpose tissue, 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm. The specimen is bisected and

submitted in toto In two blocks.

8. Received in formalin Is a segment of tan-gray soft tissue, 1 x 0.9 x 0.6 cm. The specimen is bisected and submitted in
toto in one block.

C. Received in formalin Is a 447gram. 18 x 17.5 x 2 cm right mastectomy specimen. There is an ellipse of pale skin, 14.2 x
6.1 cm. The nipple/arecla complex measures 2.5 x 2 cm. The nipple Is retracted. The attached axillary tail measures
11.5 x 6.5 cm. The specimen is oriented with short stitch superior. two long stitches lateral. The resection margins are
inked black. On serial sectioning, there Is a tan-white, lndurated, Ill—deﬁned lesion with inﬁltrating borders in the
retroareolar space. It occupies the central compartment and measures 3 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. it is located 2 cm from the

deep margin. 7.5 cm from the inferior margin. 5 cm from the superior margin. 7 cm from the medial margin. and 9 cm from the

lateral margin. No additional lesions are Identiﬁed. Examination of the axillary tall reveals multiple possible
lymph nodes. Sections are submitted as follows:

1 Nipple

2 Deep margin (closest)

3-9 Lesion submitted in toto

10-12 One lymph node per block
13&14 Three lymph nodes per block
