Right temporal brain tumor

OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES

Operation/Specimen: A: Glioblastoma, biopsy

B: Glioblastoma, biopsy

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:

A. and B. Brain, right cerebral tumor, excision biopsy: Glioblastoma {WHO
Grade IV) (see comment).

COMMENT
Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis. Sections Show a

moderately pleomorphic, densely cellular glioma demonstrating frequent
mitotic

figures, vascular proliferation and pseudopalisading necrosis. Reactive
changes consistent with prior surgical intervention are also present.
Immunohistochemical stains Show that the tumor cells are diffusely GFAP
positive. The Ki—67 labeling index is up to approximately 30%.

Positive and negative controls show appropriate immunoreactivity.
Results of MGMT promoter methylation assay will be reported below in a
procedure addenda.

PROCEDURES/ADDENDA

MGMT Promoter Methylation
Date Ordered: — Date Reported: _

Interpretation

NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected.
Results—Comments

Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment

of
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA

followed
by real—time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and unmethylated

DNA

sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial

dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and was

assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated DNA.

Factors such as the presence of >50% non~neoplastic cells in the sample, or
extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated MGMT

promoter sequences.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a
stand alone diagnostic test. This test was develo ed and its performance
characteristics determined by the *laboratory as
required by CLIA ' -regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for
specific uses by the 0.8. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results
are

provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.
