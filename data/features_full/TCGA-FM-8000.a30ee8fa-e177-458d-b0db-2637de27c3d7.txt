Report : SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT, _

This supplemental report is issued to report FISH results.
FISH analysis is negative for the t(11;14) translocation.
This finding, in conjunction with the negative
immunohistochemical stain for cyclin D1, excludes mantle
cell lymphoma. The FISH study does show another IGH
rearrangement involving an unknown partner chromosome. IGH
rearrangements are commonly seen in diffuse large B—cell
lymphoma. The final diagnosis is thus amended as follows:

 

Terminal ileum and right colon, resection:
— CDS—positive diffuse large B—cell lymphoma.
— Five lymph nodes, no tumor present (0/5).

Intradepartmental consultation obtained.

DIAGNOSIS BASED ON GROSS AND MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

Terminal ileum and right colon, resection:
— B-cell lymphoma involving full thickness of terminal
ileum, ileocecal valve, and cecum (see comment).

— Five limih nodesl no tumor iresent (0/5).

COMMENT:

Sections of the mass show a diffuse infiltrate of medium
sized atypical lymphocytes extending from the mucosa to the
subserosal adipose tissue. Flow cytometry showed a
monoclonal B—cell population positive for CD19, CD5, bright
CD20, FMC—7, and lambda. As the flow cytometry results were
inconclusive, suitable immunohistochemical stains were
evaluated to further characterize this lymphoma.
Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor cells to be
positive for BCL—6, CD23, CD5, and PAX5. Cyclin D1, MUM—1,
CD10, CD3, and CD43 are negative. A MIB—l proliferative
index is approximately 50%.

This is a challenging case. The immunoprofile is of a
B—cell lymphoma. The differential diagnosis is between a
CD5 positive diffuse large B—cell lymphoma versus an
atypical mantle cell lymphoma. Tissue has been sent for
FISH studies for the t(11;14) translocation to help clarify
the diagnosis. Results of FISH studies will be reported in
an addendum when available.

Intradepartmental consultation obtained.
