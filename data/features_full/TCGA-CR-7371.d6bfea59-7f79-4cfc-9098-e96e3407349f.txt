INSTRUCTIONS TO PATHOLOGIST: Frozen.
GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1) SOURCE: Epiglottis

Received fresh labeled, "epiglottis," is a 0.6 X 0.4 X 0.3 cm piece of
tan-white tissue. The specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section.
Summary of sections: lAFSC, 1/1.

2) SOURCE: Post Cricoid

The specimen labeled "post cricoid," is received fresh and is comprised of
a 2.4 X 0.2 X 0.2 cm strip of pink-tan mucosa. The specimen is submitted
entirely for frozen section.

Summary of sections: 2AFSC, entirely submitted, 1/1.

3) SOURCE: Left HypopharynX

The specimen labeled "left hypopharynX," is received fresh and is comprised
of a 2.7 X 0.2 X 0.2 cm strip of tan-pink mucosa. The specimen is inked
black, and submitted entirely for frozen section.

Summary of sections: 3AFSC, 1/1.

4) SOURCE: Right HypopharynX

The specimen labeled "right hypopharynX," is received fresh and is
comprised of two pieces of tissue, one measuring 1.8 X 0.3 X 0.2 cm, the
second measuring 1.4 X 0.2 X 0.2 cm. The first piece of tissue does not
have an easily identifiable mucosal surface. The second strip of tissue
does have an identifiable mucosal surface. Each of these pieces of tissue
are inked blue, and the specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section.
Summary of sections: 4AFSC, entirely submitted, 2/1.

5) SOURCE: Pharyngolaryngectomy

The specimen labeled "pharyngolaryngectomy" is received fresh and is
comprised of a laryngectomy with attached epiglottis, thyroid cartilage
with eXtension of the mucosa and trachea inferior to the thyroid cartilage.
The thyroid gland is not present with the specimen. The specimen measures
8.0 cm superior to inferior X 5.0 cm left to right X 4.8 cm anterior to
posterior. The specimen has been opened prior to receipt along the
posterior aspect. The specimen is inked as follows: anterior-orange,
posterior-black, superior-yellow, inferior-green, right-red, left-blue.
Examination of the specimen shows a 2.3 X 1.8 cm ulcerated lesion on the
posterior face of the epiglottis present centrally, eXtending to the left

and right (more prominently leftward), and towards the epiglottic vocal
folds. The right and left superior vocal folds are involved, medially, with
the left involved laterally. The anterior commissure is involved. On
sectioning, the lesion penetrates 0.4 cm deep from the mucosal surface.
There is a prominent 0.8 X 0.7 X 0.7 cm nodule in the left anterior

superior portion of the specimen abutting the anterior superior margin.
There is no gross tumor involvement of the thyroid cartilage. The tumor
mass has borders and comes within 0.3 cm of the hyoid bone, which is
present with the specimen. The tumor mass does appear to wrap around the
superior aspect of the thyroid cartilage. There is no apparent eXtension
inferior to the vocal folds. Representative sections are submitted.

Summary of sections: 5A, inferior margin, 1/ 1; 5B, anterior commissure,

1/ 1; 5C, right superior margin with epiglottis, 1/ 1; 5D, right medial vocal
folds, 1/ 1; 5E, right lateral vocal folds, 1/ 1; SF, right aryepiglottic

mucosa, 1/ 1; 5G, left anterior superior margin with prominent nodule, 2/1
(single section bisected); 2/ 1; 5H, left medial vocal fold with closest
approach to hyoid bone, 1/ 1; 51, left lateral vocal fold, 1/ 1; 5], left
aryepiglottic mucosa, 1/ 1; 5K, right and left soft tissue margins, 2/ 1; 5L,
anterior and posterior soft tissue margins, 2/ 1. NOTE: Appropriate sections
are decalcified.

6) SOURCE: Left Neck Level 4

The specimen labeled "left neck level 4" is received in saline, and is

comprised of a 5.2 X 4.2 X 0.5 cm collection of fibroadipose tissue

containing lymph node candidates. Lymph node candidates range in
measurement from 0.3 to 0.5 cm. The specimen is dissected and 21 lymph node
candidates are removed. These lymph node candidates are submitted entirely.
Summary of sections: 6A, lymph node candidates, M/1; 6B, lymph node
candidates, m/ 1; 6C, lymph node candidates, M/ 1.

7) SOURCE: Left Neck Levels 2A&3

The specimen labeled "left neck levels 2A, 3" is received in saline and is
comprised of a 13.5 X 4.5 X 0.5 cm collection of fibroadipose tissue

containing lymph nodes and vessels, with suture ties investing the vascular
end. The specimen is dissected to reveal the presence of numerous lymph

node candidates measuring from 0.2 to 1.0 cm in greatest eXtent. The lymph
node candidates are submitted entirely.

Summary of sections: 7A, lymph node candidates, M/1; 7B, lymph node
candidates, M/ 1; 7C, lymph node candidates, M/1; 7D, lymph node candidates,
6/ 1; 7E, two lymph nodes, each bisected, one inked black, 4/ 1.

8) SOURCE: Right Neck Level 2,3,&4

The specimen labeled "right neck level 2, 3, 4" is received fresh and is
comprised of a 15.2 X 5.2 X 0.6 cm collection of fibroadipose tissue

containing lymph nodes and vessels. The specimen is dissected to reveal the
presence of numerous lymph nodes measuring from 0.2 to 1.2 cm. Lymph node
candidates are submitted entirely.

Summary of sections: 8A, lymph node candidates, M/1; 8B, lymph node
candidates, M/ 1; 8C, lymph node candidates, M/1; 8D, lymph node candidates,
M/1; 8E, lymph node candidates, 2/ 1; 8F, single lymph node, bisected, 2/ 1.

9) SOURCE: Neck Dissection Level 1A
The specimen labeled "neck dissection level 1A" is received in saline and

is comprised of a 2.5 X 2.0 X 0.5 cm collection of fibroadipose tissue
containing lymph node candidates. The specimen is divided to reveal the

presence of possible lymph nodes measuring from 0.3 to 0.5 cm. The specimen
is submitted entirely.
Summary of sections: 9A, 2/ 1; 9B, 2/ 1; 9C, 2/ 1.
