Gross:

Left adrenal gland with tumors with dimension 50x48x25 mm, weight 30 g. Major part of the
adrenal gland is replaced by tumor (42x30x22 mm), on cut grey with focal hemorrhages, in
the second part ochre yellow nodule (23x15x15 mm). The remaining adrenal tissue measures
10x5x5 mm with yellow color.

Micro:

In blocks A and G diffusely and nodularly hyperplastic adrenal cortex with focal
hypolipidosis. Encapsulated intracapsular proliferation of the adrenal cortex sporadically
(block E). In block H, in the adipose tissue bordered patch of symmetric slightly bruised
adrenocortical tissue.

In blocks B and C were also found these cortical structures; further parts of the excisions is
constituted by solidly alveolarly shaped pheochromocytoma from smaller and moderately
large cells, with focal diffuse growth, focally with spindle cell component, without necrosis.
Isolated tumor was examined in blocks D-F, is shows moderate to high cellularity. Focal
profound cellular atypias. No mitoses were found. No invasion into vessels or capsular
invasion was found.

Immunohistochemic examination:

SlOO protein sustentacular cells are missed in large parts of pheochromocytoma. MlBl
activity is in both procured lesions minimal <l% positive nuclei. Chromogranin A —
pheochromocytoma strong positive, adrenocortical structures negative

Synaptofysin — pheochromocytoma strong positive, adrenocortical structures negative
