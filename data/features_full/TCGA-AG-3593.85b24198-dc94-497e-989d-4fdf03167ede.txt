Diagnosis/ diagnoses:

1. Excised soft tissue (abdominal wall) with fibrosis and chronically granulating
inï¬‚ammation. No sections of the rectal carcinoma described in (2) below.

2. Resected part of colon and rectosigmoid colon shows an ulcerated, rectal carcinoma
characterized histologically as a moderately differentiated colorectal
adenocarcinoma, extending to within 1.3 cm of the aboral resection margin, and
encircling the intestinal wall at a length of 6.5 cm, with necrotic tumor lesion.
Invasive tumor spread within all intestinal wall layers, deep into the bordering
periproctic fatty tissue. The minimum distance from the tumor to the soft tissue
resection margin is 2 mm according to microscopy.

Tumor-free oral and aboral resection margin as well as the intestine adherent to the
vaginal section and the uterus. Uterus with epidermoid glandular portio ectopy,
slightly chronic cervicitis, cystic atrophy of the corpus endometrium and individual
intramural leiomyomas. Sigmoid colon wall with individual pseudodiverticula and
chronic peridiverticulitis, tending toward scarring.

All 38 periproctic and mesocolic lymph nodes are tumor-free, with non-
characteristic reactive lesions.

Tumor stage therefore pT3, pNO, (0/38) L0 V0; G2
