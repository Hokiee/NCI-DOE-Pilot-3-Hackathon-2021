The interpretation of the above immunohistochemistry stain or stains is guided by published results in
the medical literature, provided package information from the manufacturer and by internal review of

of one or more reagents in the above tests is regulated as an analyte speciﬁc reagent (ASR). These
tests were developed and their performance characteristic determined by the ‘- 1y
’ it. They have not been cleared or approved by the US. Food and Drug Administration.

1 he FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.

Special stains and/or immunohistochemical stains were performed with appropriately stained positive
and negative controls.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. BREAST, RIGHT, NEEDLE LOCALIZED WIDE LOCAL EXCISION:
- FOCAL ATYPICAL DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA.
- FOCAL HEMORRHAGE, COLUMNAR CELL CHANGE, AND INTRADUCTAL

SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS
Specimen: Surgical Excision
Block Number:

 

ER: Negative AIIred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0
PR: Negative AIIred Score: 4 = Proportion Score 2 + Intensity Score 2

 

COMMENT:

The AIIred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the
proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of
cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60°/o of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak
intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring
range from 0 to 8.

ERIPR positive is deﬁned as an AIIred score of >2 and ERIPR negative is deﬁned as an Allred score
of less than or equal to 2.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
lmmunohistochemistry was performed usino the mouse anti-human ER (ER 105, 1:100) and PR (PGR
136, 1:100) provided by following the manufacturer 5 instructions. This
assay was not modiﬁed. interpretation of the ERIPR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published
results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal
review of staining performance.

METHODOLOGY:
Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
Her? analvsis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit ,,
using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modiﬁed. External kit-slides
provroeu by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-
house known HER2 ampliﬁed control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well

immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided
by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.

This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from
A800 and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. Pathology
Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance.
