GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. RIGHT KIDNEY AND TUMOR, NEPHRECTOMY:
Received in fresh state is a specimen labeled with patient’s name and identiﬁcation number and labeled
as "right kidney and tumor" The specimen consists of 289 grams resected right kidney and perlrenal fat
with total dimensions of 14.5 x 7.0 x 4.2 cm. The attached ureter measures 7 cm in length with external
diameter of 0.3 cm. The kidney proper measures 12.5 x 4.5 x 2.5 cm.,which on cut sections shows a
seemingly circumscribed tumor with central necrosis involving the lower pole and measures 5.3 x 4.9
and 2.5 cm. Grossly,the tumor is seen closed to capsule without gross extension to perirenal fat . The
renal pelvis and mucosa of ureter appears to be grossly not remarkable. There is no gross extension of
tumor to the renal pelvis. The remainder of the kidney parenchyma of the upper pole shows the usual
appearance with no other identiﬁable tumor focus. Two lymph nodes identiﬁed measuring 0.7 and

grossly free of tumor . The is no identiﬁable adrenal gland. Multiple sections submitted in cassettes
labeled as follows:

A1: ureter and hilar blood vessels

A2: section from ureter

A3-A7: sections of tumor with included capsule

A8: section of tumor with adjacent kidney parenchyma.

A9: nonnal-appearing parenchyma

A10: lymph nodes

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Right renal mass
