SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis. labeled, "Left kidney". It consists of a nephrectomy
specimen. which inciudes perirenat adipose tissue and kidney. The adrenat gland is not identiﬁed. The ureter is identiﬁed
measuring 9.5 cm in lenght. The urothelial lining appears to be unremarkable. The vascular margins are also identiﬁed. The
kidney is bivalved and the cut sodace shows a 5.0 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm well-circumscribed massJocated in the upper portion of the
kidney. The tumor appears conﬁned to the kidney. and compresses the adjacent renal parenchyma, pelvis and calyces. The
tumor is abutting the renal capsule and the surrounding tat focally at the posterior aspect of the specimen. The rest of the adipose
tissue is unremarkable. The rest of the renal parenchyma is also unremarkable. A representative section of the tumor is submitted
for frozen section evaluation.

Summary of Sections:

FSC — frozen section control

UM -— ureter margin

VM —- vascular margin

T — tumor

N - uninvolved renal parencbyma
F — perirenai adipose tissue

2) The specimen is received in formalin. labeled “Portion of Left 11th Rib". It consists of a fragment of rib that measures 6.5
x 1 x 0.5 cm. The section is submitted for decalciﬁcation.

Summary of Sections:

U: undesignated

3) The specimen is received in formalin. labeled "Left Spermatic Vein". it consists of a 5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm portion of tissue.
On sectioning. a vessel is identiﬁed. Representative sections are submitted.

Summary of Sections:
U ~ undeslgnated

4) The specimen is received in formalin. labeled "Periaortic Lymph Node". it consists of multiple fragments of adipose
tissue measuring in aggregate 4 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. Upon dissection several lymph nodes are identiﬁed and entirely submitted.

Summary of Sections:
U - undesignated
