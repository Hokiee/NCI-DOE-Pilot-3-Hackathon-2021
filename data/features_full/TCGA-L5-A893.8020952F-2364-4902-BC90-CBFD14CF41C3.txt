VERIFIED av:

year-old female with distal esophageal Barrett's adanocarcinoma, long
history of GERD, SIP laparoscopie NXSSEN fundoplication. Histal
hernia 4 to 5 cm. History of smoking, stopped prior to the surgery.
Bariuu swallow 3 cm sliding hiatal hernia. clinical diagnosis: Esophageal CA.
Operative procedure: Transhiatal esophagectomy.

VERIFIED .

1. "Thoracic esophagus” Received in formalin is a gastroesophagectomy
specimen. The esophagus is 3.0 cm long x 3.0 cm in diameter and a portion of
proximal stomach is 4.0 cm long x 4.5 cm in diameter. Located 2.0 cm from the
esophageal margin and 4.0 cm from the distal gastric margin. At the area of
the GE junction is a 2.5 x 1.5 cm tan-pink, firmvand uellsdefined mass that is
shiny to granular and extends 0.5 cm from the mucosal surface. The mass
occupies 50% of the circumference. Sectioning reveals the mass to extend 0.6
cm below the surface and grossly abut the mseularis proprie but does not
extend through. The wall is thickened adjacent to the mass. The remaining
esophageal moss is tan-pink and mremarkable. The remaining gastric moose
is normally folded, tan and unremarkable. Examination of the attached adipose
tissue reveals multiple probable lymph nodes that range from 0. 5 up to 0.9 cm
in greatest dimension.
