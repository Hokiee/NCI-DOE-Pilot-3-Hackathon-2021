FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
PART 1: LVMPH MODES, RIGHT PELVIC. LYMPHADENECTOMY -

EIGHT LYMPH NODES, NO EVIDENCE OF METASTATIC CARCINOMA (0(8).

PART 2: LYMPH NODES. LEFT PELVIC. LYMPHADENECTOMY—
THREE LYMPH MODES, NO EVIDENCE OF METASTATIC CARCINOMA SEEN (0/3).

PART 3: PROSTATE, RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY -
A. iNVASiVE POORLY DIF FERENTIATED PROSTAﬂC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 4 + 5 =- 9 (see
comment).
THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES BOTH THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT LOBES OF THE PROSTATE AND
CONSTITUTES APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THE TISSUE EVALUATED.
THE TUMOR MEASURES 2.0 CM IN GREATEST NDDULAR DIMENSION.
ESTABLISHED EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IS IDENTIFIED. THE EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION ls
SEEN IN THE REGIONS OF THE RIGHT PDSTERIOR APEX (SLIDE 3U). THE RIGHT POSTERIOR MID (SLIDE
32), AND THE RIGHT POSTERIOR BASE (SLIDE 3W).
ALL INKED MARGINS OF RESECTION ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA.
BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES. NO EVIDENCE OF CARCINOMA SEEN.
MULTIFOCAL PERINEURAL INVASION BY THE CARCINOMA IS SEEN.
MULTIFOCAL HIGH-GRADE PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHEUAL NEOPLASIA (PIN) IS SEEN.
TNM STAGE: T3- N0 Mx.
HISTOLOGIC GRADE: 63-4 (POORLY DIFFERENTIATEDIUNDIFFERENTIATED).

BENIGN URETHRAL TISSUE. NO EVIDENCE OF CARCINOMA SEEN.

PART 5: SOFT TISSUE. DENONVILLIERS. BIOPSY - -

A. SOFT TISSUE WITH SEMINAL VESICLE-TYPE TISSUE.

8. NO EVIDENCE OF CARCINOMA SEEN.
COMMENT:
The prostatic adenocerclnoma shown Gleam pattern- 3. 4 and 6. Gloaeon pattern 5 constitute: approximately 10']. of
the tissue: evaluated. Gleason pattern 3 constitutes approximately 35% of the dune evaluated and Gleuon pattern 4
con-mum approximately 55% of the tissue evaluated. '

Buod on the distribution of the Gleason pattern, thin carcinoma is but scored a e Glmon score of 4 4- 5 I 9.
