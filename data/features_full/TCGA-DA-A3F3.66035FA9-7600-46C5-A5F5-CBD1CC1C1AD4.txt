Interpretation ,

The BRAF gene encodes a protein that is a component of the RAS/MAPK signaling
pathway involving the control of cell proliferation. differentiation, and apoptosis. This gene
may be mutated‘in many types of cancer. particularly thyroid cancer. BRAF mutation
(V600E) occurs in 40-60% of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). It has been shown that such
mutations are associated with a more aggressive phenotype of PTC. BRAF mutation testing
of FNA specimens provides a powerful tool to preoperatively identify PTC patients at higher
risk for extensive disease (extrathyroidal extension and lymph node metastases). Journal of
Clinical Oncology 272977-2982, 2009.

BRAF VGOOE mutation is not detected In the specimen tested.
