I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

Gross Description:

1). The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "Sigmoid colon". It
consists of a portion of sigmoid colon that measures 18.5cm in length x 10.0
cm in open circumference at the distal margin. The serosal surface is pink
tan and unremarkable. The radial resection margin is inked black and the
specimen is opened to reveal a tumor that is located 9.0 cm from the
proximal margin and 6.0 cm from the distal margin. The tumor measures 2.8 cm
in length and 6.5 cm in width. Serial sectioning reveals tumor extending to
a depth of 0.7 cm, through the muscularis and grossly approaching into the
underlying pericolic fat. The tumor is 4.0 cm from the closest radial
margin. The remaining mucosa shows tan-yellow grossly unremarkable mucosal
folds. Pericolic and peri-rectal adipose tissue is thoroughly examined for
lymph nodes, and all possible nodes are submitted. Representative sections
are submitted. TPS is submitted.

Summary of sections:
PM - proximal margin
DM - distal margin
RM - radial margin

RS - uninvolved mucosa

LN - lymph nodes

BLN - bisected lymph node

 

2). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Proximal margin" and
consists of a silver metal anastomotic pin measuring 7.5 x 2.8 x 1.5 cm. At
the center of the pin, a green plastic piece is noted. A ring of pink tan
soft tissue is attached measuring 2.5 x 1.6 x 1.0 cm. The mucosal surface
is pink tan and focally hemorrhagic and the serosal surface is pink tan and
smooth. Several sutures and staples are noted. The sutures and staples are
removed and the soft tissue is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U - undesignated

3). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Distal ring" and consists
of a ring of pink tan soft tissue measuring 2.8 x 1.6 x 1.1 cm. Multiple
sutures and staples are attached. The mucosal surface is pink tan and
focally hemorrhagic. The sutures and staples are removed and the soft tissue
is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U - undesignated
