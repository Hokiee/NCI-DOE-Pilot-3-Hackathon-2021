left ovary

with a smooth outer surface and a 6. 2 x 0.7 cm left
fallopian tube

DIAGNOSIS:

A. Abdomen, panniculectomy: Skin and subcutaneous tissue
(3090.0

grams) with umbilicus identified grossly. Gross
examination only.

B. Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and

bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy: FIGO grade II (of III)
endometrial

adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, is identified forming a
mass (3.9 ”1%“

x 2.9 x 1.5 cm) in the lower uterine segment extending
into the

endocervical canal and invading through the myometrial
wall (0.9 cm

thickness), but not through to the uterine serosa. No
lymphovascular space invasion is identified. The
ectocervical

margin is negative for malignancy (by 0.5 cm). The right
and left

ovaries and tubes are uninvolved. The left fallopian tube
has

multiple paratubal cysts (ranging in size from 0.2 cm to
0.4 cm in

greatest dimension). Multiple (2) regional lymph nodes
are negative

for malignancy.

C. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, excision: Multiple right
pelvic

lymph nodes (5 external iliac, 2 internal iliac, 5 common
iliac, 10

obturator) are negative for tumor.

D. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, excision: Multiple left
pelvic lymph

nodes (8 external iliac, 4 internal iliac, 1 common iliac,
16

obturator) are negative for tumor.

 

 

 

 

 

E. Gonadal vessels, right, excision: Negative for
malignancy.

F. Gonadal vessels, left, excision: Negative for
malignancy.

G. Lymph nodes, right para-aortic above the inferior
mesenteric

artery, lymphadenectomy: Multiple (4) lymph nodes are
negative for

malignancy.

H. Lymph nodes, right para-aortic below the inferior
mesenteric

artery, lymphadenectomy: Multiple (2) lymph nodes are
negative for

malignancy.

I. Lymph nodes, left para-aortic above the inferior
mesenteric

artery, lymphadenectomy: Multiple (4) lymph nodes are
negative for

malignancy.

J. Lymph nodes, left para-aortic below the inferior
mesenteric

artery, lymphadenectomy: Multiple (3) lymph nodes are
negative for

malignancy.

K. Omentum, omentectomy: Negative for malignancy.

This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic

examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of
the

specimen(s).
