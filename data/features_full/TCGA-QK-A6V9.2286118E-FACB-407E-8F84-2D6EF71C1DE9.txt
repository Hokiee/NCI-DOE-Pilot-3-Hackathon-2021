Gross Descrigtion

Specimen A is received fresh for intraoperative consultation, labeled with the patient's name. medical record number
and as "right radical tonsillectomy." The specimen consists of a radical tonsillectomy specimen measuring 5.0 x 4.5 x
3.5 cm. Upon receipt in Pathology, the specimen is fragmented into two distinct fragments. The specimen is oriented
by the surgeon, He speciﬁes each mucosal margin, which are submitted for frozen section
consultation. Arising within the palatine tonsil there is a large polypoid mass measuring 3.5 x 1.9 in surface
dimension by a depth of 1.4 cm. The mass is the following distance from each respective mucosal margin: superior
0.4 mm, medial 0.5 cm, inferior 1.0 cm and lateral 2.3 cm. The mass comes within 0.5 cm of the deep resection
margin. The mucosal margins are inked as follows: superior, blue; medial, black; lateral, yellow; inferior, orange. The
deep margin ls inked green. A portion of the tumor is submitted for research purposes. Representative sections are
submitted as described in the cassette summary. (Dictated by '

Specimen B is received fresh and labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and as "ﬁnal inferior
margin; ink true margin". Received is a small piece of mucosal lined ﬁbrous tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm with
ink on one side. No discrete lesions are identiﬁed. The marked surface is re-ink blue and the specimen is serially
sectioned and entirely submitted in cassette "B1." (Dictated by ‘
