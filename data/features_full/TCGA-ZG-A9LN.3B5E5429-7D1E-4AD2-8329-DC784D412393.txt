Gross description:

1. (Prostate gland): Prostate gland: Weight: 50 9. Volume: 45 ml, Size: 3.6 x 5 x 4 cm. Adherent
seminal vesicles and deferent duct: right side: 2.5 cm, left side: 3.5 cm. The surface is marked with
green ink on the right side, blue ink on the left side. On the right recto~lateral surface a 1.5 x 0.7 cm
measuring tissue defect marked with yellow ink. On the left recto-lateral surface a 3 x 2 cm measuring
tissue defect marked with yellow ink. On the anterior side a 3.3 x 2 cm measuring tissue defect
marked with black ink. Total of the cross sections: 2 cm.

2. (Lymph nodes, right side): 9 x 3.5 x 1 cm measuring adipose tissue containing 5 nodes measuring
up to 4.5 cm.

3. (Lymph nodes, left side): 9 x 4 x 0.5 cm measuring adipose tissue containing 4 nodes measuring up
t08 cm.

Microscopy:

1. Apex right and left: Right 7 tissue blocks. left 6 tissue blocks (total 13 tissue blocks). 4 cross
sections: Right 20 tissue blocks, left 18 tissue blocks (total 38 tiSSue blocks). Basis right and left: Right

4 tissue blocks, left 6 tissue blocks (total 10 tissue blocks). Seminal vesicles right and left: Right 3

tissue blocks, left 3 tissue blocks (total 6 tissue blocks). Deferent ducts right and left: Right 1 tissue

block, left 1 tissue block (total 2 tissue blocks). WO—

2. Frozen lymph nodes right: 11 tissue blocks. Am 8/458

3. Frozen lymph nodes left:6tissue blocks. 5 b: : gym MS 610,9
Diagnosis: 9‘! 3 ”2.6/19!

1. (Prostate gland): Poorly differentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason 5+4=9, (Gleason 5: 80%.
Gleason 4: 20%). Tumor involves both lobes with the main focus on the left side. Maximum tumor
diameter: 45 mm. Perineural invasion. Tumor inﬁltration into pen-prostatic adipose tissue in 1 tissue
blocks (maximum invasion length 0.1 mm, maximal invasion depth 0.1 mm). Positive surgical margin
in 3 blocks (contact area 3 x 0.4 mm; Gleason 5). Tumor-free peri-urethral resection margin.

Remaining prostatic tissue with small foci of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (high grade PIN) and
signs of myoglandular hyperplasia of the prostate. Urothelium of the prostatic urethra without
dysplasia. Tumor-free seminal vesicles and deferent ducts.

2. (Lymph nodes. right side): Four lymph node metastases (3.8 mm) in five lymph nodes(4/5).
3. (Lymph nodes, left side): Two lymph node metastases (4 mm) in ﬁve lymph nodes (2/5).

Tumor classification

(in consideration of the intraoperative frozen-section and immunohistochemical analyses):

pT3b, Gleason 5+4=9 (Gleason 5: 80%, Gleason 4: 20%), maximum tumor diameter: 45 mm, tumor
volume approx. 27 ml (Gleason 4: 5.4 ml, Gleason 5: 21.6 ml), pN1 (6/10), L1, V0, R1

Comments:
Positive surgical margin in tissue blocks AL1A. AL2A. BL3.

Tumor inﬁltration into seminal vesicles in tissue blocks SBL1, BL1B, BL2B.
Tumor inﬁltration into pen-prostatic adipose tissue in tissue block SBL1.
The preceding intraoperative frozen section revealed negative surgical margin of the urethra.

Immunohistochemical analyses (DZ-40, CD31) on tissue block SBL1 revealed lymphatic invasion but
no venous invasion.
