COMMENT

The c11n1caI h1story of recentIy exc1sed Iow grade astrocytoma (WHO Grade II)
15 noted. Indeed, surg1caI res1dua of th1s procedure are noted 1n Spec1men #7.
Mu1t1pIe b1ops1es from the frontaI Tobe. and tumor 1mmed1ater adjacent to the
surg1ca1 cav1ty (spec1men #7) shows astrocytoma w1th marked cytoIog1c atyp1a,
hxperceIIUIar1ty and scattered m1tot1c f1gures. The degree of atyp1a atta1ns

t at of h1gh grade astrocytoma, WHO Grade III. The d1agnost1c features of

a gI1obIastoma mu1t1forme, 1.e. necros1s. endotheI1aI proI1ferat1on, are not
1dent1f1ed. D1ffuse1y 1nvoIv1ng the major1ty of the resected t1ssue 1n
spec1mens #7, #8 and #9 1s astrocytoma w1th grade II features: moderate
hyperceIIuIar1ty, 1nconsp1cuous m1tot1c f1gures, and m1Id to moderate nuc1ear
atyp1a. OveraII, we est1mate that approx1mater 20% of the tumor resected shows
grade III features and approx1mate1y 80% shows grade II features. This 15 of
course a somewhat arb1trary est1mate, as the d1 ferent1at1ng cr1ter1a
(hyperceIIuIar1ty, atyp1a) ex1st on a spectrum and are not cIearIy de11neated.
