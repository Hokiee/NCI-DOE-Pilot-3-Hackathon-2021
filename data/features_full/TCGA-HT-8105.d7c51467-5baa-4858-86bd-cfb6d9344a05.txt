Microscopic

Permanent section of the frozen section ;specimen demonstrates a mildly to
moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates the parenchyma.
A large area of biopsy demonstrates extensive dystrophic calcification with
adjacent and intermingled tumor cells. The tumor cells have round to oval nuclei
and few apparent processes. Atupia is mild to moderate. No mitotic figures are
seen.

Addendum

Sections demonstrate a markedly hypercellular diffusely infiltrative glioma
essentially as previously described. Again, the tumor cells quiet consistently
have perinuclear halos. Nuclei tend to be round, although some oblong nuclei
are seen. Atypia is generally moderate. Although proliferative activity is variable,
up to 17 mitoses are seen in 10 high power fields. Microvascular proliferation is
present and there is a single focus of non pseudopalisading necrosis.

Numerous MlB-1 reactive cells are present throughout the tumor. A labeling
index of 39.8% is calculated.

Diagnosis
