measures 4.8 cm in length. The specimen is opened to reveal an
endcmetrial mass. The endometrlal mass is anterior and posterior and
measures 4 x 3.5 x 1.2 cm. It is friable and appears to show some
invasion. The mass does not extend into the endocervical canal,
distally. Section is taken for trozen and submitted in cassette IFSA. A
portion of the tumor is submitted in RPM! for Precision Therapeutics as
requested. A small amount of the tumor is submitted for the stady

The specimen is as follows:
