GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries". Received unfixed and placed
in formalin at-on— is a 144 gm (9.1 x 6.5 x 3.7 cm) uterus with
attached left ovary (3.1 x 2.1 x 0.8 cm), left fimbriated fallopian tube (5.1
cm long x 0.5 cm in diameter), right ovary (2.6 x 1.7 x 1 cm) and right
fimbriated fallopian tube (5.7 cm long x 0.5 cm in diameter). The endometrial
cavity is 3.5 cm wide x 4.7 cm long that has a 4.4 x 3.8 x 0.3 cm (protruding
into the cavity) soft white—gray fungating mass that extends 0.6 cm into a 2.4
cm thick trabeculated myometrium. The mass is ill defined and is 2.5 cm from
the anterior and posterior lower uterine segments. The uninvolved endometrium
is tan-brown and smooth (0.1 cm thick). The myometrium contains three
intramural homogenous white whorled nodules ranging from 1 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm up
to 2.5 x 2 x 1.8 cm. The cervix is 3.4 cm in diameter with a smooth
pink—white ectocervix and a 1.8 cm in diameter cervical os that leads into a
2.4 cm long smooth endocervical canal. Within the anterior and posterior
endocervical canal and extending into the lower uterine segment is a 2.5 x 2.1
x 1 cm soft tan—brown fungating mass that extends 0.8 cm into the underlying
stroma, 0.7 cm from the blue-inked soft tissue margin. The mass is 2.1 cm
from the anterior ectocervix and 1.7 cm from the posterior ectocervix. The
uterine serosa, left ovary, left fallopian tube, right ovary and right
fallopian tube are all unremarkable.

@ BLOCK SUMMARY:

Al— anterior cervix with endocervical canal mass

AZ— perpendicular cut, endocervical canal mass & ant lower uterine segment
A3- posterior cervix with endocervical canal mass

A4— perpendicular cut, endocervical canal mass & post lower uterine seg
A5- full thickness of anterior endomyometrium with mass

A6- full thickness of posterior endomyometrium with mass

A7- intramural nodules

A8- left tube and ovary

A9— right tube and ovary

A9-19- remaining anterior endomyometrium from fundus towards LUS
A20—30-remaining post endomyomet from fundus towards lower uterine segment

B. "Right periaortic nodes". Received unfixed placed in formalin is a 4.6 x
1.7 x 0.5 cm pink—tan lymph node with surrounding adipose tissue is serial
sectioned submitted entirely in blocks Bl-B3.

C. "Left paraaortic lymph nodes". Received unfixed placed in formalin is a
2.6 x 2 x 0.6 cm aggregate of pink-tan lymph nodes and a scant amount of
adipose tissue are submitted entirely in blocks C1 and C2.

D. "Left pelvic nodes". Received unfixed placed in formalin is a 5.6 x 3.8 x
2 cm portion of adipose tissue that contains five lymph nodes ranging from 1 x
0.6 x 0.4 cm up to 3.1 x 1.4 x 1 cm.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Dl— one lymph node candidate bisected
D2- two lymph node candidates each bisected one inked blue
D3— one lymph node candidate serial sectioned

D4-D5 one lymph node candidate serial sectioned

 

E. "Right round ligament". Received unfixed placed in formalin is a 1.6 cm
long x 1.1 cm in diameter ovoid smooth pink-tan rubbery tissue that is

—-———--u_

Contiguous with a 3.1 x 1.1 x 0.2 cm fragment of soft fatty membranous
tissue. The specimen is serial sectioned and submitted in blocks El and E2.

F1 "Right pelvic nodes". Received unfixed placed in formalin is a 5.7 x 3.1 x
2.8 cm portion of adipose tissue that contains two lymph nodes ranging from
1.6 x 1.3 x 1 cm up to 5.2 x 2 x 1 cm.

BLOCK SUMMARY:
Fl— one lymph node candidate bisected
FZ—FS one lymph node candidate serial sectioned

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: HYSTERECTOMY, OOPHORECTOMY & LYMPHADENECTOMY

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 6th Edition): pTZ pNO pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution‘s Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to Our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

NOTE: The uterus harbors two tumors that are interpreted as a low grade large
endometrial cancer located in the lower uterine segment and its 2.5 x 2.1 x 1
cm implant that is FIGO grade 3 and penetrates 9 mm into the 15 mm thick
cervical wall. ,/~\. 'k

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).
