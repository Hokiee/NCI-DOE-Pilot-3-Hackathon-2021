Surgical Pathology
REVISED REPORT (Addendum/Procedure included)

TISSUE DESCRIPTION:

Right kidney (16 x 15 x 6 cm) with 7 cm of left ureter, biopsy from
right kidney (3 x 2 x 0.8 cm), tissue from right lower lobe lung
(No.1Hu5.5 x 2.4 x 1.3 cm and No.2nw0.8 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm), retrocaval
lymph nodes and intra—aortic caval tissue (2.3 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm)

DIAGNOSIS:
Kidney, right, biopsy: Grade 2 (of 4) renal cell carcinoma, clear
cell type. Coagulative necrosis present.

Kidney, right, radical nephrectomy: Grade 2 (of 4) renal cell
carcinoma, clear cell type, forms a 14.0 x 10.0 x 6.0 cm mass
located in the right kidney. The tumor extends into the perinephric
fat. The renal vein is grossly free of tumor. The tumor does not
involve the collecting system. Coagulative tumor necrosis is
present. Sarcomatoid differentiation is absent. The surgical
margins are negative. No renal hilar lymph nodes are identified.
The adrenal gland is absent.

Lung, right lower lobe, wedge excision No.1: Metastatic grade 2 (of
4) renal cell carcinoma forming a 1.0 cm nodule. Surgical margins
are free of involvement.

Lung, right lower lobe, wedge excision No.2: Metastatic grade 2 (of
4) renal cell carcinoma forming a 0.8 cm nodule.

Lymph nodes, retrocaval, excision: Multiple (2) retrocaval lymph
nodes are negative for tumor.

Soft tissue, intrawaortic caval region, excision: Benign
fibroadipose and nerve tissue.

ADDENDUM:

Immunohistochemical stain for EGFR shows 100% of tumor cells
positive, with 2+ intensity. This tumor can be considered an
EGFR—expressing carcinoma. Response to treatment does not appear to
correlate with intensity of staining or number of cells positive.
