1. LEFT KIDNEYI RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY - RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, PAPILLARY
TYPE, FURHMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 2 OF 4 (4.1 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION). SEE
COMMENT.

- TUMOR IS CONFINED TO THE KIDNEY.

~ NO VASCULAR INVASION PRESENT.

- ALL SURGICAL MARGINS, INCLUDING VASCULAR. URETERAL AND PERINEPHRIC SOFT
TISSUE, ARE NEGATIVE.

-ADRENAL GLAND NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

COMMENT

This tumor focally has clear cell changes. By immunohistochemistry, these
clear cells are negative for cytokeratin 7, similar to conventional clear

cell RCC. while the rest of the papillary R00 is positive for this marker.
The signiﬁcance of ﬁnding a small component of clear cell RCC in an
otherwise papillary R00 is unknown.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. The specimen consists of a left kidney surrounded by an envelope of
fibroadipose tissue measuring in total 21.5 x 8.5 x 7.5 cm. and weighing
1,224.25 grams. The kidney measures 11.5 x 5.5 x 4.5 cm. At the

inferior pole of the Specimen, a 5.0 cm in diameter area of exposed capsule
is apparent. Underlying this is a 4.1 x 4.0 x 4.0 mass which extends from
the inferior pole of the kidney. On sectioning, the mass has a variegated,
yellow-red, soft and focally hemorrhagic cut surface. It appears
well-circumscribed and does not appear to extend into the perirenal fat or
renal sinus, and is not present at the soft tissue margin of the specimen.
The closest soft tissue margin is approximately 2 cm from the tumor.
Satellite nodules of tumor are not present in the renal tissue. Dissection
of the renal veins does not show intravascular presence of neoplasm. The
renal parenchyma is pale, with blurred corticomedullary demarcations.
There is one large cyst present in the superior pole and several much
smaller cysts scattered throughout the renal parenchyma. The cysts are
lined by a smooth wall and are ﬁlled with clear fluid. The largest cyst
measures 2.0 cm in largest diameter and the smaller cysts range in size
from 0.2 to 0.5 cm in diameter. A partially fragmented adrenal gland is
visible on the surface of the specimen measuring 5.5 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm and
weighing 5.6 grams. The adrenal is without nodules but is somewhat
hemorrhagic. It does not appear involved by the mass, and the closest
portion of mass is approximately 7 cm distant. A 5.0 cm segment of ureter
is present and is essentially unremarkable. Lymph nodes are not present.
Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1 frozen section no
charge; A2 vascular margins and ureter margin; A3 representative sections
of adrenal; A4 & A5 tumor nearest soft tissue margin; A6 tumor nearest
renal sinus; A7 tumor nearest renal pelvis; A8 tumor and adjacent kidney;
A9 tumor; A10 representative section normal kidney and representative
section of kidney with cysts.
