A. Left brain tumor A. Frozen Section Charge

8. P53 Protein B. KI-67, Nuclear Antigen, Mibl
C. Left brain tumor
CLINIZAL HlSTORY: year old male with history of a newly diagnosed

left temporal brain tumor.
GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received the following specimens in the Department of
Pathology, labeled with the patient's name

A. Left brain tumor
B. Left brain tumor
0. Left brain tumor
A. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, designated "Left

brain tumor" and consists of a roughly wedge shaped piece of rubbery,
pink—tan soft tissue that is 1.5 x 1.4 x G.6 cm. A touch prep is made
and a representative piece is submitted for frozen section. Frozen
section diagnosis is "A5trocytoma_yjtﬂwgemlsrocytic features," per Dr.
. Frozen tissUe is resubmitted for permanents in cassette Feel
and remaining tissue is submitted in cassette A2. (
B. The specimen is received fresh, designated "Left brain tumor" anu
consists of multiple pieces of slightly firm, rubbery, pink—tan soft
tissue measuring 3.0 x 2.3 x 0.6 cm in aggregate. A representative

 

portion is submitted to the tumor bank. Cur surfaces are homogenous,
7 g and pale tan. Representative secLions are submitted in
seesettes 81 and 82.

C. The specimen is received fresh, designated "Eeft brain tumor" and

consists of a 5.7 x 4.2 0.9 cm aggregate of somewhat gelatinous,
,» markedly soft and somewhat friable
surf ces are glistening, homogenous pale—tan.

are submitted in a.seet:e$ Cl through CS.

 

 

     

DIAGNOSI S:

A. "Left brain tumor, resection":

Anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO Grade III) (see comment)
B. "Left brain tumor,‘rnsection"z

Anaplastic astrocytoma (VHO Grade II?) (see comment)
0. "Left brain tumor, resection":

Anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO Grade Ill) (see comment}
COMMENT: Sections Show a diffusely infiltrating astrocytoma with
prominent gemistocytio phenotype, nuclear pleomorphism and hyperchromaeia

and increased mitoses. Numerous microcysts are seen in the background.
There are occasional apoptotic tumor cells but definitive tumor necrosis
is not identified in thie material. In addition, hyperplastic blood
vessels with fibrin thrombi are seen but definitive vascular endothelial
proliferation is not readily identified in this material. There is a
prominent perivascular infiltrate of mature lymphocytes.
lmmunohistochemical stains show that the majority of tumor cells are
immunoreactive for GFAP. P53 immunostain shows rare individual weakly
immunoreactive tumor cells. Ki~67 shows an elevated proliferation index
of up to 10% approximately. These findings support the diagnosis. There
is a subpopulation of tumor cells with rounded nuclei and perinuclear
halos but with prominent nuclear pleomorphism. Analysis of lpl9q
chromosomal status will be performed and results reported in an addendum.
Correlation with clinical and imaging findings is strongly recommended.
Dr. m has reviewed this case and concurs.

"I, or my qualified designee, have performed the gross examination and
description and I have personally reviewed the gross descriptiOn and
specimen preparations referenced herein, and have personally issued this
report."
