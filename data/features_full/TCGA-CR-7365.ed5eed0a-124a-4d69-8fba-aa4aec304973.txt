2.2 x 0.6 cm in horizontal dimension. A metallic staple is present,
clamping off a portion of the specimen. The remaining surfaces of the
specimen show cauterization artifact. The mucosal surface contains no
grossly apparent lesions. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal
muscular tissue with no grossly apparent areas of firmness. No lesions
are identified. The specimen is entirely submitted.

13) SOURCE: Composite Resection

"Composite resection" is received fresh and consists of a partial
mandibulectomy specimen that is 10.0 cm from anterior to posterior, 9.0
cm from superior to inferior, and 5.0 cm from medial to lateral. The
specimen contains a rectangular fragment of fibroadipose tissue (neck
dissection) which measures 12.0 x 4.0 x 1.6 cm. The specimen is inked in
the following manner: the superior surface is inked yellow, the inferior
surface is inked black, the medial surface is inked orange, the lateral
surface is inked green, the anterior surface is inked red, and the
posterior surface is inked blue. The specimen is serially sectioned to
reveal an irregular, lobulated, firm tan- gray lesion that measures 4.2 x
2.8 x 2.3 x cm. This lesion appears to arise from the mucosa of the
ﬂoor of the mouth and is eroding the submucosal surface down to the
mandible. The lesion grossly abuts the mandible but invasion cannot be
identified grossly. This lesion abuts the medial soft tissue margin. The
lesion appears to be 1.9 cm from the anterior margin, appears grossly to
abut the superior margin, 0.5 cm from the lateral margin, 0.6 cm from
the posterior margin, and 0.3 cm from the inferior margin. Bony shave
margins are taken of the ramus (posterior) and the mandibular bony
resection margin (anterior margin, shaved). A portion of the tumor is
saved in RPMI, saved in the -80 freezer, saved in glutaraldehyde, and a
small portion given to research. Bony shaved margins, soft tissue
margins, and representative sections of tumor are submitted for
evaluation following decalcification as follows:
