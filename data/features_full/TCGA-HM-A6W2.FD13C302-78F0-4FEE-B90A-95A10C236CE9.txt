Final Surgical Pathology Report

Procedure:

Diagnosis

A. Right ovary, excision:
Metastatic poorly differentiated adenosquamous carcinoma
Consistent with origin from the patient's cervical primary

B. Uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes, left ovary, upper vagina
and parametrium, excision:

Cervical Adenosquamous carcinoma, poorly differentiated, 6 cm size

Extension invasive tumor into lower uterine segment with
lymphovascular space invasion

Extension of in situ tumor into endometrial lining

Vaginal and parametrial tissues including margins negative for tumor

Bilateral fallopian tubes negative for malignancy

Left ovary: Negative for malignancy

C. Para—aortic lymph nodes, dissection:
7 lymph nodes negative for malignancy (0/7)

Microscopic Description:
A—C. Microscopic examination performed and summarized in the cervical
cancer template below:

Histologic type: Adenosguamous carcinoma
Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated
Primary tumor (pT) TNM (FIGO): Tumor was visible and 6 cm in greatest
dimension without extension into vaginal tissue are parametrial tissue
(pTZa) (FIGO IVE)
Margins of resection:

Distance of tumor to closest margin 1 mm from anterior cervical
wall margin segment margin

Presence of carcinoma in situ at distal margin: Negative
Vascular invasion: Venous and lymphatic space invasion are identified
within the lower uterine segment and slide 812
Regional lymph nodes (pN): The seven para—aortic lymph nodes which were
evaluated are negative for tumor (limited pNO)
Distant metastasis (pM): The right ovary is positive for metastatic
poorly differentiated adenosquamous carcinoma (greater than 10 cm
tumor) (le)
Other findings: The endometrium also contains tumor which mimics
atypical complex hyperplasia but given the extensive amount of tumor
within the cervix is compatible with in situ spread of cervical tumor
into the endometrial cavity.

SpeCimen

A. Right ovary

B. Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes, left ovary, upper vagina,

C. Para—aortic lymph nodes

Clinical Information

carcinoma.

Gross Description

A. Received fresh labeled "right tube and ovary" is a 499 g, 13 x 10 x
8 cm soft lobulated dusky tan—yellow—pink ovary. On sectioning, the
cut surfaces are soft and focally cystic pale tan and somewhat
multinodular. A scant amount of residual ovarian stroma with
identifiable corpora lutea and corpora albicantia is identified along
one aspect (see block 10). No fallopian tube is present. Two frozen

sections are performed. Tissue procurement was performed.

B. Received fresh labeled "uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes, left ovary,
upper vagina, parametrium" is a 253 g, 6.7 x 5.3 x 4.3 cm symmetrical
uterine corpus with attached 5.1 cm cervix, bilateral fallopian tube
segments and left ovary. The serosa is smooth tan-pink. A rim of
glistening tan-white vaginal mucosa surrounds a markedly dilated,
annular, 6.2 cm dusky tan—pink ectocervix. A. 6.0 x 4.5 cm rubbery
glistening tan-white—pink tumor mass protrudes from the cervical 05.
The vaginal margin, paracervical margin, and parametrial tissues are
inked blue. A portion of the tumor is submitted for tissue procurement
as requested. On opening, a scant amount of residual glistening
tan-pink oval mucosa is identified along the left and posterior aspect.
The aforementioned tumor mass measures 10.0 x 5.8 cm, involves the
remainder of the cervix (predominantly from approximately 7 o'clock to
12 o'clock) and extending into the anterior and posterior lower uterine
segment and anterior uterine cavity. The tumor has a maximal thickness
of 4 cm, extending to within 0.3 cm of the inked paracervical surface.
The uninvolved uterine cavity is lined by glistening tan—pink
endometrium averaging 0.5 cm. The myometrium is smooth to mildly
trabecular tan—pink and measures up to 3 cm. The left ovary measures
3.5 x 3.3 x 2.4 cm. Stroma is pale tan with identifiable corpora lutea
and corpora albicantia. In addition, there are several smooth lined
cystic structures averaging 0.3 cm. Bilaterally, the fimbriated right
and left fallopian tube segments average 8 cm in length and 0.4 cm in
diameter. The lumina are pinpoint and stellate.
Summary: 1 through 4 — vaginal cuff margin in a clockwise manner
beginning at 12-3 o‘clock, 5 and 6 - bisected cervix, 12 o'clock, 7 and
8 — anterior cervix/lower uterine segment with tumor full thickness to
inked surface of specimen, 9 and 10 - bisected posterior cervix,
continuity inked orange, 11 and 12 - bisected section posterior
cervix/bus including tumor full thickness to inked surface of specimen,
continuity inked black, 13 and 14 - right parametrial tissue, 15 and 16
- left parametrial tissue 17 — anterior endomyometrium, 18 - posterior
endomyometrium, l9 and 20 - left ovary and tube, 21 - right fallopian
tube

C. Received fresh labeled "periaortic lymph nodes" is a 4.8 x 3.0 x 1.7
cm aggregate of soft, lobulated tan gold adipose tissue. Several soft
to slightly rubbery tanspink tissues measuring up to 1.4 cm are
recovered.

Summary: 1 - 4 Lymph nodes, 2 - 2 lymph nodes, 3 — trisected largest
lymph node
