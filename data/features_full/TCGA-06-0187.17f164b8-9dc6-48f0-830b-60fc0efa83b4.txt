Whas right parietal brain tumor, intra axial.

OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
Not Given

Operation/Specimen: A: Brain,right parietal, biopsy
B: Right parietal Brain, resection

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: ’
A and B. Brain, right parietal, excision: Glioblastoma.
See comment.

COMMENT

The specimen is portions of cerebrum diffusely infiltrated and extensively
effaced by an astrocytic neoplastic proliferation with nuclear anaplasia,
mitotic figures, prominent microvasoular cellular proliferation, and zones of
_necrosis. There are several multinucleated cells.

Special stains to better characterize the neoplasm are being requested and
will be reported as an addendum.

Results—Comments

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates glial fibrillogenesis by the
neoplastic cells. The neuronal markers fail to demonstrate a neoplastic
neuronal component. Only about 1% of tumor cells over express the p53
protein} With the MIB—l there is a proliferation index of about 21% in the
more active areas.

Comment: These immune results support a diagnosis of high histological grade
glioma without a neuronal component. u

both methylated and unmethylated MGMT promoter sequences, with products
detected by gel electrophoresis.
