COMMENT

The tumor extensiveiy invoives the surfaces of the Teft and right ovaries;
however, the right ovarian parenchyma] invoTvement measures greater than 0.5
cm quaiifying as an ovarian primary.

The individuaT tumor nucTei are atypicaT, but are uniform, and 7 mitotic
figures per 10 high power fields are present.

GROSSDESCHPHON _ _
(A) OMENTUM — A portion of omentum (19 x 10 x 2.5 cm), infiitrated by a paie
tan, mucoid tumor. Representative sections are submitted in A1 through A6.

 

(B) UTERUS, BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES — A uterus (7.0 x 4.5 x 2.5 cm), with
attached ieft faiio ian tube ("0 x 0.4 cm) reviousiy iigated; ft ovary
(2.0 x 1. 2 x 0. 7 cm9, right 0v / (3.4), 8rig t faiiopian tube C- . x 0.4 cm)
previousiK iig ated, and right ovary (2.8 x 2 0 x 1.1 cm).

In t e right ovary there is a papiiiary mass with tan— gray surface
repiacing most of the ovarian surface and parenchyma. This mass is 1. 7 cm in
maximum cross sectionai dimension. In the ieft ovary there is a surface mass
(0. 8 x 0.3 cm), with simiiar characteristic of the mass in the ieft ovary.
A150, smaii noduies (0.2 cm) are present in both faiTopian tubes.

The externai surface of the uterus is unremarkabTe. The myometrium is
1.8 cm thick; no discrete nodules are noted. The endometrium is fiat and Tess
than 0.1 cm thick. The ecto— and endocervix are unremarkabie except for the
presence of Nabothian cysts.

Tissue is submitted to the tumor bank.
