GROSS DESCRIPTION
(A) RIGHT NECK DISSECTION (LEVELS 1 PLUS II—CLAMP ON LEVEL II) — A fragment
of fibroadipose tissue (10.0 x 3.4 x 1.0 cm), with a surgica] clamp near one
extremity. Adjacent to the C1amp there is a g1and (2.5 x 2.0 x 1.7 cm), with
ga1e tan 1obu1ated surface. Several 1ymph nodes are identified, the two
argest ross1y repTaced by tumor and measuring up to 2.5 cm.
The ymph nodes adjacent to the gTand and to one side of the c1amp are

submitted from section A1—A4. The opposite end of the Specimen are submitted

in A4 to A12.

SECTION CODE: Al, three lymph nodes; A2, Six lymph nodes; A3, four lymph
nodes; A4, salivary gland; A5, two lymph nodes; A6, four lymph nodes; A7, one
lymph node, grossly replaced by tumor; A8, three lymph nodes; A9, two lymph

nodes; A10, one lymph node, grossl replaced b ‘ 11, A12, firm
fibroadipose tissue, pOSSTble lymp nodes (2).%

(3) LEFT NECK DISSECTION (LATERAL l, CLAMP ON — A fragment of
fibroadipose tissue (4.5 x 2.5 X 1.7 cm), with an attached sur ical clamp, and
a glandu ar structure (2.7 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm), with pale tan lobu ated surface.
Sectioning reveal several lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 cm in maximum
dimension, grossly unremarkab e. All the lym h nodes are submitted.

SECTION CODE: B1, gland; B2, three possi le l h nodes; BS, two possible
lymph nodes; B4, one lymph node, bisected. #0
(C) ANTERIOR MARGIN — A strip of pale pink mucosa 5.0 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm), inked
blue on one surface. The specimen is bisected and submitted in toto for
frozen section C1 and C2, en face.
(D) TEETH

(E) TONGUE MARGIN, TRUE MARGIN INKED — A fragment of tan—pink soft tissue
(6.6 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm). Blue, marking the true margin, is noted on one
surface. In addition, the specimen is received on a telfa pad, marking the
left and right aspects.

INK CODE: Red—right true margin, black—left true margin.

SECTION CODE: E1—E6, specimen serially sectioned from right to left and
entir l submitted as perpendicular section for frozen section examination.

*FS/DX: SQUAMOUS MUCOSA, NO TUMOR PRESENT.
(P) MANDIBLE, TONGUE — A composite resection of floor of mouth and mandible
and tongue. A tumor is noted in the floor of mouth. The mass measures 3.5 x
3.0 x 1.8 cm. The closest gross margin is the mucosal margin on the far left
side of the Specimen. The tumor is grossly appears not to involve the margins
of resection and a pears to invade the anterior aspect of the mandibular bone.

Wmen is su mitted sequentially from left to right under Fl—F21.
