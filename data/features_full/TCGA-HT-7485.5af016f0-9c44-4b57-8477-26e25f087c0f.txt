- Pathology Report

Microscopic Discussion:

Sections demonstrate a mildly hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates both gray and
white matter. The tumor cells have round to oblong nuclei with only mild atypia. Although they
do not have prominent glial processes, only rarely are perinuclear halos seen. In the gray
matter, the tumor does demonstrate focally prominent perineuronal satellitosis. No mitotic
figures are seen. There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis.

Addendum Discussion:

Only very rare MlB-1 reactive cells are present with an estimated labeling index of <0.1%.
There are numerous cells that are immunoreactive for P53. This pattern is most consistent with
astrocytoma differentiation.

Final Addendum Diagnosis:
Well-differentiated astrocytoma (WHO grade II)
