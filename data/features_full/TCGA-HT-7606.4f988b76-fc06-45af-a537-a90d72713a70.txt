Microscopic Description:
1. Sections demonstrate midly hypercellular white matter that is infiltrated by mildly to
moderately atypical fibrillary astrocytes. No mitotic figures are seen. There is no

microvascular proliferation or necrosis.

2.Sections demonstrate gray matter with only a rare, mildly atypical cell scattered
throughout. These likely represent infiltrating tumor cells.

3. Sections demonstrate gray and white matter. The gray matter demonstrates little
involvement with tumor. The white matter is mildly hypercellular due to diffuse tumor
infiltration as described in specimen #1.

Diagnosis:

Positive for infiltrating astrocytoma.
