It consists of a segment of ureter measuring 0.4 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter.
The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis in AFS.

B: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Left ureter ﬁle". It
consists of a segment of ureter measuring 0.4 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter.
The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis in BPS.

C: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Uretheral margin"
. It consists of a tan soft tissue segment measuring 1.2 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm. The
specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis in CFS.

D: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Uterus, cervix,
ovaries, bladder". It consists of a urinary bladder, uterus, cervix and bilateral
ovaries and fallopian tubes measuring overall 25 x 20 x 2.7 cm. The attached
peritoneum measures 15 x 9 x 0.1 cm, which is smooth and glistening. The
perivesical resection margin is inked black. The urinary bladder is opened
anteriorly to reveal two lesions, one ulcerative and the other papillary and
exophytic. The ulcer ulcerative lesion is located on the right lateral wall 2 cm
above and lateral to the right ureterovesical junction. The papillary lesion
measures 4 x 3 x 1 cm and partially surrounds the mouth of a diverticulum in the
dome. No definitive gross invasion of the bladder wall is seen by either of the
two lesions. The diverticulum measures 4 x 2 x 1 cm and is lined by flat normal
appearing mucosa. The remaining mucosa of the urinary bladder is unremarkable.
Bilateral ureterovesical junctions are identified and are uninvolved by tumor. The
attached right ureter measures 7 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter and the left
ureter measures 6 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter. Both are unremarkable. The
uterus measures 10 x 5 x 2.7 cm and is covered by unremarkable across. The cervix
measures 2.5 cm in length x 3 cm in diameter. The exocervix is covered by smooth
and glistening mucosa. The right ovary measures 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm. The right
fallopian tube measures 7 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter. Both appear normal.
The left ovary measures 4 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm. The left fallopian tube measures 9 cm in
length x 0.5 cm in diameter. A paratubal cyst is identified on the left fallopian
tube measuring 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The cervix and uterus are bivalved to reveal a
sessile polypoid lesion on the posterior endometrial wall measuring 1.2 x 1 x 0.4

Bic: Se ee final microscoPic— —diagnoses:

D: Sections of the bladder show invasive poorly differentiated urothelial
carcinoma of the right lateral wall (ulcerated lesion D2-5) and dome (papillary
lesion (07-10) associated with both ﬁlat and papillary processes. The tumor
involves the lamina propria of the right lateral wall and the superficial
musculeris propria (D10) of the dome. Individual cells range from moderate to
markedly pleomorphic corresponding with grades 3 and 4/4. Urothelial carcinoma in
situ is seen in sections from the right lateral wall (03-5) in association with the
invasive carcinoma. Sections of the non-neoplastic bladder mucosa show multifocal
chronic inflammation with associated reactive urothelial changes. Resection
margins are free of urothelial dysplasia and malignancy.

E—S: See final microscopic-diagnoses.
