1) Received fresh, labeled "uterus. cervxx, tubes and ovaries", is a 134 gran specimen

Including an unopened uterus (8.7 x 5 0 x 4 5 cm), right fallopian tube (6.0 cm long

by O 8 cm in diameter), right ovary (3.0 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm), left fallopian tube (5.5 cm

long by O 8 cm in diameter), and left ovary (2.8 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm). The ectocervix (3.5

x 3.5 cm) is covered by smooth, tan-pink, glistening, unremarkable mucosa. The

external 05 is slit—like. 1.2 cm long. The endocervical canal (2.5 cm long) has a

tan-pink, slightly hemorrhagic mucosa The endometrial cavxty contains a 4.0 x 3.4 x

1 5 cm irregular tan—pink heaped up, friable tumor mass arising from the posterior L

endomyometrium with apparent extension onto the anterior endomyometrium as well." ‘ r|

There is also a 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm smooth well-circumscribed tan-white nodule arisingl

from the anterior endomyometrium. The myometrium is 2.0 cm In maXImum thickness. {Theﬁ

mass is located apprOXImately 2.0 cm from the lower uterine segment The nodule is
located approximately 3 0 cm from the lower uterine segment. The fallopian tubes are
brown-purple with fimbriated ends and paratubal cysts ranging from 0 l — 0.2 cm in
diameter The ovaries are tan-yellow~white, slightly lobulated and unremarkable. The
anterior serosal surface is inked blue and the posterior serosal surface is inked ‘
black. 0n the posterior fundal serosal surface, there is a 0.8 x o 5 x 0.4 cm

tan—white, well~c1rcumscribed nodule. A portion of the fallopian tube and tumor mass

submitted for research In the posterior myometrium, there is a l 8 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm _
tan—white, well-Circumscribed nodule with a hemorrhagic center. There is a 0 8 x 0.6 .-
