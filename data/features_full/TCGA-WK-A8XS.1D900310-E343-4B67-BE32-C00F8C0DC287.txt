PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:

SPECIMEN DESIGNATﬁg/ﬁpﬁﬁTIAL GASTRECTOMY":
LEIOMYOSARCO (7.6 cm), intermediate grade,
involving gastric mucosa and serosa; see NOTE.

Mitoses number up to 21:10 HPF.

No tumor necrosis identified.

Mucosal resection margins, negative for tumor.

Tumor is present 2.3 cm from the closest/proximal resection
margin.

Fundic gland polyp.

NOTE: The histologic findings are similar to the previous biopsy II

CLINICAL DATA:

History: Gastric leiomyosarcoma — bleeding.
Operation: Partial gastrectomy.

Operative Findings: None specified.

Clinical Diagnosis: Bleeding gastric leiomyosarcoma.

TISSUE SUBMITTED:
A/l) Partial gastrectomy; short stitch — proximal; long stitch ~ anterior.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen was received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, unit number,
and "#1. Partial gastrectomy, short proximal, long anterior", and consists of
one partial gastrectomy specimen (10.0 x 5.1 x 4.5 cm) designated with a short
stitch (proximal) and a long stitch (anterior). One stapled resection margin

, spans distal to proximal (14.5 cm, inked in black). A tan/white/pink, firm,
