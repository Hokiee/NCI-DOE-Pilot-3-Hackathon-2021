Gross description:

1. (Prostate gland): Prostate gland: Weight: 52 9, Volume: 47 ml, Size: 4.8 x 5 x 3.6 cm. Adherent
seminal vesicles and deferent duct: right side: 1.6 cm, left side: 1.2 cm. The surface is marked with
green ink on the right side, blue ink on the left side. Apical periurethral a funnel shaped 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.5
cm tissue defect marked with red ink. Total of the cross sections: 2.2 cm.

2. (Lymph nodes, right side): 75 x 4 x 2 cm measuring adipose tissue containing 7 nodes measuring
up to 4.5 cm.

3. (Lymph nodes, left side): 6 x 5 x 1.5 cm measuring adipose tissue containing 3 nodes measuring up
4 cm.

Microscopy:

1. Apex right and left: Right 6 tissue blocks, left 6 tissue blocks (total 12 tissue blocks). 3 cross
sections: Right 18 tissue blocks, left 18 tissue blocks (total 36 tissue blocks). Basis right and left: Right
8 tissue blocks, left 9 tissue blocks (total 17 tissue blocks). Seminal vesicles right and left: Right 2
tissue blocks. left 2 tissue blocks (total 4 tissue blocks). Deferent ducts right and left: Right 1 tissue
block, left 1 tissue block (total 2 tissue blocks).

2. Frozen lymph nodes right: 22 tissue blocks.

3. Frozen lymph nodes left: 16 tissue blocks.

Diagnosis:

1. (Prostate gland): Poorly differentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason 4+5=9, (Gleason 4: 70%,
Gleason 5: 20%. Gleason 3: 10%). Tumor involves both lobes with the main focus rectolateral left.
Maximum tumor diameter: 45 mm. Perineural invasion. Tumor inﬁltration into pen-prostatic adipose
tissue in 5 tissue blocks with the main focus around both seminal vesicles (maximum invasion length 3
mm, maximal invasion depth 2 mm). Positive surgical margin in 1 block in the left prostate base
(contact length 0.4 mm; Gleason 4).

Remaining prostatic tissue with small foci of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (high grade PlN) and
signs of myoglandular hyperplasia of the prostate. Urothelium of the prostatic urethra without
dysplasia. Tumor infiltration into both seminal vesicles and deferent ducts with positive resection
margins.

2. (Lymph nodes, right side): Ten tumor-free lymph nodes (0/10).
3. (Lymph nodes. left side): Four tumor-free lymph nodes (0/4).

Tumor classiﬁcation

(in consideration of the intraoperative frozen-section and immunohistochemical analyses):

pT3b. Gleason 4+5=9 (Gleason 4: 70%. Gleason 5: 20%. Gleason 3: 10%), maximum tumor diameter:

45 mm, tumor volume approx. 28 ml (Gleason 4: 19.7 ml. Gleason 5: 5.6 ml. Gleason 3: 2.8 ml), pNO
(0/14). R1

Comments:

The preceding intraoperative frozen section revealed minor tumor inﬁltration (<1mm) in the surgical
margin of the urethra.

One macroscopic image for tumor mapping.
