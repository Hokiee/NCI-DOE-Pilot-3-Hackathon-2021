Gross:
A. The specimen is labeled "hypervascular liver lesion
segment 6." Received in is a 22 gm, 5.0 x 3.5 x

2.8 cm portion of liver which is received in two pieces.

The capsule is purple—gray and smooth with a 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.5
cm whiteegray nodular bulge. The resection surface is
marked with black ink. Further sectioning reveals a 2.0 x
1.5 x 1.5 cm well—circumscribed, tan~gray mass corresponding
to the capsular bulge. The mass exhibits a nodular, solid,
tan cut surface. The mass is 1.2 cm from the closest black—
inked resection surface. The mass is well—demarcated from
the remaining hepatic parenchyma is tan—brown. A portion of
the mass and unremarkable liver is sent to

tissue bank. Representative sections are then submitted for
permanent as follows:

Cassette Designation:

Al Mass with closest resection margin
A2-4 Mass with adjacent parenchyma
A5 Unremarkable parenchyma

Microscopic:
A histological examination has been performed.

A. H and E and trichromeustained sections show a well-
circumscribed nodule composed of hepatocytes with thickened
cell plates. A noduiar architecture is present in this

area. The neoplastic hepatocytes contain increased NC ratio
and pleomorphic nuclei. A reticulin stain demonstrates loss
and paucity of the reticulin network. The surrounding liver
parenchyma demonstrates portal tracts with bridging
fibrosis.
