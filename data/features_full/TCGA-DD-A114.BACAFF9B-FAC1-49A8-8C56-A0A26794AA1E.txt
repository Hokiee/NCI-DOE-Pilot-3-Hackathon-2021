Right lobe liver 17.0 x 15.0 x 1.5 cm with gallbladder [9.5 x 5.4
cm] together weighing 1,015 grams.

DIAGNOSIS:

Liver, right lobe, excision: Grade 3 {of 4) hepatocellular
carcinoma, usual type, forming 5‘51331E ﬁaéé”Fé 1 Xﬂgfé x 2.3 cm}.
Thegtﬁﬁor is located in the right lobe. The hepatic capsule is free
of tumor. The surgical margins are free of tumor [free by 0.5 cm].
Extratumoral vascular invasion is identified. The tumor is not
encapsulated, infiltration of parenchyma being of pushing type. No
lymph nodes are identified. The gallbladder shows cholesterolosis,
otherwise unremarkable. Non—neoplastic hepatic parenchyma will be
assessed in permanent sections.

ADDENDUM:
. Non-neoplastic liver shows chronic ”hepatitis, consistent with

hepatitis C virus (HCV] infection, mildly active [grade 2 of 4),
with portal and periportal fibrosis [stage 21.

cm) together weighing 1,015 grams.

DIAGNOSIS:

Liver, right lobe, excision: Grade 3 (of 4) hepatocellular
carcinoma, usual type, forming a single mass (3.1 x 2. 4 x 2.3 cm].
The tumor is located in the right lobe. The hepatic capsule is free
of tumor. The surgical margins are free of tumor (free by 0.5 cm).
Extratumoral vascular invasion is identified. The tumor is not

lymph nodes are identified. The gallbladder shows cholesterolosis,
otherwise unremarkable. Non-neoplastic hepatic parenchyma will be
assessed in permanent sections.
