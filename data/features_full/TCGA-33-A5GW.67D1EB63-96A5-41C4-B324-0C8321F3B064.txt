PART #1: FS: RIGHT LOWER LOBE LUNG NODULE
Resident Pathologist.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:
Staff Pathologist:
Other Pathologists/PAS:

FS: Right Lower Lobe Lung Nodule: Moderately differentiated
squamous cell carcinoma, less than 1.0 mm from stapled resection
margin.

Frozen section call-back confirmed with and read back by
Dictated by: PA (Parts 1—5).
The specimen is received in five (5) parts.

The specimen for Part 1 is received fresh for frozen section
diagnosis, labeled with the patient's mama“, and
designated 'Right Lower Lobe Lung Nodule.‘ The specimen consists of a
wedge of lung tissue at approximately 52.0 grams and 9.0 x 3.0 x 3.0
cm. Staple lines are present. The staple lines are removed and the'
underlying parenchyma inked black. The specimen is sectioned to
reveal a 2.0 x 1.8 x 1.7 cm fairly well—defined gray-tan to white
firm mass lesion that grossly abuts the black ink. A representative
section of the lesion closest to the ink is submitted for frozen
section. It is pink-red, congested, and spongy. No other lesions are
grossly noted. Representative sections, including approximately
ninety—five percent (”95%) of the lesion are submitted.

PART #2: RIGHT LEVEL 7 LYMPH NODE
Resident Pathologist:

The specimen for Part 2 is received fresh, labeled with the patient‘s
name, — and designated 'Right Level '7 Lymph Node.‘
The speCImen consists of five (5) black friable fragments of soft

tissue aggregating to 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is submitted
in its entirety, wrapped in lens paper.

PART #3: RIGHT LEVEL 11 LYMPH NODE
Resident Pathologist:

The spa imen Part 3 is received fresh, labeled with the patient's
name, , and designated 'Right Level 11 Lymph
Node.‘ The speCImen consists of two (2) black—gray fragments of soft
tissue measuring 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm and 1.8 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm. Each
fragment is bisected and submitted in its entirety, wrapped in lens
paper.

PART #4: RIGHT LOWER LOBE
Resident Pathologist:

The specimen for Part 4 is received fresh, labeled with the patient's
name, , and designated 'Right Lower Lobe.‘ The
specimen consists o a 330.5 gram, 15.0 x 13.0 x 7.0 cm lobectomy.
The pleural surface is pink, smooth, and glistening with focal areas
of anthracotic discoloration. Irregular staple lines are present, the
longest measuring 11.0 cm in length. The specimen is serially
sectioned to reveal spongy, red—pink, focally congested parenchyma
throughout. It is diffusely involved with dilated air spaces,
consistent with emphysematous changes. Mass lesions or nodules are
not grossly identified. Multiple possible nodes are identified around
the hilar region. Representative sections are submitted.
