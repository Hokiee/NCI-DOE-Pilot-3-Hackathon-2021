A. "Right3breast tissue (AF1)", received fresh. An oriented breast excision
with sutures as follows: Long — lateral, short - superior, (Dr. ). A
4.3 x 0.8 cm ellipse of tan skin with a 6.8 x 5.2 x 3.4 cm of underlying
fibrofatty breast tissue is inked as follows: Superior — blue, inferior —
black, posterior — green. The specimen is sectioned from lateral to medial to
reveal a circumscribed firm yellow sabulous 2.4 x 1.5 x approximately 1.5 cm
mass. The mass is within 0.1 cm of the green inked posterior margin and
within 0.2 cm of the blue inked superior margin. The lesion's edge is
approximately 0.4 cm from the black inked inferior margin, 2.5 cm subjacent to
the skin surface and approximately 0.6 cm from the lateral margin. The
adjacent parenchyma is composed of lobules of yellow—pink adipose intermixed
with focally dense white-pink fibroconnective tissue with no additional
lesions noted. Representative sections from the mass is frozen as AFl. The
remnant is submitted as A1.

Block Summary:

A1 — Frozen section remnant.

A2—14 Representative sections from lateral towards medial respectively. The
sections include the entire lesion in relationship to the closest
margins as well as the lateral margin (A2) and the medial margin A14.

AIS-25 Remaining breast, submitted in toto. See photograph on file in

pathology department for location of blocks.

B. "Right breast tissue new posterior margin suture in new margin", received
fresh. A 3.9 x 2.7 x 0.8 cm portion of fibrofatty tissue with a suture on one
surface. The suture surface is marked blue, the specimen is transversely
sectioned and entirely submitted as 31—84.

C. "Right breast tissue new superior margin suture on new margin", received
fresh. A 4.1 x 2.7 x 1.2 cm portion of yellow-white fibrofatty tissue with a
suture present on one surface. The suture surface is marked blue, the
specimen is transversely sectioned and submitted as C1-C4.

D. "Right axillary node, suture on apex". received fresh. An 11.2 x 7.5 x 1.2
cm portion of fibrofatty tissue with a suture present at the apex. The
specimen is dissected for lymph node candidates.

Block Summary:

D1 — 1 Lymph candidate proximal.
D2 — 3 lymph node candidates, medial.
D3- 6 Lymph nodes, medial. WMﬁm

04-5 Bisected lymph node candidate.
D6 2 lymph node candidates, distal.
D7 — 2 lymph node candidates, distal.

N.S.A.B.P. NUCLEAR GRADE: 3‘0F 3.
N.S.A.B.P. HISTOLOGIC GRADE: 3 OF 3.
GROSS TUMOR SIZE: 2.4 X 2.4 X 1.5 CM.

SIZE OF INVASIVE COMPONENT: 2.4.erweax 1.5 CM.
LYMPHATIC/VASCULAR INVASION: ABSENT.
MULTIFOCAL TUMOR: ABSENT.

IN-SITU CARCINOMA: PRESENT, OCCUPYING LESS THAN 5% OF TUMOR (SEE COMMENT).
TYPE OF INsSITU CARCINOMA: COMEDO AND CRIBRIFORM.
SIZE OF IN-SITU CARCINOMA: APPROXIMATELY 4.8 CM, SEE COMMENT.
EXTENSIVE INTRADUCTAL COMPONENT: ABSENT.

STATUS OF NON—NEOPLASTIC BREAST TISSUE: BENIGN FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES.
SIZE OF BIOPSY: 6.8 X 5.2 X 3.4 CM.

MICROCALCIFICATIONS ABSENT.

SURGICAL MARGIN STATUS: NEGATIVE (CLOSEST MARGIN 3 MM TO DCIS).

ESTROGEN/PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR AND CELL CYCLE ANALYSIS: PENDING.
METHODOLOGY: IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY, PARAFFIN BLOCK A6.
RESULTS WILL BE ISSUED IN AN ADDENDUM.

COMMENT: Although there is very little in-situ carcinoma within the invasive
tumor mass, there is a large area of DCIS adjacent to the tumor, extending in
a medial direction to near the medial margin. Based on the number of slides

involved, the DCIS involves an area of approximately 4.8 cm in largest
dimension.

B. "RIGHT BREAST TISSUE, NEW POSTERIOR MARGIN" (RE-EXCISION):

BREAST TISSUE, NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.

C. "RIGHT BREAST TISSUE, NEW SUPERIOR MARGIN" (RE-EXCISION):

BREAST TISSUE, NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.

D. "RIGHT AXILLARY LYMPH NODES" (DISSECTION):

METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA IN TWO OF FOURTEEN AXILLARY LYMPH NODES (2/14).
SIZE OF LARGEST METASTASIS: 1.0 CM.
EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION: ABSENT.

ADDENDUM 1:

Tissue was sent to the for assay of the estrogen

and progesterone receptors. The estrogen receptor activity was judged to be

negative with an estimated FMOL value of 0. The progesterone receptor activity

was judged as negative with an estimated FMOL of value of 0. Please refer to
for a complete report.

ADDENDUM 2:

This addendum is issued to report the results of an additional study. The
previous diagnoses are unchanged. An immunostain for HERZ/neu shows moderate
(2+) membrane staining in approximately 50-75% of the tumor cells and is
interpreted as POSITIVE for HERZ/neu overexpression.

METHODOLOGY:

Immunostaining for HERZ/neu (c—erbB—Z) oncoprotein is performed on recut
sections of Block A6. The immunostaining is done using DAKO rabbit anti—human
c—erbB-9 nnrnprotein which is an affinity-isolated antibody product
number . The immunostaining is performed after antigen retrieval by
heating the unstained sections at 95 degrees centigrade for 20 minutes in 10
mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0. The primary antibody is used at a dilution of
1:1500 (manual staining) or 1:2000 (autostainer), with an incubation for one
hour at 37 degrees centigrade. The Histostain Plus kit

is used as the detection system.

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).
