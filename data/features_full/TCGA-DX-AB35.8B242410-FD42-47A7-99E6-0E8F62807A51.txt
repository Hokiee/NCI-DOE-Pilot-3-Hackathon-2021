Clinical Diagnosis & History:

History of retroperitoneal liposarcoma initially

, status post resection
now with recurrence.

Specimens Submitted:

1: Left radical nephrectomy left colectomy resection of peas and illiacus
muscle

2: Small bowel
3: Mesenteric nodule
4: Abdominal scar

DIAGNOSIS:

1. Left nephrectomy left colectomy resection of peas and illiacus muscle,
radical resection:

— Recurrent high grade dedifferentiated liposarcoma, involving left
colon wall, encasing left kidney and ureter.

- The tumor has a multinodular growth pattern, the largest nodule
measuring 18.5 x 15.5 x 12.0 cm.

- The dedifferentiated component shows a high grade
myxofibrosarccma-like morphology, comprising >50% of the mass.
~ Tumor necrosis is present, estimated as 25% grossly.

- Tumor is surrounded grossly by a thin membrane which represents the
surgical resection margin.

— Colon, ureter, and renal vascular margins are free of tumor.
— Muscle tissue is not involved by tumor.

- Renal parenchyma with glomerulosclerosis and non—specific interstitial
inflammation.

2. Small bowel, resection:
- Focal areas of scarring.

- Screen with fibrosis, adhesion, mild acute and chronic inflammation.
- No evidence of malignancy.

3. Soft tissue, Mesenteric nodule, biopsy:

-Nodu1e of mature adipose tissue with scattered hyperchromatic stromal
cells, consistent with well-differentiated liposarccma (1.2 x1.0 x 0.5 cm).

4. Abdominal scar, excision:
— Dermal scar with acute and mild chronic inflammation.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

*** Report Electronically Signed Out ***

Gross Description:

1). The specimen is received fresh and labeled “Resection of psoas and
iliacus muscle, left radical nephrectomy, left colectcmy'. It consists of
a soft tissue mass measuring 18.5 x 15.5 x 12.0 cm. a segment of colon (9.5
cm long, 5.5 on in circumference). left kidney (9.5 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm) with
attached ureter (16 cm long, 0.8 cm in diameter).and a small fragment of
muscle tissue (5.5 x 3.0 x 0.8 cm). The specimen weighs 2033 grams in total.
The large soft tissue mass is encapsulated by a thin layer of fibrous tissue
that is easily separated from the mass. The cut surface is sold. lohulated,
soft, variegated including tan-yellow, to yellow-white, to friable gray. The
friable dusky area occupies roughly 25% of the mass. The mass adheres to the
colon well through its fibrous capsule without grossly invading into it. The
colonic mucosa is tan—pink and flat. The mass also adheres to the distal
segment of the ureter, spanning 6 cm. through its capsule. The ureter is not
grossly involved by the tumor. Sectioning of the kidney and the perirenal
adipose tissue reveals two additional lobulated tumors, most likely
contiguous with the main mass, being attached to the lower pole and in the
hilum, separated by 2.5 cm. The sizes of these nodular masses are 8.4 x 6.5
x 3.8 and 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm respectively with homogenous tan—yellow cut
surface. Both are encapsulated by thin capsules. Neither of the two tumors
is invading into the renal parenchyma. The renal parenchyma is thinned
ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 cm. The renal pelvis and calyces are mildly dilated.
The muscle tissue is attached to superior and posterior aspect of the
kidney and is 2.0 cm from closest tumor. Nb adrenal tissue is grossly
identified. The specimen is photographed. Sections of the tumor and normal
kidney and perirenal fat are submitted for TPS. Representative sections are
submitted for permanent.

Summary all sections:

UM - distal ureteral margin and renal vascular margin
PCM - proximal colon resection margin

DCM — distal colon resection margin

Tl — largest tumor

TC -T1 to colon

TU —T1 to ureter

M - muscle tissue

T2 - tumor attached to lower pole

T3 - renal hilar tumor

T1T2 fibroadipose tissue linked between two nodular areas

2) The specimen was received fresh, labeled l'Small bowel“ and consists of an
unoriented segment of small bowel measuring 37.0 cm in length and ranging
from 4.0 to 7.5 cm in circumference. The serosa is pink purple focally
shaggy with minute areas of gray-tan fibromembranous adhesions, and minimal
attached adipose tissue. Both ends are stapled shut. The specimen is
opened to reveal red-brown plicated ischemic mucosa. with a wall averaging
0.4 cm in thickness. A segment of small bowel measuring 8.2 cm in length is
folded back upon itself, possible an snastomosis. A 1.5 cm in greatest
dimension focus of firm induration is identified 5.0 cm from one margin near
the anastomosis, with a suture on the serosal surface. Representative
sections are submitted.

Summary of sections:

AM - margin closest to anastomosis
OM - opposite margin

I - firm focus

RS -representative sections

3) The specimen is received fresh, labeled I'mesenteric nodule“, and consists

of a 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm portion of tan soft tissue. The specimen is bisected
and entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U — undesignated

4) The specimen is received fresh, labeled “abdominal scarll and consists of
a gray-tan wrinkled ellipse of skin measuring 21.0 x 4.1 x 0.6 cm. A
portion of the skin ellipse is firm and indurated. The specimen is
representatively submitted.

Summary of sections:

U - undesignated
