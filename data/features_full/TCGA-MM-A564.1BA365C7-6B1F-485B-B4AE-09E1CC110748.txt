RT.RENAL MASS

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh for intraoperative gross consultation
and consists of a 920 gm, 21.0 x 14.8 x 7.0 cm right kidney with an
abundant amout of attached perinephric fat, a 6.0 cm in length x 0.3
cm in diameter exposed portion of ureter, a 1.5 cm in length x 0.5 cm
in diameter portion of renal artery covered by a 2.0 cm in length
staple line, a 1.0 cm in length x 0.9 cm in diameter portion of renal
vein covered by a 2.5 cm staple line, and no associated adrenal gland.
The Gerota's fascia margin is inked black, and the specimen is
bivalved to reveal a kidney which measures 15.0 cm from superior to
inferior x 8.0 cm from medial to lateral x 5.0 cm from anterior to
posterior and displays a 7.5 x 6.5 x 5.0 cm mass with a tan—brown to
focally tan—red, hemorrhagic, focally necrotic cut surface in the
inferior pole which occupies essentially the entire pole, displaces
the adjacent urothelium, and grossly appears confined to the kidney.
The mass is located 1.2 cm from the hilum, 4.5 cm from the renal
artery margin, 4.5 cm from the renal vein margin, 14.0 cm from the
ureteral margin, and 0.7 cm from the Gerota's fascia margin. No other
gross lesions are identified. The remaining renal parenchyma is
tan—brown with normal pyramids. The urothelium is tan, smooth, and
unremarkable. No lymph nodes are identified in the perihilar fat.

A portion of the tumor and the normal renal parenchyma are submitted
for tissue banking. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
1— renal artery margin; 2— renal vein margin; 3- ureteral margin; 4—
tumor toward Gerota's fascia margin; 5— tumor toward hilum; 6— tumor
toward adjacent urothelium; 7—8— random tumor; 9— grossly uninvolved
renal parenchyma; 10— grossly uninvolved urothelium.
