ort Status:

 

LEFT KIDNEY, RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY:

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, (12.8 cm) Fuhrman nuclear grade 3 of 4, chromophobe
type. ’

The tumor is confined to the renal parenchyma.

The renal vein, ureter, and inked soft tissue margins are free of tumor.
Lymphatic vascular invasion is not seen.

The renal parenchyma away from the tumor will be reported separately as an
addendum.

Two lymph nodes are free'of tumor.

AJCC (1997) stage T2 N0 MX.

 

NOTE: Hale's colloidal iron stain is positive supporting the diagnosis.

SURGICAL ADDENDUM:
LEFT NEPHRECTOMY

 

KIDNEY PARENCHYMA AWAY FOR THE TUMOR SHOWS NO SPECIFIC ABNORMALITIES

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:

Representative sections of the non~tumor parenchyma contains kidney cortex
and medulla. There are numerous glomeruli seen (over 100). Glomeruli with
global sclerosis are not seen. Glomeruli show normal cellularity and reveal
no significant pathological changes. On PAS and Jones' silver methenamine
stain,_the glomerular basement membranes appear of normal thickness. Tubules
are well preserved. The interstitium shows no fibrosis or active
inflammation. Approximately 10% of the sample shows focal tubular atrophy and
interstitial fibrosis, as evidenced on the trichrome stains (AFOG). Arteries
and arterioles are unremarkable.

CLINICAL DATA:

History: None given.

Operation: Hand assisted laparoscopic left nephrectomy
Clinical Diagnosis: Left renal mass

TISSUE SUBMITTED: #1. Left kidney

The specimen is rece1ve res , a e e w1 e patient's name, unit number

and ”#1. left kidney", and consists of a 545 gram left radical nephrectomy
specimen (15.1 x 12.9 x 5.4 cm), to include entire kidney (15.0 x 11.7 x 4.5
cm), portion of dilated ureter (4.3 cm, 0.6 cm in diameter), renal artery (2.5
x 0.5 x 0.5 cm) and renal vein (2.3 x 2.0 cm in diameter). The kidney is
partially surfaced by perinephric fat. No adrenal gland is noted. Sectioning
demonstrates an encapsulated nodular tan/pink lobulated mass (12.8 x 9.5 x 4.4
cm), which is centrally necrotic and hemorrhagic with an apparent 3.0 x 0.8 X
0.8 cm scar. Mass abuts but does not appear grossly to invade the renal
pelvis, which is freely mobile, and occupies the majority of the central
portion of the kidney, sparing the poles. The mass expands but does not
appear grossly to invade through the renal capsule, which otherwise
demonstrates dense hemorrhagic fibrous adhesions. Closest urethral mar
within 3.0 cm (post-fixation), closest renal vein margin is within 2.5
(post—fixation), and closest renal artery margin is within 3.0 cm
(post—fixation). There are no additional masses noted upon sectioning.
Transitional epithelium is tan/white and velvety, cortical medullary ju
are distinct and the uninvolved portions of the cortical surface appear
smooth. The perinephric adipose tissue is freely mobile. Three repres
sections of the tumor have been submitted for cytogenetics (lA,1B,1C) a
tumor bank (lA,1B,1C). Representative sections of cortex and medulla are
