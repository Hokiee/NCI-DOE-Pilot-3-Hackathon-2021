uallbladder (0.0 x 3.5 x 2.3 cm), peritoneal biopsies {No.1, 3 mm:
No.2, 3 mm], peri choledochal lymph node [2.0 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm], and
right adrenal gland [5.82 grams, 6 x 3.7 x 1.5 cm], right lobe
liver [2,680 grams, 21.5 x 19.5 x 12.5 cm], and cystic duct lymph
node [0.6 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm].

DInENOSIS:

Liver, right lobe, hepatectomy: Grade~§~ioﬁ 4) hepatocellular
carcinoma, usual type, forming a dominant 16 x 15 x 13 cm mass with
innumerable satellite nodules ranging in size from 0.5 cm to 6 cm.
The tumor is located in the right lobe. The hepatic capsule is
involved, but adjacent organs spared. The surgical margins are
involved grossly. Extratumoral vascular invasion is identified,
involving portal veins microscopically. The tumor is partially
encapsulated, infiltration of parenchyma being of infiltrating type.
A single separately submitted periportal lymph node is negative for
tumor. Information regarding the uninvolved hepatic parenchyma will
be reported in an addendum.

. Adrenal gland, right, excision: Metastatic grade 2 (of 4)
hepatocellular carcinoma ﬁorming multiple [2] separate masses [1.4 x
1.3 x 1.1 cm and 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm).

Gallbladder, cholecystectomy: Chronic cholecystitis with
cholesterolosis. Negative for tumor.

Peritoneal, No.1 and No.2, biopsies: Negative for tumor.

_Lymph nodes, cystic duct and pericholedochal, excision: A single
ystic duct lymph node and a single pericholedochal lymph node are
negative for tumor.

ADDENDUM:

The non-neoplastic liver is non—cirrhotic and shows changes that are
likely related to adjacent mass effect. No ground-glass hepatocytes
are seen.
