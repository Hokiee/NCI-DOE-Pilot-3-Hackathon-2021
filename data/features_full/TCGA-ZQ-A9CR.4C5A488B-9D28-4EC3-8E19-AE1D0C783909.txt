Subtotal gastrectomy. Obstructing antral gastric cancer.
Clinically T3.

Macro Report ﬂeck/1w BﬁE !

The specimen comprises a partial gastrectomy with attached section
of omentum. The stomach measures 140mm (greater curve) x 180mm
(lesser curve) x 110mm in width. The greater omentum measures 290
x 160mm and the lesser omentum measures 60 x 50mm. The proximal
duodenum measures 25mm. No obvious oesophageal tissue is present.
The specimen has been partially opened to allow for fixation. On
sectioning an infiltrating tumour mass is seen to arise from the
posterior antral wall. The tumour measures approximately 70mm in
maximum dimension and appears to be 15mm from the nearest (distal)
margin. The tumour obstructs the gastric antrum. The tumour is
90mm from the proximal margin. Macroscopically the tumour does
appear to extend into the surrounding fat posteriorly and appears
to have breached the muscularis. There are several obviously
macroscopically involved lymph nodes.

Blocks taken as: A&B — proximal margin, C&D — distal margin, E-I -
sections through tumour, J — cruciate block showing tumour and
relationship to distal margin, K—R — one lymph node per cassette,
S—W — two lymph nodes per cassette, X - three lymph nodes on one
cassette, Y — section of normal gastric mucosa. Tissue remains.

This is a widely infiltrating poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma
with evidence of widespread lymphovascular invasion. Within the
background mucosa there is evidence of chronic inflammation and
intestinal metaplasia indicating underlying chronic gastritis.
