COMMENT

The prostate gland contains a single focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor is located in the right and left transition zone.
This tumor focus measures 2.5 x 2.5 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in three cross sections and
extensively in the apical region. A minute focus of tumor with histologic features similar to the tumor present in the transition is
also present in the right posterolateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus is considered an intraprostatic metastasis. The tumor
exhibits extraprostatic extension in the anterior surface of the prostate and in the apical region. The tumor extends to the margin of
resection in multiple apical sections and in the anterior surface of the first prostatic cross sections. The added length of marginal
involvement is 15.0 mm.

Please refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and attached segments of right
and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (3.2 x 3.3 x 4.3 cm, 33 gm. post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the right
posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the left side. Serial cross sections after fixation
demonstrate firm areas consistent with tumor in the right transition zone. The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia
are grossly free of tumor.
