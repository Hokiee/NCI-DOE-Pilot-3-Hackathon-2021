Case Clinical Information
TCC 0F BLADDER INVADING PROSTATE

Gross Description

A. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"left pelvic lymph nodes" are multiple fibrofatty tissues
measuring 3.5 x 3.5 x 3 cm in compact aggregate. A dominant
area of induration is bisected in A1. A second area of
induration is bisected in A2. Four smaller areas of induration
submitted in A3.

E. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"right pelvic lymph nodes" are pieces of fibroadipose tissue
measuring 3 x 3 x 2 cm in compact aggregate. A dominant area of
induration submitted in 31-32. The remaining nodular lesions
are submitted in B3.

C. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
“left distal ureter-F5" is a yellow-tan tissue measuring 3 x 3 x
1 mm. The specimen is totally submitted in C1.

D. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"right distal ureter—F3" is a yellow-tan tissue measuring 4 x 1
x 0.5 mm. Totally submitted in D1.

E. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"neurovascular bundle—F3" is a yellow-tan tissue measuring 5 x 4
x 2 mm thick. Totally submitted in El.

F. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"bladder. prostate. seminal vesicles and distal ureters-NFS" is
a specimen so designated measuring 13 cm superior to inferior,
12 cm right to left and 3 cm anterior to posterior. The
included prostate measures 5 cm superior to inferior, 5 cm right
to left and 5.5 cm anterior to posterior. The bladder cavity is
contracted measuring 2.5 cm superior to inferior, 2.5 cm right
to left and 2.5 cm anterior to posterior. The bladder wall
appears indurated with a conspicuous palpable indurated midline
projection superiorly measuring 3 x 2 x 1.5 cm. The right and
left vas deferens project along the posterior bladder wall for 4
cm on the right and 2.5 cm on the left. The right and left
seminal vesicle area is effaced by pronounced induration
continuous with the bladder wall. The right and left ureter
stubs appear deeply retracted. Section code: F1: left vas
resection margin; F2: right vas resection margin; F3- shave
distal prostatic resection margin; F4—F6= mid posterior
prostate; F7-F9- posterior superior prostate; Flo—F13: left
seminal vesicle in continuity with prostate and posterior
surgical margin; Fla—F17: right seminal vesicle continuous with

prostate and inked posterior margin; F18-F19- sections of
previously described tumor projecting from superior aspect of
bladder; F20: left anterior prostate; P21-F23: left lateral
bladder wall extensively sampled inferior to superior; F24:
right anterior superior prostate; F25-F30= right lateral bladder
wall extensively sampled inferior to superior.
