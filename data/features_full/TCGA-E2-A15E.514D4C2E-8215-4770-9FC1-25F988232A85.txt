A. SENTINEL LN #1 LEFT AXILLA
B. LEFT BREAST MASS
C. LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS LEVELS 1.2

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. SENTINEL LN #1 LEFT AXlLLA
Received fresh is a tan pink ﬁrm grossly positive lymph node 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.5cm. Toto A1.
B. LEFT BREAST MASS
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "left breast needle localization" is an oriented 279, 5.5 x 5
x 3cm needle localized lumpectomy with radiograph. Ink code: anterior—yellow, posterior-black, superior-blue. inferior-
orange, medial-green. lateral-red. Specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 7 slices revealing a 2 x
1.5 x 1.5cm tan pink ill defined mass, closest to anterior margin at 0.4 cm in slices 2-6. A portion of the specimen is
submitted for tissue procurement. Representatively submitted:
81: medial margin slice 1
82: mass slice 2
83-85: slice 3
86-89: slice 4
810-312: slice 5
B13: mass slice 6
314-816: lateral margin slice 7
C. LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS LEVELS 1, 2
Received fresh are multiple tan pink soft tissue fragments aggregating to 5 x 4 x 2cm. Dissection reveals 12 lymph
nodes ranging from 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1cm to 1.3 x 1 x1cm.
C1: 4 lymph nodes
CZ: 4 lymph nodes
CS: 3 lymph nodes
C4: 1 lymph node
- C5-C11: axillary tissue

DIAGNOSIS:

- TUMOR MEASURES 1.1 CM
- TUMOR IS 0.3 CM FROM THE ANTERIOR MARGIN.
- DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), SOLID TYPE, NUCLEAR
GRADE 3, WITH NECROSIS, MINOR COMPONENT.
- LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU (LCIS), INVOLVING A RADIAL SCAR.
- RADIAL SCAR WITH USUAL DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA AND
MICROCALCIFICATIONS.

C. AXILLARY CONTENTS. LEFT, LEVELS 1 AND 2. DISSECTION‘.
- EIGHT LYMPH NODES, NO TUMOR SEEN (0/8).

ERIPR/HERZ Results
ER: Positive

HERZ: Positive by FISH

 

Pathological staging (pTN): pT 1c N 1

SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ERIPR RESULTS
Specimen: Surgical Excision
Block Number: A1 (lymph node with metastasis)

 

 

ER: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3
PR: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3
COMMENT:

The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the proportion score
(0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining. 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of cells staining. 4 = 31-60% of
cells staining,- 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate
intensity of staining. 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring range from 0 to 8.

ERIPR positive is deﬁned as an Allred score of >2 and ERIPR negative is deﬁned as an Allred score of less than
or equal to 2.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
lmmunohistochemistrv was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 105, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100)
provided by following the manufacturer 5 instructions. This assay was not modified.
Interpretation of the ERIPR immunohistocnemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,
information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.
