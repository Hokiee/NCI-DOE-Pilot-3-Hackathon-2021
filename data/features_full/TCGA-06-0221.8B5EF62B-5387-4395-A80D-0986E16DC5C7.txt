PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:
A. BRAIN, FRONTAL, EXCISIONAL BIOPSY: MALIGNANT GLIOMA.

ADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS:

B. BRAIN, FRONTAL LOBE, EXCISION: MALIGNANT GLIOMA. 5d“: 43 f ( (01M, C71,]

Operation/Specimen: UPDATED REPORT — Brain, frontal lobe. /v/
Clinical History and Pre-Op Dx: Recurrent brain tumor. “if?“K
S PATHOLOGY:

A. Received fresh, one fragment, 0.9 cm across in largest dimension.
Semi-firm, grayish-white. In total #1.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain: Glioma, high histological grade.

B.

SPECIMEN: Frontal lobe tumor.

FIXATIVE: Formalin.

GENERAL: A tan-gray irregular spongy soft tissue fragment 1.5 x
0.8 x 0.4 cm. External surface is tan—gray with
variegated brown hemorrhagic areas. Sectioning reveals
tan-gray smooth cut surface with no gross modularity.

SECTIONS: 1,2 - all submitted.

MICROSCOPIC: Portions of a neoplastic proliferation of glial cells.
The neoplastic nuclei have features of anaplasia, and are distributed
in a fibrillary background. Mitotic figures are present, and
microvessels Show cellular proliferation. There are no areas of
necrosis.

COMMENT: The specimen is a high histological grade glioma devoid of
necrosis (WHO grade IV/IV).

SPECIAL STAINS: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP and MIBel were

performed on sections from block #1. The GFAP demonstrates the glial
nature of the neoplasm. With the MIB—l a proliferation index of 21% is

d rmined.
