MICROSCOFIC:
The antire specimen has bu3n submitted {or histologicaL examination, and the

permanent sections confirm Lntra—Operativa assessment findings of a qiial serias

tumGur. The tumour is compaaed 0f sheet-like proliferatihn 0f small round,
uniform cells with centrai nuclei with a perinuclg at halo. In areas, the
cellular density is increased and the tumour cells assume an epithelioid
appearance with enlarged nucIei, apgn chromatin and conspicuous nucievli. The
tumuur diffusely infiltrates the cetebral yarenchyma and agqreqates beneath the
p13 mater. There is a delicate vasculatura within the tumour however we
micravagcuiar andozhelial praliferation is seen. Areas aqgregatag of
calcification as weié as microcyst formatian are obgarvei. Hin.i.g¢misawcytes are
tonspicuaus in areas and f0c.11y, the nuclei aSsume an anguiarwd prof_‘1e.
Mitotic achiv ity and apoptotic bodies are increased within areaa of increas
