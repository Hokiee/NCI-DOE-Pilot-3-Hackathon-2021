Gross Description

A. Received in formalin labeled with the patient’s name and
”left distal ureter margin FS" is a gray»tan frozen section
tissue fragment measuring 0‘7 x 0.5 cm. Wrapped and entirely
submitted in A1.

tissue fragment measuring 0.9 x 0.5 cm. Wrapped and submitted
in El.

C. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"bladder and prostate” is a bladder with attached prostate with
an overall dimension of 15 x 14 x 8 cm. The bladder measures 7
x 5 x 6.5 cm. The right seminal vesicle is 3 x 1.5 cm. The
right vas is 6 x 0.4 cm. The left seminal vesicle is 3 x 1.5 cm
and the left vas is 5 x 0.4 cm. The stump of the right ureter
is l x 0.5 cm. The stump of the left ureter is 1 x 0.5 cm. The
right side of the prostate has been previously inked in blue,
left side of the prostate has been previously inked in black.
The prostatic apical margin is shaved and the specimen has been
previously opened anteriorly prior to fixation. The bladder has
gray-tan mucosa and is remarkable for a gray~brown, friable,
necrotic mass involving the entire bladder and measuring 7 X 5.5
x 5 cm. Sectioning through theitumor appears to involve the
muscularis and no lymph nodes were grossly identified. The
specimen is represented as folldws: the distal urethral
margin=C1; right trigone=C2-C3;§anterior wall=C4; lateral
wall=C5; posterior wall=C6; domaec7; left trigone=C8—C10; left
lateral wall=Cll-C13; left posterior wall=Cl4~C19; right
prostate from apex to base=C20— 21; right seminal vesicle and
vas deferens =C22; left prostate from apex to base=C23—C24; left
seminal vesicle and vas dererenssczs.

 

D. Received in formalin labeled pith the patient's name and
"left pelvic lymph nodes" consist of yellow«tan, fibroadipose
tissues measuring 4.5 x 4 x 4 cml Five lymph nodes are grossly
identified. The largest measurés 2 x 1 cm and the smallest
measures 0.9 X 0.4 cm. The specimen is submitted as follows:
one lymph node bisected=Dl; one lymph node bisected=D2; one
lymph node bieected=D3; one lywmh node bisected=D4; one lymph
node bisected=DS. g
E. Received in formalin labeledimith the patient's name and
”right pelvic lymph node" is yellow—tan, fibroadipose tissue
measuring 4.5 x 4 x 2.5 cm. FOL; lymph nodes are grossly
identified. The largest measures 1.7 x 1 cm and the smallest
measures 1 x 1 cm. Submitted aséfollows: one lymph node
bisected=El; one lymph node bistéted=E2; one lymph node
bieected=E3; and one lymph node serially sectioned and entirely
submitted=B4—E5.; 5
