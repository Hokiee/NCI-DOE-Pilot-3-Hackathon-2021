SLIDE DISPOSITION:

DIAGNOSIS:

A. Soft tissue, ileal serosa, biopsy: Benign
fibroadipose tissue,

negative for tumor.

B. Soft tissue, anterior vaginal mucosa, biopsy: Benign
squamous
mucosa and submucosa, negative for tumor.

C. Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy

and bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy: FIGO grade 3 (of 3)

endometrial serous adenocarcinoma is identified forming a
mass (5.5 ' ' ' V

x 5.2 x 1.5 cm), circumferentially involving the

@ endometrial cavity .
and lower uterine segment. The tumor invades 2.0 cm into
the
myometrium (total wall thickness 2.1 cm). The tumor does
not

involve the endocervix. Lymphovascular space invasion is

identified. The margins are negative for tumor. The
bilateral

ovaries and fallopian tubes are not involved.

D. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(7 of 25)

left pelvic lymph nodes are positive for metastatic serous
adenocarcinoma.

E. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(1 of 14)

right pelvic lymph nodes are positive for metastatic
serous

adenocarcinoma.

F. Omentum, omentectomy: Negative for neoplasm.

G. Lymph nodes, left para—aortic above inferior
mesenteric artery,

lymphadenectomy: A single (1 of 2) left para—aortic lymph
node

above inferior mesenteric artery, is positive for
metastatic serous

adenocarcinoma.

 

H. Lymph nodes, left para-aortic below inferior
mesenteric artery,

lymphadenectomy: Multiple (4 of 13) left para—aortic
lymph nodes

below inferior mesenteric artery, is positive for
metastatic serous

adenocarcinoma.

I. Gonadal vessel, left, biopsy: Negative for neoplasm.

J. Lymph nodes, right para—aortic above inferior
mesenteric artery,

lymphadenectomy: Multiple (6) right para—aortic lymph
nodes above

inferior mesenteric artery, are negative for tumor.

K. Lymph nodes, right para—aortic below inferior
mesenteric artery,

lymphadenectomy: Multiple (2 of 2) right para—aortic
below inferior

mesenteric artery, are positive for metastatic serous
adenocarcinoma.

 

L. Gonadal vessel, right, biopsy: Negative for neoplasm.

With available surgical material [AJCC pleNZ] (7th
edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic

examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation
of the

specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent
sections are

reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive
changes

identified on permanent section review will be reflected
in a

revised report.
