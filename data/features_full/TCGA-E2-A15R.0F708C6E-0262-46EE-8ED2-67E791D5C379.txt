TPA, Lymph node, sentinel, right axilla. biopsy: Negative for carcinoma
TPB, Lymph node, sentinel, right axilla. biopsy: Negative for carcinoma
TPC, Lymph node, sentinel, right axilla. biopsy: Negative for carcinoma
TPD, Lymph node, sentinel. right axilla. biopsy: Negative for carcinoma
Diagnoses called at ‘ by Dr.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. SLN 1 RIGHT AXILLA

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "sentinel lymph node number one right axilla"
is a tan lymph node measuring 2.2 x 1 x 0.8 cm. Touch preparation is performed. Entirely submitted, A1.

8. SLN 2 RIGHT AXILLA

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "sentinel lymph node number two right axilla"
is a tan lymph node measuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.8 cm. Touch preparation is performed. Entirely submitted, B1.

C. SLN 3 RIGHT AXILLA

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "sentinel lymph node number three right axilla"
is a tan lymph node measuring 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. Touch preparation is performed. Entirely submitted. CI.

D. SLN 4 RIGHT AXILLA

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "sentinel lymph node number four right axilla"
is a tan lymph node measuring 1 x 0.6 x 0:4 cm. Touch preparation is performed. Entirely submitted, D1.

E. RIGHT BREAST

Received fresh labeled with the patient‘s identiﬁcation and designated "right breast" is an oriented, 27 g, 5.3 x 4.5 x 3
cm lumpectomy specimen. The short suture designates superior. long-lateral. lnk code: Anterior-yellow, posterior-
black, medial-green, lateral-red, superior-blue, inferior-orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from superior to
inferior into 5 slices to reveal a ﬁrm lobulated tan mass, 2.2 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm. located 0.1-cm from the nearest anterior
margin. The entire specimen is submitted:

E1-E3: Perpendicular sections superior margin

E4-E7: Slice 2, E5 demonstrating mass and nearest anterior margin

E8-E11: Slice 3, E9, E11 demonstrating mass and nearest anterior margin

E12-E15: Slice 4, submitted entirely

E16-E18: Perpendicular sections inferior margin

DIAGNOSIS:

A. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #1, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION:
- METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE OF ONE LYMPH NODE (1/1), MEASURING 0.3-CM WITH EXTRANODAL
EXTENSION, SEE NOTE.

8. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #2, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION:
- METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE OF ONE LYMPH NODE (1/1). MEASURING 0.1-CM WITH EXTRANODAL
EXTENSION, SEE NOTE.

C. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #3, RIGHT AXILLA. EXCISION:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1).

D. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #4, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION:
~ METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE OF ONE LYMPH NODE (1/1), MEASURING 0.6-CM WITH EXTRANODAL
EXTENSION. SEE NOTE.

E. BREAST; RIGHT. WIDE LOCAL EXCISION:

-INvASIVE ~ucTAL CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 2, MEASURING 1.9-CM

- INTERMEDIATENUCEEA‘R‘GRADE, DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SlTU, SOLID TYPE

- INVASIVE TUMOR PRESENT 0.15-CM FROM MEDIAL AND 0.1-CM FROM ANTERIOR SURGICAL RESECTION
MARGINS

- FOCAL LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IDENTIFIED

- BIOPSY SITE CHANGES WITH FIBROSIS.

— SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT AND SEE NOTE.

NOTE: The touch preparation of SLN #1 and 2 shows no tumor cells. Therefore the false negativity is due to
sampling error. The touch preparation of SLN #4 shows two clusters of atypical cells. Dr. concurs.

A few clusters branching out and focally separated from the main tumor mass are identiﬁed in a close proximity to
the medial margin (0.15-cm). The main tumor mass is 0.1-cm from the anterior surgical resection margin.
