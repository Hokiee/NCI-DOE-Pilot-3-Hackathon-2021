Pathology Report
DIAGNOSIS
(A) RIGHT KIDNEY:
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (7.0 CM MAXIMUM DIMENSION), CONVENTIONAL TYPE
(95% CLEAR CELLS,
5% EOSINOPHILIC CELLS), FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3, CONFINED TO
THE KIDNEY.
(SEE COMMENT)
Margins of resection free of tumor.

COMMENT

The renal cell carcinoma in the right kidney does not invade into the
perinephric adipose tissue, renal sinus adipose tissue, or the renal
vein.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
(A) RIGHT KIDNEY - A radical nephrectomy specimen, which includes the
perinephricfat (21.0 x 10.0 x 6.0 cm) and kidney (12.0 x 5.0 x 4.3 cm).

Located within the inferior and mid pole of the kidney is a
well-circumscribed nodular tumor (7.0 x 6.0 x 5.5 cm). The cut surface
of the tumor is tan-yellow, soft admixed with foci of hyaIinized tissue.
The tumor bulges into the perinephric fat without invading into it. The
tumor pushes close to the renal sinus fat and renal pelvis without
invading into either structure. The renal vein is also free of tumor.
The non-neoplastic renal parenchyma is unremarkable. The ureter (5.0 cm
in length and 0.3 cm in circumference) and the renal vein (less than 1.0
cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter) are unremarkable. No adrenal gland
is identiÔ¨Åed.

INK CODE: Blue - perinephric fat closest to the tumor.

SECTION CODE: A1, renal vein and ureteral margin; A2, tumor, close
to renal pelvis; A3-A4, tumor with renal sinus fat; A5, A6 tumor in
relation to the perinephric fat; A7-A9, tumor in relation to the normal
parenchyma; A10-A12, tumor; A13, normal kidney parenchyma.
A representative portion of the tumor is submitted for the vaccine
protocol. A representative portion of the tumor is also submitted for

possible EM studies. -
