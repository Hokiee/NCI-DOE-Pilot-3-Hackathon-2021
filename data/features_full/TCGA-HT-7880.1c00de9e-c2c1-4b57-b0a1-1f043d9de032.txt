Microscopic

Sections demonstrate a moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely
infiltrates the gray and white matter. The tumor cells have small, round nuclei
with smooth contours. Many have well formed perinuclear halos. There is little
atypia. A significant minority of the tumor cells have similar nuclei but lack
perinuclear halos. Finally, a small percentage of the nuclei are elongate with
fibrillary processes. No mitotic figures are seen. There is o microvascular
proliferation or necrosis.

Addendum

MlB-1 reactive cells are present throughout the tumor. A labeling index of 3.1%
is calculated, consistent with the low grade histologic features.

Diagnosis

Oligoastrocytoma, lowgrade/grade ll, oligodendroglioma predominant
