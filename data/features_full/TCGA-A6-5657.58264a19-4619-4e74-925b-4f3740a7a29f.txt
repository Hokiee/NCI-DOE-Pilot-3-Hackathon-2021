SPECIMEN
A. Apical lymph node
B. Extended right hemi—colectomy

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Colon cancer

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. Received in formalin labeled "apical lymph node" is an

0.6 cm. in greatest dimension soft tan lymph node. It is
bisected. AS—l.

B. Received fresh in a container labeled "extended right
hemi—colectomy" is a previously unopened portion of bowel,
consisting of 8 cm. of distal ileum with 25 cm. of contiguous

right
colon. The serosal surface is smooth to slightly scabrous tan—

pink,
with a moderate amount of attached omentum and mesenteric adipose
tissue. There is an appendix present, 6.4 cm. long, and averaging
0.8 cm. in diameter. The appendix has a tan serosa, tan wall and
mucosa, and is without focal lesion, and without gross evidence of
inflammation. The bowel measures 3.6 cm. and 5.2 cm. in
circumference at the proximal and distal resection margins
respectively. The bowel is opened. There is a 4.5 x 4.2 cm.
circumscribed rubbery tan—pink—red tumor 11 cm. from the distal
margin. On cut surface, it is maximally 1 cm. thick and extends
through the muscularis propria and into the surrounding adipose

tissue. It is approximately 1.5 cm. from the outer surface of the
specimen. Per the clinical request, tumor and normal mucosa are
submitted for tissue procurement. The remainder of the mucosa is

unremarkable and tan, with a normal pattern of folds, including in
the ileum and the remainder of the colon. The wall of the ileum
averages 0.4 cm. thick, and of the colon 0.5 cm. thick. The
adipose tissue is dissected, and multiple soft tan lymph nodes
measuring up to 0.9 cm. in greatest dimension are identified.
RS—15, according to the accompanying block summary, following
fixation.

BLOCK SUMMARY: Bl — proximal and distal resection margins; B2—B6 —
tumor, with B2 & B3 together forming a composite full thickness
section to outer surface of the specimen, with point of continuity
between blocks inked orange; B7 — ICV; B8 — random colon; B9 —
appendix; B10—B15 — lymph nodes, with multiple lymph nodes per
block, except block B15 which contains one bisected lymph node.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
The following template summarizes the findings in this case:

Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma, comprising the mass lesion in the
colon in part B.
Histologic grade: Moderately to focally poorly differentiated.

Primary tumor (pT): pT3. Carcinoma invades through the full
thickness of the bowel wall and into the surrounding soft tissue.
Proximal margin: Negative

Distal margin: Negative

Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative

Distance of tumor from closest margin: See gross description
Vascular invasion: Not definitively identified

Regional lymph nodes (pN): le. There is one lymph node with
metastatic carcinoma, with this lymph node identified in block B5,

section of the main tumor, with this lymph node in surrounding
adipose tissue, with much of this lymph node replaced by tumor.
All other lymph nodes are negative for tumor. Overall, in part B
there is metastatic carcinoma in one of forty—two (1/42) lymph
nodes. The separately submitted apical lymph node in part A is
negative for tumor.

Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: Not identified

Distant metastasis (pM): pMX

Other findings: The appendix is without specific diagnostic

abnormalities.

DIAGNOSIS
A. Lymph node, apical, excision
— Negative for malignancy.

B. Terminal ileum, appendix, and extended right colon, excision
— Moderately to focally poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma
of

the colon, invading through the full thickness of the
muscularis propria and into surrounding soft tissue (see
microscopic description).

— Metastatic adenocarcinoma in one of forty—two (1/42) lymph

nodes.

— Margins negative for malignancy.

— Appendix without specific diagnostic abnormalities.
