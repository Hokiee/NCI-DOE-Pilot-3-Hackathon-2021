reveals a minimal amount of adipose tissue with an ill—defined 6 x 2.5 x 1.?
cm firm tan—white mass. Representative sections are submitted in blocks

Dl-2.

E. "Right ovary tissue", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 5.1 x 3.4
x 2.5 cm ovary with adjacent 4.4 cm segment of fimbriated fallopian tube
demonstrating an average diameter of 0.8 cm. The ovary is remarkable for
multiple cyst up to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension with numerous papillary
excrescences lining the surface. The cut surface of the ovary is remarkable
for multiloculated cyst intermixed with‘firm tan-white solid areas of up to
1.5 cm in greatest dimension. The fallopian tube on cut surface exhibits a

groesly unremarkable lumen.

F. “Uterus, tube and left ovary with cervix", received fresh and placed in
formalin is a 8 x 5.5 x 4.2 cm uterus with attached 5 x 3.7 x 3.1 cm left
ovary and 4.6 cm segment of fimbriated fallopian tube. The external uterine
surface is pink-tan smooth and glistening with scattered soft tan—brown
papillary excrescences up to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension concentrated closely
on the anterior surface. The external cervix is groesly unremarkable with a
0.8 cm patent os. The left ovary and fallopian tube are grossly involved
multiple tan—brown papillary excrescences as well. The ovarian cut surface is
remarkable for several dilated cyst the largest being hemorrhagic in
appearance and 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. There are several firm tan-white
solid areas within the ovary as well. The fallopian tube is sectioned to
reveal a grossly unremarkable cut surface with an average diameter of 0L5
cm. The lumen is grossly patent. The uterus is bivalved to demonstrate a
soft tan—brown shaggy endometrium with no discrete masses. The endocervical
canal is unremarkable. Sectioning through the posterior myometrium reveals
several grossly unremarkable cut surface with no lesions identified.
d Sectioning through the anterior uterus demonstrates a 2.2 x 1 cm mass
. infiltrating through the serosal surface of the myometrium just below the
aforementioned serosal papillary excrescences. The mase invades 1 cm into the

anterior myometrium. The lower uterine segment and anterior and posterior
surgical cut surfaces are unremarkable.

G. "Pelvic tumor", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 2.2 x 1.7 x 0.8
cm firm tan—white fragment of tissue. The specimen is bisected and submitted

entirely in block G1.

H. "Cul de sac tumor”, received fresh and placed in formalin is an 8.5 x 5.5 x
2.3 cm aggregate of tan~brown fibroadipose tissue. Sectioning through the
specimen reveals multiple firm tanvwhite nodules up to 2.9 cm in greatest
dimension. Representative sections are submitted in blocks Hl—3.

I. “Diaphragm", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 14.8 x 10.5 X 3.6
cm aggregate of firm tan~brown soft tissue notable for multiple papillary
excrescences covering the exterior surface. Sectioning through the specimen
demonstrates a diffusely firm tan—white cut surface. Representative sections
are submitted in blocks I1—4.

J. "Upper peritoneal mass", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 6.3 x 6
x 1.4 cm aggregate of tan-brown soft tissue. Sectioning through the specimen
demonstrates a diffusely firm tan—white cut surface. Representative sections
are submitted in blocks J1-3.

K. "Liver mass", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 3.2 x 2.4 x 1.4 cm
fragment of tanwbrown soft tissue. Sectioning through the specimen reveals a
difquely firm tan-white cut surface intermixed with areas of unremarkable
tan-yellow adipose tissue. Representative sections are submitted in blocks

K1~3.

L. "Appendix", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 5.2 cm segment of
appendix with an average diameter of 0.5 cm. The exterior surface is
remarkable for multiple papillary excresoences up to 0.7 cm in greatest
dimension. There is 4 x 2 x 0.5 cm attached mesoappendix. The cut surface is
remarkable for fibrous obliteration of the lumen. The tip is removed,
bisected and placed in block L1 with the proximal margin representative
sections are submitted in block L1.

M. "Rectosigmoid", received fresh and placed in formalin is an 8.2 cm segment
of colon demonstrating an average diameter of 3.1 cm. The external surface is
remarkable for a 3.6 x 6.8 x 1.1 cm firm tan-white mass involving the external
serosa and infiltrating into the bowel wall creating a 3.2 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm
cavity. In addition there are multiple papillary excrescences involving the
serosa and adjacent adipose tissue. Opening the specimen demonstrates a
grossly unremarkable tan—brown mucosal surface with no identifiable lesions.
Sectioning through the specimen shows the aforementioned firm mass does
penetrate to involve the underlying bowel wall , but does not penetrate
through to the mucosa.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Ml—é- representative of mass with respect to underlying bowel wall and mucosa
h5— representative uninvolved colon
M6—7— mucosal margins
