SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Patient:

.uu.

Clinical Diagnosis & History:
Liposarcoma.

Specimens Submitted:

1: Right retroperitoneal sarcoma including right colon, right kidney, right
tube and ovary

2: Additional tumor on duodenum and pancreas

3: Small bowel mesentaric

DIAGNOSIS:
1. Retroperitoneum, right, retroperitoneal mass including right colon, right
kidney, right tube and ovary; resection:

- Dedifferentiated liposarcoma, arising in a background of well
differentiated liposarcoma.

- The tumor is 38.3 cm in largest dimension.

- The dedifferentiated component constitutes 40% of the tumor and shows
high-grade spindle and pleomorphio sarcoma like morphology.

— Necrosis is present (25 to 30%) in the dedifferentiated area.

- Well differentiated liposarcoma, lipoma-like and sclerosing type.

- Tumor involves the renal capsule and extends to the serosa of the
colon.

- Benign portion of fallopian tube. No definite ovary is identified.

— Margins (renal vascular, ureter and colon) are free of tumor.

2. Additional tumor on duodenum and pancreas; resection:
— Well differentiated liposarcoma, lipoma-like and sclerosing type.
- The tumor is 8.5 cm in largest dimension.
- The tumor extends to the inked resection margins.
- One benign lymph node.

3. Small bowel mesentery; excision:
- Well differentiated liposarcoma, lipoma-like.
- The tumor is 4.5 cm in largest dimension.

Note: The prior biopsy was reviewed.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED

Gross Description:

1) The specimen is received in fresh. labeled "Right retroperitoneal
sarcoma, including right colon, right kidney, right tube and ovary“ and
consists of a 6078.0 9, 38.3 x 26.2 x 19.0 on soft tissue mass with attached
right colon, right kidney, right tube and possible right ovary. The
terminal ileum measures 15.2 cm in length and 2.1 cm in circumference at the
proximal resection margin. The remaining colon measures 33.6 in length with
a circumference of 6.3 cm at the distal resection margin. An appendix is not
grossly identified. The right kidney measures 8.6 x 6.1 x 4.3 cm. The right
fallopian tube is smooth tan-purple, has an occasional perstubal cyst and
measures 6.4 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. Posterior to the right
fallopian tube is a 0.8 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm, poorly defined, slightly firm,
tan-yellow oblong nodule, possible atrophic ovary. No other ovary is
identified grossly. Sectioning of the specimen reveals a 12.1 x 8.8 x 8.5
cm, multilobular, solid, firm to hard, focally calcified and necrotic
(roughly 10% necrosis), gritty and whorled, tan-white mass that focally
infiltrates into the surrounding adipose tissue and is located inferolateral
to the kidney, (designated Mass #1). Also, directly medial to the kidney is
an additional mass similar appearing to Mass #1 measuring 12.7 x 10.1 x 9.3
cm. Both Mass #1 and #2 grossly appears to partially abut the kidney and
focally adhere to capsule. but does not grossly appear to invade into the
kidney parenchyma. The remaining specimen consists of a 34.0 x 25.1 x 13.9
cm, ill—defined, multilobular, rubbery to focally firm, tan-yellow to pale
white fatty mass interspersed by thin bands of fibrous tissue, which
partially surrounds but does not grossly involve the fallopian tube,
randomly runs along and focally adheres to the serosa of the bowel, encases
the remaining kidney, is 0.5 cm from the renal vein margin and 6.3 cm from
the ureteral margin. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal
pink brown parenchyma, with a poorly-defined cortico—medullary junction.

The cortex measures 0.5 cm and the calyces appear constricted. The bowel
margins are grossly uninvolved by tumor. No adrenal gland is identified.
Representative sections are submitted. Portions of tumor are submitted to
TPS. Photographs are taken.

Summary of sections:

UVM -- ureter and vascular margins, kidney
PM -- proximal margin, bowel

DH -- distal margin, bowel midline

C —- normal colon

F -— Fallopian tube, representative

0 —- possible ovary

K —~ normal kidney

RVM -- renal vein with possible surrounding soft tissue mass
MlK Mass #1 with kidney

M1 Mass #1, representative

2) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Additional tumor on duodenum and
pancreas", and consists of an 8.5 x 6.4 x 3.1 cm irregular portion of
yellow-tan lobulated shaggy tan tissue. There is a previous incision
revealing underlying yellow-tan homogenous fatty cut surfaces. Remaining
external surface is partially inked green, from which TPS is submitted. The
remaining external surface is inked blue. Further sectioning reveals
yellow—tan homogenous fatty cut surfaces. A pink-tan rubbery lymph node
measuring 2.3 cm in greatest dimension is identified. Representative
sections are submitted.

Summary of sections:
RS - representative sections
LN - lymph node, sectioned

3) The specimen is received in formalin labeled “Small bowel mesentery" and
consists of a 4.5 x 3.5 x 1.4 cm well-circumscribed tan-yellow to purple
membranous adipose tissue. Sectioning displays a tan homogeneous cut
surface. No discrete lesion or mass are grossly identified. Representative
sections are submitted.
