Clinical History/Diagnosis: Right Liver Lobe "Hepatoma". 94") 5/

Source of Specimen(s):

1: Right colonic mesenteric lymph node

2: right lobe liver sigment

3: gallbladder, segment 5 and 6 of liver, right colon

Gross Description:
Received in three parts.
Source of Tissue: 1. Labeled #1, "right colonic mesenteric lymph node"

Gross Description: Received ﬁesh labeled "right colonic mesenteric lymph node". It
consists of a ﬁrm yellow-tan lymph node measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The lymph node
is bisected and entirely submitted in IA.

Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled #2, "right lobe liver segment"

Frozen Section Diagnosis: 2FS- CONSISTENT WITH HEPATOCELLULAR
CARCINOMA
PER

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled "right lobe liver segment". It consists of a ﬁrm
white-tan well-circumscribed nodule measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The nodule is
bisected and entirely submitted in 2F S.
********************$***************************************************
Source of Tissue: 3. Labeled #3, " gallbladder, segments 5 and 6 of liver,

right colon"

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled " gallbladder, segments 5 and 6 of liver, right
colon". It consists of a large liver mass with attached gallbladder and attached segment of
large bowel. The liver mass measures 21 x 17 x 13.5 cm in greatest dimension.

The mass is serially sectioned to reveal a golden-yellow, soﬁ diffusely

necrotic cut surface. Also the mass comes within 2 cm of the closest

cauterized liver margin. A suture is identiﬁed at the liver margin. The

margin is inked green. The attached short segment of terminal ileum

measures 7 cm in length and 3 cm in circumference. The terminal ileum is

akuh

 

 

opened to show a difﬁlsely hemorrhagic smooth mucosal lining with no
discrete masses present. The appendix measures 8.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The
appendix is sectioned to reveal a homogeneous, soft tan-pink cut surface
with no discrete masses present. The attached segment of large bowel is
completely adhesed to the previously described liver mass and measures 39
cm in length and 5 cm in circumference. The tumor does not appear to
inﬁltrate the large bowel wall. The large bowel mucosa is red-brown and
diffusely hemorrhagic with no discrete lesions identiﬁed. The gallbladder
measures 8 x 4 x 4 cm. The gallbladder is also grossly adhesed to tumor.
The cystic duct is patent measuring 0.5 cm in diameter. The gallbladder is
opened to reveal approximately 20 cc of dark-green viscid bile. The mucosa
is velvety, bile stained with no mucosal ulcerations or polyps identiﬁed.
Representative sections submitted in 3A-3K.

Designation of Sections: 3A— tumor with closest liver margin inked green,
3B- additional perpendicular sections of the liver margin, 3C-3D- tumor
with closest capsule, 3E- tumor with adjacent normal liver, 3F- proximal
and distal right colon margin, 3G—3H- tumor in relation to right colon,

31- cystic duct, 3J- tumor in relation to gallbladder, 3K- appendix

Final Diagnosis:

1 . Right colonic mesenteric lymph node, excision:

No tumor seen in one lymph node (0/ 1).

2. Liver, right lobe segment, excision:

Hepatocellular carcinoma.

3 . Gallbladder, segments 5 and 6 of liver, right colon, excision:
Hepatocellular carcinoma, grade II/IV.

- The 21 cm carcinoma invades serosa of ascending colon.

- Angiolymphatic invasion is identiﬁed.

- Surgical resection margins are free of carcinoma.

Gallbladder with chronic cholecystitis.

Cecum and terminal ileum with no diagnostic abnormalities reco gnized.
Appendix with partial ﬁbrosis obliteration of the lumen.
