Microscopic

Sections demonstrate a mildly hypercellular infiltrating glioma. The tumor consists of a
proliferation of cells with round nuclei and variably prominent perinuclear halos. Where
the tumor cells exhibit mild cytologic atypia an occasional neuron demonstrates
perineuronal satellitosis by tumor cells. Mitotic figures are not seen. There is no
intratumoral necrosis or hemorrhage.

Only very rare MIB-l reactive cells are present. A labeling index of <0.1% is calculated.

Diagnosis

Oligodendroglioma grade II
