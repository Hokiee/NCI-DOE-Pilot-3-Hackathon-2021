Gross Description

Nine specimens are received; each is labeled with the patient’s name and medical record number.

Specimen A is received for intraoperative consultation, and is labeled as "4R lymph node." it consists of multiple portions of
grey-black soft tissue fragments measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm in aggregate. The specimen is submitted entirely for frozen
section diagnosis, then transferred to cassette "A1 F S." Dictated by

Specimen C is received for intraoperative consultation and is labeled "4L" it consists of multiple grey-black soft tissue

fragments measuring in aggregate. 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis in
cassette "C1FS." Dictated by

Specimen D is received fresh in a container labeled with the patient’s name, medical record number and "left lung FS. check
bronchial margin." The specimen consists of the left lung measuring 29.0 x 17.0 x 5.0 cm and weighing 350 grams. The
pleural surface is smooth, red—pink with no other abnormalities. The hilar lymph nodes are slightly enlarged, the largest
measuring 2.2 cm in greatest dimension. The bronchial margin shaved off and is submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis
in cassette "D1 F S.

in the left main bronchus, there is a 2.7 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm mass abutting the pulmonary vasculature. Focal areas of mucous are
also noted within airways in the left upper lobe and adjacent to the tumor. The cut surface of the tumor is grey-yellow and
smooth with focal areas of hemorrhage. The tumor is 1.1 cm from the bronchial edge and 0.6 cm from the vascular margin and
within 0.1 cm of the visceral pleura. No other lesions or masses are noted. Cassettes are submitted as follows: Dictated by

Specimen E is received labeled "#9 lymph node" and consists of four tissues from 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm up to 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm.
Sectioning reveals four purple and black lymph nodes from 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm up to 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm. The node are submitted
entirely in cassettes “E1" through "E4" as follows: Dictated by

'Specimen F is received labeled “#7 lymph node" and consists of a black and red possible lymph node from 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm
up to 2.2 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm. The specimen is submitted entirely in cassettes "F1" through "F5" as follows: Dictated by

Specimen G is received labeled "10L lymph node" and consists of five black possible lymph nodes from 0.4 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm up to
1.4 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm. These possible nodes are submitted in cassettes "Gt" through "GS" as follows: Dictated by

Specimen H is received labeled "#6 lymph node" and consists of three possible lymph nodes from 1.1 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm up to 3.0
x 3.0 x 1.3 cm. The cut surface of each possible node is marked anthracotic pigment. The specimen is submitted entirely in
cassettes "H1" through ”H5" as follows: Dictated by

Specimen | is received labeled "#5 lymph node" and consists of a purple and black lymph node. 1.3 cm in greatest dimension.
The specimen is bisected and submitted in cassette "l1." two pieces. Dictated by
