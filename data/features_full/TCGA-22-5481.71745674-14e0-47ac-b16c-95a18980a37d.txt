Surgical Pathology

DIAGNOSIS :

Lung, left, pneumonectomy: Grade 4 (of 4) squamous cell carcinoma forming a 3.6 x 3.6 x 3.6
cm mass in the left lower lobe. The tumor is located 7.0 cm from the bronchial margin. The
bronchial margin and visceral pleura are not involved. The uninvolved lung parenchyma is
unremarkable histologically. Two (2) of 8 intrapulmonary peribronchial lymph nodes are
positive for tumor, the largest of which forms a 1.7 x 1.7 x 1.7 cm adenopathy located in the
fissure.

Lymph nodes, superior and inferior mediastinal, aortic and N1, excision: Multiple superior
mediastinal {6 right upper paratracheal, 3 right and 5 left lower paratracheal and 4 left
tracheo—bronchial}, inferior mediastinal (2 left paraesophageal, 1 left inferior pulmonary
ligament and 14 subcarinal), aortic (2 anterior mediastinal) and N1 (2 left interlobar} lymph
nodes are negative for tumor. Necrotizing and calcified granulomas are identified in the
subcarinal region. Special stains to be reported in an addendum.
