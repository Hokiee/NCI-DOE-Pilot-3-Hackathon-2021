The eye ball mesures 28 by 20 mm and presents a posterior segment of optic nerves
measuring 7 mm. At the section, the tumor measures 17 mm main line. Samples

have been frozen for genetic studies then the piece has been ﬁxed and included
entirely.

Microcopy

The tumor observed macroscopically corresponds to an uveal melanoma, mainly
composed of epithelio‘ld cells. The cell cytoplasm is often pigmented with melanin.
The nuclear atypia are severe. The mitotic index is low (4 mitoses for 10 HPF).

The tumor is developed close to the ciliary body and inﬁltrates the internal part of the
sclera, leaving the half external part free. It is located at a large distance of the optic
foramen and the optic nerve on its entire course and cut end is free of tumor.

The meningeal sheets and the extra-scleral tissues are free of tumor.
