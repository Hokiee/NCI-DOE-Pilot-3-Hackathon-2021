Gross Descrigtion

The specimen is received fresh for intraoperative consultation, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and
designated "R10/sump lymph node." It consists of a single lymph node measuring 1.8 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm. The lymph node is
submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis in cassette "AtFS." A touch prep is performed. Dictated by

Specimen B is received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and medical record number and as "F83 right upper
lobe." The specimen consists of a lobe of lung measuring 13.8 x 9.5 x 4.5 cm and weighing 160 grams. Multiple stapled
margins are present on the specimen and a stitch is present for orientation. Multifocally abutting the pleura is a multilobulated
ﬂrm partly mucoid mass measuring 6.0 x 5.1 x 4.1 cm. This mass extends to the stapled parenchymal margin of resection and
extends to within 1.0 cm of the bronchial and vascular margins of resection. The lung adjacent to and distal to this mass
appears slightly mottled. No other lesions are identified within the lung. Tissue is submitted for Tumor Bank. The pleural
overlying the mass is inked black and the parenchymal margin of resection is inked blue after removal of the staple line. The
bronchial margin is shaved and submitted for frozen section diagnosis in cassette "B1FS." Representative sections of the
remainder of the specimen are submitted as stated below. Dictated by

Specimen C is received in formalin. labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and as "right 10 sump lymph node."
The specimen consists of multiple fragments of dark colored soft tissue measuring in aooreoate, 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The
specimen is submitted entirely in lens paper in cassette "C‘l." Dictated by

Specimen D is received in formalin. labeled with the patient’s name, medical record number and as "level 4 lymph node (per

specimen is from the right side)." The specimen consists of multiple fragments of ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring in
aggregate, 4.2 x 2.9 x 0.5 cm. Multiple lymph nodes are identiﬁed in the specimen ranging in size from 0.3 to 1.7 cm. The
specimen is submitted as stated below. Dictated by -.. ,

Specimen E is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and as "4R lymph node." The

specimen consists of a single lymph node measuring 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is bisected and submitted entirely in
cassette "E1 Dictated by Dr.

Specimen F is received in formalin, labeled with the patient‘s name, medical record number and as "R7 lymph node." The

specimen consists of a single fragment of soft tissue measuring 0.9 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is submitted entirely in
cassette "F1." Dictated by Dr.

Specimen G is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name. medical record number and as "right lower lobe wedge.
(per this specimen is from the right side)" The specimen consists of a wedge of lung measuring 5.8 x 2.6 x 1.8 cm.
There are two intersecting staple lines on the specimen. one measuring 5.5 cm, the other measuring 2.8 cm. There is a 0.7 cm
crescent shaped defect in the serosa, and the serosa is otherwise unremarkable. No lesions are identified in the lung
parenchyma. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes "Gl" through "G3." Dictated by Dr. '
