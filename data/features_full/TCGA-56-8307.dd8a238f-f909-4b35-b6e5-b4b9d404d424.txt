b. Margins: Negative for neoplasm
cu Angiolymphatic invasion: Absent
d. Extent of invasion: lnvades through visceral pleura to involve
diaphragm

COMMENT

E) Although the previous biopsy showed moderately differentiated squamous
carcinoma, the vast majority of the resection demonstrates poorly
differentiated morphology.

SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPTiON

A) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, 4R

Received fresh Iabeied "4R lymph node" consists of five tan-pink 0.4 to 0.6
cm lymph node fragments entirely submitted on one chuck for frozen section

diagnosis.

 

 
   

INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: "Benign lymph

node fragments” is rendered by-.

B) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, level 7 subcarinal

Received fresh labeled "left 7 subcarinal lymph node“ is a single 0.6 cm
tan—pink lymph node entirely submitted on one chuck for frozen section
diagnosis.

INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOG NSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: “One benign
lymph node" is rendered by

C) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, level 7

Received fresh labeled “ievel 7 lymph nodes” are 1, 4 cm lymph nodes. The
smaller node is inked yeliow and bisected and submitted along with
representative of the largest node on chuck 1. The remainder of the larger
node is submitted on chucks 2 and 3.

INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: ”Two benign
lymph nodes“ is rendered by

D) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, right level 11

The specimen is received labeled "level 11 lymph node R.” It consists of a
1.5 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm maroon»tan apparent lymph node. It is bisected revealing
gray-black anthracotic pigmentation on cut section. All tissue is entirely
submitted in a single cassette.

E) SOURCE: Right lower lobe

Labeled "RT lower lobe” is a 927 gm, 18 x 14.5 x 10 cm stated left lower
lobe. The pleura is maroon-pink. There is a 6.5 X 5 cm circular roughened
area. Per direct conversation with the surgeon, this area represents tissue
abutting diaphragm. This surface is inked yellow. The bronchial resection
margin measures 3 x 1.3 cm and contains multiple silver surgical clips in a
staple line. The staple line is removed, and the subadiacent tissue is

inked blue. Located 2.5 cm from the bronchial resection margin is a 5 cm in
length x 0.3 cm in width staple line composed of multiple silver surgical
clips. The staple line is removed. and the subjacent tissue is inked black.

The specimen is serially sectioned revealing a 13 x 11.5 x 8.5 cm
white-tan, focally softened and friable mass. The mass abuts the
yellow-inked roughened area on the pleura indication tissue abutting
diaphragm. It is located 2 cm from the bronchial resection margin and 3.5
cm from the black-inked staple line. The mass has circumscribed edges. It
appears to involve adjacent bronchi.

The remaining lung parenchyma is red—maroon, soft and spongy. No additional
discrete lesions or masSes are identified. There are multiple grayblack
peribronchiai lymph nodes with anthracotic pigmentation. The hilar vessels
appear patent.

Representative section including entire bronchial resection margin is
submitted for frozen section diagnosis on one block.

F) SOURCE: Level 11 lymph node, right (additional)

Labeled "level 11 lymph node R additional" are two maroon-tan soft to
rubbery apparent lymph nodes measuring 1.5 x 1.3 x1 cm and 2.5 X 1.5 x 0.5
cm. Ali tissue is entirely submitted in tour cassettes as follows:

1.2. One lymph node, quadrisected

3,4. Larger lymph node, bisected

G) SOURCE: Additional 4R lymph node, right

Labeled "additional 4R lymph node, right" are six apparent lymph nodes
ranging from 1-2 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes have focal
gray~tan anthracotic pigmentation. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted
as follows:

1. Four lymph nodes in toto

2. One lymph node. bisected

3. One lymph node, quadrisected
