CLINICAL HISTORY
The atient is a

           

    

On imaging, there is a right

frontal hemorrhagic lesion.

OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
Right frontal mass
Operation/Specimen: A: Brain, right frontal mass, biopsy
8: Brain, excision biopsy
PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:

 

frontal tumor, biopsy:
4? (see comment).

 
 

COMMENT
The frozen section diagnosis is confirmed on permanent sections.

The biopsy shows brain tissue infiltrated by a neoplasm composed of
mildly

pleomorphic glial cells. The cells are tightly packed and demonstrate
perinuclear clearing in some areas. Focal microvascular proliferation
is also

seen in some areas along with frequent calcospherites. Areas of
necrosis are

also noted. Mitoses range from 3 to 4 per ten 400x fields.

The tumor cells are diffusely highlighted by GFAP, while p53 stain
shows

diffuse weak to moderate positivity of the tumor nuclei. CD163 stains
rare

phagocytic cells. The Ki—67 labeling index is approximately 25%.
Positive and negative controls show appropriate immunoreactivity.

Molecular studies showed LOH for lp/19q (see procedure addenda below).

 

 

 

 

PROCEDURES/ADDENDA

PCR for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor

Date Ordered: _ Date Reported: Pending
MGMT Promoter Methylation

Date Ordered: _ Date Reported: _

Interpretation
POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected.

Results—Comments
Testing performed on paraffin tissue block

a stained slide was examined for subsequent tumor

dissection.

Sufficient tumor cells were present in the tissue block and no
microdissection

was needed.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT
promoter

have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents.
Assessment of

MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA
followed

by real—time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and
unmethylated DNA

sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by
serial

dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and

was
assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated

DNA.

Factors such as the presence of >50% non—neoplastic cells in the
sample, or

extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated
MGMT

promoter sequences.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results
from a

stand alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its
performance
characteristics determined by the — laboratory as
required by - - regulations. It has not been cleared or approved
or

f
specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA

has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These

results are

only in

the context of established precedures and/or diagnostic criteria.

 
   

n e
POSITIVE: Allelic loss on ChrOmosome arm 1p and chromosome arm lgq is

detected.

 

Informative loci are: D181592, DlSSSZ, D198219, D198412, and PLAZGQC
Results—Comments 7
Test performed on DNA extracted from tumor tissue paraffin block and
peripheral blood for germline comparison.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA

(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3
markers

on 1p are D18548, D131592, and 013552 (with D18468, D181612, and
DlS496 as

backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19g are D198219, D1954l2, and
PLA2G4C

(with 0198606 and D1981182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites
(2 or 4

nt'repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat)
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity scoreIr
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used
if the

first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or
otherwise

ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendroglicmas
with 1p

and 19q deletion.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results
from a

standralone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its
performance

characteristics determined by the — laboratory as
required by _ regulations. It has not been cleared or approved
for

specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA
has

determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are

provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted
only in

the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.
TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non—neoplastic cells in
the sample
may preclude the detection of allelic loss.
