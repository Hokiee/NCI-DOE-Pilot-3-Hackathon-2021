GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. RIGHT COLON, TERMINAL ILEUM
Received fresh and subsequently fixed with matching patient name and requisition number is a 30cm
right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of a 5cm in length, 2cm in circumference terminal ileum
segment and 25cm in length, 6cm average circumference right colon with moderate amount of
pericolonic fat and surgically absent appendix. There is a 7x5x1.2cm light tan fungating tumor mass
located in the proximal cecum, 2.5cm from the ileocecal valve, 7cm from the proximal and 17cm from
the distal margin. Cut section of the tumor shows it is penetrating the muscularis propria and focally
extending into the subserosal fat. Tumor tissue has been procured. There are multiple flat sessile
polypoid lesions scattered in the right colon, ranging from 0.2cm in greatest dimension to
1.0x0.7x0.5cm. The most distal one is more than 1cm away from the distal surgical margin. The
uninvolved colonic mucosa as well as the terminal ileum have kept its normal rugosity and are grossly
unremarkable. The mesenteric fat is thoroughly dissected and all lymph nodes are submitted for
microscopic examination. Representative sections are taken as follows:

A1 -A7: representatives of the tumor

A8: three polypoid lesions

A9: one polypoid lesion, bisected

A10-A11: one polypoid lesion, serially sectioned

A12: four polypoid lesions

A13: the most distal polyp

A14: representatives of the uninvolved colonic mucosa

A15: distal surgical margin

A16: proximal surgical margin and uninvolved terminal ileum

A17: 6 presumptive lymph nodes

A18: 2 bisected lymph nodes, one inked black

A19: 2 lymph nodes, larger one bisected

A20: 2 bisected lymph nodes, one is black

A21 : 2 bisected lymph nodes, larger is grossly positive
A22: 1 lymph node, serially sectioned

A23: 3 presumptive lymph nodes

A24: 1 bisected lymph node

A25: 1 bisected lymph node

A26: 2 bisected lymph nodes, 1 inked black

A27: 2 lymph nodes
