SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Some of the immunohistochemistry and ISH tests were developed and their performance characteristh were determined by the

9 Department of Pathology. They have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be
regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certiﬁed under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of
1988 (CLlA '88) as qualiﬁed to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

 

1. The specimen is received fresh labeled, " Bladder, uterus, cervix, urachus, urethra, bilateral tubes and ovaries, anterior vaginal
wall, perivesical fat". It consists of a cystohysterectomy with bilateral salpingo—ocphorectomy specimen measuring 16 cm from
superior to inferior, 12 cm laterally and 5.5 cm from anterior to posterior. The uterus measures 7.0 cm superior to inferior, 5.0 cm
from cornu to cornu, and 3.0 from anterior to posterior. There is a subserosal 3.0 cm anterior nodule which is partially calciﬁed.
There are two intramural nodules measuring 0.8 and 1.7 cm in greatest dimension. The cut surfaces are white and whorled. The
right ovary measures 2.5 x 1.8 x 1.8 cm and is partially cystic. The right fallopian tube measures 6 cm in length with an altered
ﬁmbriated end. There are approximately four paratubal cysts measuring 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. The left ovary measures 2.5
x 1.2 x 1.0 cm. The left fallopian tube measures 5.5 cm in length vrn'th a normal ﬁmbriated end. There are several, approximately 7
paratubal cysts ranging in size from 0.1 to 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. The cervix measures 3.2 cm in length and the ectocervix
measures 2.5 cm in diameter. The right aspect of the bladder is inked green and the left aspect of bladder is inked blue. The uterus
is inked black posteriorly. The urethral margin is shaved and submitted. The bladder is opened along the anterior midline to reveal
an oval shaped ulcerated, fungating lesion measuring 3.5 x 2.5 cm on the posterior wall and trigone. The lesion appears to be
involving the both ureteral oriﬁces. Both ureters are probe patent measuring up to 0.2 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion is
sectioned and revealed that the lesion is superﬁcial without penetrating through the deep muscularis layer and the underlying fat
grossly. Extension to the inked fat is grossly not identiﬁed. The remaining bladder mucosa is pink and edematous. Discrete
perivesical lymph nodes are grossly not identiﬁed. The entire lesion is submitted and representative sections from the rest of the
bladder are submitted. The ovaries and fallopian tubes are submitted entirely. TPS is submitted. Photographs are taken.

Summary of sections:
RUM - right ureter margin
LUM - left ureter margin
UTHM - urethral margin
L - lesion
L4-7—lesion to anterior cervix
L8-9-lesion to posterior bladder serosa and anterior uterus
RUO - right ureter oriﬁce
LUO - left ureter oriﬁce
LA - left anterior wall
LP - left posterior wall
RP - right posterior wall
RA - right anterior wall
DOM - dome
F - perivesical fat
AC- anterior cervix
PC — posterior cervix
AEM — anterior endometrium
PEM — posterior endometrium
R0 - right ovary
RT - right tube
LO - left ovary
LT -— left tube
ADD — additional sections of ovary, submitted entirely
ADD27-28— right ovary
AD029-30- left ovary
T - additional sections of tube. unknown laterality

2). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes, fresh and sterile" and consists of multiple pink tan ﬁrm lymph
nodes ranging from 1.2 to 5.7 cm in greatest dimension. All identiﬁed lymph nodes are submitted in twelve cassettes.

Summary of sections:

LN - lymph nodes

BLN - bisected lymph nodes

RSLN - representative sections lymph node

3). The Specimen is received fresh, labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes, fresh and sterile" and consists of multiple pink tan ﬁrm lymph
nodes. All identiﬁed lymph nodes are submitted in sixteen cassettes.

4.) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left periureteral tissue" and consists of a 1.3 x 1.1 x 0.3 cm, soft, irregular, pink-
white ﬁber membranous tissue fragment with attached underlying adipose. The surface is partially covered by a 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.1 cm,
slightly raised, irregular, tan-purple nodular lesion. The specimen is sectioned and entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
LPT - left perirectal tissue

5.) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Distal margin of urethra" and consists of a 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm irregular, rubbery,
tan-white tissue fragment. which is inked in black, sectioned and entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
DMU - is the margin of urethra

6.) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Posterior vaginal wall" and consists of a 1.3 x 0.7 x 0 .1 cm, irregular, ﬁrm. tan-
white tissue fragment, which is submitted in toto.

Summary of sections:
PVW —- posterior vaginal wall

7.) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left ureter" and consists of an unoriented, 1.1 cm length and 0.3 cm in diameter
segment of ureter circumferentially surrounded by 0.5 cm thick pink-white membranous tissue. The margins are inked in black and
blue. The ureter is sectioned and entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
LU — left ureter, sequential sections

8.) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Right ureter" and consists of an unoriented, 1.2 cm length and 0.6 cm in
diameter edematous and slightly dilated portion of ureter circumferentially surrounded by 0.3 cm thick pink-white membranous
tissue. The margins are inked in black and blue. The ureter is sectioned and entirely submitted. Also received in the same
container is a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm, soft, irregular, tan-white tissue fragment, which is submitted in toto.

Summary of sections:

RU — right ureter, sequential sections
ATF - additional tissue fragment
