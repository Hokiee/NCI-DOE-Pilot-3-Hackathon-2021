SPEClMEN DATA
GROSS DESCRil’Tlm-l‘
Received labeled ,#1, uterus. bilateral tubes and ovaries Is a 150 gram previously opened hysterectomy specimen consisting of a 6 8 x 6.2
x 4. 2 cm uterine body and an attached 3.1 x 2. B x 2. 6 cm cervix. The left ovary and fallopian tube are attached to the comu.

The serosa is smooth to shaggy and tan red. The eotocervix Is smooth and pink white with a 0.4 cm slit like as. The cndocervlcal canal is tan and 1. 9 cm
in length. The endornetrial cavity is 3 7 cm from comu to cornu and 4. 8 cm in length. The cavity diffusely consists of a 4 9 x 4. 8 cm polypoid. friable gray
white mass. The mass extends into the lower uterine segment The cut surface of the mass is gray white and diffusely involved the underlying
myometrium, extending to the inked serosa. with a depth of 1. 3 cm.

No uninvolved endometrium is identiﬁed. There is a minimal amount of residual tan pink traboculated myometrium. There are three intramural and one
subserosal whoried gray white dense nodules ranging from 0.8 cm to 2.1 cm in greatest dimension. No areas of hemorrhage or necrosis are identified in
the nodules.

The 1.5 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm leﬁ Ovary has a lobulated tan outer surface. The cut surface is tan with gray white corpora albicens. The attached 5.1 x 0.4 cm
iimbriated leﬂ fallopian tube has a tan pink serosa and a pinpoint lumen.

 

 

 

lso recé'IvTed in the same container is a 2.3 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm ovary with an attached 4.3 x 0.4 cm ﬁmbriated fallopian tube. The outer suriace of the ovary
is smooth to tabulated and tan pink. The cut surface is tan with gray white corpora alblcans. The fallopian tube has a tan pink semen and a pinpoint
lumen.

The specimen is inked. serially sectioned and representative sections are submitted as labeled: Block 1— anterior cervix; block 2~ posterior cervix:
block 3- anterior lower uterine segment: block 4- posterior lower uterine segment; blodrs 5 and 6 — anterior full thickness mass in each: blocks 7-8—
posterior ful thickness mass in each. to include a myornetrlal nodule in block 8; block 9 - three myometriai nodules: block 10— left pararnetrium; block
11—— right parametrium; mod 12- lett ovary and fallopian tube; block 13— right ovary and faiiopian tube. The blocks are labeled \iso
received in the same container is a green and yellow cassette labeled t. ‘ ‘ i for genomic research studies.
