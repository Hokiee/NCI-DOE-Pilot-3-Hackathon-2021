PART A RECEIVED FRESH LABELED— RIGHT BREAST INK MARKS
TUMOR STITCH 12 O’CLOCK, IS A SIMPLE MASTECTOMY SPECIMEN WITH OVERALL
DIMENSIONS OF 24.5 x 21 x 3.5 CM. THE NIPPLE IS UNREMARKABLE WITHIN A 5
x 3-CM ELLIPSE 0F SKIN. A SUTURE DENOTES 12 O’CLOCK. ADJACENT TO THIS
SUTURE IN THE HEEEE_£§§§3_92§23§§T IS BLACK INK DENOTING THE TUMOR AREA.
THIS AREA IS OVERMARKED WITH RED INK. THE SUPERFICIAL ASPECT OF THE
SPECIMEN IS MARKED IN BLUE, THE DEEP IN BLACK INK. IN THE UPPER INNER
QUADRANT, THERE IS A FIRM PALPABLE MASS MEASURING 2.3 x 3.3 x 1.7 CM.
THIS IS 0.6 CM FROM THE DEEP MARGIN. A RIBBON CLIP IS IDENTIFIED WITHIN
THIS MASS. A PORTION OF THIS IS SUBMITTED PER PROTOCOL.

THE BREAST TISSUE CONSISTS OF A MIXTURE OF BLAND YELLOW FATTY TISSUE AND
PINK-TAN FIBROUS TISSUE WHICH PRIMARILY IS CENTRAL AND COMPRISES NO MORE
THAN 20% OF THE PARENCHYMA. THIS MASS IS 1.5 CM FROM THE SUPERFICIAL
MARGIN. ADDITIONALLY WITHIN THE CONTAINER ARE TWO IRREGULAR PORTIONS OF
YELLOW FATTY TISSUE MEASURING 8.5 x 8.3 x 1.5 CM TOGETHER. THIS TISSUE
Is GROSSLY UNREMARKABLE AND No SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED. SECTIONS ARE
SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: A1--NIPPLE AND ADJACENT SKIN (MIRROR IMAGE TO
PROTOCOL), A2—-SUPERIOR PORTION OF LESION TO INCLUDE DEEP MARGIN (MIRROR
IMAGE TO PROTOCOL), A3--THE REMAINDER OF THE FULL CROSS—SECTION TO A2 To
INCLUDE THE INFERIOR ASPECT OF THE LESION, A4—-SECTION OF TISSUE IN AREA
OF RIBBON CLIP (MIRROR IMAGE TO TUMOR BLOCK), A5--TISSUE TAKEN FROM UPPER
OUTER QUADRANT 6 CM FROM THE LESION (MIRROR IMAGE TO PROTOCOL),
A6--MEDIAL ASPECT OF LESION TO INCLUDE DEEP MARGIN, A7--TISSUE
IMMEDIATELY LATERAL TO A6 NOT GROSSLY TUMOR, A8~—REPRESENTATIVE LOWER
OUTER QUADRANT, A9-—REPRESENTATIVE LOWER INNER QUADRANT. AIo--ADDITIONAL
SECTION OF DEEP MARGIN. A11--TUMOR ADJACENT TO DEEP MARGIN WITHOUT INKED

MARGIN PRESENT IN THE SECTION.

PART B RECEIVED FRESH LABEL3- LEFT BREAST STITCH AT 12

THE NIPPLE IS UNREMARKABLE WITHIN A 6.3 X 3.9—CM SKIN ELLIPSE. A SUTURE
DENOTES 12 O'CLOCK. THE SUPERFICIAL ASPECT IS MARKED WITH BLUE INK, THE
DEEP MARGIN WITH BLACK INK. SECTIONING REVEALS CENTRAL GRAY FIBROTIC
TISSUE INTERMINGLED WITH YELLOW FATTY TISSUE WITH A PERIMETER OF BLAND
YELLOW FATTY TISSUE WITH FINE FIBROUS BANDS. THE FIBROUS TISSUE
COMPRISES 20% OF THE SPECIMEN. SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS:
Bl~-NIPPLE, BZ--UPPER INNER QUADRANT_(MIRROR IMAGE TO PROTOCOL),
B3-—UPPER INNER QUADRANT, B4 AND 5~—LOWER INNER QUADRANT, B6 AND 7--LOWER
OUTER QUADRANT, BB AND 9--UPPER OUTER QUADRANT, BlO-—CENTRAL WITH DEEP

MARGIN.

PART C RECEIVED FRESH LABELED~ RIGHT AXILLA FIRST

SENTINEL NODE HOT, IS AN OVOID PORTION OF YELLOW FATTY TISSUE MEASURING 3
X 2.2 X 1.2 CM. SECTIONING REVEALS A 1.2-CM GROSSLY FAT-REPLACED LYMPH
NODE, SUBMITTED ENTIRELY LABELED C1. A SECOND 1-CM GROSSLY FAT—REPLACED
LYMPH NODE IS IDENTIFIED. THIS IS SUBMITTED LABELED C2.

PART D RECEIVED FRESH LABELED- RIGHT AXILLA NONSENTINEL
NODE, IS AN OVOID PORTION OF YE LOW PATTY TISSUE MEASURING 3 x 1.8 x 1.0
CM. SECTIONING REVEALS A 1.5—CM GROSSLY FAT—REPLACED LYMPH NODE,
SUBMITTED LABELED D.

PART E RECEIVED FRESH LABEIEIJ‘IIIIIIII'II'II LEFT AXILLA FIRST SENTINEL
NODE HOT, IS AN OVOID PORTION O YELLOW FATTY TISSUE MEASURING 3.5 X 1.5
X 1.5 CM. SECTIONING REVEALS A 4-CM GROSSLY FAT-REPLACED LYMPH NODE,
ENTIRELY SUBMITTED AS E1 AND 2.

PART F RECEIVED FRESH LABELED LEFT AXILLA SECOND
SENTINEL NODE, IS YELLOW FATTY SSUE MEASURING 3.5 X 3.2 X 1.5 CM.
EXAMINATION REVEALS A 1.2-CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION CENTRALLY FAT-REPLACED
LYMPH NODE, SUBMITTED LABELED F. ONE ADDITIONAL 0.5-CM LYMPH NODE IS

SUBMITTED ALSO LABELED F.
