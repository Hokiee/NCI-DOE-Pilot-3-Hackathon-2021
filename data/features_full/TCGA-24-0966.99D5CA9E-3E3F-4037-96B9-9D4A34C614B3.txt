The specimens are received in ten formalin‘ﬁlled containers. each tandem" The ﬁrst container Is labeled
"right adnexa, PSI/X." It contains a white plastic cassette IabeledFS1 that holds a piece of tan tissue measuring 2.2
cm in greatest dimension. Also present in the container is an ovary and fallopian tube as previously described in the
inlraoperative consultation, that has been previously sectioned. When reconstructed the ovary measures 6 5 x 4.2 x
3.5 cm. There is hemcrmagic tumor present on the ovaian surface. The putative fallopian tube measures it 1.2 cm and
grossly appears involved by tumor. The ovary is further sectioned to Show replacement of the normal ovarian
perenchyma by solid and papillary tumor nodules. Labeled A1 (F8); A2 and A3, ovary; A4, putativetallopia'i tube. Jar

The second container is labeled "appendix." It contains an unremarkable appearing appendix measuring 5.5 x 0.8 cm
with attached fatty tissue measuring 4.5 x 1 x 0.8 cm. The appendx is sectioned to show a patent lumen filled with
greenislnbrown‘ material. No lesions are identiﬁed grossly. Labeled Bi. do 1.

The third container is labeled "uterus, cervix. left lube and ovary.“ It contains a 145 gram specimen consisting of a
uterus with attached left annexe. The uterus measures 7.5 cm from funds to ectocervix, 4.5 cm from comu to com.
and 3.5 cm from anterior to posterior, The serosa surface of the uterus is studded bywhite-tan, papillary minor
deposits. The ectocerle ls whitetan and measures 4 x 3 cm. The uterus is blvalved to show In unremarkable,
appearing ectocervix measuring 1.5 x 0.6 cm. The endometrial cavity is tan, triangular and unremarkable. it measures
3 x 0.6 cm. The average endometrial thickness is 2 mm On section, the myometrium has an average thickness of 1.7
cm and straws multiple intramural and subse'osal fibroids that range from 0.4 to 1.3 cm In greriest dimension. The left
ovary measures 4.5 x35 x 2.? cm and shows papillary tern tumor present along the surface. On section the ovary
shows solid. white-tan tumor, The left fallopiai tube measurestl x 0.8 cm. It shows benigi appearing pa'etubal cysts
along the dstal surface. On section, the lumen is patent and unremarkable. No tumor is grossly evident. Labeled CI.

The fourth contarner is labeled "rectosigmord." It contains a curved portion of large intestine that is stapled a both ends
and measures :23 cm in length by 5.5 cm in average demeter. The specimen is unonented. The serosal surface of the
bowel is covered in white-tan tumor. The colon is opened to show unremakeble white-ten, finely folded mucosa with
no involvement by tumor. Labeled D1. presumed sigmoid margin: 02, presumed rectal mar-gin; DB and De,

The fifth container is labeled "left pavic lymph node." It contains multiple pieces of yeilcw. fatty, brown, firm tissue that
aggegate to 3 7 x 3.? x 1.2 cm. The tissue is dssectedto showfour putative lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 to 2.2 cm
in greatest dimension, that on cut section are grossly concerning for involvement by tumor. Labeled E1. two lymph
nodes: E2. two lymph nodes; E3. remainder of fatty tissre. Jar 1.

The sixth container ls labeled “right common lilac lymph node." It contains a single piece of ﬁrm tissue colored in
greatest dimension, On section it is firm and whitetan consistentwith metastatic tumor. Labeled F1. Jar 0.

The seventh container is labeled "omentum." it contains a strip of yellow, fatty omental tissue measuring 38.5 x. 10 x

HlSTOPATHOLOGlCTYPE
The histologic diagnosis is serous adenocarcinoma

TUMOR LOCATION
The locations of the primary tumoris) are the right and left ovary {synchronous primary tumors)

HlSTOLOGlC GRADE
The histologic grade is poorly differentiated (G3)

TUMOR lNVASON
Tumor is identified on the ovarian surface(si
Tumor does invade the adacenttellopian tube/peritobel softtissue

TUMOR lNVOLVEMENT

Tumor involvement of the pelvic peritoneumlsoft tissue is present
Metastatic involvement of the extrapelvio peritoneum is present
Metastatic involvement of the omenmm is present

TUMOR SIZE
The maximum dimension of tumor implants outside the true pelvis is greater than or equal to 2 cm
