Diagnosis:

2.: Total gastrectomy resection material with the inclusion of an extensive, focally ulcerated,
poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach (diffuse type), partially characterized by
signet ring cells, with widespread infiltration of the perigastric fatty tissue, marked
carcinomatous lymphangitis accompanying the tumor and twenty-five regional lymph node
metastases. Subepithelial tumor infiltrates circumscribed and extending as far as both the oral
and the aboral resection margin. Tumor spread in the omentum. Evidence of carcinomatous
lymphangitis also in the hilar fatty tissue of the spleen.

Tumor stage: pT3 pN3 (25/25) pM1 - I
