Diagnoses called at ' ‘ ’ r. (A and B) and I, (C) by Dr.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. SLN #1 LEFT AXILLA
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "sentinel lymph node number one
left axilla" is a fragment of adipose tissue measuring 2.5 x 2 x 1.3 cm. One possible lymph node is
identiﬁed measuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.5 cm. Touch preparation is performed. The entire lymph node is
submitted, A1.
B. SLN #2 LEFT AXILLA
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "sentinel lymph node number two
left axilla" is a fragment of possible lymphoid tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.1 x 1.1 cm. Touch preparation is
performed. The entire specimen is submitted, 31.
C. WLE LEFT BREAST
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "left breast wide local excision" is
an 81-9, 8 x 7 x 5.5 cm oriented lumpectomy Specimen. The long suture designates lateral, short-
superior. Ink code: Anterior-yellow, posterior-black, medial-green, lateral-red, superior-blue, inferior-
orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 6 slices revealing a ﬁrm beige
mass with granular cut surface, 2.5 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm located right at the posterior margin. A portion of the
specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representatively submitted:
C1-CZ: Perpendicular sections medial margin
C3-C4: Slice 2, mass, posterior/superior margin
05-06: Slice 2, mass, posterior/inferior margin
07-08: Slice 2, anterior/inferior
CQ-C10: Slice 3. remainder of mass, posterior margin
Ci 1: Slice 3, superior/anterior
C12: Slice 3, inferior
C13: Slice 4, posterior
C14: Slice 4, superior
C15: Perpendicular sections lateral margin
D. POSTERIOR MARGIN LEFT BREAST
Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "posterior margin left
breast" is an oriented (suture at ﬁnal margin" 9-9, 4 x 3 x 1.5 cm fragment of ﬁbroadipose tissue. The
ﬁnal margin inked black. The entire specimen is submitted, D1-D9.

SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS
Specimen: Surgical Excision
Block Number: 06

 

ER: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0
PR: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0

 

COMMENT:

The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the
proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of
cells staining, 4 = 31 -60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak

intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining). with a scoring
range from 0 to 8.

ER/PR positive is deﬁned as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is deﬁned as an Allred score
of less than or equal to 2.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
lmmunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti—human ER (ER 105, 1:100) and PR (PGR
136, 1:100) provided by Dako . following the manufacturer 5 instructions. This
assay was not modiﬁed. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published
results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal
review of staining performance.
