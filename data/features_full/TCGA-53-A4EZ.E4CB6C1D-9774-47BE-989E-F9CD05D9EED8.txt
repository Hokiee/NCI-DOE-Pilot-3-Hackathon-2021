Gross Description:

A. Received fresh are three tan-brown lymph nodes measuring 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. Submitted in toto for frozen
section in one cassette.

B. Received fresh are two dark brown lymph nodes measuring 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm in aggregate. Submitted in
toto In one cassette for frozen section.

C. Received fresh are two dark brown lymph nodes measuring 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm in aggregate. Submitted in
toto in one cassette for frozen section.

D. Received in formalin is a lymph node measuring 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. Bisected and submitted in toto in one
cassette.

E. Received in formalin is a lymph node measuring 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. Bisected and submitted in toto in one
cassette.

F. Received in formalin is a lymph node measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. Submitted in toto in one cassette.

G. Received in formalin labeled “Left upper lobe lung” is a 235 gram lobe segment measuring 21.0 x 11.5 x 3.0
cm. The pleura is mottled dark red-brown and there is an area of puckering measuring 2.5 x 1.0 cm. It is
inked black. Sectioning shows a well circumscribed tan-white soft and necrotic lesion, measuring 4.5 x 3.5 x 3.0
cm and is 2.0 cm away from the main bronchus margin and 2.5 cm away from the vascular margin. The lesion

 

does not appear to grossly extend into either the vasculature or bronchus. The remaining lung parenchyma is

dark red and hemorrhagic and appears to be uninvolved. Seven possible lymph nodes were found.
Representative sections are submitted as follows in eight cassettes.
Cassette #1 The bronchial and vascular margin
Cassette #2 Representative section of the tumor in relation to vein
Cassette #3 Representative section of tumor in relation to normal lung parenchyma
Cassettes #48-5 Representative sections of tumor in relationship to pleura
Cassette #6 One lymph node bisected and submitted in toto
Cassette #7 Three lymph nodes in toto
Cassette #8 Three lymph nodes in toto
H. Received in formalin are six possible lymph nodes. the largest measuring 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. Submitted in
toto in two cassettes.
