FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS

A. Left pleura, pleurectomy:

— Malignant mesothelioma, biphasic type, 90% epithelioid (3 0% tubular, 30%
micropapillary, 20% acinar, 20% solid) and 10% sarcomatoid, see parameters

B. # 5 lymph node, biopsy:
- One lymph node, extensively replaced by metastatic mesothelioma
(epithelioid) with extracapsular involvement (1/1), see comment

C. 10L lymph node, biopsy:

- One lymph node, positive for metastatic mesothelioma (epithelioid) (l/l),
see comment

D. # 6 lymph node, biopsy:
- Two lymph nodes, positive for metastatic mesothelioma (epithelioid) in
lymph node parenchyma and lymphatic spaces (2/2), see comment

E. Left chest wall lymph node, biopsy:

- One lymph node, positive for metastatic mesothelioma (epithelioid) (1/ 1),
see comment

Tumor Extension

Conﬂuent visceral pleural tumor

Into but not through diaphragm

Into lung parenchyma

Into mediastinal fat

Into and through the pericardium

Venous/Lymphatic Invasion: Present

Margins: Cannot be assessed

Additional Pathologic Findings: None identiﬁed

*Pathologic Staging (pTNM): pT4, N3

Primary Tumor (pT): pT4:

Tumor (locally advanced technically unresectable) involves any of the
ipsilateral pleural surfaces, with at least lof the following: difﬁise or
multifocal invasion of soft tissues of the chest wall, any involvement of rib,
invasion through the diaphragm to the peritoneum, invasion of any mediastinal
organ(s), direct extension to the contralateral pleura, invasion into the spine,
extension to the internal surface of the pericardium, pericardial effusion with
positive cytology, invasion of the myocardium.

Regional Lymph Nodes (pN): pN3:

Metastases in the contralateral mediastinal, internal mammary, or hilar
lymph node(s) and/or the ipsilateral or contralateral

supraclavicular or scalene lymph node(s)

Specify: Number examined: 5

Number involved: 5

*Effective January 1, 2010 this Checklist utilizes the 7th edition TNM staging
system for pleural mesothelioma of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJ CC)
and the International Union Against Cancer (UICC).

Comment

#1. Majority of the lymph node metastases are epithelioid and have
micropapillary and solid architecture.

#2. Per Dr. [], "the chest wall lymph node from Part E is posterior
near the brachial plexus, making it a positive N3 lymph node”.

Clinical History:
This is a year-old male with biopsy diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma.

Specimens Received:

A: Left pleura

B: # 5 lylmph node

C: 10L lymph node

D: # 6 lymph node

B: Left chest wall lymph node

Gross Description:

The specimens are received in ﬁve containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.

A. The ﬁrst container is additionally identiﬁed as, "left pleura". Received

fresh is a pleurectomy specimen, measuring 1117.4 gram, approximately 1200 cc.
It consists of multiple pieces ranging from 1 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm-25 x 12 x 4 cm in
size. The largest piece is oriented by a stitch designating diaphragm (measuring
15 x 15 cm), which is inked green. There is a 9.5 x 5.5 cm area of membranous
tissue on the second largest piece which is oriented by the surgeon as
pericardium, which is inked blue. There is 12 x 7 x 4 cm portion of adipose
tissue closely associated with the pericardium in the pleura. The specimen
demonstrates diffuse nodularity on the surface, ranging from 0.3-1.3 cm in size.
There is one 9 x 4.5 cm area of possible lung tissue attached to one of the

pieces. The specimen is serially sectioned white, ﬁrm lobulated tumor involving
every piece. The visceral and parietal pleura are thickened up to 2.0 cm and
ﬁised. The pericardium and diagram surface is smooth and glistening. The tumor

is grossly invading the surrounding adipose tissue. Gross pictures of the 2
largest pieces are taken.

Representative sections are taken as follows:

A1-2: Sections of the tumor with possible lung tissue

A3-5: Sections of the tumor with pericardium and adipose tissue
A6-8: Sections of the tumor with diaphragm

A9-15: Representative sections of the tumor

B. The second container is additionally identiﬁed as, "#5 lymph node".
Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 1 cm nodule which is bisected and

entirely submitted as B1.

C. The third container is additionally identiﬁed as, "10L LYMPH node".

Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 1.5 cm nodule which is bisected and
entirely submitted as Cl.

D. The fourth container is additionally identiﬁed as, "#6 lymph node".
Received fresh and placed in formalin are two 1.5 cm nodules, which are bisected
and submitted in D1 and D2 respectively.

B. The ﬁfth container is additionally identiﬁed as, "left chest wall lymph p
node". Received fresh in the placed in formalin is a 0.6 cm nodule which is
bisected and entirely submitted as E1.
