CLINICAL NOTES:
Left adrenal cancer.

MACROSCOPIC: %

‘Tumour left adrenal and left kidney“. The specimen consists of the tail

kidney, the left adrenal gland and the perinephrlc fat, 160 x 125 x 70mm,
weighing 6589 together. The ureter is 35mm in length and 5mm' In maximum
external diameter. The external surface of the kidney has a nodular appearance
with multiple tumour nodulesilymph nodes present in the hilum There Is an
area of capsular defect in the posterosuperior aspect of the specimen, 15 x
10mm (? site of tumour sampling for ancillary studies). The cut surface of the
specimen shows an enlarged adrenal gland replaced almost entirely by a tan
tumour with a heterogenous cut surface showing areas of haemorrhage and large
areas of necrosis. This tumour measures 95 x 95 x 70mm and has a
muitllcbulaied appearance. Tumour deposits are also identified in the renal
vein. as well as six tumour depositslinvoived lymph nodes present in the hilum,
ranging irom 740mm In maximum dimension. The kidney, ureter and renai sinuses
are not involved by the tumour. The rerriainder of the kidney' to unremarkable
Block 1: transverse section of ureteric margin and hilar vessels

Blocks 2 and 3: tumour deposits in renal vein.

Blocks 4 to t i: tumour and overlying capsule. including area of capsular defect
noted superior posteriorly In blocks 7 to 10.

Stock 12: tumour and necrosis

Block 13: tumour and area of haemorrhage.

Block 14: tumour interface with kidney.

Block 15: kidney away from tumour. :

Blocks 16 to 20: representative from involved hilar lymph nodeltumour deposits;
one node in each block, except for block 20, which has two nodes

MiCROSCOPIC:

The 95mm tumour with an estimated weight of 450mg :3 a poorly differentiated
adrenal cortical carcinoma it shows all 9 of 9 Weiss criteria of malignancy
The mitotic count is to mitoses per 10 high power field. There is widespread
vascular and sinusoidal invasion. There is extensive coagulative necrosis.
The carcinoma is separated from the soft tissue resection margin by an intact,
but thin. soft tissue plane 0.2mm. The tdmour does not extend into the
adjacent kidney, and the adjacent kidney is normal. Carcinoma does invade the
renal vein. Metastatic adrenal cortical carcinoma replaces 6 of 6 perirenal
lymph nodes. The venous resection margin and ureteric resection margins are
free of tumour.

SPECIMENTYPE: Adrenal ' Mn-”

lmmunohietoohemistry is as foliows:

IGFZ: Positive (dot~iike perinuclear pattern)
Giucocorticold Receptor: 2+ positive
ACADVL: Positive

Ki-67 Proliferative index: 40%

Calretinnin, inhibin: Focaliy positive

Melan A: Very focally positive

8-100: Negative

SUMMARY:
Left kidney and adrenal: High grade adrenal cortical carcinoma 95mm.
Metastatic carcinoma is present in 6 of 6 iymph nodes.

ADDIT!ONAL REPOHTL ,

At the request of
immunohistochemistry for microsateilite instability associated markers was
performed. The resuits are as foliows:

MLH i : Positive
MSH2: Positive
PMSZ: Positive
MSHG: Positive

Aithough we have no experience in using this test in adrenal carcinoma,: this is
the normal pattern of staining which makes Lynch syndrome unlikely. E
