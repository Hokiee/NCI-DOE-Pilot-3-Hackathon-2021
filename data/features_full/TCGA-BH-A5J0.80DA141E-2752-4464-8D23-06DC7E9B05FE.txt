MICROSCOPICALLY), NOTTINGHAM SCORE 7/9 (TUBULES 3, NUCLEAR GRADE 2, MITOTIC ACTIVITY 2).
NOTTINGHAM GRADE 2.

DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN-SITU (DCIS). SOLID AND CRIBRIFORM TYPES, NUCLEAR GRADE 2 WITH
ASSOCIATED MICROCALCIFICA‘ITONS AND EXTENSION INTO THE LDBULES, ADMTXED AND ADJACENT
TO THE INVASIVE COMPONENT.

DCIS SPANS AN AREA OF APPROXIMATELY 0.8 CM (8 MM).

SURGICAL MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR INVASIVE TUMOR; CLOSEST MARGIN IS ANTERIOR AT 0.45 CM
(4.5 MM) (See Part 6 for additional anterior margin).

COMMENT:
In Pan 1, immunohlstochemtcai staining for E-cadhorin Is. focally negative and P120 demonstrates focal stron9_
cytoplasmic staining. This immunohistochemicai stalning pattern supports tho diagnosis of Iobular carcinoma In situ and

atypicai Iobular hyperplasia.

Part 6: The nresence of a 0.2 cm focus of invasive ductaI carcinoma In confirmed by immunohlstochomical stains for p63
and ~ (see Microscopic Description). The morphologic features of this microscopic focus of carcrnoma are similar
to the invasive ductal carcinoma in Part 1.

MICROSCOPIC:
Microscopic examination substantiates the above diagnosis.
