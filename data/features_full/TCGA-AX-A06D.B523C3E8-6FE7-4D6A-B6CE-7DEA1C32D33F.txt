=s=========ADDENDUM===========

The reason for this addendum is to report the microscopic interpretation of two pieces of
nondeaignated lymph nodes that were procesaed tor histology after original submission for
research purposes. The original diagnosis and total number of lymph nodea remains the
same.

gnoss DESCRIPTION:
Received in container. in two separate . are two pieces of lymph node which
were previously submitted for research and subsequently returned. No orientation was

available. The lymph nodes are from two pieces of lymph node, measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm
each and are submitted in two undeaignated cassettea.

TMLRESSION:

LYMPH NODES, SITE(S) NOT SPECIFIED, DISSECTION:
Two lymph nodes, negative for malignancy (0/2).

myometrium to a maximum depth of 0.7 cm posteriorly. The myometrium averages 1.5

representatively sampled and submitted as follows:

CASSETTE SUMMARY:

Cassette 1A: Anterior cervix.

Cassette lB: Anterior lower uterine segment.

Cassette 1C: Posterior cervix.

Caesette 1D: Posterior lower uterine segment.

Cassette lE-lJ: Anterior endomyometrium with tumor, full thickness section.
Cassette lK: Right tube and right ovary.

Cassette 1L~1Rz Posterior endomyometrium with tumor, full thickness section.
Cassette 18: Tumor with necrosis and hemorrhage.

Cassette 1T: Left fallopian tube.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: (continued)

Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name and "right para-aortic", is a 4.0 x
1.5 x 1.0 cm portion of yellowegold to pink-tan fibroadipose tissue, dissected for
possible lymph nodes. Two lymph nodes are grossly identified, ranging from 1.5 to 2.5
cm in greatest dimension. A portion from the largest lymph node is submitted for
research. The specimen is submitted as follows:

CASSETTE SUMMARY:
Cassette 2A: One lymph node, bisected.
Cassette 2B: One lymph node, bisected.

Received fresh for research, labeled with the patient's name and "left para-aortic, is
a 3.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm portion of yellow-gold to pink-tan fibroadipose tissue, dissected
for possible lymph nodes. One lymph node identified that is 4.6 x 1.7 x 0.6 cm. The
specimen is bisected and entirely submitted in cassettes 3A and BB.

Received labeled with the patient’s name and "bladder serosa", is a 5.6 x 4.0 x 3.0 cm
partially encapsulated pale yellow to pink-tan nodule with adherent yellow-gold
adipose tissue. Upon sectioning the specimen contains a firm calcified yellow-tan
grumose material. Portions of the capsule are representatively submitted in cassettes

4A and QB.

Received in formalin, labeled "left obturator lymph node" and with the patient's name,
is one yellow—tan ovoid lymph node, 1.5 x 1.3 x 0.4 cm. The lymph node is sampled for
research. The remaining tissue is bivalved and submitted in one cassette.

Received in formalin, labeled "left external iliac lymph node" and with the patient’s
name, is one yellow—tan ovoid lymph node, 4.0 x 1.8 x 0.5 cm. The lymph node is
sampled for research, the remaining tissue is bivalved and entirely submitted in two

cassettes.

Received in formalin, labeled "right external iliac lymph nodes" and with the
patient's name, is an aggregate of irregular portions of yellow—tan lobulated adipose
tissue, 4.5 x 2.5 x 0.7 cm. The specimen is dissected for lymph nodes, there are four
tan ovoid lymph nodes identified, ranging from 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm to 2.5 x 1.2 x 0.6
cm. One lymph node is sampled for research. All lymph nodes identified are submitted
as follows:

CASSETTE SUMMARY:

Cassette 7A: One lymph node, bivalved.
Cassette 73: One lymph node, bivalved.
Cassette 7C; one lymph node, bivalved.
Cassette 70: One lymph node.

Received in formalin, labeled "right obturator lymph node" and_with the patient’s
name, is one tan ovoid lymph node, 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm. The lymph node is sampled for
research. The remaining tissue is bisected and entirely submitted in two cassettes.
