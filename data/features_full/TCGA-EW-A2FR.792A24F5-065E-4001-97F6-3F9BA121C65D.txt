GROSS DESCRIPTION: v

SPECIMEN A IS LABELED RIGHT BREAST MASS AND CONSISTS 0F YELLOW~GRAY LUMPECTOMY MEASURING
9.3 X 9.0 X 6.5 CM AND WEIGHS 75.7 GRAMS. THE SPECIMEN IS ORIENTED WITH A SHORT STITCH AT
THE SUPERIOR MARGIN, A LONG STITCH AT THE LATERAL MARGIN AND CLIP INFEROLATERAL CORNER.
THE SPECIMEN REVEALS A LIGHT TAN ELLIPSES OF SKIN MEASURING 3.5 X 0.8 CM. THE SPECIMEN IS
INKED AS FOLLOWS: SUPERIOR MARGIN INKED RED, INFERIOR MARGIN INKED ORANGE, LATERAL MARGIN
INKED GREEN, MEDIAL MARGIN INKED BLUE, INFEROLATERAL MARGIN INKED YELLOW AND DEEP MARGIN
INKED IN BLACK. MULTIPLE CROSS SECTIONS REVEAL AN ILL-DEFINED, GRAYrPINK, INDURATED AREAS
MEASURING APPROXIMATELY 1.0 X 1.0 CM. THIS AREA IS LOCATED AT 0.7 CM FROM THE INFERIOR
MARGIN (NEAREST). THERE IS AN ILL—DEFINED, GRAY-PINK MICROCYSTIC ASPECT LOCATED AT 0.3

CM FROM THE INFEROLATERAL MARGIN (NEAREST). THE REST OF THE SPECIMEN IS YELLOW, HOMOGENOUS
CUT SURFACE. THE STROMA IS SUBMITTED IN TOTO IN 16 CASSETTES.
