5) The specimen is received iresh. labeled, "Right breast,

mastectomy consisting oi an ellipse of tan skin with breast
tissue. The ellipse a: skin measures 9.0 x 3.0 an. The breast

the upper outer quadrant is a smaller tumor nodule which measures
1.0 cm in greatest dimension (satellite nodule: vs tumor
extension). Spreading from the mass toward the outer aspect, is
a. diffuse area of fibrous tissue which 1:: thickened and
multinodular. The fibrous tissue constitutes approximately 45%
of the breast tissue. The rest of the breast tissue is fatty and
unremarkable. No lymph nodes were identified at the axillary
tail site. The tumor was taken so: TPS. Representative sections
