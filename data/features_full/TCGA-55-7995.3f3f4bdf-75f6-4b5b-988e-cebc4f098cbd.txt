CLINlCAL INFORMATION
Lung mass: cancer study

SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPTION

A) SOURCE: Wedge resection left upper lobe lung

Labeled ”wedge resection left upper lobe lung” is a 23 gram, 8 x 4 x 3 cm
lung wedge excision with an incorporated staple line (8.5 X 0.5 cm). The
redntan pleural surface includes a discrete indurated puckered 1 x 0.8 cm
area centrally (inked green). The stapled margin is trimmed and subjacent
tissue inked black. Cut surfaces disclose a 2.6 x 2.4 x 1.7 cm solid
gray-tan tumor mass with partially circumscribed to focally infiltrating
borders, abutting the green~inked puckered serosa and 0.6 cm from the
blacksinked staple resection surface.

Central tumor is submitted on one block for frozen microscopy.

INTRAOPERATIVE PAT TION WITH FROZEN SECTION: "Non-small cell
carcinoma" is rendered b

Fresh tumor is banked for additional ancillary studies.

The remaining cut surfaces are soft red—tan, with mild emphysematous change
and no additional discrete lesions.

Representative sections are submitted in seven cassettes as follows:
1. Frozen section residue

2, Black—inked staple margin nearest tumor

3~6. Tumor mass with green-inked puckered pleural surface

7. Lung with emphysematous change

The speci ‘ the patient at—and placed in
formalin at for a minimum of-fixation per

irotocol.

8) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy. level 9L

The specimen is received in formalin labeled "level 9L lymph node." It
consists of three red-black soft tissues aggregating 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm.
The specimen is submitted in toto in one cassette.

C) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, level 5

The specimen is received fresh labeled "level 5 lymph node." it consists of
1 x 1 x 0.2 cm of fragmented black—red tissue which is submitted in toto
for frozen on one block.

lNTRAOPERATIVE PATH TATION WITH FROZEN SECTlON: ”Negative for
carcinoma." is rendered b

D) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, level 6

The specimen is received in formalin labeled "level 6 lymph node." It _

consists of two tan—red soft tissues aggregating 0.9 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm. The
specimen is submitted in toto in one cassette.

 

E) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, level 7

The specimen is received labeled "level 7 lymph node.” It consists of a
single 1.2 cm anthracotic lymph node. The specimen is entirely submitted in
one cassette.

F) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, level 12L

The specimen is received labeled "level 12L lymph nodes.” It consists of
three anthracotic lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 to 0.8 cm in greatest
dimension. The specimen is submitted in toto in one cassette.

G) SOURCE: Left upper lobe bronchial margin for frozen section
Received fresh from the OR labeled "left upper lobe bronchial margin for
frozen section and consists of a 3 g lung lobe (19 x 12 x 4 cm). The
bronchial resection margin is received stapled. The staple line is removed
and the subjacent tissue is taken en face for frozen section diagnosis.

INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLO TION WITH FROZEN SECTION: "Benign
bronchial margin” is rendered b

The vascular margins and hilar lymph nodes are taken. The pleural surface
is tan-red to red-purple, smopth and glistening. There is a 9 cm staple

line grossly corresponding to the earlier wedge resection. The staple line

is removed and the subjacent tissue is inked blue. The staple line lies 4.5
cm from the bronchial resection margin. The lung lobe is sectioned
revealing pink-tan to red—purple spongy tissue. No discrete masses or
lesions are identified.

Representative sections of the specimen are submitted in nine cassettes as
follows:

1. Frozen section bronchial resection margin

2. Hilar lymph nodes

3, Vascular resection margins, en face

4. Staple line nearest bronchial margin

5. Additional inked staple line

80. Grossly unremarkable lung parenchyma

MICROSCOPIC

A) Sections through the wedge resection from the left upper lobe confirm
the presence of non-small cell carcinoma. The tumor is predominantly
composed of solid nests of cells with large vesicular nuclei and abundant
eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic activity is fairly abundant and areas of
tumor necrosis are seen. The tumor is predominantly growing in solid nests
with minimal acinar formation. although occasional foci of both

intracellular and extracellular mucin are suggested. This lesion abuts but
does not appear to specifically infiltrate within the overlying visceral

pleura. Assessment in this regard includes an elastic stain on block A6.
Noninvolved pulmonary parenchyma demonstrates nonspecific emphysematous
changes but is otherwise unremarkable. A limited immunohistochemical
evaluation of this lesion is performed with results as follows:

TTF-i: Positive
N in A: Negative
Negative
P63: Limited/focal positivity is seen

The combination of TTF-i positivity with apparent focal mucin production by
this neoplasm would confirm a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.

B G) The ma icroscopic appearance substantiates the diagnosis.
