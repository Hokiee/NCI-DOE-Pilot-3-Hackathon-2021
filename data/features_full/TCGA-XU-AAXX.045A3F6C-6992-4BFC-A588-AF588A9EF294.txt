COMMENT

Sections show a well—circumscribed tumor composed of a roughly equal
admixture of small lymphocytes and larger epithelial cells. The tumor is
partially encapsulated, but in several places extends through the capsule

into adjacent adipose tissue. 'Tumor is present focally at a cauterired
edge of resection, presumably a surgical margin. By
immunohistochemistry, the lymphocytes stain positive for CD3. with a
subset positive for CD1a, and the epithelial cells stain positive for low
and high molecular weight keratins and p63. The overall features are in
keeping with a minimally invasive thymoma (modified Masaoka stage Ila),
WHO type 32 (aka cortical type), with a microscopically positive margin
of resection-

GROSS DESCRIPTION

1. The specimen container is labeled with the patient's name and as
"thymus gland, thymoma and pericardium“ and contains an unoriented thymus
gland with a portion of membranous tissue (?pericardium) received in 10%
buffered formalin. The thymus gland measures 12.5 x 8.5 x 2.4 cm. The
membranous tissue measures 7.5 x 2.5 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is painted
with silver nitrate. with the ?pericardium over coat the green dye. on
gross examination, a well-circumscribed nodule is identified on one pole
of the thymus measuring 5.5 x 3.8 x 2.5 cm. The cut surface of the
nodule is tan in color, with focal areas of calcification. The
peripheral aspect of the nodule firm and is centrally soft and friable.
The rest of the thymus is firm, tan in color and has a slightly nodular
appearance.
