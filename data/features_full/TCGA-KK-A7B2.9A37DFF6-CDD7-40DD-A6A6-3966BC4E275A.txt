DIAGNOSIS

(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 9 (4+5). (SEE COMMENT).
TUMOR EXTENDING INTO EXTRAPROSTATIC TISSUE.
MARGINS OF RESECTION FREE OF TUMOR.
Right and left seminal vesicles, no tumor present.
Segments of right and left vasa deferentia. no tumor present.
PERINEURAL AND LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION PRESENT.
SEE PREVIOUS REPORT FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF THE PELVIC LYMPH NODES.

COMMENT

The prostate gland contains two foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, one in the peripheral zone and one in the transition zone. The
dominant tumor focus is located in the left anterolateral, left lateral and left posterolateral peripheral zone with extension into the
left transition zone. This tumor focus measures 2.0 x 0.8 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the two
cross-sections of the prostate and extensively in the apex and base. In the left superior neurovascular bundle region this tumor
focus extends into extraprostatic tissue (6.0 mm). The margins of resection are free of tumor. The second tumor focus is located
in the right transition zone. This tumor focus measures 1.4 x 1.2 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and is present in two
cross-sections and extensively in the apex and base. This tumor focus is of lower histologic grade (Gleason score 7/3+4) and
conﬁned to the prostate. The margins of resection are free of tumor.

Please refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate. attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (3.5 x 3.0 x 3.5 cm, 24.0 grams, post-ﬁxation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
right posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the left side. A palpable nodule is present on the left

side of the prostate. Serial cross-sections after ﬁxation demonstrate an area consistent with tumor in the right peripheral zone of
the two cross-sections of the prostate extending into the left transition zone.

The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

SECTION CODE: A1—A4, right seminal vesicle and right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; A5-A8, left
seminal vesicle and left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; A9 prostatic base, right border; A10-A13, prostatic base. right
posterior border, A14-A19, prostatic base, central portion; A20, prostate base, left border; A21-A23, prostatic base, left posterior
border; A24—A25, apex anterior; A26, apex left; A27-A28, apex posterior; A29, apex right; A30-A37, sections of the two
cross-sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.

The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in
black.

Orange ink (A34,A35) denotes surfaces that do not represent a true margin of resection.
