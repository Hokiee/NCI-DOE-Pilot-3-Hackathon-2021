CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Right thyroid nodule with atypical cells
CLINICAL HISTORY: Papillary carcinoma.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS
AI Thvroid, right lobe, excision — Papillary carcinoma

B) Lymph nodes, pretracheal, excision — Negative for metastatic
carcinoma (0/1).

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. Received fresh for frozen section labeled "right lobe

of thyroid" is a lobectomy specimen that measures 4.4 x 2.9
x 2 cm in dimension. Sections through the specimen show a white
firm nodular lesion grossly suspicious for carcinoma that measures
1.5 cm in dimension. A representative section is submitted for
frozen section and a touch preparation is made. The remaining
thyroid shows degenerative and cystic changes. The tumor is
entirely submitted for permanent section in cassettes Al through A4
and the remaining thyroid is submitted for permanent section in
cassettes A5 through A10. As—lO.

B. Received fresh for frozen section labeled "pretracheal

lymph node" is a lymph node that measures .7 x .6 x .5 cm
in dimension. The lymph node is entirely frozen.

C. Received fresh labeled "central cervical lymph node"

are five soft tan pink—gold tissues ranging from 0.4—1.7
cm. in greatest dimension. The two largest tissues are bisected and
the specimens are entirely submitted in three blocks as labeled.
BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - Three whole tissues; 2—3 - one bisected tissue
per cassette.

D. Received fresh labeled "left lobe thyroid" is a 13.2

gram, unoriented, 4.9 x 3.6 x 2.0 cm. soft portion of
thyroid parenchyma. The capsule is delicate tan pink and no
lymphoid or parathyroid tissues are identified. The specimen is
inked entirely black and sectioned. The parenchyma is bosselated
pale tan with focal areas of "normal appearing" red— brown beefy cut
surfaces. No discrete mass lesion is identified grossly. The
specimen is entirely submitted in a sequential manner in 10 blocks.

 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Histologic type: Papillary carcinoma
Primary tumor (pT): The tumor measures 1.5 cm in the right lobe and

there are two microscopic foci in the left lobe that measure 3.5 mm
and 1 mm in

largest dimension.

The tumor shows minimal extrathyroidal extension in the right
lobe, pT3.

Margins of resection: Positive in the right lobe.
Vascular invasion: Not identified.

Regional lymph nodes (pN): pNO

Distant metastasis (pM): pr

Other findings: Marked chronic throiditis.

14X2,4x3,3xl

DIAGNOSIS ii
A. Thyroid, rightxlobe, lobectomy —
Papillary carcinoma (see tumor characteristics in the
micfoscopicrdescription).
B. Lymph node, pretracheal, excision —

One lymph node negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/1).
C. Lymph nodes, central cervical, excision —

Six lymph nodes negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/6).
D. Thyroid, left lobe, excision —

Two microscopic foci of organ—confined papillary carcinoma
measuring 3.5 and 1 mm in dimension.
