Pathology Report for Subiect-

Addendum Discussion:

Only a rare MlB-l positive cell is present, consistent with the low grade histologic
features. The case is reviewed with- who in addition to the astrocytic
proliferation, notes disorganization of neurons with some atpyia, as well as neurons and
white matter, consistent with a background of cortical dysplasia.

Addendum Diagnosis:
Well-differentiated Astrocytoma, grade II in background of cortical dysplasia.

Microscopic Description:

Sections demonstrate a mildly to moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely
infiltrates white matter as well as gray matter. In the latter, focal perineuronal
satellitosis is seen. The tumor predominantly resembles gemistocytes, although some
fibrillary astrocytes are seen. Although the nuclei tend to be round to oval, perinuclear
halos or other definite indications of oligodendroglioma differentiation are not seen.
Atypia is mild to moderate. No mitoses are in seen in 50 high power fields or on lower
power scanning.
