5) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Left breast'I and consists of a
breast measuring 21.5 x 14.0 x 3.4 cm with an overlying skin ellipse
measuring 10.8 x 5.0 cm. Situated centrally on the skin surface is an
averted nipple measuring 1.3 x 1.3 x 0.6 cm and areola measuring 2.2 x 2.2
cm. A suture demarcates the axillary aspect. The posterior surface of the
breast is inked black, the anterior aspect is blue and the axillary aspect
green and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal an indurated
tan-white tumor measuring 2.5 x 2.4 x 2.3 cm, and located predominantly in
the upper outer quadrant, between 12 o' clock and one o' clock, focally
extending into the upper inner quadrant, 0.2 cm from the anterior aspect and
0.7 cm from the deep margin. Sectioning of the axillary aspect reveals no
grossly identifiable lymph nodes. Tissue is submitted for TPS.
Representative sections are submitted.
