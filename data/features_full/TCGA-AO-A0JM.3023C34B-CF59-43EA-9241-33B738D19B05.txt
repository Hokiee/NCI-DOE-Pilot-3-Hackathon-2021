- CALCIFICATIONS ARE PRESENT IN BOTH THE IN SITU AND INVASIVE CARCINOMA.

- VASCULAR INVASION IS PRESENT.

- No INVOLVEMENT OF THE SURGICAL MARGINS BY INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS
IDENTIFIED.

- RARE FOCI OP DCIS/IN SITU CARCINOMA ARE CLOSE (1 MM) TO THE FOLLOWING
SURGICAL MARGIN: DEEP.

- NO SKIN INVOLVEMENT BY CARCINOMA IS IDENTIFIED.

- THE ATTACHED SKELETAL MUSCLE IS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

- THE NON-NEOPLASTIC BREAST TISSUE SHOWS BIOPSY SITE CHANGES.

- THE LYMPH NODE STATUS IS AS FOLLOWS (EXPRESSED AS THE NUMBER OF POSITIVE
LYMPH NODES IN RELATION TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF LYMPH NODES EXAMINED): LEVEL
I: D/13; LEVEL II: 0/9; AND LEVEL III: 0/2.

- RESULTS OF SPECIAL STAINS (ER, PR, HERZ-NEU) WILL BE REPORTED AS AN
ADDENDUM.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF

1). The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation.
labeled “Sentinel node number one, level 1, right sxilla“ and consists of 7
lymph nodes and measure 3.5 x 2.6 x 1.0 cm in aggregate. One lymph node is
blue and has been bisected, and the lymph nodes are entirely submitted in
two cassettes.

Summary of sections:
FSCA--frozen section control A
FSCB—-frozen section control B

2). The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation,
labeled "Sentinel node number two, level 1. left sxilla" and consists of a
soft lymph node measuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm, bisected and entirely
submitted for frozen section.

3). The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation,

4). The specimen is received fresh in a container, labeled "Right breast and
axillary contents levels 1, 2 and 3 with tags attached". The specimen
consists of a mastectomy measuring 30 x 19 x 3 cm. That axillary tail
measures 13 x 8 x 2 cm. The overlying ellipse of skin measures 10 x 3 cm.
No scar can be identified on the skin. The nipple measures 1 x 1 cm and it
is grossly unremarkable. The deep resection margin is inked blue. The
specimen is serially sectioned revealing a pinkish red, relatively
well-circumscribed and firm lesion measuring 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm which closely
abuts the inked resection margin. The lesion is 2 cm away from the skin.
The lesion is located in the lower inner quadrant. Surrounding the lesion,
are areas of fibrosis which show punctate areas of cheesy necrosis. Away
from this lesion, in the lower outer quadrant is a vaguely defined area of
fibrosis and nodularity. Approximate measurements of this area are 10 x 6
cm. The upper inner and outer quadrants show mainly fatty tissue. An
axillary dissection is performed revealing 3 level one lymph nodes, 4 level
two lymph nodes and 2 level three lymph nodes.
