Gross Description:

 

1.) The specimen Is received fresh, labeled ”paratracheal lymph node" and consists of a single pink tan ﬁrm lymph node(1.2 x 0.5 x
0.4 cm). Bisected and entirely submitted. _

Summary of sections:
BLN-- bisected lymph nodes

2.) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "perithyroidal lymph node" and consists of two pink tan ﬁrm lymph nodes measuring
0.8 and 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. Entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
LN -- lymph nodes

3.) The specimen ls received fresh, labeled "total thyroid, stitch marks left superior pole" and consists of a thyroid weighing 20.5
grams. The right lobe measures 3.5 x 2.4 x 1.5 cm , the left lobe measures 4.5 x 2.8 x 1.8 cm and the isthmus measures 1.2 x 0.6
x 0.6 cm. The external surface is covered by a thin ﬁbrous capsule. The posterior surface of the specimen is inked black, and the
anterior is inked blue. Sectioning reveals round tan/yellow , well circumscribed mass(2.0 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm) in the lower pole of the
left lobe. Sections through the remaining tissue reveal irregular white firm area in the left upper pole, and 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.5 steilaie
white ﬁbrous area in the mid right lobe. The remaining thyroid parenchyma ls red tan and meaty. Representative sections of the
specimen are submitted for TPS. The remaining tissue is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
N — nodule left lobe
RL - right lobe

LL - left lobe

IS - isthmus
