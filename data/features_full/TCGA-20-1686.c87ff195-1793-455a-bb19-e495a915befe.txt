Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled #2, “left tube and ovary”
Intraoperative Consultation: SBROUS ADENOCARCINOMA.

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled " patient name and medical number,
left tube and ovary". It consists of a fallopian tube with attached

cystic ovary weighing a total of 345 grams. The cystic ovary measures 11.5

x 10.5 x 7.5 cm. The outer surface is gray-tan, cerebrifonn with no

papillary structures noted. The ovary is sectioned to reveal a

multilocular ﬂuid ﬁlled cut surface with multiple scattered ﬂeshy areas

noted, the largest measuring 7' cm in greatest dimension. The attached
fallopian tube measures 4.5 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. The tube is sectioned to

reveal a soft tan—pink cut surface with no obvious masses present.
Representative sections submitted in 2A—2I.

Designation of Sections: 2A—2H- random section of ovary, 21— fallopian

tube in relation to ovarian mass
