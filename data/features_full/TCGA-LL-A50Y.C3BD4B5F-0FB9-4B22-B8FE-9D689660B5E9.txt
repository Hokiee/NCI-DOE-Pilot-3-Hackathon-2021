GROSS DESCRIPTION:

Specimen A is received in the fresh state labeled “left breast tissue". This is a breast
with an overlying ellipse of white skin and nipple. The skin measures 24 x 15 cm. The
skin and nipple are unremarkable. The breast measures 24 x 15 x 4 cm. A suture-tags the
axillary tail which measures 5 x 3 x 3 cm“ The chest wall margin is fatty and
unremarkable. This margin is marked with black ink. The specimen is serially sectioned.
The breast tissue is mostly fatty without focal suspicious lesions. A couple of large
fatty lymph nodes are found in the axillary tail with the largest one measuring 3 cm in
greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Al - nipple
AZ~S — representative breast tissue waving medial to lateral
A6 — chest wall margin, inked

A7 - axillary tail

Specimen B is received in the fresh state labeled "right modified radical mastectomy".

This is a breast with an overlying ellipse of white skin and nipple. The skin ellipse
measures 20 x.15 cm: The breast measures 20 x 15 x 4 cm. The axillary tail measures 8 x 8
x 3 cm. The skin and nipple are unremarkable. The chest all margin is fatty without focal
lesions. The chest wall margin is inked black. There is some palpable nodularity along
the medial most margin and this margin is inked blue, Serial sections through the breast
reveal mostly fatty tissue with irregular areas of white fibrosis. In the central breast
roughly 3 cm inferior to the nipple is an ill-defined. indurated area suspicious for tumor
and associated with fresh hemorrhage. This area spans approximately 1 cm by palpation and
a portion of this area is submitted for tumor banking. handed off to There
appears to be a separate tumorous area in the lateral breast roughly 6 cm from the nipple
and spanning by palpation roughly 3 cm. Again, this area is visually ill~defined. There
may be yet a third ill—defined indurated area in the far lateral breast spanning
approximately 7 mm. Several fatty lymph nodes are identified in the axillary tail. These
measure up to 3 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as
follows:

31,2 — nodularity in the medial most breast

BB - nipple

34 - grossly uninvolved medial breast tissue

85—? ~ 1 cm nodule mid inferior breast

BS — hemorrhagic fecus mid breast

BB - chest wall margin central breast

BIO-lz- 3 cm area of nodularity lateral breast

313 — possible third area of nodularity lateral breast
Bl4,15~ one fatty lymph node

315 ~ one fatty lymph node

317418e one fatty lymph node
319,20— multiple lymph nodes

NOTE: The specimen margins were grossly uninvolved by tumorous tissue by at least.1 cm
along the deep margin.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTIGN:

The slides are examined and evaluated. E—cadherin stain is performed on the left breast
tissue in an area showing features of lobular carcinoma in situ and atypical lobular
hyperplasia. The E. Cadherin stain is negative confirming this diagnosis. In addition to
the histologic sections one of the lymph node from the right modified radical mastectomy is
examined with Pankeratin stain. No evidence of metastatic carcinoma is detected either in
the histology or the Pankeratin stain.
