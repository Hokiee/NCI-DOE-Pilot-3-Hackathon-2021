GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in three parts.

Part 1 is labeled with the patient' s name, initials xx, medical record
number, and "total laryngectomy and bilateral neck dissection" and
consists of

a total laryngectomy with three tracheal rings and epiglottis, attached
right

selective neck dissection and left modified radical neck dissection,
hyoid

bone, and left thyroid lobe.

In the left side of the larynx there is a 5.0 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm firm grey
ulcerated mass, involving left glottis and extending superiorly to
paraglottic

space, invading left thyroid cartilage, and penetrating cricothyroidal
membrane with extension into anterior strap muscles. The tumor is
within 5.0

mm from left anterior soft tissue margin and 0.3 cm from left pyriform
sinus.

Left thyroid lobe appears to be unremarkable. See Part 3 for left
pyriform

mucosal margin. The tumor is far away from right anterior soft tissue
margins,

and superior (base of tongue) margin. Purulent exudate is identified in
right

glottis.

Left neck dissection consists of 12.0 x 10.0 x 6.0 cm segment of soft
tissue

with attached external jugular vein (6.0 cm long, 3.0 cm in open
circumference

in inferior segment and 0.6 cm in open circumference in superior
segment), and

7.0 cm in largest dimension, multicystic mass with necrotic yellow,
granular

material.

Right neck dissection consists of a 9.0 x 2.3 x 1.0 cm segment of soft
tissue,

containing levels 2 through 4.

Representative sections of the metastatic and primary tumor are banked.
Digital images are taken.

Representative sections of laryngectomy are submitted as follows:

1A inferior/tracheal margin

13 left anterior soft tissue margin, radial

1C right pyriform mucosal margin, shave.

1D tumor in paraglottic space

1E tumor penetrating cricothyroid membrane and extending into anterior
soft

tissue

1F representative section of thyroid gland

1G tumor invading thyroid cartilage

1H tumor extending through cricothyroid membrane.

1I midline (anterior commissure)

1J representative section through right glottic region

1K additional section through right glottic region.

1L superior jugular vein margin

1M inferior jugular vein margin

1N jugular vein and immediately adjacent tumor

10 tumor and closest soft tissue margin, inked green, radial

1P tumor (neck metastasis) and skeletal muscle

1Q additional left level 4 grossly positive lymph node, 1.5 cm

1R additional left level 4 lymph nodes.

1S level 2 right

1T level 2 right

1U salivary gland tissue, right

1V level 3 right

1W level 3 right

1X level 4 right

1Y level 4 right

Part 2 is labeled with the patient' s name, initials xx, medical record
number

and "left neck level 2B". It consists of a 2.0 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm fragment
of

soft tissue with possible lymph nodes. Part 2 is bisected and entirely
submitted in cassettes 2A through 2C.

Part 3 is labeled with the patient' s name, initials xx, medical record
number

and "left laryngeal wall, stitch superior". It consists of a single
fragment
of mucosa, 3.0 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. Part 3 is entirely submitted in

e 3AFS.
