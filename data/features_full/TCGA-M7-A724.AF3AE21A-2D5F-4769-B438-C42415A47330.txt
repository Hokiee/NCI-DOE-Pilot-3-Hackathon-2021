This staging information is based on this pathologic specimen
and may be incomplete. A comprehensive review of all available
information is recommended to determine final staging.

B: Lymph nodes, left pelvic, regional resection
— No tumor seen in five lymph nodes (0/5)

C: Lymph nodes, right pelvic, regional resection
— No tumor seen in two lymph nodes (0/2)

Comment:

After this case was signed out, recut slides were requested by
Hospital. The patient had a local recurrence and received
salvage radiation therapy at Hospital completed in

The recut slides were reviewed by the Pathologist on

who notified us that the recut slides showed positive margin.
The entire case was recut and reviewed, and the recut slides
show extracapsular extension and positive margin in the right
mid prostate. These results were sent to Dr. on . The
patient has already received treatment for local recurrence.

Clinical History:
I—year—old male with prostate cancer.

Gross Description:
Received are three appropriately labeled containers.

Container A is additionally labeled "prostate".
Specimen fixation: Formalin

Type of specimen(s) received: Robotic assisted laparoscopic
prostatectomy

Size of specimen: Medial to lateral is 5.6 cm, superior to
inferior is 5.2 cm, anterior to posterior is 5.0 cm

Weight of specimen: 60 grams

Orientation: Inking: apex/yellow, bladder neck/red, right
half/blue, left half/black

Size and description of other organs or structures: Left seminal
vesicle stump 3.5 X 1.7 x 1.1 cm, left vas deferens 2.5 cm long
x 0.5 cm in diameter, right seminal vesicle stump is 4.7 x 1.7 x
1.4 cm and right vas deferens 3.4 cm long x 0.5 cm in diameter.
The left and right seminal vesicle and vas deferens are all
unremarkable.

Gross description of prostate: The left and right lobes are
roughly of equal size with diffuse periurethral nodularity and a

2.1 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm firm nodular gray/white mass with lobulated
borders that is at the right lateral apex. The mass is 0.1 cm
from the apical margin, 1.4 cm to the bladder neck margin and
grossly abuts the capsule but does not extend through it. A
portion of the mass was given to tissue procurement.

Digital photograph taken: No

Block Summary:

Al-A3 - Right apex, radially sectioned

A4—A5 — Left apex, radially sectioned

A6—A8 — Right bladder neck, radially sectioned

A9-A11 - Left bladder neck, radially sectioned

A12—A18 — Right prostate from apex to base, mass in A12—A17 and
right seminal vesicle in A18 (approximately 40% of right
prostate submitted)

A19—A24 — Left prostate, from apex to base (approximately 40% of
left prostate submitted)

A25 — Left seminal vesicle

Container B is additionally labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes"
and consists of a 4.7 x 3.7 x 1.7 cm portion of adipose tissue
that is dissected for lymph node candidates. Five fatty lymph
node candidates are identified ranging from 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm
up to 3.7 x 2.3 x 1.4 cm in greatest dimension. The largest
lymph node is firm tan/gray.

Block Summary:

B1 — Two lymph node candidates

BZ — One lymph node candidate, serially sectioned
B3-B4 — One lymph node candidate, serially sectioned
B5-B6 - Representative of largest lymph node

Container C is additionally labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes"
and consists of a 5.5 x 2.1 x 1.9 cm portion of adipose tissue
that is dissected for lymph node candidates. Two lymph nodes are
identified ranging from 0.2 cm in greatest dimension up to 5.5 x
1.7 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. The largest node is tan,
firm, and grossly positive on cut section.

Block Summary:
Cl — One lymph node
C2—C3 - Representative of largest lymph node
