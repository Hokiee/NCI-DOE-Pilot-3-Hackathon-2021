Macroscopic examination :
1 . A piece of thymectomy weighing 173 g and measuring 18 x 11 x 0.5 cm and having a
nodule 8 x 7.5 x 4.3 cm surrounded by a capsule . When cut , the tumor appears
Iobulated without cyst , or necrosis , or bleeding .

2 . Two fragments of fat superior mediastinum measuring 2 and 2.2 cm long axis .

Histopathological examination :

1 . thymus :

The tumor appears Iobulated by thick fibrous tract from the capsule. it is constituted by a biphasic
proliferation constituted ﬁrstly by cells quite numerous epithelial , splndled , grouped in small
short beams with little nuclear atypia . The epithelial proliferation is associated with a lymphocytlc
component. Lymphocytes are quite small , regular . The tumor is surrounded by a thick fibrous

capsule , not crossed. The normal thymus contains a discrete lymphoid hyperplasia, and extends in
the medium mediastinum.

After immunohistochemistry , the tumor cells express pancytokeratin AE1/AE3 and focally CDZO.
They do not express CD5 or EMA. Lymphocytes are T phenotype of immature CD13 and CD3 + .

2 . Fat upper mediastinum :

The upper mediastinal fat is the location of two small lymph nodes lack of histopathological
evidence of malignancy.

3 . Subcutaneous fat left pleural :

Fragment of connective adipose tissue without lymphoid structure.

Conclusion :

Thymoma 8 cm long axis , sub type AB , completely encapsulated . Resection

is complete.
