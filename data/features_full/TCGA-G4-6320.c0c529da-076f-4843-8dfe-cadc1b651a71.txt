INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:
A-right colon: Tumor is 11 cm from each margin (proximal and distal) called by—

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. RIGHT COLON
Received fresh is a closed segment of colon including terminal ileum, ileocecal valve, cecum, and colon
measuring 25 cm in length. The serosa has an area of tattooing approximately 7 cm from the distal
margin. The vermiform appendix is 7.1 cm in length and 0.5 cm in width; it is unremarkable. On
opening the colon, the segment of terminal ileum is 6 cm in length and 4 cm in diameter; right colon is
19 cm in length and up to 10 cm in diameter. The colon contains a circumferential, polypoid, indurated,
mass with serpentine borders measuring 6 x 4.3 cm extending through the muscularis propria. The
mass is located 11 cm from the proximal and distal margins and 5 cm from ileocecal valve. There are 2
colonic polyps, 0.5 and 0.6 cm. Tissue is procured. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
A1: proximal margin
A2: distal margin
A3-A8: mass in relationship with normal mucosal and deep margin
A9: colonic polyps
A10: normal-appearing mucosa including region of tattooing
A11 : appendix
A12: proximal, 6 lymph nodes
A13: proximal, 2 lymph nodes
A14-A15: proximal, 1 node each
A16-A23: distal, 6 lymph nodes each
A24-A25: distal, 3 lymph nodes each
A26-A27: distal, 2 lymph nodes each
A28—A33: distal, 1 lymph node each
A34-A36: 7 possible lymph nodes each (after O-Fix)

DIAGNOSIS:
COLON, RIGHT, HEMICOLECTOMY:
- INVASIVE ADENOCARCINOMA, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED,
ARISING IN A TUBULOVILLOUS ADENOMA.
- TUMOR MEASURES 6 CM.
- TUMOR INVOLVES THE SUBSEROSAL FAT.
- MARGINS, FREE OF TUMOR.
- HYPERPLASTIC POLYPS (2).
- APPENDIX, NO TUMOR SEEN.
- METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO TWO OF 65 LYMPH NODES WITH FOCAL
EXTRANODAL EXTENSION (2/65).
