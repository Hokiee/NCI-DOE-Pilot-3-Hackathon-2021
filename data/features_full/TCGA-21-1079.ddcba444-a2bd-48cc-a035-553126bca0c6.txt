Gross Description:
GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received in ﬁve parts.

A) Labeled #l , "level IX lymph node”. Received fresh for frozen section evaluation is a
0.8 x 0.6 x 0.30m gray-black lymph node. Specimen is submitted in toto for frozen
section evaluation and the frozen itself is submitted labeled AF S.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: AFS — NO TUMOR SEEN.

B) Labeled #2, "level X nodes“. Received fresh is a 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3cm gray-black
rubbery firm lymph node which is submitted in toto labeled B.

C) Labeled #3, “left lung". Received fresh for frozen section evaluation is a 420 gram,
20.5 x 14.5 x 4.5cm left pneumonectomy specimen. It is covered by a pink-red pleura.
There is a 2.5 cm of attached bronchus and the bronchial margin is submitted for frozen
section evaluation. The frozen section residue is submitted labeled CPS. In the anterior
segment of the upper lobe there is a 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.00m ﬁrm mass which on sectioning
Reveal light to gray—tan ﬁrm cut surfaces with focal ﬁ'iable, hemorrhagic areas. The mass
su1rounds the hilar area and grossly appears to extend to themovei‘lying pleura. The
remaining lung parenchyma is pink to red—brown andmspongy. There are several
palpable hilar lymph nodes, 0.4 to l.0cm in greatest dimension. The cut surfaces of each
are brown—black and anthracotic stained. Representative sections are submitted as
follows: Cl evascular margin, C2 thru C5 — tumor with overlying inked pleura, C6 thin
C7 -representative tumor sections, C8 ~ random lung sections, C9 thru C10 ~hilar lymph
nodes.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: CFS — NEGATIVE BRONCHIAL MARGIN.

D) Labeled #4, "level V lymph node". Received fresh are three brown-black anthracotic
stained lymph nodes, 0.4 to 1.2cm in greatest dimension. They are submitted in toto
labeled D.

E) Labeled #5, "level VII lymph node". Received fresh is a 2.0 X 1.0 X 0.60m yellow—tan
lobulated fragment of adipose tissue which contains several red—black palpable lymph

 

nodes, 0.8 to 1.80m in greatest dimension. Representative sections of each lymph node is
submitted labeled E.

Final Diagnosis:

DIAGNOSIS:

A) LEVEL 9 NODE:

- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/1).

B) LEVEL 10 NODE:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/1).

C) LEFT LUNG:

- GRADE II-III SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA OF THE LUNG INVOLVING THE
PLEURA AND

FOCALLY TO THE INKED PLEURAL MARGIN (SLIDE C3).

- NEGATIVE VASCULAR AND BRONCHIAL MARGINS OF RESECTION.

- SIX LYMPH NODES, ALL NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/6).

D) LEVEL V LYMPH NODES:
— THREE LYMPH NODES, ALL NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/3).

E) LEVEL VII LYMPH NODE:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/1).
