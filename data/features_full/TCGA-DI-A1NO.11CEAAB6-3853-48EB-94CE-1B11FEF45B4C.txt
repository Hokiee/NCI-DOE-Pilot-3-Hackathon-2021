COMMENT

In part (B), extensive cautery and frozen artifact precluded definitive diagnosis at the time of frozen section. The frozen tissue was
reprocessed and shows no evidence of metastasis. The foci in the deep cervical stroma do not appear to represent direct
extension from the endometrial tumor; it is possible that this focus represents lymphatic spread. The endocervical glands and
upper two-thirds of the cervical stroma are not involved by carcinoma. In part F, there is a single, detached and distorted group of
e lioid cells in one section. Additional studies to better characterize this cell group are in progress; results will be reported as
ar dendum.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT UTERINE FIBROID — Gray—white tissue (7.0 x 5.0 x 4.5 cm) without hemorrhage or necrosis representatively sampled in
A1 -A5. .

(B) BLADDER PERITONEUM - Tan tissue (1.8 x 1.8 x 1.7 cm) with a firm, tan-white, poorly circumscribed nodule (0.4 cm) entirely
frozen in B1 and 82.

*FS/DX: LEIOMYOMA ENDOSALPINGIOSIS. FOCAL ENDOMETRIOSIS, AND FOCl SUSPICIOUS FOR METASTATIC
ADENOCARCINOMA. v
(C) UTERUS, TUBES AND OVARIES - A uterus and cervix (13.0 x 9.0 x 6.0 cm) with attached unremarkable ovaries (each 3.5 x
2.0 x 1.5 cm) and unremarkable fallopian tubes (each 10.0 x 0.5 cm).

The endometrium has a firm, solid mass (6.5 x 6.5 x 6.0 cm) with areas of necrosis that invades into the outer third of the
myometrium (to within 2.0 mm of the uterine serosa). The uterine serosa has two roughened areas (each 2.0 x 2.5 cm). The
tumor does not extend into the lower uterine segment, and the cervix is grossly unremarkable.

The myometrium has multiple white firm nodules (0.5 to 5.5 cm) without hemorrhage or necrosis.
