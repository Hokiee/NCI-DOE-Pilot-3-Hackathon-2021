lobe.

D: Brain. right front - deep tumor excision biopsy
E: Brain. right frontal tumor, excision biopsy
Pathologic Diagnosis
A, B, C, D, E. Brain, right frontal, craniotomy:
1. Diffuse astrocytoma, consistent with anaplastlc astrocytoma. WHO grade 3
2. Negative for codeletlon of chromosomal arms 1p and 19q
3. Positive for mutant lDH1-R132H protein by immunostain
4. Kl-GTI MlB-1 proliferation index: up to approximately 10%
See comment.
Comment
This diffuse astrocytoma has readily identiﬁable mitoses, consistent with anaplastic astrocytoma. WHO
grade 3.
Abnormal blood vessels and karyorrhectic nuclei are also identiﬁed. However, there is no deﬁnite
microvascular
proliferation and no foci of tumor necrosis.
Pre-operative radiology imaging studies report nodular areas of contrast-enhancement in the periphery of
this
neoplasm. The possibility of these biopsies representing peripheral regions of a glioblastoma cannot be
excluded.
The histological ﬁndings may be correlated with clinical and radiology imaging features for the ﬁnal
clinicopathological
interpretation.

Procedures/Addenda
Loss of Heterozygosity 1p, 19q Assay (LOH)
Date Ordered: Date Reported:
Interpretation
NEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1p and chromosome arm 19q is NOT detected.
informative loci are: D1 S552, D1 S468. 0181612, D1 8496, D195219, 0198606 and 01981182
Results-Comments

Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor parafﬁn block (A2). DNA extracted
from a
corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)! Tumor DNA
pairs using 3
markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1p are 018548. 0181592, and 018552 (with D1 S468.
D1 $1612. and
Di S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D198219. 0193412, and PLAZG4C (with
0193606 and
D1981182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLAZG4C which is a
minisatellite (26
nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size. and
ease of
interpretation. The backup markers are used if the ﬁrst line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or
otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical ﬁnding in oligodendrogliomas with 1p and 19q deletion.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand-alone diagnostic
test. This test
was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLIA ’ 88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for speciﬁc uses by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in the context of established
procedures
and/or diagnostic criteria.
TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in the sample may preclude the
detection of
allelic loss.
