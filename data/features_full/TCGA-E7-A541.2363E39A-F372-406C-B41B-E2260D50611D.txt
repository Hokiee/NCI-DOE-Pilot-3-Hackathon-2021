Gross Description: Piece of radical cystectomy with a whitish, solid, and vegetative tumor developed at

the level of the right hemibladder

Microscopic Description: Histological aspect: urothelial carcinoma, GS, poorly differentiated,with
alveolar and papillary pattern, unevenly invasive into the chorion and into the deep and superficial
musculature, but without surpassing it; with an important inflammatory infiltrate arranged as lymphoid
aggregates, which limits the tumoral invasion hotbeds; the urethral lining with preserved architecture to
the level of the surgical segment; prostate with small tumoral hotbeds of acinar adenocarcinoma with
infiltrative glandular pattern at the level of one of the lobes; seminal vesicles - morphologically
undamaged.

2. Group of four lymph nodes without tumoral metastases.

3. Lymph nodes with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, without tumoral metastases.
4. Two small histotypic lymph nodes.

5. Small segment of ureter with slightly dilated lumen.

6. Small segment of ureter with dilated lumen and non-specific inflammatory infiltrate diffusely
distributed into the chorion.

Diagnosis Details: CONCLUSION: 1. Invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, poorly differentiated,
63, pTZb pNo pr.

2. Acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate, histological score Gleason 6 (3+3), pT2a pNx pr.

Additional pathologic findings: The path report doesn't specify the tumor size. For bladder cancer the T
grade is given by the level of tumor extension in through the wall not the tumor size. 50, tumor size is
not relevant for the pathologist and he/she doesn’t always record its dimensions.
