Clinicel Diagnosis 5 History:
Left sided ebdominel mess found after experiencing fatigue and weight loss.

Specimens Submitted:

1: SP: Spleen

2: SP: Redicel resection of left retroperitoneel sarcoma and left kidney,
adrenal and left colon

3: SP: End of sigmoid colon

DIAGNOSIS:
1) SPLEEN, SPLENECTOMY:

SPLEEN WITH SCATTERED GRANULOMAS/LIPOGRANULOMAS.
ACID-FAST AND GNS STAINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR MICROORGANISMS.

a

2) SOFT TISSUE, LEFT KIDNEY ADRENAL AND LEFT COLON, RESECTION:

- DEDIEFERENTIATED LIPOSARCOMA; MOST OF THE TUMOR CONSISTS 0? WELL

DIPFERENTIATED SCLEROSING, INELAMMATORY, AND LIPOMA—LIKE WELL DIFFERENTIATED
LIPOSARCOMA, BUT HYPERCELLULAR AREAS WITH ASSOCIATED MITOTIC ACTIVITY AND
NECROSIS (E.G. SECTIONS 15 AND 19) ARE ALSO PRESENT.
- TUMOR MEASURES 22 CM GREATEST DIMENSION, INVOLVES PIEROADIPOSE TISSUE,
SHOWS ABOUT 30% NECROSIS (GROSS ESTIMATE), AND COMES WITHIN 0.1 CM 0? INRED
SOFT TISSUE MARGIN.

- KIDNEY, ADRENAL GLAND AND COLON WITH NO SIGNIFICANT ABNORMALITY.

- IMMUNOSTAINS FOR CDK4 AND MDMZ ARE POSITIVE.

3) COLON, END OF SIGMOID, RESECTION:
- SEGMENT OP COLON, NO TUMOR SEEN.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF

THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

Gross Description:

1). The specimen is received fresh. labeled 'spleen' and consists of a
segment of spleen weighing 190 grams and measuring 10.0 x 6.0 x 4.5 cm.
There is an attached portion of hilar fat measuring 8.0 x 4.3 x 4.0 cm.
Serial sections reveal no gross lesion. Representative sections are
submitted.

Summary of sections:
5 spleen
SH spleen with hilar fat

2). The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "radical resection of
left retroperitoneal sarcoma with left kidney, adrenal and left colon“ and
consists of a kidney with attached ureter and vessels, adrenal gland, a
portion of left colon, and a soft tissue mass. The portion of colon
measures 35 x 4 cm and appears unremarkable. The attached kidney measures
9 x 7 x 6 cm and appears unremarkable with a well—defined corticomedullary
junction. The attached adrenal gland measures 5 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm and appears
unremarkable. The colon, kidney, and adrenal gland are not involved by
tumor. In the attached mesentery there is an encapsulated soft tissue mass
which measures 22 x 21 x 15 cm. The mass appears to be encapsulated and
involves adjacent fibroadipose tissue. The mass does not involve adjacent
structures. The external surface of the mass is inked black. Serial
sectioning reveals a white tan, firm, slightly gelatinous cut surface with a

central cavity of necrosis and hemorrhage spanning a diameter of 10.0 cm.
The tumor is approximately 30% necrotic. The remainder of the soft tissue
mass is fairly homogeneous. A photograph has been taken. A portion of the
tumor is submitted for TPS. Representatively submitted.

Summary of sections:

PCI - proximal colonic margin
DCM — distal colonic margin

UVN - ureteral and vessel margins
NC - normal colon

NA - normal adrenal

NR - normal kidney

T- tumor

3.) The specimen is received in formalin and is labeled "End of sigmoid
colon" and consists of a 2.5 cm in length by 1.6 cm in diameter portion of
sigmoid colon with attached focally hemorrhagic pericolic fat. The serosal
surface is glistening, smooth tan-white and is inked in black. Bowel shows
glistening, tan-pink plicated mucosa and a slightly thickened muscularis, up
to 0.6 cm in maximum thickness. Representative sections are submitted.
