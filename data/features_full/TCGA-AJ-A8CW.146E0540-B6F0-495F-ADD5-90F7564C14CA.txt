SPECIMEN DATA

   

V cRoss DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in nine containers labeled with the patients name

Container A is additionally labeled "#1“, and contains a 24 x 2.3 x 0.7 cm yellow-tan lobulated awry received with attache paraovarian soft tissue.
Sections through the paraovarian soft tissue reveal a ﬁbrcvascular cut surface. Discrete segment of fallopian tube is not identified. The ovary is
sectioned to reveal a yellow-gray ﬁrm ﬁbrous cut smfaoe. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes A1—A4 labels ' designated as
follows: A1: Paraovarlan soft tissue for possible fallopian tube capture; A2-A4: Entire ovary.

Container B is additionally labeied “left tube and ovary", and contains a 3.0 x 2.0 x 0.7_ cm yellow—tan Iobulated ovary received with attached paraovarian
soft tissue. Sectioning reveals a yellow—tan ﬁhmvaenular cut surface. A discrete segment of fallopian tube is not identified. Representative sections are
submitted in cassettes 81—84 labeled . designated as follows: BlvB2: Paraovarian soft tissue for possible fallopian tube capture; 33-84:
Ovary, entirely.

Container C is additionally labeled “#3". and contains a 501.1 gm uterus with attached cervix The 11.0 cm in length by 11.0 by 9.0 cm distorted uterine
corpus is surfaced by a pinkvtan aerosol. The 4.0 cm in length by 4.5 by 4.5 cm merino cervix is partially surfaced by a pink-tan glistening ectocervlcal
mucosa and features a central 1.4 cm patentos. The right and left parametrial soft tissues are inked and taken on face. The endocervlcai canal is
yellow-tan focally cystic and mucoid. A 1.8 x it} x 0.5 cm pink-tan polypoid lesionis located within the endocervioal canal. On section. no areas of
invasion are identified. The endometrlum is lined by a yellowish fungating friable mass, 5.5 x 5.0 x 4.5 an. No nonnat—eppearingendometrium is
identiﬁed. On section, this mass extends i .5 cm into a 3.5 cm thick pink—tan-ﬁbrous myomelriurn. Within the myometrium are multiple well-
cb'oumscribed ﬁrm rubbery nodules ranging from 1.0 up to 4.5 cm in greatest dimension. They feature gray-white whorted and bulging cut surfaces with
no evidence of hemorrhage or necrosis. Two nodules are focally calciﬁed. No additional myornetnal nodules or lesions are identiﬁed. A section is
submitted for frozen section with the residual entirely resubmitted for permanent section in cassette Ct labeled glditional representative
sections are submitted in cassettesCZ-CtB designated as follows: 02 Right parametrium, on face; 63: Leﬂ parentemum, on face; C4: Anterior
endolectocervix; <35: Posterior endolectocervir. 06: Endocervical polyp; 07: Anterior lower uterine segment; 08: Fastener lower uterine segment; CS
010: Full-thickness anterior endolmyometrium to include meets. bisectedtnotched thins the join}, (:1 t—Cf 2: Full-thicimess anterior endo/myometrium to
include mass bisected (notch thins the join); 3134214: Full—mickness posterior endolmyometrium to include mass, bisected (notch thins the join); 81 5—
816: Full-thickness posterior endolmyometrium to include mass, bisected (notch thins the join); 0174318; Whorled nodules. Additionally. a yellow,
green and blue cassette for genomios research, each labeled

Container D is additionally labeled ”right peraaorlic", and contains a 1.5 _x 1.5 x 0.4 cm yellow-tan tibmfatty son tissue. On palpation. a possible 0.6 cm
ﬁrm fatty lymph nodes is identiﬁed. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette D labeled ‘ M ,i ,
Container E is additionally labeled “right external lilac and Gunmen”, and contains a 7.8 x 7.5 x 25 cm aggregate of yellowish ﬁbrofatty soft tissue. On
palpation, multiple firm Wonsslh’e Wit nodes are identiﬁed ranging from 0.3 up to 2.6 cm in greatest dimension. They are entirety submitted in
cassettes E1 -E7 labele'. esignated as follows: 51: Three whole possible lymph nodes; E2-E4: Two whole possible bisected lymph
nodes in each cassette; E5: One whole possible lymph node; E6437: One whole possible trisected lymph node.

Container F is additionally labeled “right obiurator“. and contains a, 5.6 x 4.0 x 2.4 cm aggregate of yellowish fibrotatty ‘soft tissue. On palpation. four
ﬁrm fatty possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging from 0.2 up to 4.0 cm in greatest dimension. The largest nodule is sectioned to reveal a red
hemorrhagic cutsuriare with multiple gray-white nodules possibly consistent with butter. All possible lymph nodes are submitted in cassettes Fl-FS
labeled .\ designated as follows: Fl ; Two whole possible lymph nodes; F2: One whole possible bisected lymph node; F3-FB: Largest,
possibly ".iuweo lymph node, serially sectioned.

Container 6 is additionally labeled "left external iliac". and contains a 6.4 x 4.7 ‘x 2.0 cm aggregate of yellowtan ﬁbrofalty soft tissue. On palpation.
mulbpie ﬁrm fatty possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging from 0.2 up to 20 omin greatest dimension. They are entirely submitted in cassettes Gl-
G4 labeled ignated as follows: 61: Six whole possible lymph nodes; G2—G4: One whole possible bisected lymph node in each
cassette. ._ , .

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Container H is additionaliy iabeied "left obturatof‘, and contains a 4.0 x 3.0 x 1.8 cm yellow-tan ﬁbtofmty soft tissue. On paipatim, four ﬁrm faity
gossibie lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging from 1.3 up to 28 cm in greatest d’mension. They are entirely submitted is: cassettes H1-H3 iabeieci
' signated as foiiows: H1: Two whole possibie bisected iymph nodes (one inked); H2-H3: One whole possﬂaie bisected iymph node in

each ca....W.

Container i is additionally iabeied ”#9", and contains a 15.8 x 10.5 x 4.0 cm yellow-tan ﬁneiy tabulated ﬁbmfatty soft tissue. On section and paipation,
