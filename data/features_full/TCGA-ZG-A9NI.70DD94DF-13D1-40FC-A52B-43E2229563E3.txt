Gross description:

1. (Prostate gland): Prostate gland: Weight: 62 9, Volume: 57 ml, Size: 4.5 x 6 x 5 cm. Adherent
seminal vesicles and deferent duct: right side: 2.5 cm, left side: 3 cm. Apical periurethral a funnel
shaped 1 x 1 cm tissue defect marked with red ink. Total of the cross sections: 2 cm.

2. (Lymph nodes, right side): 7 x 4.5 x 2 cm measuring adipose tissue containing 2 nodes measuring
up to 4.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm.

3. (Lymph nodes, left side): 6 x 5 x 2 cm measuring adipose tissue containing 4 nodes measuring up
to 3.5 x 2.5 x 1 cm.

Microscopy:

1. Apex right and left: Right 12 tissue blocks, left 14 tissue blocks (total 26 tissue blocks). 3 cross
sections: Right 12 tissue blocks, left 12 tissue blocks (total 24 tissue blocks). Basis right and left: Right
13 tissue blocks, left 14 tissue blocks (total 27 tissue blocks). Seminal vesicles right and left: Right 2
tissue blocks, left 2 tissue blocks (total 4 tissue blocks). Deferent ducts right and left: Right 1 tissue

block. left 1 tissue block (total 2 tissue blocks). IZOD-o ‘3
2. Frozen lymph nodes right: 12 tissue blocks. WWW) NOS ?/‘/0/6

3. Frozen lymph nodes left: 15 tissue blocks. 6’ (111,! Vb 5:! AIDS a Q I 9
Diagnosis: 9%) I) 2.51/9

1. (Prostate gland): Poorly differentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason 5+4=9, (Gleason 5: 70%.
Gleason 4: 25%, Gleason 3: 5%). Tumor involves both lobes with the main focus on the right side.
Maximum tumor diameter: 43 mm. Perineural invasion. Tumor inﬁltration into pert-prostatic adipose
tissue in 4 tissue blocks. thereof 2 adjacent blocks around the right seminal vesicle (maximum
invasion length 4 mm, maximal invasion depth 3.7 mm). Tumor inﬁltration into the right seminal
vesicle. Positive surgical margin in 8 blocks, thereof 2 adjacent blocks with the main focus in the right
base (contact area 8 x 4 mm; Gleason 5 and 4). Tumor-free pert-urethral resection margin.

Remaining prostatic tissue with small foci of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (high grade PIN) and
signs of myoglandular hyperplasia of the prostate. Urothelium of the prostatic urethra without
dysplasia. Tumor-free left seminal vesicle and deferent ducts.

2. (Lymph nodes, right side): Fifteen tumor-free lymph nodes (0/15).
3. (Lymph nodes, left side): Six tumor-free lymph nodes (0/6).

Tumor classiﬁcation

(in consideration of the intraoperative frozen-section, parallel report and immunohistochemical
analyses):

pT3b. Gleason 5+4=9 (Gleason 5: 70%, Gleason 4: 25%, Gleason 3: 5%). maximum tumor diameter:
43 mm, tumor volume approx. 15.7 ml (Gleason 5: 11.0 ml, Gleason 4: 3.9 ml, Gleason 3: 0.8 ml),
pNO (0/21), LO. V0, R1

Comments:

Positive surgical margin in tissue blocks AR4B, BR1C, BR2C. BR4A, BLGC, SBR1. SBR2 and SBL2.

Tumor inﬁltration into the right seminal vesicle in tissue blocks BR1C, SBR1 and SBR2.
Tumor inﬁltration into pert-prostatic adipose tissue in tissue blocks BR3B, SBR1 and SBR2 and SBL2.

The preceding intraoperative frozen section of the sample “pelvic wall" showed tumor-free ﬁbro—
muscular tissue.

The parallel sample showed tumor-free pre-prostatic fat tissue.

lmmunohistochemical analyses (AE1IAE3) performed on 5 lymph nodes (tissue blocks 2A, 2B, 20.
2E, 3A, 3B, 3C, SD, 3E, 3F, 3K) did not reveal any metastases.

lmmunohistochemical analyses (DZ—40, C031) on tissue blocks SBR1 and SBR2 revealed no
lymphatic invasion or venous invasion.

One macroscopic image for tumor mapping.
