GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. FAT OVERLYING TUMOR

Received in formalin labeled with the patient’s identiﬁcation and ‘fat overlying tumor’ is a tan yellow
fragment of ﬁbrofatty tissue 14 x 4 x 3cm. Dissection reveals unremarkable adipose tissue.
Representatively submitted in A1-A3.

B. LEFT KIDNEY TUMOR BASE ? CA.

Received fresh for frozen section labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and ‘left kidney tumor base?
CA' is a tan pink soft tissue fragment 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1cm. A touch prep is taken. Toto FSB.

C. LEFT KIDNEY TUMOR

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and ‘left kidney tumor’ is an oriented 3209, 9 x
6.5 x 6cm partial nephrectomy specimen with attached peri—nephric adipose tissue 8 x 6 x 3cm. The
capsule is tan pink. smooth, intact and inked black. The 8 x 60m resection margin is inked green. The
most deep surgical resection margin is designated by the surgeon and inked blue. The specimen is
serially sectioned perpendicular to the resection margin to reveal a 9 x 6 x 4.5cm yellow-red, partially
necrotic mass, abutting the deep resection margin and the capsule. Gross photographs are taken. A
portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. The peri-nephric adipose tissue is serially
sectioned. The mass grossly appears to be conﬁned to the kidney. Representatively submitted:
C1-C2: deepest resection margin

C3-C8: mass

C9-C10: peri-nephric adipose tissue

CLINICAL HISTORY:
None Given

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left kidney tumor.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION:

FSB-TPB: Left kidney tumor base ? CA— Suspicious for oncocytic neoplasm. Dr. has review this case
and agrees with the diagnosis and interpretation. Diagnosis called to Dr. at by Dr.
