GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A: The specimen is received fresh and submitted in formalin. The specimen
consists of a 1441 g lobe of liver measuring 17.0 x 17.4 x 9.8 cm. The surface
of the specimen is smooth with a concave appearing neoplasm infiltrating the
surface of the specimen. This area measures 9.8 x 9.0 cm. This is white in
appearance and slightly necrotic. Surrounding this neoplasm on the surface is
a rim of hemorrhagic area. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal that
this neoplasm is somewhat well circumscribed and measures 13.0 x 11.8 x 8.0
cm. This neoplasm has a homogeneous white/tan appearance. There is some slight
central necrosis. This neoplasm comes to within 0.7 cm of the surgical
resection margin, which has been painted black. Adjacent to this neoplasm is
another well circumscribed white/tan neoplasm measuring 1.4 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm. It
is located 1.0 cm from the largest neoplasm and also 1.0 cm from the resection
margin. Also identified attached to the surface of the specimen is a fibrous
cystic structure measuring 2.0 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm, which is open and contains what
appears to be green bile with an inner mucosal surface.

HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

Division Head:
Inquiry Numbers:

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

Please note the an"tions of the tumor and normal portions of liver are taken
for , Tumor Bank.

Summary of sections:
A1 to A8 - Representative sections of the neoplasm including closest points of
invasion to resection margin and surface of the liver capsule.

A9 - Representative section of gallbladder. Portion of tissue attached tot he
liver.

A10 — Representative section of the smaller above described nodule in closest
point of invasion to the resection margin.

A11 — Representative section of normal—appearing liver parenchyma.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
Sections show infiltrative carcinoma with morphologic features of
hepatocellular carcinoma. The overall patterns are a combination of
trabecular and pseudoglandular. The nuclei are slightly enlarged and mildly
pleomorphic, however, the cells still have abundant cytoplasm. This would
correspond to a tumor grade of 2. One large nodule is present measuring 9.8
cm in maximum dimension. The gross appearance would correspond to the diffuse
type. The tumor is 0.7 cm from the nearest surgical resection margin. There
is moderate fibrosis within the tumor. Angiolymphatic invasion is not
identified in these sections. Mitotic rate is 6/10 HPF. The non—malignant
liver is unremarkable. One regional lymph node and the gallbladder are also
unremarkable.
