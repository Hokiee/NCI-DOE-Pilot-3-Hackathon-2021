lntemgtalion

A Val55QGly mutation in exon 11 of the KIT gene is present in this sample using PCR and bi-directional sequencing
analysis. There is no evidence for the presence of a PDGFRA mutation.

DNA was extracted from parafﬁn embedded soft tissue: esophageal margin 08, part 6, block X, and ampliﬁed using
primers speciﬁc for exons 9, 11, 13 and 17 of the KIT gene ,, and exons 12 and 18 of the PDGFRA gene
.- The PCR products were puriﬁed, sequenced and then compared with the NCBI reference sequence '

The presence of an X06182.1:c.1676T>G (p.Val559C-.‘ily) mutation in exon 11 of the KIT gene was detected by PCR and
sequencing. No mutation was detected in exons 12 and 18 of the PDGFRA gene. A polymorphism,
‘ ‘ , in the PDGFRA gene was also identiﬁed in this patient.

The lower limit of mutation detection by sequencing is 10-15%.
This analysis is based on our current knowledge of the KIT or PDGFRA activating mutations and their association with

GlSTs. Demonstration of a mutation in the KIT or PDGFRA gene supports the diagnosis of GIST and predicts response to
Imatinib. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by ‘
