THIS REPORT.

 

1). The specimen in received fresh for frozen section consultation. labeled
“Pars aortic avonuitia“ and consists of two fragments of soft tissue
measuring 0.4 cm and 0.5 cm in greatest dimension, which are entirely

submitted for frozen auction canaultatian-

2). The spaciman is received fresh, labeled, “left lower lobe lung“. It
consists of a 16.0 x 13.5 x 4.8 cm lung lobe with attached bronchus anﬁ
blood vessels, which weighn 2&4 gm. There is no stapled margin. The
attached bronchus measures 1.0 cm in length by 1.1 cm in diameter. Theta is
a 5.0 x 2.0 cm surgical defect on the anterior aspect. The pleural surface
shows multiple areas of fibrous adhesiuns. Tha pleural surface is inked
black. Burial sectioning reveals a 2.3 x 2.2 x 2.9 cm whita-tan, atallata
tumor. The tumor is ill-definga. Tha tumor is situated in the mid lung
paranchyma. located 2.2 cm fram the bronchial margin. The tumor is within
the parenchyma 1.2 cm from the pleura. The tumor greSﬂly does not involve
the branchus without causing bronchial obstruction. The bronchial mucosa is
smooth and glistening. There are no satellite lesions. Peribronchial
anthracotic lymph nodas are identiﬁiad and auhmittad. The uninvolved lung
parunchyma is unremarkable. The bronchial margin and a representative
saction at humor wane sent for frozen section. Representative sections
including the entire tumor are submitted. TPS is aubmitted. Photogra9hs are
taken.
