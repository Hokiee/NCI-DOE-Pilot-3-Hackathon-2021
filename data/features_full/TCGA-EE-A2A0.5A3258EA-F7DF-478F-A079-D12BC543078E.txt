MCROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
(Dr

 

Two specimens received.

1. "LEFT GROIN CONTENTS - STAPLE UPPER". An oriented ellipse of skin and attached subcutaneous
ﬁbro fatty tissue 260 x 120 x 80mm in dentb orientated with staple marking uppe'. (The specimen was
previously sampled for tumour banking , The specimen is dissected from upper to lower. There
are several lymph nodes identiﬁed including two large nodes up to 60 and 70mm across with solid pale tan to
grey cut surface.

A & B. Large lymph node.
C & D. One bisected lymph node each.

E. Three lymph nodes.

F & G. One bisected lymph node.

H. One lymph node.

J. One lymph node.

K &L. One lymph node.

M. Representative section from the skin.
N. ?One lymph node

2, "LEFT ILIAC + OBTURAIQKLMHNQDES". An irregular piece of fatty tissue 90 x 50 x 35mm.
There are eight lymph nodes identiﬁed up to 24mm across.

A. One bisected lymph node.

B. One lymph node.

C & D. One bisected lymph node.

E-H. One bisected lymph node each.
J-L. Four sections of one lymph node.

1. "LEFT GROIN CONTENTS - STAPLE UPPER".

A total of ten lymph nodes were retrieved, of which four show complete replacement of the lymph node by
metastatic melanoma. This is characterised by large, pleomorphic epithelioid cells with variable oval nuclei
and prominent nucleoli. Numerous mitoses are seen. The cells have moderate amounts of amphophilic
cytoplasm. There are several areas of necrosis. Immunohistochemical staining shows that the tumour cells
are positive for $100, I-IMB45, and Melan A. Focal extra nodal spread is seen up to 2mm from the capsule.
The skin is unremarkable. (4/ 10).
