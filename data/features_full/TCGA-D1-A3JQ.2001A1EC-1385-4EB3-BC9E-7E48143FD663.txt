DIAGNOSIS:

A. Abdomen,_pannicu1ectomy: Skin and subcutaneous tissue, 2218.0
grams, identified gross1y.

B. Uterus, right and ieft ovaries and fa11opian tubes,
hysterectomy, and bi1atera1 saipingo—oophorectomy: FIGO grade III
(of III) endometria] adenocarcinoma, serous adenocarcinoma is
identified forming a p01 poid mass 2.9 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm, Tocated in
the anterior uterine wa1¥ and aiso extending to invoive the
posterior endometrioid surface over a 5.0 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm area
(tota1). The tumor invades 0.1 cm into the myometrium (tota1 wa11
thickness 3.2 cm). The tumor does not invo1ve the endocervix.
Lymphovascuiar space invasion is not identified. The margins are
negative for tumor. The bi1atera1 ovaries and fa110pian tubes are
not invo1ved.

C. Lymph nodes, Teft pe1vic, excision: MuitipTe (8) Tymph nodes
are negative for tumor.

D. Lymph nodes, right pe1vic,_excision: One of twenty Tymph nodes
(1 of 20) 1ymph nodes is pOSitive for metastatic adenocarCinoma.

E. omentum,_omentectomy: Fibroadipose tissue. Negative for tumor.
One (1) regiona1 1ymph node is negative for tumor.

F. Lymph nodes, right para—aortic excision: Mu1tip1e (9) 1ymph
nodes are negative or tumor.

G. Gonadal vessei, right, excision: Negative for tumor.

H. Lymph nodes, Teft para-aortic, excision: MuitipTe (11) Tymph
nodes are negative for tumor.

I. Gonada1 vesse1, ieft, excision: Foca1 invoTvement by metastatic
adenocarCinoma is identified.

J—T: Staging biopsies [cu1—de—sac, b1adder peritoneum, right coiic
