EGFR FISH analysis was manually performed and quantitatively assessed
by
analysis of a minimum of 60 cells using the EGFR SpectrumOrange and
the CEP7

EGFR FISH negative:
Disomy: < two gene copies in more than 90% of the cells

Addendum

Immunoperoxidase stain for EGFR is positive. Immunoperoxidase stain
for p16

is focally positive but negative as a surrogate marker for HPV. In—
situ

hybridization for HPV is negative.

tissue. Grossly, there is a 2.5 x 2.3 x 0.9 cm tan-white, firm,
exophytic

supraglottic tumor mainly involving the right side. Anterior
commissure,

preepiglottic soft tissue, vocal cords, and aryepiglottic folds are not
involved. The rest of the mucosa is unremarkable.

There are two possible lymph nodes attached to the left side of the
larynx

measuring in greatest dimension 1.8 cm each. Multiple possible lymph
nodes

from anterior soft tissue are identified ranging in greatest dimension
from

0.1 to .5 cm.

The tumor is entirely submitted.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in 4 parts.

Part 1 is received fresh labeled with the patient‘s name, initials
and

"right neck levels 2, 3, 4". Received is an unoriented, irregular mass
of

finely lobulated to coarsely lobulated 11 x 6 x 2 cm adipose tissue.
The

specimen is divided into 3 equal segments and designated as levels A
(finely

lobulated segment) through C. Multiple lymph nodes are identified
ranging in

size from 0.1 to 2 cm. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted.
Section code:

1A — level A -bisected lymph node

1B e level A - bisected lymph node

1C — level A — 4 possible lymph nodes
10 — level B — 2 larger lymph nodes
1E — level B — 4 lymph nodes

1F - level B - 2 bisected lymph nodes
1G — level B.— 6 smallest lymph nodes
1H - level C — 4 possible lymph nodes
1I — level C — 3 possible lymph nodes

Part 2 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials

and

"left neck—levels 2, 3, 4 (tie superior)". Received is an oriented,
irregular, 12 X 3 x 3 cm, adipose neck dissection with a single suture
designating superior. The specimen is subdivided into 3 equal segments
and

designated as levels 2 through 4. Multiple lymph nodes are identified
ranging

in size from 0.2 to 2.6 cm in greatest dimension. Several of the
larger lymph

nodes within level 2 appear suspicious. The lymph nodes are entirely
submitted.

Section code:

2A - 2C — level 2 — trisected largest lymph node

20 — level 2-bisected lymph node

2E - level 2—two bisected lymph nodes (one LN inked blue)

2F — level 2- two possible smaller lymph nodes

2G — level 3—bisected lymph node

2H — level 3-bisected lymph node

21 - level 3—four possible lymph nodes

2J - level 3-three smaller possible lymph nodes

2K — level 4- four possible lymph nodes

2L — level 4—five possible lymph nodes

2M — level 4-seven minute possible lymph nodes

Part 3 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials

and

"larynx". It consists of a total laryngectomy measuring 11.5 x 8.0 x
7.0 cm

with attached hyoid bone, skin (4.0 x 3.5 cm) with a tracheostomy site,
and

fibroadipose tissue with multiple lymph nodes attached the anterior
