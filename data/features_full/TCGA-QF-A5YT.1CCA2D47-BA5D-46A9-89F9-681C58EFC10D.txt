Pertinent Clinical Information

(A) -year-old with endometrial cancer.

(B—C) year-old G0 with FIGO Grade 1 endometrioid endometrial
adenocarcinoma.

Gross Description
Specimen Material: A— Uterus, cervix, B- Left tube and ovary, C- Right tube
and ovary.

The case is received in three parts each labeled with the patient's name,
medical record number and given accession number

and it is accompanied by a requisition form labeled with the same name
and same accession number.

Part A: Received fresh labeled "UTERUS, CERVIX" is a 119 gram, 5.5 from
cornu to cornu, 6.5 from superior to inferior, and 4.0 from anterior to
posterior uterus without adnexa. There is an attached 2.5 x 3 cm cervix

with a circular as exuding tan-white, soﬁ tissue/material. The serosa is
tan-red, smooth and glistening. The specimen is inked as follows:

Anterior serosa blue

Posterior serosa black and bivalved to reveal a tan-white lush endometrium
that measures from 0.3 to 0.9 cm in greatest thickness.

Part A: There is a 2 x 1.5 cm tan-white exophytic mass in the anterior lower
uterine segment. The endometrial cavity is sectioned longitudinally to
reveal a tan-white, trabeculated myometrium that is 2.5 cm in greatest
thickness. Also present is a 0.8 x 0.7 cm intramural, tan-white, whorled

ﬁbrous nodule and a 0.8 x 0.4 tan-white, whorled ﬁbrous subendometrial
nodule located in the fundus. A frozen section is performed and
representative sections are submitted as follows in cassettes:

FSAl: representative section of exophytic mass and anterior lower uterine
segment

A2-A6: longitudinal full thickness section of the anterior fundus to
cervix, area of deepest visible gross invasion

A7 -A26: entire endometrium of anterior uterus with anterior cervix

A27 : posterior cervix

A28—A45: posterior endometrium in its entirety

A3 5-A39: longitudinal full thickness section of the fundus to cervix

on the side with the visible deepest

invasion to include the posterior cervix in cassette 27, to

include the subendometrial

nodule in cassette 35

A41: endomyometrium to include intramural nodule

Part B: Received in formalin labeled "LEFT TUBE AND OVARY" is a 4.5 cm in
length and 0.8 cm in diameter ﬁmbriated fallopian tube with a tan-pink to
red-brown hemorrhagic smooth and glistening surface. Attached is a 2.5 x

1.5 x 0.7 cm ovary with a tan-white lobulated surface. The fallopian tube

is serially sectioned to reveal a pinpoint to stellate lumen. The ovary is

serially sectioned to reveal a 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm unilocular cyst. The

remaining ovarian parenchyma is tan-white— to pink, variegated and smooth.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:
Bl: representative sections of fallopian tube
B2-B3: representative sections of ovary

Part C: Received in formalin labeled "RIGHT TUBE AND OVARY" is a 4.8 cm in
length and 0.6 cm in diameter tortuous ﬁmbriated fallopian tube with a

surface that is tan-pink to red-brown and hemorrhagic. Attached is a 2.3 x

1.5 x 0.5 cm previously disrupted ovary with a tan-white lobulated surface.

The fallopian tube is serially sectioned to reveal a pinpoint to stellate

lumen. The ovary is serially sectioned to reveal few corpora albicantia and

a tan-yellow to tan-pink variegated smooth surface.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:
C l: representative sections of fallopian tube
C2: representative sections of ovary
