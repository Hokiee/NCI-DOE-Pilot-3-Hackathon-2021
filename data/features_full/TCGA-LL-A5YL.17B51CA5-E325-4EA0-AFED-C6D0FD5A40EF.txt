GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is submitted in five containers.

A. The first specimen submitted in the fresh state is labeled ”right breast tissue”. The
specimen is the right breast. total mastectomy specimen. Suture marks the axillary tail of
the breast. There is an ellipse of white skin containing the nipple. This measures 9 x 4.5
cm The breast itself measures 23 x 22.5 x 6.5 cm. There is a firm mass palpable beneath
the surface at approximately the 11 o’clock position. The overlying superficial margin
adjacent to the skin is marked with black ink and the deep margin beneath this is marked
with blue ink. On cut section the mass measures approximately 4.5 x 3 x 3 cm. The edges
are quite difficult to discern and are more easily palpated than visualized. In the center
of the specimen there is a small focus of hemorrhage consistent with previous biopsy. A
portion of this mass is set aside for tissue banking per protocol. The mass extends to
within approximately 1 cm of the overlying superficial margin at approximately 11 o‘clock
at its closest point. It is located well above the deep margin which is approximately 7 cm
beneath the mass. Cut sections through the remainder of the breast tissue reveals some
rubbery white parenchymal breast tissue and abundant yellow fat. There are no other
nodules or mass is identified. Sections are submitted as follows:

A1 — nipple

A2~5 — mass in breast

A6 — mass in breast with adjacent tissue
A7—9 _ non—neoplastic appearing breast tissue

B. The second specimen is received in the fresh state in the operating room and represents
two axillary lymph nodes. one measuring 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm and the other measuring 1 x 0.7 x
0.7 cm. The cut sections are hard. A section Of each is examined by frozen section.

These are submitted in block Bl. frozen section control. Additional section of each is
submitted in block BZ.

C. The third specimen initially in the fresh state is labeled "sentinel node #1“ and is a
piece of yellow fat measuring 2.5 X 2 x 1 cm with a 1 cm round moderately firm lymph node
which is bisected and submitted in toto in block C1.

D. The fourth specimen is labeled "level 3 axillary nodes“, The specimen is a piece of
yellow fatty tissue measuring 9 x 3 x 1.5 cm with a suture marking the highest level 3
lymph node. There are five additional small lymph nodes. The highest node is submitted in
block D1 and the other five lymph nodes are submitted in block D2.

E. The fifth container is labeled “right axillary contents". The specimen is yellow fatty
tissue measuring 10 x 9 x 2.5 cm. Within the fatty tissue are several nodules consistent
with lymph nodes. The largest of these measures 2 cm in diameter and on cut section is
partially replaced by very hard white tissue. A section of each node is submitted in
blocks El through Ea.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The slides are examined and evaluated.
