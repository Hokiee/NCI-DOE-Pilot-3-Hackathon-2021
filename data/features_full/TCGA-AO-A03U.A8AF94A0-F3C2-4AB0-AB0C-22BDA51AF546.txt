1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled
"Sentinel Node #1 Level 1 Left Axilla". It consists of a lymph
node measuring 1 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. The node is bisected and
submitted entirely in one cassette.

Summary of Sections:
FSC - frozen section control

2) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled
"Sentinel Node #2 Level 1 Left Axilla". It consists of a single
piece of adipose tissue measuring 4 x 4 x 2 cm. Serial
sectioning of the specimen reveals multiple lymph nodes ranging
from 0.3 up to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes
are submitted in two cassettes.

Summary of Sections:
FSCA-B - frozen section controls A and B

3) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled
"Sentinel Node #3 Level 2 Left Axilla". It consists of a lymph
node and adipose tissue. The lymph node measures 2.2 x 1 x 0.6
cm. The node is submitted in one cassette.

Summary of Sections:
FSC — frozen section control

4) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Left Breast,

Suture Marks Axillary Tail“. It consists of a simple mastectomy

specimen measuring 22 x 22 x 5.2 cm. It has an attached ellipse

of skin measuring 19.5 x 9.7 cm with a central nipple measuring

1.0 cm in diameter and 0.4 cm in height. The skin, nipple and
areola are grossly unremarkable. The specimen is serially
sectioned to reveal in the central area, a 1.8 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm
ill-defined, firm, white nodule. The nodule is located within
2.0-cm from the closest deep margin and was seen 1.0 cm from the
nipple. The remaining breast tissue shows few areas of fibrosis.
Representative sections are submitted.

 

Summary of Sections:

T - tumor

DM - deep margin, close to tumor
U0 - upper outer quadrant

LO - lower outer quadrant

LI - lower inner quadrant

UI - upper inner quadrant

N - nipple
NB — nipple base
5 - skin

5) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right breast (suture
marks axillary tail)". It consists of a total mastectomy
specimen, 21 x 20.5 x 4.5 cm. A skin is attached inferiorly, 19
x 8 cm. A nipple is present in the center of the skin, 1.3 cm in
diameter. A black suture labeled the axillary tail is present.
The anterior aspect is inked in yellow and the posterior aspect
is inked in black. Serially sectioned identifies the fibrotic
area underneath the areola, 3.5 x 3.5 x 3 cm and another fibrotic
area with blue dye, 4.5 x 3.5 x 3 cm. No, otherwise, apparent
tumor nodule is identified. Representative sections are
submitted in 20 cassettes.

Summary of Sections:

N — nipple

S - skin

DM ~ deep margin

F — fibrotic area

D - blue dyed area

ML ~ medial lower quadrant

MU - medial upper quadrant

LL - lateral lower quadrant
LU - lateral upper quadrant

6) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Non—sentinel
Node Left Axilla'. It consists of a single piece of adipose
tissue measuring 2.5 x 2 x 1 cm. Serial sectioning of the
specimen reveals two rubbery lymph nodes measuring from 0.5 up to
1 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are submitted in one
cassette.
