SPECIMEMS) SUBMITTED: GROSS DESCRIPTION

Right kidney and fat: In formalin labeled "right kidney and perinephric fat" is a 424-gram right nephrectomy specimen to include
a 10 x TX 2.8 cm kidney with attached perinephric soft tissue and 4.5 cm of ureter. The capsular surface is gray-brown and
slightly bulging. The specimen is bivalved to reveal a 3.7 x 3.5 cm spongy tan-yellow mass within the mid region, which
approaches the renal capsule and comes to within 0.3 cm of the soft tissue margin (inked blue). The mass is locally
hemorrhagic and displays smooth-walled cystic spaces containing tan-red ﬂuid. There are additional smooth-walled cystic

pink-brown parenchyma with a well-deﬁned corticomedullary junction. The renal pelvis displays focally hemorrhagic tan-pink
urothelium. Ureteral and vascular margins appear free of tumor grossly. No adrenal gland is identiﬁed. Representative sections
are submitted in seven cassettes as follows: A - ureteral and vascular margins, B - C - mass to include the inked soft tissue
margin. D - additional section of me 55. E - ms 35 to include adjacent cystic space. F - G - renal parenchyma to include pelvis and
