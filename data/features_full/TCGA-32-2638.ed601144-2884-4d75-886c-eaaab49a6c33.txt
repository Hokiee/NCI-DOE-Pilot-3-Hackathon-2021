1. Brain tumor 661m

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS:

Brain tumor, right temporal tumor .TCGA 32 2638

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1. Received fresh for frozen section labeled with the patient's name and
“brain tumor" are three red—tan soft tissue fragments aggregating to 0.5 x 0.3
x 0.2 cm. A smear is performed with the remainder frozen on one chuck.

 

 

 

 

  

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:
EDEMA‘I‘OUS WHITE MATTER WITH REACTIVE VASCULAR CHANGES. -

The specimen is subsequently re—submitted for permanent sections.

2. Received fresh for frozen section labeled with the patient's name and
"right temporal tumor" are multiple red—tan soft tissue fragments aggregating
to 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm. A smear is performed with the remainder frozen on one
chuck.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:
GLIOBLAS‘I‘OMA. -

The specimen is subsequently rewsubmitted for permanent sections.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
1. Microscopic examination reveals cortical gray matter and underlying white
matter. The white matter appears edematous and demonstrates scattered reactive
astrocytes. The blood vessels appear thickened and many demonstrate hyalinized
walls. A definitive neoplastic population is not seen.

2. Microscopic examination reveals an infiltrating glioma. The neoplasm
appears hypercellular. The tumor cells diffusely infiltrate the brain
parenchyma. They demonstrate moderate cytologic atypia. Morphologically the
tumor cells exhibit elongated to oval nuclei with prominent fibrillary
processes. Mitotic figures are prevalent. Microvascular proliferation is
readily identified.

DIAGNOSIS:
(PROVISIONAL):

1. BRAIN TUMOR, BIOPSY AND RESECTION:
EDEMATOUS WHITE MATTER WITH REACTIVE FEATURES.

2. RIGHT TEMPORAL TUMOR, BIOPSY:
GLIOBLASTOMA. PENDING REVIEW OF ADDITIONAL SECTIONS.

ADDENDUM DISCUSSION:

ADDENDUM SPECIMEN SOURCE:
1—2. See original report.
2. Right temporal tumor — perm

ADDENDUM GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1—2. See original report.

3. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and “right temple
tumor" are multiple tan—brown soft tissue fragments admixed with blood clots
aggregating to 4.0 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned with
representative sections submitted in two cassettes.

ADDENDUM MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
1. See original report.

3. Microscopic examination reveals a diffusely infiltrating high grade glial
neoplasm. The tumor cells demonstrate moderate cytologic atypia. Occasional
cells exhibit more marked atypical features. In some areas, the tumor cells
appear spindle—like and demonstrate a sarcomatous growth pattern.
Microvascular proliferation is robust. Numerous mitotic figures are seen. The
malignant astrocytes demonstrate focal areas of perineuronal satellitosis.
Early necrosis is identified. Pseudopalisading necrosis is not seen. There is
a background of acute hemorrhage.

The neoplastic cells are immunoreactive for GFAP. They are negative for
epithelial membrane antigen. They do not demonstrate collagen production and
a permanent reticulin network is not seen. Tumor cells demonstrate patchy
nuclear positivity for MGMT, but the overall positivity rate is less than
25%. Numerous MIB—l reactive cells are present with a labeling index of
greater than 25%.

ADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS:

l. BRAIN TUMOR, BIOPSY AND RESECTION:
EDEMATOUS WHITE MATTER WITH REACTIVE FEATURES-

2, 3. TEMPORAL TUMOR, RESECTION:

ADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS:
GLIOBLASTOMA (WHO GRADE 4).
