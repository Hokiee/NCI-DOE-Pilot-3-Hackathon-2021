moderately cellular. The cells are small with minimal nuclear atypia. The
nuclei range trom round to ovoid and elongated (spindled). There are
abundant glial ﬁbres in the background. One mitosis has been tound in all
the tissue. There is no necrosis or vascular endothetiel proliferation. There
is no biphasic pattern. and no Rosenthal libres or eosinophilio granular
bodies. No perivascular lymphocytes are seen.
