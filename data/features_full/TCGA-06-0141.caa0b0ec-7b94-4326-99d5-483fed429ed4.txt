 

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:
A,B. BRAIN, LEFT OCCIPITAL, EXCISION: GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME.
ADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS: MIBHI PROLIFERATION INDEX 16%f

SEE MICROSCOPIC AND COMMENT.

Operation/Specimen: UPDATED REPORT — Craniotomy, brain.

Clinical History and Pre-Op Dx: _ith left occipital
enhancing lesion with central necrosis.

GROSS PATHOLOGY: A. Received fresh, several fragments, 1.5 cm
across, in aggregate. Soft, focally hemorrhagic, tannish—brown. In
total # 1 and 2.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, left occipital: High grade glioma
(C/W glioblastoma multiforme).

B.

SPECIMEN: Left occipital lesion — permanent.

FIXATIVE: None.

GENERAL: A 2.5 x 2.0 x .6 cm. aggregate of tan-red soft friable

brain tissue fragments and blood clot. All submitted.

SECTIONS: 3'4 — smaller fragments; X1 — largest fragment.

MICROSCOPIC: A,B. Portions of a glial neoplastic proliferation in
which the tumor cells have clear nuclear features of anapiasia. The
background is fibrillary, and contains vessels with microvascular
cellular proliferation throughout. There are also extensive areas of
tumor necrosis with necrosis and thrombosis of vessels. The necrotic
tissue focally contains numerous polymorphonuclear neutrophils. There
are mitotic figures.

Cont‘d...

COMMENT: In both specimens there is a glioblastoma multiforme. There
are extensive areas of tumor necrosis, with the presence focally of

 

 

    

polymorphonuclear neutrophils.

ADDENDUM REPORT

SPECIAL STAIN: An immunoperoxidase method for MIB—l was performed on
sections from block #1. A proliferation index of 16% was determined in
the more active areas.
