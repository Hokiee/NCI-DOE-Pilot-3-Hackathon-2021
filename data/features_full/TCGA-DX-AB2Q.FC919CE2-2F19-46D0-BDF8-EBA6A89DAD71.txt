Clinical Diagnosis E History:
with new right lower leg mess, biopsy shown to be

Wm (74$ g/zo/I L/

Specimens Submitted:
1: SP: Radical resection of right lower leg

DIAGNOSIS:
1 SOFT TISSUE, RIGHT LOWER LEG) RESECTION: -HIGH GRADE PLEOMORPHIC
SARCOMA CONSISTENT WITH MALIGNANT FIBROUS HISTIOCYTOMA.
- TUMOR ULCERATES INTO SKIN AND EXTENDS POCALLY INTO SKELETAL MUSCLE.
-TU'MOR SIZE: 9 X 8 X 4 CM
-TUMOR IS PREDOMINANTLY VIABLE WITH FOCAL NECROSIS (ABOUT 5%) .
-MARGINS OF RESECTION ARE FREE OF TUMOR. DEEP KARGIN IS 0.3 CM FROM

TUMOR AND IS LIMITED BY SKELETAL MUSCLE. ALL OTHER MARGINS ARE WIDELY
NEGATIVE.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL) I AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

Gross Description:

1). The specimen is received fresh and labeled " radical resection of right
lower leg' and consists of an oriented 15 x 14 cm round portion of skin
excised to a depth of 2.5 cm with a fungating 9 x B x 4 cm tumor extending
above the surrounding skin surface. The tumor has ulcerated the skin with a
thin fibrous capsule on the surface overlying visible tumor. There is
hemorrhagic crust also on the surface. The tumor has been oriented with a
short suture marking superior and a long suture marking 'lateral'. The
suture marking "lateral” appears to be on the deep resection surface and is
sutured to skeletal muscle. Therefore, this margin will be considered deep.

The specimen will be oriented based on the superior suture as viewed from

anterior. The specimen is inked as follows: superior red, inferior green,
lateral blue, medial orange, deep black. The closest margin is the deep
(clearance 0.5 cm). All of the skin margins are greater than 1 an away from
the tumor. The cut surface of the tumor is fleshy, pale tan-white with
scattered areas of hemorrhage. The tumor appears predominantly viable. Gross
photographs are taken. TPS is given. Representatively submitted.
