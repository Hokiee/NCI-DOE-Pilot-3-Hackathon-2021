GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen consists of a 187 g, 16.2 x 8.5 x 5.3 cm segment of liver
displaying a tan—brown, granular hepatic resection margin with
abundant amounts of metallic clips. The capsule is tan-pink to brown,
smooth to scabrous with adhered fatty soft tissue. The hepatic margin
is inked blue.

Sectioning reveals a 4.3 x 3.2 x 3.0 cm tan—yellow to brown,
well—circumscribed nodule that is 3.1 cm from the hepatic resection
margin. The well-circumscribed nodule grossly extends to the
overlying capsule and extends to include the attached fatty soft
tissue.

The remaining liver parenchyma is tan—brown and unremarkable. No
subsequent lesions are identified.

Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1—3— hepatic
resection margin closest to mass; 4—8- mass to include overlying
attached fat, capsule, and adjacent liver parenchyma; 9- uninvolved
liver parenchyma away from mass.

It should be noted that gross findings are communicated to the surgeon
for an intraoperative gross consultation. Also, a representative
portion is taken for tissue bank.

GROSS CONSULT DIAGNOSIS:

Liver, left lobe, leftlateral sectorectomy:
~ TUMOR 3.0 CM FROM MARGIN GROSSLY

MICROSCOPIC EXAM
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

LIVER MASS, LEFT LATERAL SECTOR WITH ATTACHED OMENTUM,
EN BLOC RESECTION:

- SPECIMEN TYPE: LIVER SEGMENT, EN BLOC RESECTION.

— LATERALITY: LEFT LATERAL.

< TUMOR SITE: LEFT LATERAL

- TUMOR CONFIGURATION: SINGLE FOCUS.
— TUMOR SIZE: 4.3 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION.
— HISTOLOGIC TYPE: HEPATOCELLULAR CAARCINOMA.
— HISTOLOGIC GRADE: MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED (G2).
- MARGINS
HEPATIC: NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (3 CM FROM TUMOR).
' LYMPHO-VASCULAR INVASION: IDENTIFIED.
- INVASION THROUGH THE CAPSULE AND VISCERAL
PERITONEUM INTO ADJACENT ADHERED OMENTUM WITH
HEMATOMA AND ORGANIZATTION.

PATHOLOGIC STAGING (pTN):

— PRIMARY TUMOR: pT4 DUE TO VISCERAL PERITONEUM INVASION.

ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSES:
- CAPSULAR FIBROSIS WITH ORGANIZING HEMATOMA AND ADHESIONS
EXTENDING TO ATTACHED OMENTUM (SEE ABOVE).
— CHRONIC HEPATITIS, GRADE 3, STAGE 2.

COMMENT: THE PREVIOUS BIOPSY WAS CORRELATED. THE TUMOR PEREORATES THE
CAPSULE AND THE INVASION IS NOT A FEW CELL GROUPS BUT IS MEASURES AT
LEAST 3 mm IN SIZE. THE TUMOR IS NOT SEEN AT THE INKED AREAS OF THE
ATTACHED OMENTUM.

WAS NOTIFIED OF THE GROSS LIVER PARENCHYMAL MARGINS AT THE
TIME OF THE RESECTION.
