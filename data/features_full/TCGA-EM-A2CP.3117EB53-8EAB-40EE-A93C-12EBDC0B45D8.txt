Gross Description
1.The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "thyroid: Left, stitch is superior pole"

consists of a lobe of thyroid that is oriented with a stitch. it measures 5.5 cm Si x 3.3 cm ML x 2.4
cm AP and weighs 24.9 g. The external surfaces have ﬁbrous adhesions. One surface nodule
measures 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm. The external surface is painted with liquid bluing. The lobe contains
two delineated nodules that measure 1.0 cm Si x 0.8 cm ML x 0.8 cm AP and 3.2 cm Si x 3.0 cm
ML x 2.2 cm AP. The remainder of the thyroid tissue is ﬁrm, rubbery and pale red-brown.
Sections of the larger nodule and non-nodular tissue are stored frozen. The remainder of the
specimen is submitted as follows:

1A surface nodule

lB-W lobe, superior to inferior

2. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as “right paratracheal nodes” consists of
two lymph nodes measuring 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm and 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm received in 10% buffered
formalin.

2A two lymph nodes

3. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as “left central paratracheal nodes" consists
of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 4.7 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm received in 10% buffered formalin. Multiple
lymph nodes are identified measuring from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm to 1.7 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm in diameter.
The specimen is submitted as follows:

3A—C one lymph node bisected. each block.

SD-F multiple lymph nodes, each block.

4. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "right thyroid lobe stitch superior"
consists of a right hemithyroldectomy specimen that is oriented with a stitch and weighs 9.7 g.
The lobe measures 5.0 cm Si x 2.1 cm ML x 1.3 cm AP and the isthmus measures 2.5 SI x 1.0
cm ML x 0.8 cm AP. The external surfaces have ﬁbrous adhesions. One surface nodule
measures 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm. The external surface is painted with liquid bluing. The right lobe
contains two delineated nodules that measure 2.0 cm Si x 1.6 cm ML x 1.5 cm AP and 1.0 cm Si
x 0.9 cm ML x 0.8 cm AP. The remainder of the thyroid tissue is ﬁrm, rubbery and pale red-brown.
Sections of both nodules are stored frozen. The remainder of the specimen is submitted as
follows:

4A surface nodule

4B-M lobe, superior to inferior

4N,O isthmus
