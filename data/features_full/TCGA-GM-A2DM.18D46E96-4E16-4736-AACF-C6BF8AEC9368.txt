GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) RIGHT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1, BLUE, COUNT 8 - A single ovoid, pink-tan lymph node (2.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm)
is serially sectioned and touch preps made (touch preps 1-4) and entirely submitted in cassettes A1 and A2.

'TP/DX: NO TUMOR PRESENT.
(B) RIGHT AXILLAFIY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2, BLUE, COUNT 153 - A portion of yellow fibroadipose tissue (4.0 x 2.0 x 1.0
cm) contains a single fatty, gray to white lymph node (2.8 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm). The lymph node contains a 0.4 cm white nodule. The
specimen is serially sectioned, touch preps 1-4 made and a frozen section done, submitted entirely in cassettes 82 and Bs.

‘FS/DX: NO TUMOR PRESENT. ‘3
(C) RIGHT SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY, SHORT DOUBLE STITCH SUPERIOR. LONG DOUBLE STITCH LATERAL, LONG
SINGLE STITCH DEEP - A right segmental mastectomy specimen, oriented by the surgeon, 7.8 x 6.0 x 1.5 cm. The specimen
was sectioned from superior to inferior in eight slices. Within the center of the specimen is a 2.7 x 2.5 x 1.7 cm well-circumscribed
pink-tan friable mass, located at the anterior margin, 1.3 cm from the lateral, 2.2 cm from the medial margin and 2.0 cm from the a
deep margin.
There is a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm nodular firm area in slice #6, possibly representing previous biopsy site, 0.3 cm from the
medial margin and 1.0 cm from the superficial margin. The breast tissue surrounding the mass is composed of greater than 90%
yellow adipose tissue. No additional masses are identified.
INK CODE: Blue - superior, green - inferior, yellow - anterior, black - deep, red - medial. orange - lateral.
SECTION CODE: C1, slice #4, lateral; C2, slice 4, lateral; CS, slice 4, tumor and anterior margin; C4, slice 4, deep
margin; C5, slice 4, medial margin; CG, slice 5, lateral margin; C7, slice 5, tumor and anterior margin; C8, slice 5, tumor and deep
margin; 09, slice 5, anterior; C10, slice 5, deep margin; C11, slice 6, tumor and medial margin; C12, slice 7, tumor and anterior
margin; C13, slice 7, medial/anterior margin; 014, slice 8, inferior margin; 015, slice 1, superior margin; C16, slice 3,
representative uninvolved breast tissue; C17, slice 6, 0.5 cm nodule with anterior/medial margin.
(D) EN BLOC EXCISION. ADDITIONAL SUPERIOR MARGIN AND LESION AT 9 O'CLOCK (STITCH SUPERIOR MARGIN) - A
tan-yellow fibrofatty irregular soft tissue fragment( 7.0 x 5.5 x 2.0 cm) with a suture at an edge of the specimen. The specimen is
arbitrarily oriented in the form of a clock with suture designated as 12 o'clock. The face of the clock has a fibrotic area (3.0 x 2.0
cm). The back of the clock is predominantly fatty. The specimen is serially sectioned from 3 to 9 o'clock. The fibrotic area seen
on the face of the clock extends to the 12 o'clock edge and measures 4.0 x 3.5 x 0.8 cm. The remainder of the specimen shows
fatty tissue.
INK CODE: Green - 9 to 3 o‘clock edge. Black - 3 to 9 o'clock edge. Yellow - face of the clock. Blue - back of the clock.
SECTION CODE: D1 -DSB, specimen entirely submitted from 3 to 9 o'clock.
(E) SUPERFICIAL INFERIOR MARGIN, STITCH TRUE MARGIN - A tan-yellow fatty fragment (5.0 x 4.0 x 1.7 cm) with a stitch
on one side. A 1.0 cm white firm area is present abutting the inked margin with central fat necrosis and a 0.4 cm cyst.
iNK CODE: Black - true margin.
SECTION CODE: Specimen is entirely submitted in E1 to E14.
(F) ADDITIONAL DEEP MARGIN, STITCH AT TRUE MARGIN - A tan-yellow specimen (3.5 x 2.4 x 1.8 cm) with a stitch on one ,%
side. The side with the stitch is inked black. The specimen is entirely submitted in F1 to F7. i '
(G) ADDITIONAL MEDIAL MARGIN, STITCH = TRUE MARGIN - A tan-yellow fatty specimen (4.5 x 2.5 x 1.7 cm) with stitch on
one side. The side with the stitch is inked black. The specimen is entirely submitted in 01-08.
(H) ADDITIONAL SUPERFICIAL MEDIAL MARGIN, STITCH = TRUE MARGIN - A tan-yellow fatty tissue specimen (3.5 x 2.5 x
2.0 cm) with a stitch on one side. An irregular fragment fibrotic area is present in the specimen focally abutting the inked true a a
margin. ,.
INK CODE: Black - true margin.
SECTION CODE: Specimen is entirely submitted in H1 -H8.

 

(I) ADDITIONAL SUPERFICIAL LATERAL MARGIN - A tan-yellow fatty tissue specimen (2.9 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm) with suture on one
side. The suture side is inked black. The specimen is entirely submitted in l1-l3.
(J) ADDITIONAL SUPERFICIAL INFERIOR MARGIN, STITCH = TRUE MARGIN - A tan-yellow fatty tissue specimen with focal

fibrosis (3.0 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm) with a stitch on one side. The side with the stitch is inked black. The specimen is entirely submitted in
J1 -J5.
