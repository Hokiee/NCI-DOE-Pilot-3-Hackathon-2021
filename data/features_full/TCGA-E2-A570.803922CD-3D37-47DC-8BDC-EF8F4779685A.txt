SPECIMENgSp A. SENTINEL NODE #1 RIGHT AXILLA
B. SENTINEL NODE #2 RIGHT AXILLA
C. RIGHT BREAST
D. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #3 RIGHT AXILLA
E. RIGHT BREAST SKIN

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Right breast lower inner quadrant @ 4:00 position — 2.30m invasive ductal carcinoma.

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
None Given

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION:

TPA: sentinel node #1 right axilla- Negative for carcinoma. Diagnosis called to Dr. at by
Dr.

TPBl-TPBZ: sentinel node #2 right axilla- Negative for carcinoma. Diagnosis called to
Dr. at by Dr.

DIAGNOSIS:

A. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #1, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION:
— METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE OF ONE LYMPH NODE (1/1),
MEASURING 0.05—CM (MICROMETASTASES), WITHOUT EXTRANODAL
EXTENSION, SEE NOTE.

B. LYMPH NODES, SENTINEL #2, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION:
- TWO LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/2).

C. BREAST, RIGHT, MASTECTOMY:
- INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 1, MEASURING 1.5 CM
- INTERMEDIATE NUCLEAR GRADE, DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU,
SOLID, CRIBRIFORM AND MICROPAPILLARY TYPES, WITH
MICROCALCIFICATIONS AND CENTRAL NECROSIS
- DCIS WITHIN 1 MM OF ANTERIOR INFERIOR SURGICAL MARGlN
— SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS NEGATIVE FOR INVASIVE TUMOR
- LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU
- BIOPSY SITE CHANGES WITH FIBROSIS, GRANULATION TISSUE,
AND FAT NECROSIS
- SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT.

D. LYMPH NODES, SENTINEL #3, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION:
— FOUR LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/4).

E. SKIN, LEFT BREAST, RECONSTRUCTION:
- SKIN TISSUE, NO TUMOR SEEN.

N OTE: The touch preparation of sentinel lymph node #1 is reviewed, no tumor cells
identiﬁed. Therefore, the false negativity is due to sampling variability.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. SENTINEL NODE #1 RIGHT AXILLA

Received fresh for frozen section labeled with the patient’s identiﬁcation and ‘sentinel
node #1 right axilla’ is a tan pink lymph node 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.5cm. The specimen is serially
sectioned and a touch prep is taken. Toto A1.

B. SENTINEL NODE #2 RIGHT AXILLA

Received fresh for frozen section labeled with the patient’s identiﬁcation and ‘sentinel
node #2 right axilla’ are two tan pink lymph nodes 2 x 1.2 x 0.70m and 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.30m.
The specimens are serially sectioned and two touch preps are taken.

Bl : one lymph node

B2: one lymph node

C. RIGHT BREAST

Received fresh labeled with the patient’s identiﬁcation and “right breast” is a 160g, 15 x
14 x 3.5cm oriented (stitch in axilla) simple mastectomy with attached 8 x 3cm tan brown
skin ellipse and 0.9cm everted nipple. Ink code: anterior-superior: blue, anterior-inferior:
orange, posterior-black. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 9
slices with nipple in slice 3, revealing a 2.1 x 1.6 x 1.5cm tan white ﬁrm well
circumscribed mass, 0.70m from the closest anterior-inferior margin and 1.20m from the
deep margin in the LIQ of slices 4-5. A biopsy clip is identiﬁed in the LIQ of slice 5. A
portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representatively submitted:
Cl: nipple slice 3

CZ: UOQ slice 1

C3: LOQ slice 1

C4: UOQ slice 2

C5: LOQ slice 2

C6: UC slice 3

C7: LC slice 3

C8: UIQ slice 4

C9-C10: mass LIQ with anterior-inferior margin slice 4

C11: deep margin and skin LIQ slice 4

C12: mass LIQ with anterior-inferior margin with clip ID slice 5

C13: UIQ slice 5

C14: LIQ slice 6

D. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #3 RIGHT AXILLA

Received fresh labeled with the patient’s identification and ‘sentinel node #3 right axilla’

are four tan pink lymph nodes ranging from 0.9 x 0.6 x 0.3cm to 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.50m. Toto
D1.

E. LEFT BREAST SKIN

Received in formalin labeled with the patient identiﬁcation and designated "leﬁ breast
skin" is a tan-white in fragment, 22 x 1.4 x 0.6 cm. Serial sectioning reveals no discrete
lesions. Representatively submitted in E1-E2.
