Addendum

Fluorescent in situ hybridization studies have been performed on the poorly differentiated calenic adenocercinoma. The
ratio of HER-2Ineu to the centromere of chromosome 17 Is 1.70, indicating low level HER-Zlneu amplification In the
targeted region.

HerZI'neu amplification may help in identifying those patients likely to experience shorter survival when considered-
tdgether with other major risk factors.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

PART 1: LIVER, BIOPSY -
METASTATIC MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA, CONSISTENT WITH PATIENTS COLON PRIMARY (see

comment).

PART 2: GALLBLADDER, CHOLECYSTECTOMY -
GALLBLADDER WITH CHRONIC CHOLECYSTITIS.

 

PART 3: KIDNEY RIGHT, EXCISION 0F MASS-
A. MULTIPLE RENAL CORTICAL CYSTS WITH ASSOCIATED HEMORRHAGE AND ORGANIZING HEMATOMA

8. NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.

PART 4: COLON, RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY -
A. INVASIVE POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA WITH AREAS OF MUCINOUS DIFFERENTIATION

(see comment}.

THE CARCINOMA SHOWS INVASION THROUGH MUSCULARIS PROPRIA AND INTO SEROSAL ADIPOSE
TISSUE.

METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA is PRESENT WITHIN ONE OF TEN LYMPH NODES, 4.0 CM, WITH FOCAL
EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION.

ALL EXAMINED RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR.

con/Inner]
Much of this tumor is a well differentiated adenocarcinoma, and the pericolonic lymph node metaetaeis from part 4 is of
this pattern. However, some of the deeply invasive tumor is mucinous, and this pattern is present in the liver biopsy.

Trichrome and PAS stains were performed on the liver biopsy I part 1). The trichrome stain highlights deemoplastic
fibrosis within the metastatic carcinoma. The PAS stain highlights lntracallular and extracellular mucin within the
metastatic carcinoma.
