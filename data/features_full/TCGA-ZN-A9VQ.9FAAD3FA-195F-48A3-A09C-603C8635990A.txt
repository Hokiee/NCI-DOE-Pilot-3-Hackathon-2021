O.R. CONSULTATION:
SPECIMEN LABELED "#8 PHRENIC NODULE" (FSA):
Epithelioid mesothelioma, invasive in fibrous tissue.

OR Consultation by:

The senior physician certifies that he/she personally conducted a gross and/or
microscopic examination of the described specimen(s) and rendered or confirmed
the rapid diagnos(es) related thereto.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received fresh, in nine parts, each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.

Part A, "#1. Right rib", consists of four segments of rib (12.0, 5.8, 1.2,
2.5 cm in length x an average diameter of 2.2 cm). Scant attached tan/red
skeletal muscle and tan/red fibrous tissue is present. There is no gross

evidence of involvement by tumor. A bone marrow squeeze is performed.

and

Micro A1: Bone marrow squeeze, multi frags, RSS.

Part B, "#2. Level 9", consists of four fragments of tan/red fibrous tissue,
tan/yellow adipose tissue and focally anthracotic tan/red lymph node candidates
(3.6 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm in aggregate). One fragment exhibits a firm tan/yellow cut
surface. The specimen is entirely submitted for microscopic examination.

Micro Bl-BB: Soft tissue fragments, multi frags, ESS.

Part C, "#3. Level 8", consists of a single tan/white to tan/red focally
anthracotic soft tissue fragment consistent with lymph node (1.2 x 0.8 x 0.5

cm). The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted for microscopic
examination.

Micro Cl: Soft tissue fragment, 2 frags, ESS.

Part D, "#4. Level 7", consists of six fragments of tan/white to tan/red soft
tissue with focal anthracosis, consistent with lymph node candidates (3.9 x 2.1
x 0.6 cm). The specimen is entirely submitted for microscopic examination.

Micro D1 through D2: Soft tissue fragments, multi frags, ESS.

Part E, "#5. Level 10R", consists of a single tan/red to tan/white focally
anthracotic soft tissue fragment (0.6 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm). The specimen is
entirely submitted for microscopic examination.

Part F, "#6. Diaphragm", consists of three fragments of tan/red skeletal muscle
and tan/red soft tissue focally lined by a smooth and glistening surface (5.6 x
3.5 x 1.4 cm in aggregate). Multiple (at least 10) tan/white firm nodules (up
to 0.2 cm in maximum dimension) are present on the soft tissue overlying the
skeletal muscle. No definitive involvement of skeletal muscle by tumor is
identified. Representative sections are submitted.

Micro F1 through F2: Representative sections of soft tissue and skeletal
muscle, 3 frags each, RSS.

Part G, “#7. Visceral and parietal pleura", consists of a 388.0 gram aggregate
of tan/pink fibromembranous soft tissue (29.0 x 24.0 x 3.8 cm in aggregate)
with multiple (at least 100) tan/pink nodules (ranging from 0.2 to 6.8 cm) and
admixed tan/yellow lobulated adipose tissue. Representative sections of the
nodules are submitted to the 7

The surface overlying the nodules is focally inked black

and Representative sections are submitted for permanent microscopic
examination.

Micro G1 through G4: Sections of largest nodules, 1—3 frags each, RSS.

Part H, "#8. Phrenic nerve", consists of a single irregular yellow/pink soft
tissue fragment (1.2 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm). The specimen is inked black, bisected
and entirely submitted for frozen section examination as FSA.

Micro H1: Frozen section remnant (FSA), 2 frags, ESS.

Part I, "#9. Old port site #1", consists of a single fragment of tan/white skin
and subcutis (2.1 x 0.5 cm, extending to a depth of 2.2 cm). The subcutis is
firm with abundant tan/white fibrous scar tissue, but no focal mass lesions are
identified. The specimen is entirely submitted for microscopic examination.

Micro Il through I2: Skin and subcutis, 1—2 frags each, ESS.

By his/her signature below, the senior physician certifies that he/she
personally conducted a microscopic examination ("gross only" exam if so stated)

of the described specimen(s) and rendered or confirmed the diagnosis(es)
related thereto.
