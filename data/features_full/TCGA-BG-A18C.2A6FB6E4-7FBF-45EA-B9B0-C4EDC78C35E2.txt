A. ENDOMETRIAL A/QENMWMEIRIQIDIXEEIIQO GRADE, NUCLEAR GRADE 2,
INVOLVES 95% OF EEQQMETRIAL SURFACE ARISES IN A BACKGROUND OF COMPLEX ATYPICAL
HYPERPLASIA.

TUMOR INVADES 0.3 CM OF 2.3 CM MYOMETRIUM (~13%).
LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IS NOT IDENTIFIED.
CERVIX AND BILATERAL ADNEXA. NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
RIGHT FALLOPIAN TUBE WITH PARATUBAL OYSTS.
RIGHT OVARY WITH SURFACE EPITHELIAL INCLUSIONS, AND FOCAL SURFACE ADHESIONS.
BILATERAL OVARIES WITH MILD STROMAL HYPERPLASIA.
CERVIX WITH MESONEPHRIC REMNANTS.
PATHOLOGIC STAGE: T1: N0 MX.

COMMENT:
Correlated with companion negative pelvic wash
Prior biopsy results of endometriold carcinoma with focal high-grade component are noted. Specimen Is extensively
sampled and there is no evidence of high-grade mallgnant neoplasm.
