Final Diagnosis:

A. Right pelvic lymph nodes, lymphadenectomy: Four benign lymph nodes with
one showing focal hyalinized change, negative for malignancy.

B. Left pelvic lymph nodes, lymphadenectomy: Three benign lymph nodes,
negative for malignancy.

C. Uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, total

hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy:

l. Endometrial high-grade serous carcinoma (please see comment)

2. Tumor diffusely involves the endometrial cavity, and arises in
association with adjacent intraepithelial carcinoma

3. Tumor invades into the outer half of the myometrium

4. Tumor involves the parenchyma and surface of both right and left
ovaries

5. Tumor extensively involves the mucosa of the distal right fallopian
tube (please see comment)

uterine serosa
8. No evidence of cervical glandular or stromal involvement

Final Diagnosis Comment:

The endometrial cavity is diffusely involved by high—grade serous carcinoma with focal
intraepithelial carcinoma present at the surface of residual uninvolved atrophic
endometrium. The tumor at the uterine cavity represents the largest tumor bulk and it
invades into the outer half of the anterior myometrium but does not directly extend to
the uterine serosa; there is concurrent multifocal microscopic serosal tumor deposits
present on the anterior serosal surface (not in contiguity with the intrauterine
tumor). There is focal tumor involvement of the ovarian surface with associated
parenchymal tumor nodules in both ovaries. The lumen of the right distal fallopian
tube and fimbria is extensively involved and extended by multinodular tumor deposit.

While it is possible that the high—grade serous may have originated from the right
distal fallopian tube or alternatively that the tumors in the uterus and the right
fallopian tube represent synchronous primaries, the distribution of the disease is
most in keeping with a uterine primary that subsequently metastasized to the different
extra—uterine sites. This is also supported by the immunostaining findings that both

the uterine tumor and the right tubal tumor show only weak focal nuclear WTl
immunoreactivity, in contrast to the usually strong and diffuse WTl immunoreactivity
observed in the great majority of primary ovarian/tubal serous carcinomas.

Gross Description:
Received are four containers, each labelled with the patient's name, XXXXXXXXXXX and
demographics.

Container A is labelled RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES and consists of multiple pieces of
fibrofatty tissue aggregating to 7 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm. Two lymph nodes are identified
within the fibrofatty tissue measuring 2 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm and 2 x 0.7 x 0.2 cm,
respectively and are submitted in toto in cassettes A1 and A2. The remainder of the
fibrofatty tissue is submitted in cassettes A3 and A4.

Container B is labelled LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE and consists of multiple pieces of
fibrofatty tissue aggregating to 4.5 x 3 x 1 cm. Two lymph nodes are identified
within, one measuring 2 x l x 0.4 cm and the other measuring 1.9 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm. They
are sectioned and submitted in El and 82, respectively. The remainder of the
fibrofatty tissue is submitted in B3 and B4.

Container C is labelled UTERUS, CERVIX BILATERAL TUBES, AND OVARIES and consists of a
total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The uterus measures
4.4 x 3.6 x 2.5 cm, left fallopian tube measures 5.6 x 0.5 cm, left ovary measures 2 x
l x 1.3 cm, right fallopian tube measuring 6 x 0.5 cm at its attachment site to the
uterus, dilating up to 1.5 cm at its fimbriated end, right ovary measuring 2 x l x 0.5
cm.

The serosal surface is tanvbrown, smooth, shiny, and free of any adhesions. The
ectocervix measures 1.8 x 2.4 cm and it is covered by a glistening white mucosa. The
external 05 is slit-like and measures 0.7 cm. The endocervical canal measures 2.1 cm
and involved by a friable tumor in the proximal region. The same friable white
exophytic tumor is present, diffusely involving the endometrial cavity. On cute
sections, the tumor invades into the out half of the anterior myometrium (to within
0.3 cm of the serosal surface) but does not extend to the serosa.

Left fallopian tube is unremarkable. The left ovary is multinodular and cystic and
there are several golden areas which grossly resemble the appearance of corpora lutea.
The right fallopian tube has multiple nodules towards its fimbriated end, the largest
of which measures 1 cm in diameter. Cut sections through the nodules show a white,
soft mass with a central area of hemorrhage. These nodules appear to be mostly
contained within the lumen of the fallopian tube. There are also several cystic
spaces near the fimbriated end, the largest measuring 0.7 cm in diameter, filled with
a mucinous-like material. The right ovary is multinodular and golden in appearance,
and otherwise unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Cl—C2 ~representative sections of left ovary

C3—C4 —representative sections of left fallopian tube
C5—C6 —right ovary submitted in toto

C7—C10 —Right fallopian tube mass, submitted in toto
Cll,C12—Remainder of right fallopian tube

C13 -posterior cervix
C14 —anterior cervix
C15 —posterior cul—de—sac

Cl6—C26—posterior endomyometrium (transverse sections from inferior to superior),
submitted in toto
C27-C39—anterior endomyometrium (transverse sections from inferior to superior),
submitted in toto

Container D is labelled OMENTUM and consists of a single piece of fibrofatty tissue
measuring 10 x 5 x 0.8 cm. Grossly, the tissue is tan-yellow with strands of fibrous
tissue within it. At one edge, there is a slightly firmer piece of adipose tissue
measuring 2 x l x 0.7 cm. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Dl—D2 -firmer area of omentum submitted in toto
D3—D6 -representative sections of fibrofatty tissue
