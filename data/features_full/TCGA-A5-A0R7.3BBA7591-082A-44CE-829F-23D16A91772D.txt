SURGICAL PATHOLOGY:
COPath Specimen
Source:

A: Right Tube \T\ ovary, ( Permanent)
B: Left Tube \T\ ovary
C: Uterus
D: Left Pelvic lymph node
E: Left Peri—aortic, ( Frozen section)
F: Right Pelvic lymph node

Final Diagnosis
A. Fallopian tube and ovary, right (salpingo-oophorectomy):
(g-Ovary with endosalpingiosis and no signiﬁcant histopathologic
abnormalities.
-Fallopian tube with no signiﬁcant histopathologic
abnormalities.

B. Fallopian tube and ovary, left (salpingo-oophorectomy):
-Ovary with follicular cyst and benign glandular rest.
-Fallopian tube with no signiﬁcant histopathologic
abnormalities.

C. Uterus (total abdominal hysterectomy) :

-Adenocarcinoma, éndometrioid type, grade 2/3. ,

—Tumor is seen extending into the deep myometrium involving 40%
of the myometrial wall (lcm invasion with wall thickness 2.5

cm. )

—Cervical margin of resection appears clear.

-Bilateral parametrial margins of resection appear clear.

-No deﬁnite evidence of lymph-vascular space invasion.

-With regard to invasion of the lower uterine segment by
carcinoma, this is pending additional sections.

D. Lymph node, left pelvic (biopsy) -No evidence of malignancy in two lymph nodes
examined.

 

, E. Periaortic, left (biopsy):
-No evidence of malignancy in seven lymph nodes examined.

F. Lymph node, right pelvic (biopsy):

Gross Description The specimen is submitted in eight parts, all are labeled with the patient's
name.

‘3 Specimen A is labeled "right tube and ovary" and consists of one ovary, measuring 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm,
as well as a 4 x 0.5 cm in diameter portion of fallopian tube. Representative sections of fallopian
tube are submitted in cassette AI. On cut section, no focal abnormalities are noted in the ovary.

lpecimen B is labeled IIleft fallopconsists of one, 3 x ian tube and ovaryovary, 4 x
.8 x 1.5 cm as well as 0 .5 cm

in diameter fallopian tube. On cut section, no abnormalities are noted in the ovary.
Representative sections of fallopian tube are submitted in cassette BI and ovary in cassette B2

ll . .
Specimen C is labeled lIuterus and consrsts of one, 278 gram uterus. The myometrium measures 2

cm in thickness and there 15 an exophytic tumor extending 1 cm above the apparent myometrium.

The tumor grossly does not appear to extend down into the lower uterine segment. The cervix
appears clear. The specimen is inked. Sections of the cervical margin of resection are submitted in
cassettes C1 and C2. Sections of the right parametrial margin of resection are submitted in cassette
C3. Sections of the left parametrial margin of resection are submitted in cassette C4. Sections of the
lower uterine segment are submitted in cassettes C5 and C6. On further sectioning of the tumor, it
appears to be invading the myometrium with the myometrial thickness of 2.5 cm. Tumor is seen
invading 1 cm into the myometrium with 1.5 cm of remaining uninvolved myometrium . Sections of
tumor in this region are submitted in contiguous sections in C7 and C8 and C9 and C10 showing the
deepest penetration of tumor.

 
 

Specimen D is labeled IIleft pelvic lymph node 11 and consists of multiple fragments of red-brown
tissue that measure in aggregate l x 1 x 0.5 cm. Representative nodes are submitted in cassette

D.

u 1 o a n o o
Specrmen E IS labeled IIleft pertaortic lymph nodes and are submitted for frozen section. The
frozen section specimen is entirely resubmitted in cassette E.

u
Specimen F is labeled IIright pelvic lymph node and consists of one, 2 x 2 x 0.5 cm portion of tan
tissue, which is examined for lymph nodes and representative nodes are submitted in cassettes F1

and F2.

. I 1 o I H a -
Specrmen G is labeled IIright periaortic lymph node and consrsts of one, 2 x 2 x 0.5 cm portions of
tan tissue, which is sectioned and representative nodes are submitted in cassette G.

Specimen H is labeled .. omentumn and consists of one apparent partial omentectomy specimen,
measuring 5 x 5 x 0.2 cm. On palpation, no deﬁnite nodules are identiﬁed. On cut section, no
nodules are identiﬁed. Representative sections are submitted in cassette HI through H4.
