Clinical History
Right lung upper lobe nodule

Specimen
#1 Right upper lobe wedge biopsy
#2 Completion of right upper lobectomy—right upper lobe, freeze
bronchial margins
#3 Level 7
#4 Level 10

Gross Examination

#1 Right lung, upper lobe, wedge biopsy: Received in the fresh state is a
wedge shaped portion of lung weighing 57.5 grams and roughly 7.5 x 5.5 X 2.5 cm.
Within the tissue is a well circumscribed, nonencapsulated tumor roughly 2.0 X
2.0 X 1.3 cm. The tumor grossly extends to within 0.2 cm of the surgical
resection margin. The tumor is 0.2 cm deep to the pleural surface. The
surrounding lung tissue is soft and dark red. A portion of the tumor to include
the surgical resection margin is submitted for frozen section evaluation. With
the expressed written consent of the patient, a portion of the tumor is triaged
for the Cancer Genome Atlas Project. Additional tissue is sampled in siX
cassettes for permanent section. Block Summary: "A","B", tumor with closest
surgical mar in; "C", subpleural tumor; "D","E", tumor; "F", grossly normal lung
tissue . i

#2 Received fresh labeled completion of right upper lobectomy, right upper
lobe, is a 352.5 gram, 21.0 X 11.0 X up to 3.5 cm lobe of lung. The bronchial
margin is submitted for Frozen Section as "2FS". Extending in either direction

from the stapled bronchial margin, is a 19.0 cm long staple line. On the
opposite surface there is a 13.0 cm long staple line. The pleura is dark red
purple, smooth and glistening. The tissue is serially sectioned to demonstrate
a dark red brown, soft spongy parenchyma, with no discrete mass or lesion
identified. There are two dark grey peribronchial lymph node candidates, 0.7
and 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. Eleven representative sections are submitted
in five: "A-E". Block summary: "A", vascular margins and bronchial tissue just
deep to bronchial margin Frozen Section; "B", two individual peribronchial lymph
node candidates; "C,D", parenchyma beneath the staple line opposite the
bronchus; "E", uninvolved parenchyma away from the staple line.

 

 

      

* Final Report *

#3 Labeled Level 7, is a 0.6 X 0.4 X 0.2 cm irregular fragment of dark grey
soft tissue, entirely submitted in one cassette.

#4 Labeled Level 10, is a 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm aggregate Of two irregular
fragments of dark red soft tissue, entirely submitted in one cassette.

Frozen Section Diagnosis

#1 RIGHT LUNG, UPPER LOBE; WEDGE BIOPSY (1 FS): NON-SMALL CELL CARCINOMA,
FAVOR

SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA. TUMOR GROSSLY EXTENDS TO WITHIN 2 MM OF SURGICAL

RESECTION MARGIN. -

#2 RIGHT LUNG, UPPER LOBE BRONCHIAL MARGIN (1 FS): NEGATIVE. -

Microscopic Examination
#l-#4 Microscopic examination performed.

Comment
The lesional cells have the following immunophenotypic profile (immunoperoxidase
technique): CK5/6 (-), CK7 (focal +), p63 (—), and TTF—l (rare +). The

wnotypic findings support the interpretation of adenocarcinoma.

 

Final Diagnosis
#1 RIGHT LUNG, UPPER LOBE; WEDGE BIOPSY: POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA,
SOLID TYPE.
TUMOR SIZE: 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.3 CM.
SURGICAL MARGIN STATUS: TUMOR EXTENDS TO WITHIN 0.2 CM OF SURGICAL
MARGIN.
PLEURAL SURFACE STATUS: NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.
LYMPHOVASCULAR SPACE INVASION: ABSENT.
#2 RIGHT LUNG, UPPER LOBE; EXCISION: BENIGN LUNG TISSUE (NEGATIVE FOR RESIDUAL
CARCINOMA).
BRONCHIAL MARGIN: FREE.
PERIBRONCHIAL LYMPH NODES: TWO LYMPH NODES, NO TUMOR PRESENT.
#3 MEDIASTINAL (LEVEL 7) LYMPH NODE BIOPSY: BENIGN LYMPH NODE.
#4 MEDIASTINAL (LEVEL 10) LYMPH NODE BIOPSY: BENIGN LYMPH NODE.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (TNM CLASSIFICATION): pTla pNO.
