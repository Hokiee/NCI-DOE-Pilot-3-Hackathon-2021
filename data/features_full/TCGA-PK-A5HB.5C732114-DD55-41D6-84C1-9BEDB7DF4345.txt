Gross Description
1. The specimen container labeled with the patient’s name and as "splenule" contains a round grey-blue accessory spleen

that measures 1.8 x 1.7 x 1.2 cm. On section the specimen is tan and grossly unremarkable.
1A ~ specimen submitted in toto.

2. The specimen container labeled with the patient's name and as “left spleen" contains an intact blue-grey spleen that
measures 13.0 x 10.0 x 5.0 cm. The serosal surface and the cut surface are unremarkable. No nodes are identified in
the hilar region. A piece of normal tissue is stored frozen. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

2A-D - four representative sections.

3. The specimen container labeled with the patient‘s name and as “leﬂ adrenal distal pancreas, left kidney" contains a

kidney adherent to a large adrenal mass and an adherent portion of pancreas. The specimen measures 14.5 x 19.0 x
12.0 cm. The kidney measures 11.5 x 6.5 x 6.0 cm and is grossly unremarkable. The pancreas measures 5.5 x 3.0 x 2.3

is tan, partly solid, partly friable. and iobulated with foci of hemorrhage. No obvious adrenal parenchyma is identiﬁed but
small patches of bright orange-yellow are seen particularly in the capsular region. In the perirenai fat there are several
nodes that range in size from 0.3 cm in diameter to 9.0 cm in diameter. A piece of adrenal tumor is stored frozen.
