(A4-A6) Mass

' (A7) Uninvolved lung.

Specimen B is received fresh from the operating room labeled right hilar lymph node and consists of a 1.9 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm
aggregate of hemorrhagic yellow fatty tissue. A portion of the specimen is submitted for frozen section analysis.

The specimen is entirely submitted as follows:
(B1FS' ) Frozen section
(32 ) Additional tissue.

Specimen C is received in formalin labeled right pulmonary ligament node and consists of a-1.5 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm yellow fatty
tissue fragment. The out surfaces show a central tan-gray 1.1 cm in maximum diameter lymph node. The specimen is
bisected and entirely submitted in cassette (C1 I.

Specimen D ls received in formalin labeled 4R lower paratracheal, the requisition denotes lower paratracheal node, and
’ consists of four irregular gray-black anthracotic nodules varying from 0.6 to 1.5 cm in maximum diameter. The cut surface
of the larger lymph node shows well~circumscribed solid white 0.1 cm areas.

The larger nodes are inked and sectioned, the smaller submitted in toto as follows:

(D1 ) TWO potential whole nodes and a bisected node
(DZ Largest node, bisected.

(BF1) Frozen section diagnosis: “lymph node, no tumor seen" is rendered by Dr.

Microscopic Description

Specimen A sections demonstrate lung with a large nodule of metastatic-malignant melanoma.

The tumor cells (A6) demonstrate the following immunostain results:

3100 Positive
HMS-45 Positive
Mart-1‘ Pesitive

I The parenchymal resection margin is not involved by melanoma.

Sections (BF1. B2, Ci, D1) demonstrate benign lymph node tissue. There is anthracotic pigment deposition. No
metastatic malignancy is seen. ,

Sections (DZ) demonstrate lymph node with metastatic malignant melanoma.
