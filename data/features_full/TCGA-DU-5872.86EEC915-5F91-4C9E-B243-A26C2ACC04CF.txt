Clinical History
The patient is a -year—old woman with a past history of left frontal mixed oligoastrocytoma diagnosed
on

‘ , LOH negative, treated with XRT and Temozolomide. Currently the patient experiences altered
mental status.
and on imaging has new abnormal signal with nodular enhancement.
Operative Diagnoses
Recurrent frontal oligoastrocytoma
Operation I Specimen
A: Brain, left frontal brain tumor, biopsy
B: Brain. left frontal brain tumor, biopsy
Pathologic Diagnosis
A. Brain, left frontal brain tumor, biopsy:
1. Necrotic tumor and brain tissue.
2. Scant viable tumor cells.
3. Radiation induced changes.
B. Brain, left frontal brain tumor, biopsy:
1. Recurrentlresidual oligoastrocytoma.
2. Radiation induced changes (see comment).
Comment
Scant viable tumor is present in specimen A. and deﬁnite viable tumor is present in specimen B. Tumor
cells show
moderately pleomorphic round to oval to angulated nuclei. Mitotic ﬁgures are rare. Necrosis, astrogliosis,
vascular
changes and chronic inﬂammation related to radiation therapy are noted. lmmunohistochemical stains are
performed
on specimen B. GFAP demonstrated reactive astrogliosis and highlights occasional tumor cells. The Ki-
67 labeling
index is approximately 2 to 3% in the tumor areas of lower cellularity and approximately 5 to 10% in areas
of higher
cellularity, but this higher activity is often associated with chronic inﬂammation and/or vascular changes.
With the exception of the radiation induced changes. the remaining tumor appears histologically similar to
the patient’s
previOus specimen in terms of histopathological grade being. Some mild microvascular proliferation is
noted, but is not
deﬁnitely associated with tumor. as it also appears in areas of reactive gliosis, and may be secondary to
radiation.
Convincing histopathological evidence for deﬁnite transformation from a WHO grade II to grade III lesion
is lacking.
This could be due to sampling phenomenon. The fact that the lesion shows new enhancing foci
radiologically however
suggests that it has progressed to a WHO grade lIl lesion. Clinical correlation is required.
