CLINICAL INFORMATION

The patient has a history of adenocarcinoma of the right upper lobe of
lung. The patient undergoes right upper Iobectomy and thoracic
Iymphadenectomy.

SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPTION

A) SOURCE: Right paratracheal lymph node

The specimen is received labeled "right paratracheal lymph node" and
consists of a 0.3 cm red-black soft lymph nodal tissue, submitted In toto
on one block for frozen microscopy.

INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONS FROZEN SECTION: "One lymph node,
negative for carcinoma" is rendered by

B) SOURCE: 4R paratracheal lymph node

The specimen is received labeled "paratracheal lymph node, 4R" and consists
of four soft red—black tissues, ranging 0.4—0.7 cm, submitted entirely on

block for frozen microscopy.

INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WT FROZEN SECTION: “Lymph node
tissue, negative for carcinoma“ is rendered by

C) SOURCE: Level 7 subcarinal lymph node

The specimen Is received labeled "subcarinal lymph node level 7" and
consists of a single 0.4 cm red~black tissue, submitted in toto on one
block for frozen microscopy.

INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATIO FROZEN SECTION: ”Lymph node
tissue, negative for caricnoma" is rendered by

 

 

 

D) SOURCE: Right upper lobe, bronchial margin forfrozen

Labeled "right upper lobe, bronchial margin for frozen" Is a 195 g, 20.5 x

8 x 4 cm lung lobectomy with a continuous parenchymal staple line along 18
cm of the hilar aspect of the specimen. A visceral pleural surface Is
puckered apically (inked blue) Cut surfaces disclose a 4 x 3.5 X 3 cm firm
solid gray-tan tigmor mass with irregular borders within the superior one

half of the specimen, focally less than 0.1 cm from the puckered serosa and
3.5 cm from the bronchial resection. The bronchial resection margin is
trimmed (three lumina) en face for frozen microscopy.

INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: "Bronchial
margin negative for carcinoma" is rendered by

The tumor is found 1.4 cm from the nearest parenchymal staple line (inked
blue). The remaining cut surfaces disclose soft red—tan focally crepitant
lung without additional discrete lesions. A single black peribronchial 1.3
cm lymph node is identified. The pulmonary vasculature is thin—walled and
patent.

NOTE: Tumor is retained for additional possible ancillary studies.
Representative sections are submitted in 12 cassettes as follows:

1. Frozen section residue
Pulmonary vasculature en face margins

2.
3. One peribronchial bisected.,lymph node

4. Parenchymal staplegiine nearest tumor, perpendicular to blue ink
5-8. Lung tumor with puckered pleura (inked black

 

9—10. Lung tumor and adjacent lung
11. Normal lung adjacent to tumor
12. Normal lung inferior half of specimen

Note: Specimen removed from patient a Specimen placed in
10% neutral buffered formalin a Specimen fixed in formalin
for a minimum ofS hours, and no ongert an 4 hours,

E) SOURCE: Lymph node resection, level 12R

The specimen is received labeled "level 12R lymph node," It consists of a 1
cm anthracotic lymph node. The specimen Is entirely submitted in one
cassette.

   
   

3 it
F:)SOURCE Lymph node resection, level 9
The specimen is received labeled "level 9 lymph node." It consists of three
anthracotic possible lymph nodes averaging 0.3 cm in greatest dimension.
The specimen is submitted in toto in one cassette.

G) SOURCE: Lymph node resection, subcarinal, level 7

The specimen is received labeled "subcarinal lymph node, level 7." It
consists of four anthracotic pigmented lymph nf’éges ranging from 0.5 to 1.4
cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is entirely submitted in three
cassettes labeled:

G1. Three lymph nodes
2—3. One node, sectioned

H) SOURCE: Lymph node resection, level 11R
The specimen is received labeled "level 11R lymph node " It Consists of a 1
Ecm anthracotlc lymph node The specimen is entirelv submitted In one
