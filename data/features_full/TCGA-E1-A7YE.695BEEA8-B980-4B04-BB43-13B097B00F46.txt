CLINICAL HISTORY:
Brain tumor left frontal anaplastic astrocytoma.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Brain tumor (AFl—2)", received fresh. A 6.5 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm resection of
brain tissue is received. Representative tissue is frozen as AFle, the
frozen section remnants are submitted in respective blocks Al—Z. Additional
representative sections are submitted as A3—8.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
A. "Brain tumor":AFl— gliosis, atypical cells
AF2— glioblastoma

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

Permanent sections reveal a highly cellular pleomorphic population of
astrocytes consistent with a high grade glioma. The area interpreted as

necrosis on frozen section as AFZ actually represents an area of hemorrhage as
seen in permanent sections.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. "BRAIN TUMOR":

ANAPLASTIC ASTROCYTOMA (WHO GRADE III). SEE COMMENT.

COMMENT: Hemorrage due to surgical trauma, present in permanent section on
block A2 was interpreted as frank necrosis at frozen section. No frank

necrosis is appreciable in any of the permanent sections, making this an
anaplastic astrocytoma.

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).
