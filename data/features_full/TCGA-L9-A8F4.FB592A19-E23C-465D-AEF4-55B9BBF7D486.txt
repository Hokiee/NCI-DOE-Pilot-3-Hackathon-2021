A. LUNG. LEFT UPPER LOBE. WEDGE RESECI‘ION:
- INVASIVE POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA
— TUMOR MEASURES 2.? CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION AND INVADES VISCERAL PLEURA (pTZ)
— INTRATUMORAL LARGE VESSEL INVASION IDENTIFIED
— PARENCHYMAL MARGIN NEGATIVE AND MEASURES 8 M

B. TISSUE SUBMITTED AS LEFT PLEURAL BIOPSY:
- CAUTERIZED CHEST MUSCULAR WALL AND PLEURAL TISSUE WITH CHRONIC INFLAMMATION
— NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA

C. LEVEL V LYMPH NODE, RESECI‘ION:
- TWO (2) ANTHRAOOTIC LYMPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA

COMMENT(S)

The mass is an invasive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The visceral pleura is
extensively involved by the tumor with ink present on tumor at the surface. Within the mid
portion of the tumor is an area of necrosis with venous invasion noted

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in three parts. Each part is labeled with the patient's name

A. Received fresh for tissue banking with tissue collected at 9 a.m. for tissue banking
and designated “left upper wedge" is a 31 gram. 14.0 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm wedge of lung tissue.
The pleura is mottled and pink—tan with a focally puckered lesion. The area of puckering
corresponds to an indurated tumor mass. The puckered area is 2.5 cm. Staples are removed
with the staple margin inked black. The pleural surface is inked blue. The wedge is
sectioned to have a 2.7 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm indurated tumor mass. The tumor diffusely involves
the pleural surface in the region of puckering and comes to within 1.0 cm of the black
inked staple margin. The tumor has a tan—white to mottled gray—black and anthracotic
appearance. The lung parenchyma adjacent to the tumor has a spongy. loose consistency with
dilated air spaces consistent with possible emphysemic changes. Sections of the tumor are
sampled for tissue banking with the tissue collected at The remainder of
the lung wedge biopsy is sectioned to have a spongy. focally golden—yellow to tan~brown
appearing cut surface. No additional lesions are identified. Representative sections are
sampled to include the tumor to the nearest inked staple margin and puckered pleura in
cassettes Al—AS with A5 being a random representative section of the parenchyma at the
opposite pole of the wedge sampled.

B. Labeled "left pleural biopsy" is a 1.5 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm indurated fibroconnective tissue
biopsy. The biopsy has focal adherent clotted blood. The specimen is bisected and
entirely submitted in cassette Bl.

C. Labeled "level 5 lymph nodes" are two anthracotic. red—brown. nodular lymphoid tissue
fragments. The nodes are 6.0 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm and 0.8 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The tissues are
submitted in toto in cassette C1.
