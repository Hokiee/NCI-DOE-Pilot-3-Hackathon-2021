MACROECOPIC DESCEIPTION

A fresh, intact right globe.
Dimensions:
Cornea: Horizontal 11.5mm, Vertical 11mm

Optic nerve
Length 12.5mm, Diameter 4mm

Pupil: regular

Axial 25mm, Horizontal 24.5mm, Vertical 24mm

0n trans- -illumination, a shadow is seen in the supero medial

measuring 19mm in maximum diameter.
Plane of section: vertical oblique

Intraooular description:

On opening, a nodular, pale mass is seen, slightly anterior

to the equator.

Tumour size
LBD 9mm, Height 8.5mm

MICROSCOPY

Sections show a virtually non-pigmented choroidal melanoma
extending from the era serrata / pars plana up to the
equator. Tumour consists predominantly of spindle cells. The
number of mitosis is approximately 4/40 high power fields
Closed loops are focally present in the planes of sections.
The lymphocytio infiltrate within the tumour is minimal.
Tumour necrosis is not seen. There is no tumour extension

through the sclera, optic nerve or vortex veins examined.
Tumour cells are not seen at the resection margins.

Elsewhere, the cornea shows no significant abnormality. The
anterior chamber angles are open and the anterior chamber is
shallow. The iris shows no significant abnormality. Ciliary
processes away from tumour show slight hyalinisation. Retina
overlying the tumour is slightly atrophic and Bruch's
membrane appears intact.

DIAGNOSIS

Right eye, enucleation: Choroidal melanoma of predominantly
spindle cell type.

COMMENT

Immunohistochemistry will be carried out for completion. In
addition, molecular genetic examination of DNA extracted
from the tumour cells will be performed using
multiplex-ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA),
looking at chromosomes 1, 3. 6 and 8. A supplementary report
will follow in due course.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT -

Immunohistochemistry confirms that tumour cells express
Melan-A and HSP 27 (score 2).

SU?PLEHENTARY REPORT

In the meantime, molecular genetic analysis of tumour DNA
extracted from the fresh uveal melanoma tissue was performed
using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification
(MLPA) . These investigations were performed in the

 

The kit P027 from which examines for gains or v
losses in 37 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8, was used. "
The DNA concentration was measured using and the ' ' 5
quality assessed using multiplex—FOR prior to the MLPA

reaction.

The DNA concentration was high and of good quality on
assessment. The MLPA reaction was run at least twice on
differing occasions, resulting in similar results.

The results of the sequence analysis of the MLPA products is
printed on a separate report. In summary, sequence analysis
demonstrated:

 

essentially normal chromosome 1p,

3 borderline losses of chromosome 3 in the presence of 3
borderline gains, .
gains in chromosome 6p J
and normal chromosome 8. ' "
