CLINICAL NOTES

PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Rectal cancer.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

one

A. Received in formalin labeled "apical lymph node" is a
0.8 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm yellow fatty tissue fragment which may
be possible lymphoid tissue. The tissue is entirely submitted in

cassette . -
B.

eived fresh subsequently fixed in formalin labeled

"sigmoid and upper rectum". The specimen grossly consists
of a 20—cm long portion of colon which is stapled at the distal end
(inked black) and opened at the proximal end (inked blue). The

serosa of the specimen is pink—tan smooth and glistening partially
covered with abundant yellow lobular fat. Retroperitoneal

reflection

to

is located 6 cm from the distal margin. The specimen is opened to
show a pink—tan smooth glistening mucosa with an average
circumference of 5.5 cm. There is a large exophytic tumor closer

the distal end, measuring 5.3 x 6.0 x 1.0 cm. This is located 3.5
cm from the distal end. The distal end has a circumference of 7.5
cm and the tumor comes within 0.6 cm of being circumferential. The
cut surface of the tumor shows invasion into the muscularis

propria.

However, no discrete invasion is grossly identified into the fat.
This comes within 2.5 cm of the radial margin. A sample was taken
for tissure procurement. The remainder of the mucosa is pink—tan
smooth and glistening with normal to slightly dilated folds. No
other discrete gross lesions are identified in the mucosa. Multiple
lymph nodes are grossly identified in the fat which are firm and
somewhat enlarged up to 1.7 cm in greatest dimension.
Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows:
Block 1 — representative luminal margin; block 2—4 — representative
section of tumor which includes tumor to normal and tumor into fat;
block 5 — representative radial margin; block 6 — one possible

lymph

node bisected; block 7—15 — whole possible lymph nodes._.
C. The specimen consists of a 5.5 x 0.7 cm ap which

is partially covered pink—tan smooth glistening serosa and
minimally yellow lobular fat. The specimen is sectioned to show an
intact wall with an average thickness of 0.3 cm. The lumen ranges
from pinpoint to 0.3 cm partially filled with green feces.
Representative sections of the specimen tted in one
cassette with the proximal end inked.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

A. This single apical node is negative for metastatic
disease, 0/1.
B. This segment of colon contains an ulcerated,

moderately

the

differentiated adenocarcinoma, minimally extending into pericolonic
fat. Please see the template below:

Histologic type: Infiltrating adenocarcinoma.

Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated.

Primary tumor (pT): pT3.

Proximal margin: Negative for tumor.

Distal margin: Negative for tumor.

Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative for tumor.

Distance of tumor from closest margin: The tumor is 3.5 cm from

distal margin.

Vascular invasion: Not detected.

Regional lymph nodes (pN): As per parts A and B, a total of 48

lymph nodes are found, one of which contains metastatic disease,
1/48, lea.

Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: Negative.

Distant metastasis (pM): Cannot be assessed.

C. Microscopic examination performed.
3,5,1

DIAGNOSIS

A. Apical lymph node, excision —

Single lymph node negative for metastatic disease, 0/1.
B. Sigmoid and upper rectum, segmental resection —

Segment of colon with infiltrating, moderately differentiated
adenocarcinoma, extending into pericolonic fat.

All margins are negative for tumor.

Metastatic disease is present to 1 of 47 lymph nodes, 1/47.
C. Appendix, appendectomy —

Appendix — no significant pathology.
