Gross Description

This case consists of five specimens, each received in formalin labeled with the
patient's name and medical record number.

Specimen one is received labeled "common hepatic lymph node", and consists of a
single candidate lymph node ”2.0 x 0.8 x 0.8" resected in continuity with benign
appearing fat. This tissue is submitted in its entirety in cassette lA—lD.

  
   

Specimen two is received labeled "celiac lymph node", and consists of a single
fragment of redrtan ﬁibrous tissue (2.5 x 1.8 x 0.5 cm). This tissue is submitted
in its entirety in cassettes 2A-ZB.

Specimen three is received labeled "periaortic lymph node", and consists of a
single reddish tan fragment of soft tissue (2.5 x 1.8 x 0.6 cm). Tissue is
bivalved and submitted in cassette 3A.

Specimen four is received labeled "retroportal lymph node", and consists of a
single candidate lymph node (1.2 x 0.8 x 0.8) which is bivalved and submitted in
its entirety in cassette 4A.

Specimen five is received labeled “left lobectomy“, and consists of a 600 g segment
of liver (12.5 x 12.5 x 7.0 cm). A cauterized surgical margin is noted. The
resection specimen is dominated by a large firm nodular lesion (10.0 x 6.5 x 7.0
cm). This nodular mass approaches the surgical margin to within 2.0 cm. The
surgical margin is inked black, and the exterior surface of the liver capsule
adjacent to the nodular mass is inked blue. Sectioning reveals the mass to abut
the capsule. Penetration is not seen. The mass is notable for a large central
scar stellate pattern and bile type staining peripherally. Tissue is submitted as
follows: 5A central scar portion of mass; EB representative section of tumor; 5C
tumor interface with normal parenchyma; SD representative section of liver tumor;
5E tumor to resection margins; 5F tumor to resection margins; 56 representative
sections of uninvolved liver parenchyma; SH—SK additional representative sections

of tumor mass.

Additional pathologic findings: The background liver parenchyma is unremarkable.
Special histochemical stains trichrome. PAS—D, and iron are performed on a
representative tissue block of uninvolved liver with appropriate controls and show
no evidence of pathologic fibrosis, iron deposition, or alpha~l-antitrypsin type
hyaline globules.
