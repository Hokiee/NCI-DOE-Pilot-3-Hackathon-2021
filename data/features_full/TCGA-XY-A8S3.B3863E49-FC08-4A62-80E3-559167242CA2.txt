Mixed germ cell tumor.
See comment and case summary.

CASE SUMMARY FOR TESTIS (RADICAL ORCHIECTOMY):

Serum tumor markers: LDH 165 UIL; AFP 96.9 nglml; HCG elevated
Tumor focality: Unifocal
Tumor size: See below
Greatest dimension: 2.5 cm
Additional measurements: 2x2 cm
Macroscopic extent of tumor: Conﬁned to testis
Histologic type: Mixed germ cell tumor (80% embryonal, 15% yolk sac, 5% choriocarcinoma)
Margins:
Spermatic cord margin: Benign
Other margins: NIA
Microscopic tumor extension: Confined to testis
Lymph-Vascular invasion: Yes
Pathologic staging (pTNM):
Primary tumor: pT2: Tumor limited to the testis with vascular/lymphatic invasion
Regional lymph nodes: X
Distant metastasis: NIA
Serum Tumor Markers: S1
Additional pathologic ﬁndings: Mlcrolithiasis and intratubuiar germ cell neoplasia

AJCC Staging (7th edition) pT2

COMMENT

Properly controlled immunohistochemical studies were performed. CD30 and OCT 3/4 highlight the
embryonal carcinoma. Glypican 3 and AFP highlight the yolk sac tumor while HGG highlights a
small foci of choriocarcinoma. OCT 314 also highlights intratubuiar germ cell neoplasia.
