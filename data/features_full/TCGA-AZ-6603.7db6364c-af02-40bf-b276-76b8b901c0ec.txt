Fluorescence In situ hybridization aludien demonstrate that the adenocaminoma has a ratio of Her- 2iNeu gene to the
contromom chromosome 17' of 1 19 indicating a lack of amplification In the targeted rogion.

Herzineu amplification may help in identifying those patients likely to experience shorter survival when considered
logothor with other major risk factoro.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
COLON, SIGMOID. SEGMENTAL COLEGTOMY —

A. INVASIVE MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA (3.? CM) lNVADING iNTO BUT NOT THROUGH
MUSCULARIS PROPRIA WITH INTRAMURAL ABSCESS.

B. SURGICAL MARGINB NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.
C. THREE (3) LYMPH MODES NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (see comment).

E. PATHQLOGlC STAGE: p1"? N0 MX. DUKES A.
CKGRCJUND COLON WITH CRYPT BRANCHING.
COMMENT;

Poricolonic adiposo tissue wad intensively sectioned and additional sections of pericolonlc adipose tissue were
submitted but no additional lymph nodes were identified.
