Intraoperative Consultation: An intraoperative non-microscopic consultation was obtained and
interpreted as: “8.5 x 8.5 x 6.5 cm ovary with solid and focally cystic lesion comprising
the majority of tissue. Attached 4.5 cm long fallopian tube. Portion of ovarian tissue
frozen. Portion for Tumor Bank. The rest for permanents.“ _

F81: Left adnexa — “Adenocarcinoma consistent with Mullerian origin, "—

— - Microscopic Description and Comment: Sections of both the right and left
ovaries show poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, mixed papillary serous and endometrioid
types. The papillary serous areas form well developed papillary structures lined by
epithelium with a very high nuclear grade, and psammoma bodies are easily identified.

The areas of endometrioid carcinoma show regions of solid growth and also have a high
nuclear grade; of particular note, focally the areas of endometrioid carcinoma show squamous
differentiation, and within these areas, there are microscopic foci in which tumor invades
the ovarian parenchyma with the morphology of a poorly differentiated, keratinizing squamous
cell carcinoma {slide Al) . Tumor is diffusely present on the surface of both ovaries. Tumor
extends to the adjacent fallopian tubes, and the lumen of the right tube is focally effaced
by adenocarcinoma.

Sections of the uterus show no evidence of metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
The cervix contains an endocervical polyp, the endometrium is proliferative, and the
myometrium is unremarkable. There is no evidence of metastatic adenocarcinoma on the serosal
surface of the uterus.

There is no evidence of metastatic adenocarcinoma in the single left external iliac lymph
node. In addition, we note that there is no evidence of metastatic adenocarcinoma in one
incidental lymph node identified in sections from the gastrocolic omentum specimen.

Microscopic foci of metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma are present within
the fat of the gastrocolic omentum specimen, as are numerous foci of metastatic poorly
differentiated adenocarcinoma in the omentectom s ecimen no ules are all less
than 2 cm in greatest dimension).

  

History: The patient is a— with leftpelvic mass. Operative procedure:

Gross Description The specimen is received in five containers of formalin, each labeled
with the patient‘s name. The first container is additionally labeled “left adnexal" -
The specimen is an enlarged ovary consistent with dimensions listed in the non—microscopic
intraoperative consultation weighing 260 grams. The specimen has been previously incised at

time of frozen section analysis to reveal a predominantly solid tan tumor with cystic areas.
Some of the cysts contain yellow mucoidHlike material. Several foci of tumor is present

on the serosal surface of the ovary. The attached fallopian tube is of normal caliber (up
to 0.6 cm diameter) and contains a small 0.7 cm paratubal cyst. No gross tumor directly
involves the fallopian tube, however, a 0.6 cm nodule of solid tissue is present in the
surrounding soft tissue. Labeled A1, solid area tumor With surface involvement; A2, solid
area tumor with adjacent cystic areas; A3, solid area of tumor; A4, solid area of tumor
penetrating serosa with large serosal nodule; A5, A6, additional sections of tumor; A7,
fallopian tube and paratubal cyst; A8, fallopian tube and possible tumor in para fallopian
tube soft tissue,- A9, tissue frozen as FSl. —

The second container is labeled "uterus, cervix, RSO.“ The specimen is a 140 gram, 8 x 8 x
4.5 x 4.0 cm uterus with an attached 2.7 x 2.4 x 1.5 cm ovary and a 7.0 x 1.0 cm fallopian
tube . The cervix measures 4.0 x 3.5 X 3.5 cm with a 1.0 x 0.9 cm endocervical polyp.

The outer ectocervix is unremarkable. The endometrial cavity measures 3.2 x 2.0 cm and
contains light tan homogenous endometrium without focal abnormalities. Uterine myometrium is
unremarkable and the uterine serosa is smooth without nodules or other irregularities. The
right ovary contains a 1.2 x 1.1 x 0.7 cm solid nodule on the serosal surface. Cut section
of the ovary contains a 1.6 x 1.1 x 1.1 cm ovarian cyst with a thickened wall measuring

0.7 cm suspicious for tumor. The center of the cyst has papillary projections. Cut sections
of the fallopian tube reveal focal areas where the lumen is obliterated by a solid mass

of tissue grossly suspicious for tumor. Labeled Bl, anterior cervix and endocervix; 82,
lower uterine segment and lower uterus; B3, endometrium, myometrium and anterior serosa;
B4, posterior cervix and endocervix; B5, posterior lower uterine segment and lower uterine
wall; B6, posterior endometrium, myometrium and serosa; B7, fallopian tube; B8, ' vary
with small papillary cyst and surface tumor; B9, area of cyst with solid area. ﬂ

The third container is additionally labeled "L external iliac LN,” and contains a single
piece of yellow adipose tissue with a small lymph node measuring 0.5 cm in greatest

dimension —

The fourth container is labeled "gastrocolic omentum,n and contains an aggregate of yellow
adipose tissue measuring 3.5 X 2.5 x 0.7 cm. Two small tan nodules are present within the
adipose tissue.

The fifth container is also labeled "omentectmmyﬂI It contains a 15 x 5.5 x 2.0 cm
aggregate of lobulated fat. Several ill-defined solid areas are present within the omental
fat. The largest measures approximately 2 cm in dimension, which on cut section contain
streaks of white fibrous tissue interdigitating among the adipose tissue. No definite
nodular masses are identified.
