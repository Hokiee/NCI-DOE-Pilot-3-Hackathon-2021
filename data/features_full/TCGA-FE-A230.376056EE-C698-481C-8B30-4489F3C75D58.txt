***'*GROSS DESCRIPTION:**"*

The specimens are received in three properly labeled containers, one of
which is submitted for frozen section, with the patient' 5 name and
accession number.

The specimen is designated ”left thyroid lobe, thyroid CA?,
stitch=superior pole' and consists of a 37.2 gram thyroid lobe measuring
5.7 x 4.2 x 3.2 cm that is oriented with a stitch designating superior
pole. There are no lymph nodes or parathyroid glands and the capsule is
inked black. The isthmic edge is inked yellow and cut section reveals a
4.4 x 4.0 x 2.2 cm thinly encapsulated nodule. The nodule abuts the
capsular surface and is 0.2 cm from the isthmic edge. The nodule is
composed of tan friable tissue with focal areas of hemorrhage. The
uninvolved adjacent thyroid parenchyma is tan—pink to red—brown. A frozen
section was performed and cassette AFl is resubmitted as received. (P) Rs

Summary of Cassettes: AFl, nodule, frozen section; Al—2, nodule and
isthmic edge, perpendicular; A3, nodule and thyroid capsule, perpendicular;
A4, nodule and adjacent uninvolved thyroid parenchyma; A5, uninvolved
thyroid parenchyma

The specimen is designated “right thyroid lobe, stitch=superior

pole" and consists of an 11.7 gram thyroid lobe that measures 5.0 x 4.0 x
1.6 cm. The capsular surface is inked black and the isthmic edge is inked

yellow. There is one possible lymph node identified measuring 0.6 cm in

greatest dimension. Cut section through the thyroid reveals two areas of
modularity measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm and 1.7 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm. Both of

these areas are located in the inferior half of the lobe and are 0.8 and

1.1 cm from the isthmic edge, respectively. RS 5

Summary of Cassettes: Bl, isthmic edge, shave; 82—3, larger nodular
area; B4, smaller nodular area; 35. one lymph node

- The specimen is designated "mass overlying anterior cricoid"

and consists of two tan—pink nodes that measure 0.7 and 1.2 cm in greatest

dimension. The larger node is bisected and reveals dark pink homogeneous
rubbery tissue. TE 2

Summary of Cassettes: Cl, larger node, bisected; C2, smaller node
