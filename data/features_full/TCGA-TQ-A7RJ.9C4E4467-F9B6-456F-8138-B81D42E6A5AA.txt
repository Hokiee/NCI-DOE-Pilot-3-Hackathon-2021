Nature of material: Brain

Received on: WWW (L7! 3

Macroscopy: Qt») 10/4” '3
Received in formalin, two fragments of soft and brown-brownish tissue measuring jointly

5.5 X 4.0 X 1.5 cm. Received, in the same vial, four smaller fragments, composed of
soft and brownish tissue measuring jointly 1.0 X 0.8 X 0.3 cm.

Microscopy:

Sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin show brain tissue infiltrated by glial
neoplasm with two distinct cellular patterns. One is represented by cells with round
nuclei, loose chromatin and frequent clear perinuclei halos. Are arranged in bit fibrillar
matrix which displays a network of support branched capillaries. The other pattern is
formed by cells with irregular hyperchromatic nuclei and indistinct cytoplasm limits. They
come up on fibrillar matrix with frequent cysts. It is note the occasional secondary
structures of Scherer and some lymphocytic perivascular cuffs. It is not observed mitotic
figures, necrotic feel or areas of microvascular proliferation. The lesion shows strong
and diffuse positivity for GFAP and presents cellular proliferation index, estimated by Kl-
67 immunostaining of about 1%.

Diagnosis:
Resection product of lesions in the parietal lobe (side not speciﬁed): - Oligoastrocitoma
(grade II — WHO, 2007).
