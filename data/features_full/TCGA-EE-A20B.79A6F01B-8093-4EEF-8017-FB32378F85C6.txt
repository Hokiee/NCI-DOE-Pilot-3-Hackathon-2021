Size of tumour: ~20 x 20 x 18mm (macroscopic) .

Tumour description: nests and sheets of pleomorphic, mitotically active (up to 17 per mm?) epithelioid and
spindle cells

Distance to nearest margin: ~Smm (deep)

Other comments: the features are in keeping with melanoma; as the tumour does not show an epidermal
connection and a junctions] melanocytic component is not identiﬁed, it is likely to be a
recurrence/metastasis; the tumour cells are positive for 8-100, HMB-45 and Melan-A.

The sections show a lymph node. No evidence of malignancy is seen in the sections stained with
haematoxylin-eosin, 8-100 and HMB—45. “I”
