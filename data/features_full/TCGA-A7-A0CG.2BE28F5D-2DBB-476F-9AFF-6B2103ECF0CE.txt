CLINICAL HISTORY: -year—old white female with lobular carcinoma.

PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Left breast cancer. POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: Left
breast cancer.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS

GROSS DESCRIPTION

‘33 A. Container A is labeled with the patient's name,
medical

record number and "right axillary sentinel lymph node".
The specimen container holds a single piece of fibrofatty tissue.
When dissected, there are four separate lymph nodes. The largest
measures 1.8 X 1.5 x 1 cm. The remainder three smaller lymph nodes
average 0.3 cm. AS—AFSl, AFSZ — One lymph node bisected; AFS3 —
three remaining nodes.

B. Container B is labeled "left axillary sentinel lymph

node". The specimen container holds a single rubbery tan
lymph node, measuring 1.5 x l x 1 cm. AS-Block BPS-1, BPS-2 —
Bisected.

C. Container C is labeled with the patient's name,
medical

GROSS DESCRIPTION

record number and "right breast". The specimen container
holds a single piece of fatty tissue, oriented by two sutures and
measuring 5 cm. from medial to lateral, 3.1 cm. from anterior to
posterior and 3 cm. from superior to inferior. The specimen

margins

are inked as follows: Blue—anterior, black—posterior, red—
superior,

green—inferior, yellow—medial, orange—lateral. The specimen is

serially sectioned. On cut section, there is a firm tan mass,

measuring 2.1 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm., located approximately 3 mm. from the

inferior margin of resection. ASCl-ClS.
D. Received fresh labeled "left breast biopsy" is a 4.5
cm
(anterior to posterior) x 4.3 cm (medial to lateral) x 2.1
cm (superior to inferior) diffusely cauterized soft, lobulated,
tan—gold—white portion of fibroadipose tissue with two sutures, as
stated previously. The superior surface appears in keeping with
the
lining of a prior breast biopsy. The margins are inked as follows:
Superior - blue, inferior - black, medial - green, and lateral —
orange. The specimen is sectioned from anterior to posterior. Cut
surfaces throughout the specimen consist predominantly of
glistening
lobulated golden yellow adipose tissue with a moderate amount of
interspersed dense, focally nodular, tan-white fibrous tissue. No
definitive mass lesion is noted. The specimen is entirely
submitted
in a sequential manner from anterior to posterior in 9 blocks, as
labeled. AS-9.
/ E. Received fresh labeled "superior margin" is a 2.5 cm
(a (anterior to posterior) x 1.8 cm (medial to lateral) x 1.7
cm (superior to inferior) soft, lobulated tan-gold—white portion of
fibroadipose tissue with two sutures, as stated previously. The
margins are inked as follows: Superior — blue, inferior - black,
medial - green, and lateral — orange. The specimen is sectioned
from anterior to posterior. The cut surfaces consist predominantly
of glistening lobulated golden yellow adipose tissue with a
moderate
amount of interspersed tan—white fibrous tissue. No discrete mass
lesion or abnormality is identified. The specimen is entirely

GROSS DESCRIPTION
submitted in a sequential manner from anterior to posterior in five
blocks, as labeled. AS-S.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 ~ Perpendicular sections entire anterior margin
cap, 2-4 — sequential sections, 5 — perpendicular sections entire
posterior margin cap.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
A. Sections of the right axillary sentinel lymph node
demonstrate no evidence of metastasis in four lymph nodes.
The lymph nodes in sections ASFl through ASF3 were examined by
rig multi-level sectioning with H&E stain, as well as the

immunohistochemistry for pankeratin.
B. The left axillary sentinel lymph node demonstrates no
evidence of metastatic disease in one lymph node.
Sections
BFSl and BPSZ are examined by multi-level sectioning with H&E
staining as well as the immunohistochemistry for pankeratin.

of the left breast.

Invasive Carcinoma: Present.
