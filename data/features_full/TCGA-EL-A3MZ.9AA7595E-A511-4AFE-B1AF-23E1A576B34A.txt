GROSS DESCRIPTION ' P g
(A) SEROMA CAPSULE - Muitiple fragments of yellow and red fibroadipose tissue go
and skeletal muscle (6.0 x 4.5 x .0 cm). A few of the ieces have a smooth.
membranous surface consistent with a capsule. No other esions are grossly
identified. Representative sections are submitted in A1 and A2.
(8) TOTAL THYROIDECTOMY AND TRACHEAL RESECTION ~ The entire spec1men measures
10.5 x 8.0 x 5.0 cm and con515ts of a segment of trachea (2.5 cm long). and
attached thyroid and overlyin skeletal muscle (8.0 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm). The
right therTd lobe is unremar able.
There is a palpable, visible mass in the left thyroid lobe. The adjacent
tracheal mucosa is raised and centrally uicerated over an area of 1.8 x 1.1
cm. Sectioning reveals a tan pink, firm, Infiltrating mass (3.6 x 2.5 x 2.0
cm). which extends into and through the tracheal wall and whithin 1 mm of the
superior and Inferior soft tissue margins of resection. There is focal
0551f1cation of the trachea. One rounded. tan fleshy and hemorrhagic
extension of the mass is designated by the surgeon as a probable involved
paratracheal lym h node. .
INK CODE: 8 ue — soft tissue margin; black - superior mucosal edge.
