FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

  

KIDNEY, RIGHT, RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY—

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION.

some; ow?

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR CELL) TYPE, 13. 5 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION.

FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE IIIIV.
TUMOR EXTENDS BEYOND THE RENAL CAPSULE INTO PERINEPHRIC FAT, ON BOTH MACROSCOPIC AND

INVASION OF THE RENAL VEIN AND IT’ 3 BRANCHES IS IDENTIFIED.
NO EVIDENCE OF ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IS IDENTIFIED

THE RENAL VEIN MARGIN IS INVOLVED BY TUMOR AND CONTAINS TUMOR THROMBUS.
ARTERIAL, URETERIC AND SOFT TISSUE MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR ‘
THE NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY SHOWS CHRONIC GLOMERULONEPHRITIS AND MODERATE RENAL

HYPERTENSIVE VASCULAR DISEASE.
THE ADRENAL GLAND IS FREE OF TUMOR.
