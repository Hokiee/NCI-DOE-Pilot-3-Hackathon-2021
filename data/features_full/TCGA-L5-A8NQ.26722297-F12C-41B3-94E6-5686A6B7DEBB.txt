OPER DAVE: RED DOC:
VERIFIED BY:

-year-old male recently diagnosed with poorly differentiated squamous cell
carcinoma of mid-esophagus. Transhiatal esophagectomy/Tunor esophagus l. x 4 cm
tumor 7cm above GE junction.

VERIFIED BY:

1. l'Esophagus". 9.5 x 3.5 cm previously opened specimen of distal mid and
distal esophagus and proximal stomach with 12 x. 5 x 2 cm fragment of the
periesophageal and perigastric fat. Specimen includes 7 cm of the distal '
esophagus and approximately 3. 5 cm of the proximal stomach. 2.5 x 1.5 cm ulcer
situated 2.5 cm distal to the proximal resection edge. The mucosa proximal and
the distal from this lesion is wrinkled, gray and glistening. The gastric
folds are pink-tan and unremarkable. The serial section through the lesion
which occupies approximately 50% of the esophagea circumference reveal maximuu
depths of invasion 1.2 cm througi the lamina propria inked of the
It approaches deep resection margin within less than 0.1 cm.

1A. Distal gastric margin. (Shaved).

13-E. Consecutive sections of the longitudinal stirp of the mucosa from
cephalea to caudal, distal margin inked green.

1F. Deepest tuner extension.

113. Additional tumor section.

1H. Additional tumor section. Multiple possible lymph nodes identified in the
areas of esophageal and parigastric fat submitted in cassette 11.

2. ”Cervical esophageal margin”. 2.5 cm segment of the tubal esophagus stapled
at one end with great wrinkled, unremarkable moose. Sectioned. Submitted.

 

2A.

3. ”Gastro hepatic ligament" Z x 1 x 0.5 cm fragnent of brown-tan adipose.
Entirely submitted.

4. ”Left jugular lymph node”. 1 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm lynph node. Entirely submitted
in cassette 4.
