"RIGHT CHEST WALL LESION STITCH SUPERIOR".

The sections show skin to the level of subcutaneous tissue. Sections of both of the nodules, which lie within
the subcutis, show that they are well circumscribed and partially pseudoencapsulated cellular nodules
composed of malignant epithelioid and spindled cells. The cells have high nuclear: cytoplasmic ratio, large,
pleomorphic oval nuclei containing prominent nucleoli, and with moderate amounts of amphophilic
cytoplasm with focal intracytoplasmic brown pigment. Numerous mitotic ﬁgures and apoptotic bodies are
seen. There are areas of necrosis. The largest nodule lies 0.5mm from the deep margin and 8mm from the 12
o'clock margin, and the second nodule lies 7mm from 6 o'clock. The tumour cells show patchy strong
nuclear staining for SlOO and are positive for HMB45 and Melan A. The combination of features are
consistent with melanoma.
