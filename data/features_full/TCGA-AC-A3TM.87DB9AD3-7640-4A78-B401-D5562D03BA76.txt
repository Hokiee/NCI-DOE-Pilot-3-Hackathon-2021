DIAGNOSIS:

A Right axillary sentinel lymph node #1:
Metastatic lobular carcinoma involving subcapsular sinuses (detected by panqiokeratin lHC stains only; greater than 200 individual cells
identiﬁed 111)

8. Right axillary sentinel lymph node #2 excision:
Metastatic tabular carcinoma involving subcapsular sinuses (detectable by pancytokeratln IHC only; fewer than 200 cells identiﬁed- 111).

C. Right axillary sentinel lymph node #3, excision:
Single lymph node negative for metastatic tumor by routine sections and pancytokerah‘n immunohietochemistry (0/1).

D. Right axillary sentinel lymph node #4. excision:
Single lymph node negative for metastatic tumor by routine sections and pancytokeratin lmmunohistochemistry (0/1).

E. Right breast. simple mastectomy:
in situ and invasive tabular carcinoma, with invasive tumor measuring up to 7 cm in maximal dimension grossly.
Invasive lobular carcinoma is BloomRichardson grade ll (architectural score - 3; nuclear grade « 2: mitotic rate — 1).
No evidence of angiolymphatic invasion.
Random sections through the quadrants show an isolated microscopic loci of invasive tabular carcinoma well away from the main tumor mess.
Negative deep inked surgical margin of resection.
Nipple with extensive LClS colonizing lactiferous ducts.
Prognostic markers have been previously reported, but because of duration from diagnosis will be repeated on block E7. Addendum report to
follow.

“cease DESCRIPTION.
The specimen is received in ﬁve containers labeled with the patients name

A. Container A is additionally labeled ’right axilla sentinel node #1‘ and contains a 1.5 cm yellow~lan ﬁrm fatty nodule consistent with lymph node. The
specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section with the residual entirely resubmitted for permanent section in cassette a labeled -

B. Container B is additionally labeled 'n’ght axillary sentinel node 32' and contains a 0.7 cm yellow-tan ﬁrm fatty nodule consistent with possible lymph
node. The nodule is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette 8 labeled

1.2 cm yellow-tan ﬁrm fatty nodule is identiﬁed consistent with possible lymph node. This nodule is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette C labeled

D. Container 0 is additionally labeled 'right axillary sentinel node #4‘ and contains a 0.9 om yellow-tan ﬁrm fatty nodule consistent with lymph node. The
specimen is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette D labeled ,

E. Container E is additionally labeled ‘right breast and contains a 625 gram. 22.0 x 14.5 x 4.0 an simple mastectomy specimen partially surfaced by
210 x 9.5 cm ellipse oi pink-tan wrinkled skin bearing a central 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm averted nipple. Orientation is not offered or possible. Located 3.8 cm
from the nipple is a 2.0 cm in length well delineated. partly healed sar. The deep margin is inked and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 7.0 x
3.4 x 3.0 cm ill-deﬁned gray‘white mass that resides 2.5 cm below the skin and approaches to within 1.8 cm of the inked deep margin. The remainder of
the cut surface is comprised of yellow-tan ﬁbroadlpose tissue with no additional lesions identiﬁed. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes Ei
