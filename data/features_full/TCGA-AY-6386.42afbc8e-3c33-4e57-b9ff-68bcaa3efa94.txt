SURGICAL PATHOLOGY

Surgical Pathology Report

Diagnosis:
Colon, right, colectomy

Tumor Histologic Type: Invasive adenocarcinoma with mucinous features
Histologic Grade: Moderately differentiated

Tumor Location: Cecum with extension into ileocecal valve

Depth of Invasion: Through muscularis propria into the pericolic soft tissue
Lymphovascular Invasion: Not identified

Perineural Invasion: Not identified

Margins:

Proximal margin: Negative, 4 cm from tumor

Distal margin: Negative, 8 cm from tumor

Circumferential (radial) margin (rectal tumors only): Not applicable
Mesenteric margin: Negative, 8 cm from tumor

Distance of carcinoma from closest margin (specify): 4 cm to proximal

Regional Lymph Nodes:
Total number with metastasis: 1
Total number examined: 19

Additional pathologic findings: Focal abscess formation adjacent to tumor

AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT3 lea
Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to change pending
clinical review and additional information.

Comment:

Multiple enlarged lymph nodes without carcinoma were identified. These lymph nodes contained numerous follicles that appeared
reactive. However, due to the large size of the lymph nodes, the number of follicles, and the patient' 5 age, immunostains for BCL2,
CD3 and CD20 were performed to exclude follicular or another low grade lymphoma. These stains reveal a benign reactive pattern

with no evidence of lymphoma.

Clinical History:
cecal cancer.

Gross Description:

Specimen fixation: formalin

Parts of bowel received: terminal ileum, cecum and ascending colon with attached fat
Specimen length: The terminal ileum is 4.5 cm in length and the large bowel is 12 cm in length.
Orientation: The cecal pouch where the tumor is inked blue.

Tumor dimensions: 5.5 x 4.7 x 1.3 cm with a mucinous cut surface.

Gross appearance of tumor: Central cratered ulcer with raised rolled borders, broad based configuration
Circumferential growth: n/a; in cecal pouch

Gross depth of invasion: through the muscularis propria and into the subjacent fat of the cecum

Gross evidence of perforation through visceral peritoneum: no

Luminal obstruction: no
Bowel circumference at tumor site: n/a (in cecal pouch)

Gross distance of tumor from margins: The tumor is located 4 cm from the proximal margin, 8 cm from the distal margin, 8 cm from
the radial mesenteric margin and focally abuts the deep blue inked serosa.

Lymph nodes: submitted as per block summary

Other remarkable findings: The remaining mucosa is velvety tan, and grossly unremarkable. The wall has a uniform thickness of
0.3 cm. No appendix is grossly identified. The mass focally extends onto the ileocecal valve.

Tissue submitted for special investigation: Tumor and normal are given to Tissue Procurement.
Digital photograph taken: no

A21 - two lymph node candidates

Light Microscopy:
Light microscopic examination is performed by Dr.

For cases in which immunostains are performed, the following applies:

Appropriate internal and/or external positive and negative controls have been evaluated. Some of the immunohistochemical
reagents used in this case may be classified as analyte specific reagents (ASR). These were developed and have performance
characteristics determined by theâ€” These reagents have not
been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is
not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This
laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of_) as qualified to perform high
complexity clinical laboratory testing.
