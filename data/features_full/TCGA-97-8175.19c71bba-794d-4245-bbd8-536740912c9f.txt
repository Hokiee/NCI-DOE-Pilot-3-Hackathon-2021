CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
- with a 4 cm LUL mass.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in four parts, each labeled with the

patient's name.

1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'left upper lobe wedge at 084

b'. It consists of a pre-incised wedge biopsy of the lung measuring

9 x 3.5 x 2 cm. The stapled line measures 9 cm in length. The
stapled line is shaved and the pleura around is inked black. At the
pre-incised area there is a grey-white firm nodule measuring 2 x 1.1
x 1.1 cm located 0.4 cm from the stapled line margin. The remainder
of the parenchyma is pink-red and crepitant. Frozen section
performed on the nodule and resubmitted for permanent section.
Representative sections are submitted.

2. Part two is received in saline, labeled 'level 5 lymph node'. It
consists of two pieces of tan-brown soft tissue measuring 1.0 x 0.8
x 0.3 cm and 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted.

3. Part three is received fresh, labeled 'completion left upper
lobectomy'. It consists of a 176 gram left upper lobe of the lung
measuring 23 x 6.5 x 4 cm. There are two staple lines at the medial
aspect of the specimen measuring 11 cm and 11.5 cm. The staples are
removed and this margin is inked black. The pleural surface is

inked blue. The specimen is serially sectioned from superior to
inferior. There is no grossly palpable mass or lesion identified.
Representative sections are submitted.

4. Part four is received in saline, labeled 'level 9 lymph node'.
It consists of a piece of tan-brown soft tissue measuring 0.9 x 0.4
x 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted.

ADDENDUM # 1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS:

EGFR, KRAS and ALK (FISH) was sent on for atient
The test is to be performed on tissue from case
date The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited

accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose
signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,
examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1C appropriate to
the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. 1 H& E and 9
unstained slides were prepared and forwarded t- where the
subject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be
issued when the results of this molecular test are available.

ADDENDUM #2:

EGFR Mutation Analysis

Referring Physician: _

Body Site: Left upper lobe of lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: No mutation detected.

INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided
for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma

patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be

responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.

COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 80% tumor
cellularity upon pathologist review.

A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was
identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
significance.

Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with
differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among
patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.

This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell

lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change
during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this
result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation

in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.

This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.

METHOD:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is

selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary electrophoresis
and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or negative results may
occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic
heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

 

DISCLAIMER:
This test was develo ed and its performance characteristics
determined by The laboratory is regulated under the

Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of - (CLIA) as
qualified to perform high complexity clinical testing. This
particular test is not considered a stand alone test and should be
used only in the context of other diagnostic tests or clinical
work-up related to treatment decisions.

MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY

KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS

 
     

Referring Physician:
Body Site: Left upper lobe of lung
Specimen Type: Slides

Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma

RESULTS: Wild-type gene.

INTERPRETATION:
No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.

COMMENT:

Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor
prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS
mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly
associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.

This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of

the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for
use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh,
frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular
the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal
cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these
mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor
KRAS mutations (e. g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,
etc.).

Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide
additional information regarding this patient's probability of
response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if

clinically indicated. See references.

METHOD/LIMITAT IONS:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single

nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

ADDENDUM 3:

Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH)

    

Body Site: Left upper lobe of Lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma

INTERPRETATION:
Negative for a rearrangement involving the ALK gene.

Probe #Nuclei Examined % Positive Nuclei %
Control values

2p23(ALK)V 100 0 <15.0

A total of 100 cells were scored.

FINDINGS: FISH was performed on araffin embedded tissue sections
using dual color break-apart probe_ to the ALK
gene at 2p23. This probe ﬂanks the entire gene. If a rearrangement
involving ALK is present, inversion or translocation, one of the two
probe signals separates as one red (orange) and one green signal. In
this specimen, separated signals were present in 0.5% of the nuclei
scored. Based on laboratory validation data, these results are

within the normal limits.

COMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 27.0% of
cells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals

represents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosomes
2/2p ALK region. Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in

NSCLCs, although the significance of extra co ies of the ALK ene in
luni carcinoma is unclear at this time —g
