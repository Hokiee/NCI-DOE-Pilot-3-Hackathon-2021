*** Diagnosis / Diagnoses: ***

1.: Lymph node with coarse nodular metastasis from a moderately differentiated
adenocarcinoma of the colorectal type and thus apparently a metastasis from one of the
colorectal carcinomas listed under 2: primarily from the carcinoma located in the sigmoid
colon.

2.: Resectate of a portion of the colon or rectosigmoid colon with two synchronous
colorectal carcinomas:

A rectum carcinoma conforming to the histological type of a moderately differentiated
adenocarcinoma, extending no closer than 3 cm to the aboral resection margin and with a
diameter of 3.5 cm. Invasive spread of tumor as far as the level of the internal portions of
the muscularis propria.

An ulcerated colon or sigmoid colon carcinoma conforming to the histological type of a
moderately differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma, extending no closer than 12.5 cm to
the aboral resection margin and with a greatest diameter of 4 cm. Invasive spread of
tumor into the neighboring mesocolic fatty tissue with lymphangitic strands of tumor
cells in the margins of the tumor.

Oral and aboral resection margins tumor-free.

Nine of 33 lymph nodes with extensive metastases, sometimes larger than the lymph
node capsule, from the colorectal carcinoma(s).

Tumor stage thus

pT2 L0, V0; G2 for the rectum carcinoma

pT3 L1 V0; G2 for the sigmoid colon carcinoma

pN2 (10/34)
