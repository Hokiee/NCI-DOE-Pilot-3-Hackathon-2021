SPECIMEN

Right colon

CLINICAL NOTES

PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Right colon cancer.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

Received fresh labeled "right colon" is a previously

unopened, 29 cm. segment of proximal right colon with
attached 10 cm. of distal ileum surfaced by smooth to scabrous tan
pink serosa with a copious amount of attached mesocolon and
mesentery. An unremarkable 6.2 cm. in length, 0.3 cm. in diameter
appendix is present. The proximal and distal margins measure 3.2
and 5.6 cm. in circumference respectively. On opening, there is a
well circumscribed, 5.2 x 4.0 cm. rubbery pale tan tumor located 3.8
cm. distal to the ileocecal valve. The tumor has the maximal
thickness of 1.2 cm., grossly extending into the muscularis propria,
to within 0.2 cm. of the inked free radial serosal surface. A
portion of tumor and a portion of normal mucosa are submitted for
tissue procurement as requested. The ileum and remaining colonic
mucosa are unremarkable tan pink with regular folds and the walls
average 0.5 cm. in thickness. Several slightly rubbery tan white
tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 1.4 cm. in
greatest dimension are recovered from the attached mesocolon and
mesentery. Representative sections are submitted in 12 blocks as
labeled.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — proximal and distal margins; 2 through 4 — tumor
full thickness to inked radial serosal surface (black); 5 - tumor to
distal normal mucosa; 6 - ICV; 7 - random colon; 8 - appendix; 9 -
six whole lymph nodes; 10 — four wh lymph nodes; 11 and 12 — one
bisected lymph node per cassette.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma

Histologic grade: Moderately-differentiated

Primary tumor (pT2): Carcinoma into, but not completely through,

the muscularis propria.

Proximal/distal/radial margins: Negative.

Vascular invasion: Negative.

Regional lymph nodes (pN): Twelve negative lymph nodes (0/l2).

Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: Not identified.

Other findings: appendix with fibrous luminal obliteration; ileum
unremarkable.

 

DIAGNOSIS
Terminal ileum, cecum, appendix, proximal colon, right
hemicolectomy:
Adenocarcinoma, moderately-differentiated, with invasion into,
but not through, the muscularis propria.
Negative margins of excision.
Angiolymphatic invasion not identified.
Twelve negative lymph nodes (0/l2).
