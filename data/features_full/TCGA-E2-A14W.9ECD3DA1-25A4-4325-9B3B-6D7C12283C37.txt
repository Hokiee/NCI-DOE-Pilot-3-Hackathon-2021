INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:
TPA/T PB - SLN #1/SLN #2: Negative for tumor cells.
TPDn‘ PF - SLN #3/SLN #4: Negative for tumor.
Called by Dr to Dr, at I (A, B). (D) and 1 (F).
C - left breast: (gross exam only) 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm tumor located 1.2 cm from the closest/deep margin; tumor extends
to the nipple and areola, called by Dr. to Dr. at

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. SLN #1
Received fresh is a tiny piece of lymphoid tissue within ﬁbroadipose tissue, 0.4 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. A touch prep is
performed; submitted entirely in cassette A1. _
B. SLN #2 ,
Received fresh is a piece of lymphoid tissue within fibroadipose tissue, 0.4 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. A touch prep is performed;
submitted entirely in cassette B1.
C. LEFT BREAST, STITCH AT AXILLARY TAIL
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "left breast, stitch in axillary tail" is an oriented 3929, 20 x
14.5 x 2 cm mastectomy with 11.5 x 5.2 skin ellipse and 1.6cm inverted and ulcerated nipple. lnk code:
Anterior/superior—blue, anterior/inferior-orange, posterior-black. The specimen is serially sectioned into 18 slices
from medial to lateral with the nipple in slice 5 revealing a 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm white-tan ﬁrm well-circumscribed mass
beneath the nipple, present in slices 5 to 7 that is 1.2 cm from the deep margin. A gross diagnosis was conveyed to
OR and tissue is procured. Representatively submitted:
c1-cz: slice 5, mass and extension to nipple
C3: slice 5, mass and deep margin
C4: slice 6, superior posterior mass
CS: slice 6, anterior inferior mass
CS: slice 6, inferior posterior mass
C7: slice 7, mass and normal appearing parenchyma
CB: slice 8, normal appearing parenchyma adjacent to mass
CS: slice 3, upper inner quadrant
C10: slice 9, upper outer quadrant
C11: slice 10, lower outer quadrant
C12: slice 4, lower inner quadrant
C13: skin
C14-C17: nipple
C18: 1 axillary lymph node
D. SLN #3
Received fresh is a lymph node, 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. A touch prep is performed and the lymph node is submitted
entirely for cassette D1.
E. UPPER OUTER QUADRANT LEFT BREAST; STITCH AT NEW UPPER OUTER MARGIN
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "upper outer quadrant lett breast; stitch at new upper
outer margin" is an oriented 37g, 9 x 6.3 x 0.8 cm ﬁbrofatty tissue. Final margin is inked black. Serial sectioning
reveals no discrete lesions. Representatively submitted in cassettes E1-E6.
F. SLN #4
Received fresh is a lymph node, 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. A touch prep is performed; submitted entirely in cassette F 1.
G. INFERIOR MEDIAL BREAST-LEFT; STITCH AT DEEP MARGIN

Received fresh labeled with the patient‘s identiﬁcation and "inferior medial breast-left; stitch at deep margin" is an
oriented 3g. 4.1 x 2.5 x 0.6 cm ﬁbrofatty tissue. Final margin is inked black. Serial sectioning reveals no discrete
lesions. Entirely submitted in cassettes GI-G4.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1, LEFT AXILLA, BIOPSY:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NO TUMOR SEEN (0/1).

B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2. LEFT AXILLA, BIOPSY:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NO TUMOR SEEN (0/1).

c. BREAST, LEFT, MASTECTOMY:
- - INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, POORLY DIFFERENTIATED
‘Wm OF THE NIPPLE.
- TUMOR MEASURES 2.5 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION.
. MARGINS, NO TUMOR SEEN.
- ONE LYMPH NODE WITH NON-NECROTIZING GRANULOMAS, NO TUMOR
SEEN (om (SEE NOTE).

NOTE: Special stains have been ordered on the lymph node and those results will be reported in an addendum. A
C031 stain has been ordered for evaluation of lymphvascular invasion and those results will be reported in an
addendum.

D. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #3, LEFT AXILLA, BIOPSY:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NO TUMOR SEEN (0/1).

E. BREAST, LEFT. UPPER OUTER QUADRANT, EXCISION:
- FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NO TUMOR SEEN.

F. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #4, LEFT AXILLA, BIOPSY:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NO TUMOR SEEN (0/1).

G. BREAST, LEFT, INFERIOR MEDIAL MARGIN, EXCISION:
- FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NO TUMOR SEEN.

ADDENDUM:
NOTE: A CDSI stain was performed on C4 and is negative showing no evidence of lymphvascular invasion. Special

stains (GMS, AFB, PAS) were performed on the lymph node (C18) and are negative showing no evidence of funoal
or acid fast organisms. The non-necrotizing granulomas would be consistent with the patient's history
