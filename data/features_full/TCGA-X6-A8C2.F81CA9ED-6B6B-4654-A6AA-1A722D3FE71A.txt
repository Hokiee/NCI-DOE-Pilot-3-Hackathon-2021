A. Received fresh are two red—brown soft tissue fragments, 0.6 to 0.7 an

in greatest dimension. A frozen section is performed and the tissue is

consumed. 3. Received rtesh is a 1.1 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm red-brown soft tissue

frequent with cautery. A frozen section is performed and the tissue is

consumed. C. Received tresh is a 1.8 x 1.2 x 1.1 cm zed—brown sat: tissue

E. Received in formalin is a 2.2 x 1.9 x 1.0 cu ragged red tendinous soft
