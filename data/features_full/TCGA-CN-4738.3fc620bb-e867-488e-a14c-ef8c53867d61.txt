GROSS DESCRIPTION:

Part 1: The specimen is submitted fresh with the pattent‘s name and ”left neck levels 2-4". it consists of adipose tissue {12.0 x 6.0
x 1.8 cm), grossly unremarkable. Sections submitted as follows:

1A — two lymph nodes bisected (level 2)

18-10 H one lymph node bisected per cassette (level 2)

1E — 0 lymph nodes (level 2)

1F — four lymph nodes (level 2)

1G — six lymph nodes (level 3)

1H — six lymph nodes (level 4)

ti — two lymph nodes (level 4).

Part 2: The specimen ls submitted fresh with the attent’s name and "right neck levels 2-4". it consists of adipose tissue (11.0 x
7.0 x 1.5 cm), grossly unremarkable. Sections su milled as follows:

2A - six lymph nodes (level 2)

2B — two lymph nodes (level 8)

26 u- one lymle node bisecteg (level 3)

2D — one tymp node blsecte (evel 4)

2E — one lymph node (level 4}.

Part 3: The specimen Is submitted fresh with the pattent‘s name and “left superior laryngeal nerve”. It consists of a small tissue
fragment (0.9 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm). The specimen is submitted in tote in one cassette.

Part 4: The specimen ts submitted fresh with the patients name and “total laryngectomytneck dissection”. It conststs of a total
laryngectomy specimen (9.0 x 7.5 x 4.0 cm) including hyotd bone {4.5 x 0.4 x 0. ). la nx from eptglottls to subglottts and seven
tracheal rings. The anterior part of the specimen shows a lracheostomy site with a s In ellipse measuring 2.0 x 0.0 Cm. On
opening the larynx posteriorly, there is an Irregular white friable ulcerated area of 1.2 x 0.9 cm, located in the tell hemllarynx. neatr
the mtdllne, invkoing the left ventricle (lrensglottto). On serial section. the mass ( .0 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm) Crosses the mklllne and
involves the me let aspect of the right true vocal cord. which Is edemaloUe. The mass Invades anterior y the orlcol ytold
membrane and also adjacent muscle. The mass Is 3.7 Cm from the distal tracheal mar in. The closes margin ts the anterior soft
tissue margin at approximately 0.3 cm. The antertor surface ts covered by red/brown so tissue. which is grossly unremarkable. A
left thyroid lobe is 9.2 gram and measures 0.0 x 2.3 x 'l.2 cm. It Is covered by a thin capsule. Oh sectioning, the unltolm dark
brown parenchyma ls grossly unremarkable. No parathyroid is Identified. Digital pictures were taken.
