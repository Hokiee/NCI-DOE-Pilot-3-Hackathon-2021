Comment '

This is a large locally invasive papillary carcinoma with striking cn'brifonn architecture. No morules are identiﬁed. The
cribrl'form morular variant of papillary carcinoma is usually associated with familial polyposis coli and a gerrnline APC
mutation; in this case, the full features of this variant are not identiﬁed but the prominent and unusual cn'briform
architecture suggest that further investigation for an underlying genetic predisposition may be warranted.

The specimen labeled with the palient's name and as "right hemithyroidectomy stitch upper pole" consists of a right
hemithyroidectomy specimen that is oriented with a suture and weighs 52.9 g. The lobe measures 6.8 cm SI x 4.4 cm ML
x 3.6 cm AP and the isthmus measures 2.2 St x 0.7 cm ML x 0.8 cm AP. The external surfaces have ﬁbrous adhesions.
No parathyroid glands or lymph nodes are identiﬁed grossly. The external surface is painted with blue dye. The lobe is
almost completely replaced by a delineated solid nodule that measures 5.1 cm SI x 4.3 cm ML x 3.5 cm AP. A small rim
of compressed normal tissue is identiﬁed. Sections of nodule and normal tissue are stored frozen. The remainder of the
specimen is submitted as follows:

1A—AA lobe, superior to inferior

1AB-AC isthmus

Microscopic Descriﬂgn

 

m Pageégg

_ Surgical Pathology Consultation Report .

The dominant tumor has central degeneration consistent with the site of previous biopsy; there is artefactual displacement

of tumor into vascular channels at this site. The tumor Is negative for nuclear transformation of betacatenin; intact
membranous staining is identiﬁed. Only scattered leukocytes stain for CBS.
