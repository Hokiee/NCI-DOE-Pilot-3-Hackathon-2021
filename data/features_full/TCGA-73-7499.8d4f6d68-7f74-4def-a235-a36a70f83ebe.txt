UPPER LOBE LUNG

ecere fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "right upper lobe" is a right upper
lung lobectomy specimen, weighing 198 grams and measuring 16 x 8 x 3.2 cm. The pleural surface
demonstrates an area of puckering, 2.1 x 1.3 cm, inked black. Sectioning shows a gray-tan mass
measuring 3 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm, located approximately 2 cm from bronchial margin and 1.3 cm from pleural
surface. The remainder of the specimen shows pink red congested lung parenchyma. A portion of the
specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representative sections submitted:
H1 : Bronchial margin from the frozen section
H2: Tumor section, from the frozen section
H3-4: Tumor with pleura

H5: Tumor with closest bronchial branch

H6—7: Section from puckering area

H8: Uninvolved lung parenchyma

H9: Hilar lymph nodes

I. LEVEL 4R LYMPH NODES

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and "level 4R lymph nodes" are pieces of
yellow-tan soft tissue admixed with black-tan lymph nodes in aggregate measuring 3.1 x 2.4 x 0.6 cm;
submitted entirely in cassettes I1-I2.

J. LEVEL 7 LYMPH NODE

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and "level 7 lymph node" is an aggregate of
black-tan lymphoid tissue pieces, 3 x 2 x 0.7 cm; submitted entirely in cassettes J1 -J2.
