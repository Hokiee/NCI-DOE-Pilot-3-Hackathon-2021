Procedure:

Diagnosis

A. Sentinel lymph node, right axilla, biopsy: One negative lymph
node (0/1).

E. Breast, right, mastectomy: Invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3,
size 4. 5 cm in greatest dimension, with ductal carcinoma in- situ,
grade 3 with necrosis; negative margins of excision.

C. Breast, left, mastectomy: Focal atypical ductal hyperplasia;
negative margins of excision.

D. Lymph nodes, right axilla, regional resection: Four negative
lymph nodes (0/4).

Gross Description

A. Received unfixed for frozen section, labeled sentinel node right, is
a lymph node that is fat-replaced and 2 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm, entirely frozen
in 3 blocks.

B. Received unrixed for tissue procurement, labeled right breast, is a
1444 gram right breast that is unoriented and 23 cm medial to lateral,
22 cm superior to inferior, and 4.5 cm anterior to posterior. There is
an anterior black skin ellipse, 20 x 5 cm with 5 cm areola and 1.5 cm
nipple. There is a tan-gritty tumor at 12:00, up to 4.5 cm in greatest
dimension, and close to the anterior margin. Sections as follows: 1—6
continuous tumor, 7/8 tumor, 9 tumor, 10 RUQ random. 11 RLQ random, 12
LLQ random, 13 LUQ random, 14 nipple, 15 areola

C. Received unfixed, labeled left breast, is a portion of fibroadipose
breast tissue and skin that is 818 grams and 26 x 17 x 5 cm. Skin is
darkly pigmented, and without focal lesions. Sectioning through the
breast tissue shows no mass lesions. Representative sections in 8
blocks. ,

D. Received unfixed, labeled right axillary content, is a 9 x 7 x 2 cm
portion of fatty nodal tissue. Lymph nodes are identified: 1 one
node, 2 two nodes, 3 one node.
