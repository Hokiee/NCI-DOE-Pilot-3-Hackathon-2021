“had a right parietooccipital glioblastoma diagnosed a
few weeks ago, for resection of residual tumor.

OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
Craniotomy for brain tumor.

 

 

Operation/Specimen: A: Brain, excision biopsy

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:
Brain, site not specified, excision: Glioblastoma.

.See Comment.

COMMENT
The specimen contains portions of an astrocytic neoplastic proliferation that

effaces the brain tissue, and has nuclear anaplasia, mitotic figures,
microvascular cellular proliferation, and zones of necrosis, many with
pseudopalisading, i.e. a glioblastoma (WHO IV/IV).

Results—Comments

IMMUNOHESTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates gliofibrillogenesis by
neoplastic cells. A very small minority of cells over expresses the p53
protein. The CD163 depicts a prominent population of positive cells
intermingled with neoplastic cells. With the MIB—l there is a proliferation
index of about 16% in the more active areas.

Comment: The immune results are consistent with a high histological grade

glioma. The diagnosis remains as on the initial report.
