SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

COLLECTION DATE: -

SPECIMENS:

1. RIGHT LOWER LOBE WEDGE RESECTION
2. STATION 9 LYMPH NODE

3. STATION 7 LYMPH NODE

4. STATION 4 LYMPH NODE

DIAGNOSIS:

1. LUNG, RIGHT LOWER LOBE: WEDGE RESECTION

- SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA, POORLY DIFFERENTIATED (1.6 CM), SEE
NOTE.

- THE STAPLE LINE MARGIN IS FREE OF TUMOR.

Note: Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumor cells are
positive for p63 while negative for TTF-l, supporting the diagnosis.
A mucin stain is negative.

2. LYMPH NODE, LEVEL 9: BIOPSY
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/1).

3. LYMPH N ODE, LEVEL 7: BIOPSY
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/1).

4. LYMPH NODE, LEVEL 4: BIOPSY
- TWO LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/2).

CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
.ex-smoker with RLL NSCLC.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in saline, in four parts, each labeled with
the patient's name.

1. Part one is labeled 'right lower lobe wedge resection'. It

consists of a wedge biopsy of the lung measuring 11 x 7 x 2.8 cm.
The staple line measures 14 cm. The pleura are gray pink and
glistening. There is a yellow tan sub pleural firm nodule with ill
defined borders measuring 2 x 1.8 x 1.3 cm, located 1.6 cm from the
staple line margin. The staple line is shaved and the pleura around

the staple is inked blue. The pleural surface above the nodule is

inked black. The remainder of the parenchyma is pink red blotchy and
crepitant. No other nodule grossly identified. Representative

sections are submitted.

2. Part two is labeled 'station #9 lymph node'. It consists of one
soft red-black lymph node measuring 1 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm, which is
bisected. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

3. Part three is labeled 'station #7 lymph node'. It consists of
one soft red-black lymph node measuring 2.3 x 1 x 0.6 cm, which is
bisected. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

4. Part four is labeled 'station #4 lymph node'. It consists of two
soft red-black lymph nodes measuring 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm in
aggregate. Entirely submitted in one cassette.
