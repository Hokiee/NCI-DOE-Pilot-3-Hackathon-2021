GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received fresh, in five parts, labeled With the patient's name
and unit number.

Part A, "#1. Left pelvic sidewall deposits", consists of soft tissue fragments
of 2.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm.

Micro Al: Soft tissue fragments, 1 frag,

Part B, "#2. Right retroperitoneal mass stitch superior, long posterior tissue
bank", consists of a 35.5-9 tan/yellow lobulated multifocally disrupted
oriented soft tissue mass (5 x 5 x 4.5 cm) with a short stitch superior and
long stitch-lateral. The excision appears marginal grossly. The specimen is
inked per protocol. There is on the lateral aspect of the specimen additional
fatty piece attached measuring 2.7 x 2.1 x 0.6 cm. There is a tan/white
