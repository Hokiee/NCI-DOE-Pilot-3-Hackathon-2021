Clinical History:
The patient is a year'old female with a history of right breast mass

undergoing right breast lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy.

Comment
Cytokeratin stains are performed on the sentinel node (blocks A1 and A2).
However, the microscopic focus of carcinoma is not present on the deeper

sections used for lHC.

Specimens Received:
A: Sentinel Lymph Node Right Breast #1
B: Right Breast Lumpectomy

C: Right Axillary Contents

Gross Description:
The specimen is received in three containers, each labeled with the patient‘ 5

name and medical record number.

A. ContainerA is additionally identiﬁed as '1. sentinel lymph node, right

breast #1.‘ Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis is a 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm
blue-tan, ovoid lymph node candidate. The specimen is bisected and entirely
frozen in cassettes AlFS-AZ FS and read as 'AlFS~A2FS positive for metastatic
tumor < 2 mm‘ per Dr. The frozen section remnants are entirely submitted

in cassettes A1FS-A2FS.

8. Container B is additionally identified as '2. right breast lumpectomy; long

stitch lateral, short stitch superior.’ Received fresh and placed in formalin

is a 113.8 gm, oriented lumpectomy specimen. The specimen measures 7.2 cm from
lateral to medial, 11.0 cm from anterior to posterior, and 3,0 cm from superior

to inferior. The specimen is oriented with a double short suture at superior

and a double long suture at lateral.

The specimen is inked as follows:

superior blue
inferior black
anterior green

posterior red

The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into ten slices. The
central aspect of the specimen, within five slices, is notable for a
well—circumscribed, centrally spiculated, indurated, otherwise solid, firm,
white-pink mass. The mass measures 1.9 x 1.7 x 1.7 cm and abuts both the
inferior (black) and inferior/posterior (red/black) margins, diffusely. The
second slice from the lateral aspect of the mass shows an identifiable metallic
clip. The remainder of the specimen is devoid of additional discrete lesions
and is otherwise composed of soft, yellow tissue (85%) and intermixed,

glistening and soft, white parenchyma (15%).

Block summary:
Bl—BZ:lateral margin, serially sectioned
83-8105: entire specimen from lateral to medial, respectively

3106-8107: medial margin, serially sectioned

(Mass in cassettes 827, 828, 836-839, BSA-BS7, 874-877; clip in cassettes

assess.)

C. Container C is additionally identified as '3. right axillary contents.‘
Received fresh is a 8.0 x 5.0 x 2.5 cm portion of lobulated, yellow tissue. The

specimen is dissected for lymph node candidates.

Block summary:

C1: five lymph node candidates

C2: two lymph node candidates

C3: one lymph node candidate, bisected
C4: one lymph node candidate, bisected
CS: three lymph node candidates

C6: three lymph node candidates

C7: five lymph node candidates

C8: one lymph node candidate, bisected
C9: one lymph node candidate, bisected
C10: one lymph node candidate, bisected
C11: two lymph node candidates

C12: three lymph node candidates

C13: one lymph node candidate, bisected
C14: one lymph node candidate, bisected
C15: one lymph node candidate, bisected
C16: one lymph node candidate, bisected
C17-C19: one lymph node candidate, sectioned

(questionable multiple matted lymph nodes)

Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis:
AlFS-AZFS. Sentinel lymph node, right breast #1: Positive for metastatic tumor

<2 mm.
