Microscopic Description:

Sections demonstrate markedly hypercellular neoplasm consisting of sheets of moderately atypical
tumor cells. The neoplastic cells exhibit moderate nuclear pleomorphism, variably prominent
eosinophilic nucleolic and abundant weakly eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic figures are numerous.
Sheets of confluent tumor necrosis are present. Scattered hemosiderin-laden macrophages are
identiﬁed consistent with chronic hemorrhage. There is a background of acute hemorrhage, as well. The
adjacent brain pharenchyma is gliotic and edematous.
