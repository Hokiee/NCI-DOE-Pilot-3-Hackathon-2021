SOURCE OF TISSUE: 10 — Labeled #10, "left upper lobe".

GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received fresh is a 335 gram, 24.5 X 14.0 X 3.5cm left upper
lobectomy of iung. It is covered by a pink to red-purple, focally anthracotic stained pleura,
having up to 0.60m of attached bronchus. In the superior/inferior segment, there is a 2.6 x 1.8
x 1.6cm firm mass. The cut surfaces are tan, gritty, having irregular borders. This lies
approximately 3.00m from the hilar structures. The overlying pleura is glistening and
umbilicated. The remaining cut surfaces of the lung range from tan—pink to crepitant to areas
which are red—purple, soft and glistening. There are multiple palpable, hilar lymph nodes, 0.5
to 2.00m in greatest dimension. The cut surfaces of each are gray-black and anthracotic stained.
A representative section of each lymph node is submitted. Representative sections are
submitted in ten blocks.

DESIGNATION OF SECTIONS: 10A - bronchial and vascular margins, IOB thru 10E
~ tumor with inked pleural margin, 10F thru 10G ~ random lung sections, 10ch1u lOJ ~ hilar
lymph nodes.
