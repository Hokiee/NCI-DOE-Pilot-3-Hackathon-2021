HNAL DIAGNOSS: m llilllllllllllllllllllillllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

PART 1: UTERUS WITH CERVIX AND BILATERAL ADNEXA, TOTAL ABDOMINAL HYSTERECTOMY AND BILATERAL
SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY (1 TO GRAMS) -

. MIXED MALIGNANT MULLERIAN TUMOR (CARCINOSARCOMA).
TUMOR MEASURES 5.5 CM.
TUMOR INVADES THROUGH THE POSTERIOR MYOMETRIUM (100%), AND FORMS A NODULE ON THE

SEROSAL SURFACE.

NO DEFINITE LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

LOWER UTERINE SEGMENT MARGIN IS NEGATIVE FOR INVOLVEMENT BY TU
NOT SEEN IN THE SPECIMEN GROSSLY OR MICROSCOPICALLY.

LEFT AND RIGHT FALLOPIAN TUBES ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

LEFT AND RIGHT OVARIES ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

RIGHT OVARY WITH INFLAMMATORY ADHESIONS

RIGHT FALLOPIAN TUBE WITH SEROSAL FOREIGN BODY GIANT CELL REACTION TO POLARIZABLE

MATERIAL AND ADHERENT NODULAR AGGREGATE OF INFLAMMATORY CELLS WITH
GRANULATION~TYPE INFLAMMATORY TISSUE.

J. PATHOLOGIC STAGE: pTSa pNO pMX (FIGO stage IIIA).

PART 2: RIGHT COMMON ILIAC LYMPH NODE, BIOPSY —
ONE LYMPH NODE. NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (011).

MOR: CERVICAL TISSUE IS

r;om no 9?

PART 3: LEFT EXTERNAL ILIAC LYMPH NODE, BIOPSY ~

ONE LYMPI-I NODE WITH SMALL GRANULOMA FORMATION. NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (011) (see comment).
COMMENT:
The tumor is biphasic,

with a high grade serous carcinoma component and a high grade endometriai stromal sarcoma
component.

lmmunostains were attempted on Part 3 but the granuiomas were not present on the stained slides (AEIIS was otherwise

negative; CD68 demonstrated numerous histiocytes). Stains to rule out fungal and acld~fast organisms are pending and
will be reported separately.

Please cross-refer the pelvic wash specimen“ which was negative for malignant coils.
MICROSCOPIC: '
Microscopic examination substantiates the above diagnoses.
