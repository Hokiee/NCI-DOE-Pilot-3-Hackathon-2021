distal paratracheal” are 3 pieces of soﬁ tan tissue ran ng om . x .1 x 0.1 cm to 0.5 x 0.5 x
0.2 cm. The entire Specimen is submitted for frozen section in cassette FSA.

B. 4L LEFT DISTAL PARATRACHEAL
-esignated “B - 4L left distal _

 

Received fresh and labeled with the patient nam
paratracheal” are 3 fragments of pink-tan soft tissue ranging from 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.1 cmto 1.0 x 0.4 -
x 0.4 cm. The entire specimen is submitted for frozen section in cassette FSB.
C. LEVEL 7 SUBCARINAL
Received fresh and labeled with the patient name —designated “C — level 7
subcarinal” are 5 fragments of pink-tan soft tissue ranging cm 0.3 X 0.2 x 0.1 cm to 0.4 x 0.3 x
0.1 cm. The entire specimen is submitted for ﬁ'ozen section in cassette FSC.

D. 2R RIGHT PROXIMAL PARATRACHEAL

Received fresh and labeled with the patient name _lesignated “D - 2R light

proximal paratracheal” are 3 fragments of pink—tan soft tissue ranging from 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm to-
0.6 x 0.4 x 0.1 cm. The entire specimen is submitted for frozen section in cassette FSD.

  
  

E. RIGHT MIDDLE AND LOWER LOBE BI LOBECTOMY
Received fresh and labeled right middle and lower lobe, bi-Iobectomy is a 391 gm bi—lobectomy
specimen. The middle lobe is 14 x 9 x 3 cm and the lower lobe is 15 x 9 x 5.5 cm. The pleural
surface is smooth and the lower lobe is inked black. Shaved section is taken of the bronchial
margin and submitted for frozen section. In the central area of the lower lobe is a 4.5 x 4.0 x 3.0
cm white—tan necrotic mass. It surrounds the central bronchi and inﬁltrates the main bronchial
tree. The mass extends to the pleura. The remainder of the parenchyma has a redutan and
speckled anthracotie appearance. No additional masses or lesions are observed. A section of
mass is submitted for tissue procurement. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

FSEI: frozen section of bronchial margin

E2-E9: sections of mass in association with bronchi, lymph nodes, pleura and

parenchyma

El I: normal appearing parenchyma from middle lobe

E10 and E12: possible lymph nodes

F. LEVEL 7 LYMPH NODE P

pink~brown soft tissue measuring . x . x . cm. Specimen is bisected and the cut surface

‘level 7 lymph node packet” 1s a piece of

G. LEVEL 11R RIGHT UPPER
Received in formalin and labeled level 1 IR right upper lobe” are pieces of

pink and black soft tissue in aggregate measunng 1.8 x l.4 x 0.3 cm. Submitted in toto in block
GI.

H. MEDIAL MARGIN
Received in formalin and labelemnedial margins, is an unori ent ed piece of
piniotan soft tissue 1.0 x 0.5 x 0. cm. u no e in block HI.

NOTE: Tumor is present in the bronchial margin of the bi-lobectomy specimen on permanent
sections. No tumor is seen in specimens H and I that were submitted as medial and lateral
margins. The detached fragment of squamous epithelium seen in speci at least
moderate dysplasia. Multiple levels of specimen H were examined an eviewed
selected slides of specimen H. A CD34 immunostain was performed wi appropriate controls
on slide E6 and shows no evidence of lymphovascular invasion.
