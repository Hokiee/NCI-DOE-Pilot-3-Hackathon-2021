GROSS DESCRIPTION:
.1 .ysr LT.TUBE & OVARY

 

Gross examination onli ino iross tumor seen) i).

Received is large ovarian tumor with multilobular and nodular and
cystic appearance weighing 7 83gm. and measuring 18x15x9cm. Cut
sections show predominantly solid nodular component with creamy
yellow soft parenchyma and thin walled cyst containing serous

fluid with inner smooth lining surface measuring 9X6crn. in
diameter. The nodules ranging from 0.50m. to 8cm. in overall
dimension in size and from yellow to deep purple in color. The
fallopian tube is grossly not identiﬁed. Sections submitted as

follows:
Tl,T2: tumor with cyst wall
T3 to T8: representatives of the solid tumor
FT: fallopian tube

2. F82 RT.TUBE 85 OVARY

Received fresh is a large ovarian mass demonstrating multinodular
and multilobulated appearance with focal cystic changes and
weighing 290gm. and measuring l3x8x5cm. Fallopian tube is also
present measuring Scm. in length and 0.50m. in diameter. The
color of the outer surface of the ovary ranges from yellow tan to
pink purple. The size of the nodules range from 0.40m. to Scm.

in overall dimension. Multiple small hemorrhagic cysts are
identiﬁed. On serial sections, ovary reveals nodules having a

solid consistency. Multiple yellow necrotic areas multiple cyst
formation. There are focal thickening of the cyst wall. N0

normal ovary is identified. Sections submitted as follows:

FT: fallopian tube

T1 to T3: cystic components of the tumor

T4 to T8: solid components of the tumor
3. UTERUS

_ W...

 

 

Received fresh is a uterus weighing lS2gm. and measuring
12x7.4cm. The serosa ispsmooth and apparent subserosal fibroid
seen located near thejunction ofcertiix and lower segment of
uterus and measures 0.8cm. in overall dimension. The uterus is
opened along the lateral margin which reveals a hyperernic
endometrium with velvety appearance. No deﬁnite gross tumor
seen. The cervix is grossly unremarkable. Serial sectioning of
the uterus and cervix reveal unremarkable endo and myometrium. No
focal lesion identiﬁed. The endometrium measures 0.2cm. The
myometrium measures 2cm. in thickness. Sections submitted as
follows:

ABM: gnterigr endometrium it

PEM: posterior endornetrium

ACl,2: anterior cervix

PC 1 ,2: posterior cervix

F : ﬁbroid
4. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES
Received in formalin are three fragments of fibroadipose tissue
ranging from le .8x0.7cm. to 3.2x2.3x1.4cm. Five lymph nodes
identiﬁed ranging from 4x1x0.7cm. to 0.5x0.3x0.3cm. Lymph nodes
submitted as follows:

LNIA,B: one lymph node

LN2: two bisected lymph nodes

LN3: two bisected lymph nodes
5. RT PELVIC LYMPH NODES
Received in formalin are two fragments of ﬁbroadipose tissue
measuring 2.3x1. 1x0.7cm. and 3. lxi .7x_l.lcm. Three lymph nodes
are identified. Sections submitted as follows:

LNI: one bisected lymph node

LN2: two bisected lymph nodes
6. BX SIGMOID NODULB
Received in formalin is a fragment of tan soft tissue measuring
0.4x0.3x0. 1 cm. The specimen submitted in toto in cassette
labelled SM.
7. PERI-AORTIC LYMPH NODES
Received in formalin are four fragments of tan pink focally
hemorrhagic nodule ranging from 3.5x0.6x0.4cm. to 4.2x2.8x2. lcm.
Serial sections of the nodules reveals a white yellowish tan
lobulated cut surface with focal hemorrhage. Sections submitted
as follows:

LN1,2: two largest nodes

LN3: one lymph node

LN4: one lymph node
