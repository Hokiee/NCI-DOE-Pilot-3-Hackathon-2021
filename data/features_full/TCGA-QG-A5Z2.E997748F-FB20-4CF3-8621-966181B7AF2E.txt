REGHT HEMICOLECTOMY

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
colon cancer

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
colon cancer

Surgeon/physician:

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen consists of a 27.8 cm in length segment of right colon
with 4.7 cm of attached terminal ileum. The specimen is stapled at
both ends with a moderate amount of attached fat. The serosa is
tan—pink to red, smooth and glistening. There is a 7.2 x 0.8 cm
intact vermiform appendix.

Opening reveals a tan— —brown smooth glistening ileal mucosa with normal
folds. The ileocecal valve is tan- yellow and thickened. The colonic
mucosa displays a 3.8 x 2.6 x 0.8 cm tan-red slightly raised polypoid
mass that is 9.3 cm from the proximal resection margin, and 19.8 cm
from the distal resection margin. Sectioning through the mass reveals
a focal area of invasion going into the underlying muscle layer. The
mass does not extend to the inked serosal surface. The mass is 7.3 cm
from the mesenteric resection margin.

The remaining colonic mucosa is tan—brown smooth and glistening with a
1.0 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm submucosal mass grossly consistent with a
submucosal lipoma. There is a moderate amount of endoscopy tattooing
adjacent to the polypoid mass. Sectioning through the attached fat
reveals multiple tan-pink rubbery lymph nodes.

Pepresentat ive sections are submitted as follows: 1— prox1mal
resection margin; 2— distal resection margin, 3— 9— entire mass With
underlying fat and possible inked serosa; 10— mesenteric resec.tion
margin closest to mass; 11— submucosal lipoma; 12— appendix; 13—
;leocecal valve; l4—l8- multiple whole lymph nodes; 19—20- one
bisected lymph node in each; 21- multiple whole lymph nodes.

MICROSCOPIC EXAM
DIAGNOSIS:

Colon, right, hemicolectomy:

DIFFERENTIATED), (SEE CANCER SUMMARY)
~ ALL MARGINS FREE OF TUMOR
— 23 LYMPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (0/233

- TATTOO PIGMENT IDENTIFIED
- UNREMARKABLE APPENDIX
~ SUBMUCOSAL LIPOMA
