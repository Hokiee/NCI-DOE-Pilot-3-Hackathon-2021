Diagnosis:

This is a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the colon (descending/sigmoid colon) of
histopathological differentiation grade G3, with ulceration of the inner surface of the
tumor, peritumorous, chronic recurrent concomitant inï¬‚ammation, focal mucus formation,
tumor infiltration in the parietal layers of the colon as fas as the subserous fatty connective
tissue, with twelve local lymph node metastases (12/18), with carcinomatous lymphangitis
and carcinosis of the blood vessels. In addition the overview slices from the resection
margins show these to be tumor-free, and the sigmoid colon shows diverticulosis.

According to the sections available, the tumor spread of the colon carcinoma corresponds
to a tumor stage of pT3, pN2, MX, L1, V1.
