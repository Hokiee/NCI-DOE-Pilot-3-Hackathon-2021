A. Histologic type: Squamous cell carcinoma

Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated

Primary tumor (pT) TNM [FIGO): Carcinoma involves all sections of the
cervix with direct extension into the myometrial wall, parametrial
tissues and upper vagina. pT2b. IIB

Margins of resection: uninvolved

Vascular invasion: Not identified

Regional lymph nodes (pN): Metastatic carcinoma is present in one node
as described below le

Distant metastasis (pM): Cannot be evaluated by the specimen, pMX
Other findings: None

B. Sections of the right pelvic lymph nodes demonstrate metastatic
carcinoma involving 1 of 23 nodes.

C. Sections of the left pelvic lymph nodes demonstrate no evidence of
metastasis in 16 lymph nodes.

D. Sections of the periaortic lymph nodes demonstrate no evidence
metastasis in 12 lymph nodes.

Clinical Information
Cervical cancer

Gross Description

A. Container A is labeled with the patient's name, medical record
number and "uterus, cervix, tubes, ovaries, bilateral parametria and
upper vagina". The specimen consists of a uterus with attached
bilateral adnexa and parametria. The uterus measures 8.9 cm from the
tip of the cervix to the top of the fundus, 4.8 cm in breadth and 4.2
cm in width. The external examination of the ectocervix demonstrates a
tan firm tumor nodule occupying the majority of the mucosal surface.
The uterus is bivalved, and the uterine cervix contains a fungating
tumor mass with direct extension into the myometrial wall. The overall
dimensions of the tumor including both involvement of cervix and
uterine corpus it is 4.8 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm. Tumor additionally grossly
involve the parametrial tissue and upper vagina bilaterally. The
endometrial surface is focally ulcerated by involvement from the tumor.
The ovaries bilaterally are grossly uninvolved by tumor and average
1.2 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. Fallopian tube segments are unremarkable. Rep.
sections submitted. BLOCK SUMMARY: Al-A13: Entire cervix and
adjacent parametrial tissue, upper vagina, submitted from 12 to
11:00., A 14, A:15 - lower uterine segment, A16 - A18 representative
sections of myometrial wall, involved by tumor, a 19, 820 — bilateral
ovaries and fallopian tubes.
B. Received in formalin labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes" are multiple
yellow lobular fatty tissue fragment having an aggregate measurement of
7.5 x 7.0 x 2.5 cm. The specimens are palpated to identify possible
lymphoid tissue the lymph nodes range from 0.3 cm to 4.5 cm in greatest
dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows: 1 — 4
possible lymph nodes, 2 — 6 possible lymph nodes, 3 — 2 possible lymph
nodes, 4 — one possible lymph node bisected, 5/6 - one possible lymph
node bisected, one half in each, 7 through 11 - one possible lymph node
sectioned, 12 through 17 — one possible lymph node sectioned RS 17
C. Received in formalin labeled "left pelvic lymph node" are multiple
yellow lobular fatty tissue fragments which have an aggregate
measurement 7.5 x 5.5 x 3.5 cm. The specimens are palpated to identify
multiple lymph nodes which range from 0.5 cm and 3.5 cm in greatest
dimension. The lymph node are entirely submitted as follows: 1 — 4
possible lymph nodes, 2 - 3 possible lymph nodes, 3 — 2 possible lymph
nodes, 4 - 2 possible lymph nodes, 5 - 4 possible lymph nodes, - one
possible lymph node bisected, 7 - one possible lymph node bisected, 8/9
— one possible lymph node bisected, one half in each, 10/11 — one
possible lymph node bisected, one half in each. RS 11
D. Received in in formalin labeled "periaortic lymph nodes" are
multiple yellow lobular fatty tissue fragments which have an aggregate
measurement of 5.5 x 4.5 and 1.2 cm. The specimens are palpated to
identify multiple lymph nodes which range from 0.5 cm a 2.5 Cm in
greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows:
1 - 4 possible lymph nodes, 2 - 4 possible lymph nodes, 3 ' one
possible lymph node bisected, or - one possible lymph node bisected, 5
- one possible lymph node bisected, 6/7 — one possible lymph node
bisected, one half in each. RS 7
