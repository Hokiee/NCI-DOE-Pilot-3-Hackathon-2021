Remark

The tumor is classiﬁed as follows:

pT33, pNO (01’ 16), L0, V0; Gleason 2+4 = 6 with tertiary Gleason 3 portion (approx. 50% Gleason
2, 30% Gleason 4).

In the apex and the right rectolateral side, carcinoma cells extend to the artificial (yellow
highlighted) margin of the preparation.

Compare here the material sent in separately for frozen section analysis with the XXXXX. The
other preparation margins are tumor-free.
