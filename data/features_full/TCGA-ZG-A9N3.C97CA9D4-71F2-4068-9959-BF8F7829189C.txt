Data of pathology report: II
Patient ID: ll
Gross description:

1. (Prostate gland): Prostate gland: Weight: 60 g. Volume: 55 ml, Size: 4.3 x 6.5 x 4.9 cm. Adherent
seminal vesicles and deferent duct: right side: 4 cm, left side: 3.8 cm. The surface is marked with
green ink on the right side, blue ink on the left side. On the right side,'rectolateral two 0.9cm
measuring tissue defects marked with yellow ink. Apical pen-urethral a funnel shaped 1.1 x 0.8 cm
tissue defect marked with red ink. Total of the cross sections: 1.6 cm.

2. (Lymph nodes, right side): 2.5 x 2 x 1 cm measuring adipose tissue without palpable nodes.

3. (Lymph nodes, left side): 4.5 x 3 x 1 cm measuring adipose tissue containing 1 nodes measuring up
to 1.5 cm.

4. (Lymph nodes, right side ll): 9 nodes measuring up 3.4 cm.

5. (Lymph nodes, left side II): 5.5 x 2.5 x 1.7 cm measuring adipose tissue containing 6 nodes
measuring up to 1.9 cm.

Microscopy:

1. Apex right and left: Right 8 tissue blocks, left 8 tissue blocks (total 16 tissue blocks). 3 cross

sections: Right 17 tissue blocks, left 12 tissue blocks (total 29 tissue blocks). Basis right and left: Right

15 tissue blocks, left 10 tissue blocks (total 25 tissue blocks). Seminal vesicles right and left: Right 3

tissue blocks, left 3 tissue blocks (total 6 tissue blocks). Deferent ducts right and left: Right 1 tissue

block, left 1 tissue block (total 2 tissue blocks). fab—C) :3

2. Lymph nodes, right side: 2 tissue blocks. WM“) U03 3/40Z5

3. Lymph nodes, left side: 3 tissue blocks.

4. Lymph nodes, right side ll: 8 tissue blocks. 5 b 1 WNOS Clo I- of

5. Lymph nodes, left side ll: 8 tissue blocks. 9% J I 123/117;

Diagnosis:

1. (Prostate gland): Poorly differentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason 5+4=9, (Gleason 5: 70%,
Gleason 4: 25%, Gleason 3: 5%). Tumor involves both lobes with the main focus aound the right base.
Maximum tumor diameter: 45 mm. Perineural invasion. Tumor inﬁltration into peri—prostatic adipose
tissue in 5 tissue blocks mainly around the base (maximum invasion length 9 mm, maximal invasion
depth 1.5 mm). Positive surgical margin in 6 blocks (contact area 8 x 8 mm; Gleason 5+5). Tumor
inﬁltration into the right seminal vesicle and left deferent duct with positive resection margin. Tumor-
free pen-urethral resection margin.

Remaining prostatic tissue with small foci of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (high grade PIN) and
signs of myoglandular hyperplasia of the prostate. Urotheiium of the prostatic urethra without
dysplasia. Tumo-free left seminal vesicle and right deferent duct.

2. (Lymph nodes. right side): Tumor-free soft tissue.

3. (Lymph nodes, left side): Two tumor-free lymph nodes (0/2).

4. (Lymph nodes, right side ll): One lymph node metastasis (0.4mm at the hilus) in 12 lymph nodes
(1112).

5. (Lymph nodes, left side ll): Sixteen tumor-free lymph nodes (0/16).

Tumor classiﬁcation

(in consideration of the parallel report and immunohistochemical analyses):

pT3b. Gleason 5+4=9 (Gleason 5: 70%, Gleason 4: 25%, Gleason 3: 5%). maximum tumor diameter:
45 mm, tumor volume approx. 16.5 ml (Gleason 5: 11.55 mi, Gleason 4: 4.13 ml, Gleason 3: 0.82 ml),
pN1 (1/30), L0*, V0, R1

Comments:

Tumor infiltration into the right seminal vesicle in tissue blocks BRB1 and BRB4.

Tumor infiltration into pert-prostatic adipose tissue in tissue blocks BLB1, SBR1, SBR2, SBR3 and
SBL3.

Positive surgical margin in tissue blocks BRA1, BRA2. BRB2, RAC3. SBR1 and SBL3.
The preceding punch biopsy revealed prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason 5+4=9.

lmmunohistochemical analyses (AE1/AE3) on sixteen lymph nodes (tissue blocks 3A. 4A-E and 5A—D)
did not reveal any further metastases.

‘lmmunohistochemical analyses (02-40, 0031) on tissue blocks SBL1 and SBR1 revealed no

lymphatic or venous invasion. *At the point of lymph node metastasis a lymphatic invasion must have
been present.
