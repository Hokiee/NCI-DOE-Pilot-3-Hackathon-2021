Clinical Diagnosis & History:

Specimens Submitted:
1: Radical resection of left upper retroperitoneal mess, splenectomy left
adenopathy left kidney

DIAGNOSIS:
1. Left kidney, left adrenal, spleen, portion of stomach, retroperitoneal
mass; radical resection with partial gestrectomy, splenectomy, left
adrenelectomy and left nephrectomy:

— Dedifferentiated Liposarcomn.

~ Size - 13.2 x 10.5 x 7.5cm; three separate tumor nodules are also
present, measuring 3.2, 3.0 and 2.0 cm respectively.

- The dedifferentiated component is predominantly a high-grade spindle
cell sarcoma and focally shows a divergent

rhabdomyoearcomatous differentiation. (see Note)

- Tumor necrosis is grossly estimated at 20%.

— The tumor involves the spleen, envelope around the kidney and adrenal
and extends upto the stomach.

- The well-differentiated liposarcoma component extends to the deep
margin; all other margins are uninvolved.

NOTE: The tumor is predominantly composed of streaming fascicles o£ spindle
cells with moderate to severe cytologic atypia. Focal areas with a rhahdoid

pattern) and negative for desmin. In the more rhabdoid areas, there is
myogenin and desmin positivity, confirming a divergent rhabdomyosercomatous
differentiation. '

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

Gross Description:

1. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "partial gastrectomy, radical
resection of retrcperitoneal left upper quadrant mass , splenectomy, left
adrenalectomy, left kidney," and consists of a 17009. 24 x 15 x 9cm radical
resection oriented as per requisition. There is a well-demarcated,
white‘pink fleshy retroperitoneal tumor (T) with 20% geographic necrosis
(13.2 x 10.5 x 7.5cm), situated between the spleen and stomach, and superior
to the adrenal gland and kidney. There may be a softer, slightly yellow area
(? well—differentiated component. 30%) at the superior aspect of the
specimen. The mass has the following relationships with the margin: deep
(black) 0.4cm; anterior (peritoneum: yellow) 0.2cm: superior (blue) 0.2cm;
inferior (red) 4.5cm; lateral (green) 0.2cm: medial (orange) 1.5cm. The
tumor is adjacent and adherent to the spleen, stomach, kidney and adrenals;
it appears to invade the spleen. It appears distinct from the surrounding
adipose tissue, without any apparent areas of transition.

Three separate pink firm nodules of tumor are also identified, (N1, 3.2 x
2.8 x 1.7om: N2, 3.0 x 2.0 x 2.0cm; N3, 2.0 x 1.5cm). The smallest nodule
appears to invade the spleen. They are all far from the inked margins.

The spleen (14 x 10 x 4cm) has a smooth capsule and red cut surface, with
gross preservation of white and red pulp. No additional lesions are
identified. The portion of stomach (A x 2.5cm) shows somewhat flattened
folds but is otherwise without gross abnormalities. The kidney (13 x 7 x
3.5cm) has a preserved cortex (0.8cm) and smooth surface underneath the
capsule. Its associated ureter is 6.0cm long and 0.3 cm in diameter: the
vascular margins are grossly unremarkable. The adrenal (3.0 x 1.0 x 0.6cm)
has a somewhat thinned cortex, but is otherwise unremarkable.

Photographs are taken. Representative tissue is submitted for and
permanent sections. '
