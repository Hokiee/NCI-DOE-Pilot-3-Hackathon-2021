Gross Description:

1) The specimen is received fresh and labeled “Long stitch - proximal, short
- distal jejunum. remnant gastrectomy with attached segment of transverse
colon'. It consists of a segment of stomach that is anastomcsed to a portion
of small bowel measuring 8.3 cm in length and 3 cm in diameter. The stomach
measures 8.8 cm in diameter at the proximal end and 8.8 x 7.0 x 3.5 cm
overall. There is a long stitch at the proximal end and a short stitch at
the distal of the jejunum and per the requisition. The specimen is opened
to reveal a normally folded gastric mucosa with a firm, poorly defined, mass
at the anestomosis site measuring 5.4 x 2.5 cm that is located 5.2 cm from
the proximal stomach margin, 1.6 cm from the proximal small bowel margin and
4.5 cm from the distal small bowel margin. The remaining small bowel mucosa
is brown and unremarkable.

Attached to the specimen, by a portion of adipose tissue, is a separate
segment of colon measuring 5 cm in length and 3.2 cm in diameter. The colon
segment is opened to reveal tan, unremarkable mucosa.

A portion of the mass is submitted for TPB. The greater and lesser
curvature adipose tissue, pericolic and attached adipose tissue are palpated
for lymph nodes. all identified lymph nodes are submitted entirely. '
Representative sections are submitted.

2) . The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Celiac lymph node“, and
consists of three fatty lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 to 0.3 cm in greatest
dimension. All identified lymph nodes and the remaining fibrofatty tissue
is submitted.

Summary of sections:
LN — lymph nodes
RS — remaining fibrofatty tissue

3) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Omentum". It consists of a 14.5
x 8.0 x 2.3 cm vascularized adipose tissue consistent with omentum,
displaying minimal fibrous adhesion. Serial sectioning displays no discrete
mass or lesion. Representative sections are submitted.
