LEFT lNGUINAL LYMPH NODE: {3N2 \ 616,-] it)

We receive a lymph node measuring 3,5 x 3,5 x 2,8 cm.

lNGUINAL LYMPH NODE (BIOPSY):
- DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA, CD20 POSITIVE

The lymph node shows a diffuse and partially nodular lymphoid inﬁltration composed
by large centroblastic cells, accompanied by abundant small lymphocytes, histiocytes
and plasma cells.

The atypical cells are positive for CD20, BCL2, BCL6 and IgD, and are negative for
CD10 and MUMl. There is Kappa light chain restriction. The small accompanying
lymphocytes are CD3positive. The Ki—67 proliferative index is 50-60%.

PCR BCL2 : Rearranged
