GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries", received fresh and placed in
formalin on is a 852 gram, 19.8 x 13.7 x 7.4 cm
hysterectomy specimen with bilateral attached adnexa. The cervix is 4.9 cm in
diameter with a 2.3 cm diameter os. The serosa is tan and dull with no
adhesions. The endometrial cavity is filled with serosanguinous fluid and the

Grossly, the tumor invades 0.6 cm into a 1.1 cm thick myometrium (deepest
invasion). The myometrium ranges from 1.1 to 2.3 cm thick. Additionally, the
myometrium has multiple intramural nodules with a tan~white whorled appearance

The right ovary (2 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm) has a smooth tan external surface and a tan
unremarkable cut surface. The right fimbriated fallopian tube (5.2 cm long,
0.5 cm in diameter) has multiple paratubal cysts up to 0.4 cm and a 0.2 x 0.2
x 0.1 cm white plaque on the external surface. The tube has a patent lumen
with a tan lining. The left ovary (2.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm) has a smooth tan
external surface with a 0.5 cm diameter simple cyst. The cut surface is tan
and unremarkable. The left fimbriated fallopian tube (5 cm long, 0.7 cm
diameter) has a purple external surface with multiple paratubal cysts up to
0.4 cm diameter. On section, the lumen is grossly dilated up to 0.4 cm with a
tan lining. The tube appears to be looped around onto itself. In the
periadnexal soft tissue there is a 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm tan calcified nodule.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Al~2~ anterior cervix

A3— anterior and lower uterine segment

A4~5~ posterior cervix 1

A6— posterior lower uterine segment

A7'9— mass~anterior endomyometrium, full thickness

A10—12— mass-posterior endomyometrium, full thickness (A10~ deepest invasion)

Al3— additional myometrial nodule with respect to primary mass and normal
myometrium

Al4— right ovary

AlS— right fallopian tube (with plaque)

A16— left ovary

Al7— left tube

Al8~ left periadnexal calcified nodule following decalcification

B. "Right vaginal margin", received fresh and placed in formalin on at

is a 2.8 x 1.4 x 1 cm fragment of tan—brown tissue composed of 2 cm of
tan smooth mucosa with an opposite roughened deep stromal margin (inked

C. "Right pelvic lymph nodes", received fresh and placed in formalin on
. ' 2 cm fragment of adipose tissue containing
multiple lymph nodes up to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes

display a firm, tan~white cut surface. There are several matted lymph nodes
which appear grossly positive. F

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Cl— one lymph node, serially sectioned

C2- multiple lymph nodes

C3- multiple lymph nodes

C4— matted lymph nodes, representative sections

D. "Left pelvic lymph nodes", received fresh and placed in formalin on

at is a 4.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm aggregate of two fragments of adipose
tissue containing multiple tan, firm lymph nodes up to 1.4 cm in greatest
dimension. Multiple lymph nodes are matted and appear grossly positive on cut
section.

BLOCK SUMMARY:
01— one lymph node, bisected
02— matted (grossly positive) lymph nodes, representative sections

E. "Omentum", received fresh and placed in formalin on _‘ is a
5 x 5 x 1.5 cm fragment of adipose tissue consistent with omentum. Upon
thorough examination no masses or lesions are grossly identified.
Representative sections submitted in blocks E1-4. '

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: Hysterectomy salpingo—oophorectomy, omentectomy, lymph node
dissection

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 7th Edition): pT3b le pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. "UTERUS, CERVIX, BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES" (HYSTERECTOMY, BILATERAL

SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY):

CARCINOMA OF THE ENDOMETRIUM:
TUMOR SITE: DIFFUSE.
HISTOLOGIC TYPE: SEROUS PAPILLARY ADENOCARCINOMA.
FIGO GRADE: 3 OF 3.
TUMOR SIZE: 13.7 CM (LARGEST DIMENSION).
MAXIMUM DEPTH OF MYOMETRIAL INVASION: THROUGH FULL THICKNESS OF
MYOMETRIUM (1.1 CM), TO ABUT THE SEROSAL SURFACE.
LYMPHATIC/VASCULAR INVASION: PRESENT, EXTENSIVE.

SEROSA: FREE OF TUMOR.
SPECIMEN MARGINS: SEE SEPARATELY SUBMITTED VAGINAL CUFF MARGIN BELOW.

OVARIES, RIGHT AND LEFT: POSITIVE FOR CARCINOMA (BILATERALLY).
FALLOPIAN TUBE, RIGHT AND LEFT: POSITIVE FOR CARCINOMA (BILATERALLY).

 

B. ”RIGHT VAGINAL MARGIN” (EXCISION):

SQUAMOUS MUCOSA, POSITIVE FOR ADENOCARCINOMA, WITH EXTENSIVE INVOLVEMENT
OF LYMPHATIC/VASCULAR SPACES.

C. "RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES" (LYMPHADENECTOMY):

METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA IN FIVE OF FOURTEEN LYMPH NODES (5/14).

D. "LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES" (LYMPHADENECTOMY):
