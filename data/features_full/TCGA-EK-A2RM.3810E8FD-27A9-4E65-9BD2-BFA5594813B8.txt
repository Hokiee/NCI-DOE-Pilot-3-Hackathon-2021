Gross Description

The case is received in seven containers, each with the
patient 5 name and
medical record number.

I:Spetcilrfnen 1 is designated "right aortic node" and is received
res or

frozen section and is described then as one piece of red-tan
soft tissue

measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 1 cm and dissected to reveal multiple
potential ymph

nodes frozen in toto as 1A. The remaining specimen is now
received

following formalin fixation and is submitted as 1A in toto.

Specimen 2 is received fresh and is labeled "left pelvic node".
T e

specimen consists of multiple fragments of yellow-tan soft

tissue measuring

6.1 x 4.1,. x 1.2 cm in aggregate. Further dissection reveals six
otentia

ymph nodes, as large as 1.2 cm, which are dissected and

submitted in 2A-C

remaining fat in 26 and 25.

Specimen 3 is received fresh and is labeled "right pelvic node".
e

specimen consists of multiple fragments of tan fatty soft tissue

measuring

5.? x 3.l7 x 1.4 cm aggregate. The specimen contains multiple
0 entla

Pmph nodes as large as 0.9 cm, and are submitted in BA

t rough 3D.

Specimen 4 is received fresh and is labeled "portion of right
parametrium".

The specimen consists of one portion of tan soit tissue
measuring 1.2 x 0.9

x 0.2 cm and is submitted in toto in 4A.

Specimen S is received fresh and is labeled portion of left
arametrlum.
nee 5%eglmen consists one portion of tan soft tissue measuring
1. x . x
0.3 cm, and is submitted in toto in SA.

Specimen 6 is received fresh and is labeled "uterus, tubes and
ovaries,

parametrium of upper vagina". The specimen weighs 233.3
grams in toto. The

uterus measures 7.9 cm superior to inferior, 7.1 cm cornu to
cornu, and 3.5

cm anterior to posterior, and measures 3 cm in length, 4.6 cm
lateral to

irateral, and 4.4 cm anterior to posterior. The cervix is notable
or a

protruding friable red-tan mass appearing to be a posterior
eslon. The

specimen also contains a Cuff of vagina measuring from 1.2 to

2.7 cm, and

grossly‘ free of tumor. The serosa of the uterus and cervix Is

smoot and

glistening. The uterus and cervix are bivalved along the

anterior-posterior

304d” to reveal the following: An endocervlcal canal 4.0 long,
. cm 5

wide, an unremarkable endometrlal cavity 4.6 cm long, and

3.9 cm wide, and

0.1 c151; thick, and a myometrlum notable for a thickness of 1.4

cm. e

specimen ls inked as following: Black is anterior, green is

posterior, and

the vaginal cuff is inked blue. The posterior ectocerle is

replaced by a

Euggatlng mass lesion measuring 4.5 cm lateral to lateral and
. cm

anterior to posterior x 2.6 cm superior to inferior, with a tan-

w e

surface. The mass lesion is located approximately 1 cm from

the lower

uterine segment posterioriy, and 1.5 cm from the anterior

uterine se ment.

The mass 5 located 1.5 cm from the closest vaginal margin.

Right and left

pgralmgtrla are shaved. They are grossly uninvolved by tumor.
e e

p'aigatmetrlal are submitted in toto in 6A through D, and the

l’ 9

parametrial is submitted in 6E through 6H. The vaginal cuff is

submitted as

follows: Left anterior cuff in 61, right anterior cuff and 6}, and

e

posterior cuff in 6 K and right posterior cuff in 6L. An

uninvolved

portion of vaginal cuff is cut off. The' cervix is then processed

as a cone,

and submitted as follows: 2:00 as 6M, 12:30 as GM, 1:00 as

60, 2:00 as 6P,

2:30 6Q, 3:00 as 6R, 3:30 as 65, 4:00 as 6T, 4:30 in 6U and

6V, 5:00 in 5w

and 6X, 6:00 in 6Y and 6Zand 7:00 as 6AA and 688, 8:00 as

6CC, 8:30 as

600, 9:00 as SEE, 9: 30 as 6FF, 10:00 as GGG, and 11:00 as

6HH. A section

through anterior endocervix and lower uterine segment is

submitted in 6H,

and a section through posterior endocervix and lower uterine

se ment is

su mitted in 6)]. A full thickness cross-section through

anterior

endometrium and myometrlum is submitted in 6KK and a full

thickness cross

section through posterior endometrium myometrlum is 6LL.

The right ovary

measures 4.0 x 2.8 x 1.8 cm and the right fallopian tube

measures 3.3 cm x

0.3 cm in greatest dimension. Upon sectioning, the right ovary

is

multicystic and hemorrhagic with the cysts as large as 1.5 cm

in diameter.

Section throu h right ovary and adjacent fallopian tube is

submitted in MM

and representative sections of the right fallopian tube which

looks grossly

unremarkable Is submitted in 6NN. The left ovary measures

3.7 x 2.9 x 1.2

cm andtthe left fallopian tube measures 3.6 cm x 0.3 cm in
reates

Siameter. Upon sectioning, the left ovary is cystic and has a

cyst as large

as 0.6 cm. A representative section of ovary with adjacent

fallopian tube

is submitted in 600. The fallopian tube looks grossly
unremarkable and
representative sections are submitted in 6PP.

Specimen 7 is received fresh and is labeled "left uterine
artery". The

specimen consists of one portion of yellow-tan soft tissue
measuring 2.0 x

1.2 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto and 7A.
