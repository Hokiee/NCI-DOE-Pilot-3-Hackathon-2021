PERMANENT SECTIONS (AIFS)

Specimen l is received fresh tor intra0peracive consultation in a container
labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and "biopsy oi
pelvic mass“ and consists of irregular fragment of fri.able can tissue (2.0
x 1. 5 x 1. 0 cm) admixed with blood clot. Representative sections are

submitted for frozen section in cassette AlFS and the remainder of the
specimen is submitted in cassette A2 and A3.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS, PELVIC MASS: SPINDLE CELL NEOPLASM. FAVOR
LEIOMYOSARCOMA

Specimen 2 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled
"uterine fundus, bilateral adnexa, right colon, appendix, and distal
ileum." The specimen consists of a uterus (6.0 x 5.0 x 4.0 cm) with cervix
remnant (2.0 x 1.2 cm in surface diameter, excised to a depth of 1.1 cm).
attached bilateral ovaries (2.2 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm each), bilateral fallopian
tubes (8.0 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter each), with adhered distal
ileum (45.2 cm in length), appendix (6.0 cm in length and 0.3 cm in
diameter), and attached colon (6.0 cm in length and 4.0 cm in
circumferential diameter) and mesenteric fat (approximately 20.0 cm).
There is an ill—defined tan, friable mass (approximately 16.0 x 16.0 x 12.0
cm) that extends from the uterine Eundus through the serosa and invades the
surrounding soft tissue. The tumor is adherent to the colon, ileum and
appendix without invasion into these structures. The mass has mottled,
friable tan cut surfaces with extensive hemorrhage and necrosis. Multiple
tumor nodules involving the bowal wall, mesentery, external surface of the
right fallopian tube are identified.

The endometrial cavity measures 4.0 x 3.0 cm and is lined by pink-tan
endometrium, 0.2 cm in average thickness. The posterior endometrium shows
an endometrial polyp (3.0 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm). The myometrium is pink—tan with
an average thickness of 2.5 cm. The myometrium shows multiple intramural
and subserosal white—tan, firm nodules (1.0 to 7.0 cm in greatest
dimension) with whorled out surfaces. No hemorrhage, necrosis, or
degeneration is seen. The ovaries and fallopian tubes are grossly
unremarkable.

The colonic mucosa is grossly normal. The serosa shows multiple tumor
deposits. The attached mesenteric fat has numerous tumor deposits.

myometrium;

Specimen 3, received fresh labeled with the patient's name, medical record
number, and "oul—de-sac mass and cervix,“ consists of a portion of
ectocervix that measures 2.6 x 2.1 cm in diameter and covered by pink—tan
exocervical mucosa and 0.1 cm slitlike on with attached irregular fragment
of soft tissue that is extensively involved by tumor measures 8.0 x 6.0 x
1.5 cm.

Section code: C1, anterior cervix; C2, posterior cervix; C3-C5,
representative section of attached soft tissue with the mass.

Specimen 4, received fresh labeled with the patient's name, medical record
number, and "sigmoid epiploica," consists of irregular fragments of
Eibroadipose tissue measuring 2.1 x 1.9 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is serially

sectioned to reveal fibrofatty cut surfaces with no grossly identifiable
nodule. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes D1—D5.

Specimen 5, received with formalin in a container labeled with the
patient's name, medical record number, and "mesenteric nodule," consists of
am irregular fragment of pink—tan, friable soft tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.4
x 1.2 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in-cassettes E1 and E2.
Specimen 6, received with formalin in a container labeled with the
patient's name, medical record number, and ”omentum," consists of a flat
sheet of fibroadipose tissue measuring 16.0 x 3.0 x 0.6 cm. There are
multiple pink—tan friable tumor nodules identified. Renresentative section
of the nodule is submitted in cassettes F1—F4.

The following special studies were performed on this case and the
interpretation is incorporated in the diagnostic report above:
