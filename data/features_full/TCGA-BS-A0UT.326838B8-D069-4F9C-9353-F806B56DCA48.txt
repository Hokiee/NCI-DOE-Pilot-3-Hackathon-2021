lntraogerative Consultation:

Touch Preparation: Benign
Gross Description
A. Received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled.et‘t pelvic lymph node" are three fragments of tan-yellow fatty soft

tissue. up to 5.0 cm, 22.0 grns overall. By palpation and cross sectioning. there are multiple soft. tan-pink rubbery lymphoid
nodules up to 2.0 x 1. 5 cm‘ across. Touch imprints are prepared and stained with Diff-Quik solution. A representative section

of each lymphoid nodule, blocks A1-A5

8. Received in forfnalin labeled “-lelt ovary" rs a ﬁmbriated segment of ligated fallopian tube and attached ovary. 12 0 gms
overall. The fallopian tube approximately 4. 5 x 0.3 cm. its cut surface is pinpoint and grossly free of pathologic change. The
ovary. 20.x 1.2 x 1.0 cm. 3.0 gms. A portion of the tissue is removed intraoperatively and submitted for cancer research.

9%": Upon sectioning, the cut surface reveals mottled. tan—yellow ovarian parenchyma with an occasional corpora albicans.
Representative fallopian tube and ovary. block 3.

C. Received in formalin labeled inght ovary‘ is a ﬁmbriated segment of ligated fallopian tube and attached ovary. 10.0 gms
overall. The fallopian tube, approximately 4.5 x 0.3 cm. its cut surface is pinpoint and grossly free of pathologic change. The
ovary. 2. 7 x 1.1 x 0 8 cm. 4.0 gms. A portion of the tissue Is removed intraoperativeiy and submitted for cancer research.
Upon sectioning. the cut surface reveals mottled tan-yellow Ovarian parenchyma With an occasional corpora albicans
Representative fallopian tube and ovary, block 0.

0. Received in formalin labeled uterus and cervix” is a previously opened uterus and cervix with surgically absent bilateral
adnexa, 111.0 gms. The uterus measures 7.5 cm in length. 4.5 cm in broadest width and up to 4.0 cm anterior-posteriorly.
The serosa is smooth and glistening. tan-pink. The cervix measures 3.0 cm in length and 2.5 cm in maximum diameter. its
external mucosa is tan—white and non-ulcerated. Situated along the lower anterior. wall of the endometrial canal is a friable.
red-tan exophytic lesion, approximately 2.5 x 1.5 cm across. The cut surface of the tumor reveals it to grossly extend to a
depth of 0.5 cm within the myometrium. and 3.0 cm of the cervix. At this level. the myometrium measures at least 1.2 cm in
thickness. Elsewhere. the endometrium is smooth. tan-pink. 0.1 cm in thickness. A portion of the endometrium is removed
intraoperatively and submitted for cancer research; Sections through the myometrium reveal multiple circumscribed. white-
grey rubbery ﬁbroids. up to 1.7 x 1.1 cm across. Their'cut surface reveals a whorled architecture without gross necrosis or
hemorrhage. At least one of the fibroids is calciﬁed . Representative sections. blocks D1-D10.
