COMMENT

The prostate gland contains four separate foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, one in the transition zone and three in the peripheral
zone. The dominant tumor focus and the one of the highest histologic grade (Gleason Score 7/3+4) is located in the left transition
zone. This tumor focus measures 2.0 x 1.5 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in the four cross sections
of the prostate, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. The second largest tumor is located in the right anterolateral
peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 1.5 x 0.3 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in the four cross
sections of the prostate and focally in the apical region. The third largest tumor focus is located in the left posterolateral peripheral
zone. This tumor focus measures 0.6 x 0.1 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in one cross section. The
fourth tumor focus is located in the right posterolateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 0.1 x < 0.1 cm in the largest
cross sectional dimension and it is present in one cross section. All tumor foci are confined to the prostate. The margins of
resection are free of tumor.

GRossi DESCRIPTION

(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (4.2 x 2.8 x 3.7 cm, 48 grams, post-fixation). has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
right and left posterolateral aspects of the prostate appears symmetrical. No tumor is palpated externally or observed in the cross
sections after fixation.

The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

SECTION CODE: C1, C2, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C3, C4,
left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C5, prostatic base right border; 06, C7,
prostatic base right posterior border; C8—C13, prostatic base central portion; C14, prostatic base left border; C15, C16, prostatic
base left posterior border, 017-020, apex anterior; C21, 022, apex left; 023-025, apex posterior; 026, apex right; 027—C42,
sections of the four cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.

The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in block.
Blue ink (017-26) denotes surfaces but do not represent the true margin of resection.
