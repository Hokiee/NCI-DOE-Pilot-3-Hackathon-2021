Final Diagnosis:

Robotic—assisted radical prostatectomy and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection.

A—D. Four separate biopsies of margins labeled anterior bladder neck margin, right lateral bladder neck margin, left
lateral bladder neck margin, and posterior prostate margin: All four specimens consist predominately of fibrornuscular
and fibroadipose tissue, and are negative for carcinoma.

E. Prostate with bilateral nodes. Synoptic report.

Procedure: Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy, bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection.

Histologie type: Adenocareinoma, seiner type.

Histologlc grade: Primary pattern: 4 Secondary pattern: 3 Total Gleason Score: 7

Tumor quantitation: Multifoeal bilateral inﬁltrating adenoearcinoma. The bulk of the tumor is on left side, involves
apex, midgland, and base, and measures at least 3 cm in greatest dimension. There are separate foci of carcinoma
present on the right side, Gleason grade 3+4 and 3+3 varying from ‘7 mm down to less than 3 mm. Carcinoma involves
more than 5%, but less than 50%, of total prostatie volume.

Extraprostatic extension: Present on the left side, in mid gland and at base (reviewed with

Dr

Margins: All surgical margins are negative for carcinoma.

Lymph-vascular invasion: Present.

Perineural invasion: Present.

Seminal vesicle invasion: Absent.

Treatment effect on carcinoma: Not applicable.

Lymph nodes: Seven pelvic. lymph nodes negative for carcinoma, 0/7.

Additional pathologic ﬁndings: High grade prostatie intraepithelial neoplasia.

Ancillary studies: Parafﬁn-embedded tumor tissue (block E9) will be sent for DNA pioidy studies; AN
ADDENDUM WILL BE lSSUED.

Pathologic staging: p'i‘3.

Biorepository sample (if applicable): The mirror image section consists entirely of invasive carcinoma.

Procedure: Radical prostatectomy.
Prostate size: Weight: 56 grants; Dimensions: 4 x 3.8 x 3.8 cm; Seminal vesicles: 3 x 2 x 1.2 cm.
Gross notes: Grossly evident tumor: Yes, 1.2 x 1 x 0.9 cm in the left apex-mid portion of the specimen.
