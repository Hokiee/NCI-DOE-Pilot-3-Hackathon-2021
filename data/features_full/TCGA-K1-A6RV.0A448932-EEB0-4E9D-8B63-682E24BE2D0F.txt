COMMENT:

This malignant spindled cell neoplasm consists of fascicles of pleomorphic splndled cells with eosinophllic cytoplasm.
blunt ended nuclei, coarse chromatin and some prominent nucleoli. Extensive necrosis (approximately 80%) and focal
myxold areas are observed. Anglolyrnphatlc invasion is present. Brisk mitotic figures are noted and many are atyplcal
(up to 42110 high-powered ﬁelds). lmmunohistochemlcal stains were performed and the cells of interest are positive for
desmin (focally, blocks 2A, B), calponln (blocks 2A. B). smooth muscle actin (blocks 2A. B). 8099 and pancytolteratln,
and negative for 3-100. C034 (highlights vascular structures) and (Hill. Ki-GT demonstrates up to 50% nuclear positivity.
Oeteocalcin and osteonectln show high background staining. The overall morphological and lmmunohlstochemical

results support high grade Ielomyosarcorne. IQ Q) - O — 3

Apparently normal male chromosome analysis. No clonal numerical or structural abnormalities ware observed. The possibility that
the normal cells may represent normal stromal cells. and not the tumor cells. cannot be excluded. A law cells (see report below)
with nonclonal chromosome abnormalities may be the result of a tissue culture artifact, but more likely represent the malignant
cells.

Twenty trypsin-Glemsa banded metaphase cells were analyzed from 4, 5. 6, and 7-day harvests of monolayer cell cultures from
tissue labeled “right thigh mass.” Fifteen cells had an apparently normal male chromosome complement. One cell had a
hypodiploid karyotype. likely as a result of random dlrornosomai loss. One cell each had the following chromosome complement:
45.XY,t(3;12)(q21;q24.1),-19 and 46,XY.t(8;12)(q11.1;p11.1). Two cells from the same slide and the same microscopic ﬁeld of
vision both had a 46.xY.t(12;13)(q13;q14) chromosome complement.
