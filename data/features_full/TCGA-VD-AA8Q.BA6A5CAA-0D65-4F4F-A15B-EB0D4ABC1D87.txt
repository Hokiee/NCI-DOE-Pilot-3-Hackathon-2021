infiltrate within the tumour is minimal. Scattered
macrophages are present. Tumour necrosis is not seen. There
is no tumour extension through the sclera, optic nerve or
vortex veins examined. Tumour cells are not seen at the
resection margins.

Elsewhere, the cornea shows oedema in its basal cell layers.
The anterior chamber angles are open and the anterior
chamber is deep. The iris shows no significant abnormality
but the ciliary body appears atrophic with hyalinisation of
ciliary processes. The lens shows subcapsular degenerative
changes. Retina overlying the tumour is slightly atrophic.

DIAGNOS IS

Right eye, enucleation: Choroidal melanoma of predominantly
spindle cell type.

COMMENT

This Copy For: -

Molecular genetic examination of DNA extracted from the
tumour cells will be performed using multiplex—ligation
dependent probe amplification (MLPA). looking at chromosomes
1, 3, 6 and 8. A supplementary report will follow in due

course.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT - MLPA

In the meantime, molecular genetic analysis of tumour DNA
extracted from the fresh uveal melanoma tissue was performed

using the technique
probe amplification
performed in the

The kit P027 from

termed multiplex ligation—dependent
(MLPA). These investigations were

, which examines for gains or

losses in 31 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8, was used.
The DNA concentration was measured using and the
quality assessed using multiplex—PCR prior to the MLPA

reaction .

The DNA concentration was high and of good quality on
assessment. The MLPA reaction was run at least twice on
differing occasions, resulting in similar results.

The results of the sequence analysis of the MLPA products is
printed on a separate report. In summary, sequence analysis

demonstrated:

normal chromosome 1p,

disomy 3,
normal chromosome 6

and normal chromosome 8.

Taken together, these molecular data would place the patient
in the low risk group with respect to the development of

metastatic melanoma

Consideration of clinical features of the tumour is,
however, also required.
