- Pathology Report

Microscopic Description:

Microscopic examination reveals an infiltrating glioma. Many of the tumor cells
demonstrate elongated to oval nuclei with moderate nuclear pleomorphism. Intermixed
amongst these cells and seen separately in small clusters, are neoplastic cells with
predominantly round nuclei and an apparent paucity of fibrillary processes. Overall,
cytologic atypia appears moderate with scattered cells showing more significant atypia.
The tumor cells are embedded in a variably fibrillary and myxoid background. In areas,
the cells are arranged in distinct cellular nests with foci of prominent clustering around
blood vessels. Neither necrosis nor microvascular proliferation are seen. Up to four
mitotic figures per 10 high power fields are counted.

Addendum Discussion:

The tumor cells are negative for expression of synaptophysin. They demonstrate strong
positivity for GFAP. The calculated MIB-l Labeling Index is 10.7%. Overall, the
histologic features in conjunction with the MIB-l Labeling index are consistent with a
high grade glioma.

Addendum Diagnosis:

Right Frontal Brain Tumor, Biopsy and Resection:

Anaplastic Oligoastrocytoma, Oligodendroglial predominant (Who Grade III)
MIB-l Labeling Index = 10.7%
