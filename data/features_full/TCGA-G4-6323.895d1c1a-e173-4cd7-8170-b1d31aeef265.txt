A. RIGHT COLON

SPECIMEN(S):
A. RIGHT COLON

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. RIGHT COLON:
The specimen is received fresh and consists of a 14.5 cm segment of cecum and ascending colon and
attached mesocolon. A 4.0 cm segment of terminal ileum is attached. The appendix is present and
measures 7.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The serosa is unremarkable. There is a 6.0 x 4.0 x cm polypoid lesion
present in the cecum which is confined to the mucosa. The lesion measures approximately 0.6 cm from
the ileocecal valve. The tumor abuts the base of the appendix. The remaining mucosa of the colon is
unremarkable. The mucosal surface of the small intestine is diffusely nodular suggestive of hypertrophy
of the Peyer's patches. Multiple encapsulated nodules are dissected from the surrounding adipose
tissue, the largest measuring up to 1.2 cm across. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
A1: Proximal margin, A2: Distal margin, A3: Base of appendix including representative section of tumor,
A4: Representative section of tumor closest to ileocecal valve, A5: Additional representative section of
ileocecal valve, A6-A12: Additional representative sections of tumor, A13: Sections of appendix,
A14: Additional representative sections of colon, A15-A16: Additional representative sections of small
intestine, A17: Single encapsulated nodule, A18: Single encapsulated nodule, A19: Single encapsulated
nodule, A20: Single encapsulated nodule, A21 : 2 encapsulated nodules one inked yellow, A22: 4
encapsulated nodules, A23: 6 encapsulated nodules, A24: 3 encapsulated nodules, A25: 3 possible
encapsulated nodules, A26: 2 possible encapsulated nodules, A27-28: Multiple possible encapsulated
nodules.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. COLON, RIGHT, HEMICOLECTOMY:
- INTRAMUCOSAL WELL DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA ARISING FROM
TUBULOVILLOUS ADENOMA
- SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR
- APPENDIX, NO TUMOR SEEN
- TWENTY FOUR LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/24)
- SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT AND SEE NOTE.

NOTE: A microscopic focus of invasive well differentiated adenocarcinoma involving lamina propria is
identified. The rest of the tumor which almost completely submitted for microscopic examination shows
only tubovillous adenoma.

Selective slides were reviewed by Dr. who concurs with the diagnosis.
