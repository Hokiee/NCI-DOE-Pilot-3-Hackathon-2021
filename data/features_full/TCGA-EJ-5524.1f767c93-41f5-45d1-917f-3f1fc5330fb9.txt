The Patient is a—viih a history of prostatic adenocarcinoma with Gleason Score 4 + 4 = 8 o
. ,,the Ieft side. PSA 3.76 nglml. Clinical TMN stage= cT2b.
PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer.
POST—OP DIAGNOSIS: Same.
WEDURE: Radical retropubic prostatectomy.

    
 

 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

PART 1:
LYMPH NODES, RIGHT PELVIC, EXCISION -
NO EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASIA IN EIGHT LYMPH NODES (DIS).

PART 2:
LYMPH NODES, LEFT PELVIC, EXCISION —
NO EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASlA IN NINE LYMPH NODES (DIQ).

PART 3:
PROSTATE AND BlLATERAL SEMINAL VESlCLES, RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY—
A. INVASIVE PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, ACINAR TYPE, GLEASON SCORE 4+5=9 WITH

TERTIARY GLEASON PATTERN 3 COMPONENT.

THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT LOBES AND HAS A GREATEST NODULAR
DIAMETER OF 2 cm {slide (SEE).

THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES APPROXIMATELY 15% OF THE EXAMINED PROSTATE VOLUME.

THE CARCINOMA SHOWS EVIDENCE OF ESTABLISHED EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IN THE
RIGHT POSTERIOR BASE (slide 3U).

BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES AND VASA DEFERENTIA ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA.

ALL EXAMINED SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA.

MULTIFOCAL PERINEURAL INVASION IS IDENTIFIED

NO ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

HIGH GRADE PROSTATIC iNTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA AND INTRADUCTAL EXTENSION OF
CARCINOMA ARE IDENTIFIED

PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT3a N0 MX.

NON NEOPLASTIC PROSTATE WITH FOCAL NODULAR HYPERPLASIA, GLANDULAR ATROPHY,
AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATION ARE NOTED (see synoptic).
