Clinical Information

rear-old with left paraganglioma, likely pheo
Pre-Operative Diagnosis: Not specified
Post-Operative Diagnosis: Not specified
Operation: Resection of paraganglioma
Specific questions to be answered: None

Specimen:
1 Celiac Artery Paraganglioma
2 Lymph Node, Celiac Artery

Final Diagnosis

1. Celiac artery paraganglioma, resection:
Paraganglioma, extending multifocally to inked specimen edges, see note.

2. Lymph Node. celiac artery, biopsy:
Fibroadipose tissue with small portion of lymphoid aggregate, nerve and ganglion, no tumor or lymph node seen.

The case material was reviewed and the report veriﬁed by:
(Electronic signature)
Verification Date:

Note
The lesion shows local vascular and capsular invasion, diffuse growth, nuclear atypia, and high cellularlty (PASS is 7).

lmmunohistochemical stains with adequate controls (see disclaimer) were performed on block 1.1 for S—
100,Chromogranin, and synaptophysin. The tumor cells are strongly positive for Chromogranin and synaptophysin, focally
positive for S~tOO. These findings support the above diagnosis.

lmmunostaln lor SDHB was performed on block U for screening possible SDHB germline mutation with adequate
controls. Additional molecular/genetic test is recommended for patient with tumor showing negative or weak cytoplasmic

SDHB staining pattern it clinically indicated.

The tumor shows negative cytoplasmic SDHB staining.

Frozen Section Diagnosis
1A: Tumor present, final diagnosis deferred to permanent.

Gross Description
The case is received in 2 fresh containers. each labeled with the patients name and medical record number.

Specimen 1 is received fresh for frozen section designated "celiac artery paraganglioma" and was described at that time
as “one piece of red tan soft tissue weighing 15.1 g and measuring 4.5 x 4.2 x 1.2 cm. The specimen is entirely inked
black. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a red cut surface. Representative sections frozen as 1A" The
specimen which was frozen is received now following formalin fixation and is submitted as 1A . The remaining specimen
which was not frozen has been fixed in formalin and appears as previously described and is submitted entirely in 10
cassettes labeled 1A through 1J.

Specimen 2 is designated ”celiac artery lymph node", and consists of one brown-red, firm potential lymph node measuring
1.2 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is submitted entirely in one cassette labeled 2A.
