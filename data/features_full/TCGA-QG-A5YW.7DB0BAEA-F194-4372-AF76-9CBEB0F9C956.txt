ADDENDUM- IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY
Results-Comments

The peritoneal nodule shows a well-circumscribed proliferation of spindled
cells arranged in fascicles without signiﬁcant cytologic atypia, necrosis

or mitoses. Immunohistochemical stains are expressed as follows:

CD117: negative

CD34: negative

Desmin: positive, diffuse

COMMENT: There are deposits of tumor within lymph nodes and the fat
approaching the mesenteric margin, but tumor is not identiﬁed at the inked
margin. The 0.8 cm peritoneal nodule is a spindle cell tumor, and the
differential diagnosis includes a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and

a leiomyoma. Immunohistochemical stains will be performed in order to
better characterize this lesion, and results will be issued in an addendum
report. The majority of the primary colon tumor has the pattern of a
conventional adenocarcinoma, with less than 50% having mucinous or Signet
ring cell features.

Pertinent Clinical Information
Small white peritoneal nodule adjacent to the right colon.

Gross Description
Specimen Material: Right colon.

The case is received in one part labeled with the patient's name, , medical record number and
given accession number and it

is accompanied by a requisition form labeled with the same name and same

accession number.

The specimen is received fresh in one container as "RIGHT COLON" and
consists of 26 cm length of cecum with a diameter of 5.4 cm, 1 1.3 cm length
of terminal ileum, a 2.5 cm diameter, and a 6.3 cm in length appendix with
a diameter of 1.2 cm. There is a 9.5 x 5.9 x 3.1 cm portion ofmesenteric

fat and a 16.0 x 5.9 x 0.6 cm portion of attached pericolonic fat. The

colonic serosa is tan-pink to tan-red, hemorrhagic. There is a cecal
umbilication located 16.5 cm from the proximal margin and 18 cm from the
distal margin. The mesentery displays a palpable 4.2 x 3.4 x 1.7 cm mass,

which extends to the surgical mesenteric margin. The mesenteric margin is
inked blue. The serosal umbilication is inked black. There is a 0.8 cm in
greatest dimension grey-white hard, ovoid nodule attached to gray-white to
tan-pink ﬁbromembranous tissue attached to the cecal serosal surface. The
cecal mucosa displays a tan-red to tan-green, 7.2 x 6.9 cm, endophytic,
hard, ulcerative, circumferential tumor which obliterates the ileocecal
valve. The adjacent appendiceal oriﬁce is located 11.2 cm from the
proximal margin and is 9.9 cm from the distal margin. The cut surface of
the tumor measures 4.5 cm thick, involves the attached fat and abuts the
inked serosa. Multiple lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging from 1.8 to 0.3
cm Their cut surfaces and grey-white and hard. The cut surface of the
mesenteric mass display that it abuts the mesenteric margin and is
gray-white and hard. The appendix is unremarkable. Additional matted lymph
nodes are identiﬁed ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 cm in diameter.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

1: proximal margin

2: distal margin

3: full thickness section of cecal tumor

4-5: representative section of tumor within mesentery
6: tumor to appendiceal oriﬁce
