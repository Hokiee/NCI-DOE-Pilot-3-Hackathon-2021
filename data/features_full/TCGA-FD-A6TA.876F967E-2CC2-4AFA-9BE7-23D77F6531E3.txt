The patient is a year—01d maIe w1th history of bIadder cancer who undergoes
radicaI cystectomy and CNS.

Specimens Received:

F: Right DistaI ureter

Gross Description: _ . . _
Rece1ved are 51x conta1ners bear1ng the pat1ent's name and med1ca1 record
number.

A. The first container is additionaIIy IabeIed "right pe1vic Iymph node".
Received fresh for intraoperative diagnos1s is a 4 x 4 x 2 cm aggregate of
yeIIow. IobuIated fibroadipose t1ssue. The firmest Iymph node 15 frozen and
read as "Iymph node, no tumor" by Dr. []. Addit1ona1 y identified are seven
Iymph nodes ranging in s1ze from 0.3-2.0 cm in greatest dimen51on.

Representative sect1ons are submitted as foIIows:

AlFs: frozen section remnant

A2: four Iym h nodes

A3: one Iymp node

A4: one Iymph node _

AS: one matted Iymph node, quadr1sected

B. The second container is additionaIIy IabeIed ”Ieft peric Iymph node".
Received fresh for intraoperative diagnosis is a 1.5 cm yeIIow—tan noduIe
grosst consistent with Iymph node. It 15 bisected, frozen and read as
metastatic urothe11a1 carc1noma" by Dr. []. It is entirer submitted in
cassette BlFS.

C. The third container is additionaIIy IabeIed "right peric Iymph node".
Received fresh is a S x 3 x 1 cm aggregate of yeIIow, Iobu1ated fibroadipose
tissue. Identified are five Iymph node candidates rangin in size from 0.5—2.0
cm in greatest d1mension. Representative sections are su mitted as foIIows:

C1: two Iymph nodes
C2: two Iymph nodes
c3: one Iymph node

D. The fourth container is additionaIIy IabeIed "Ieft peric Iymph node".
Received fresh and pIaced in formaIin is a 6 x 4 x 1 cm aggregate of yeIIow,
IobuIated fibroad1pose t1ssue. Identified are 15 Iymph node candidates ranging
in s1ze from 0.2-2.5 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are
submitted as foIIows:

01: four Iym h nodes

DZ: two Iymp nodes

D3: three Iymph nodes

D4: three Iymph nodes

05: one Iymph node, bisected
06: one Iymph node, bisected

Page 2

D7: one Iymph node, bisected

E. The fifth container is additionaIIy IabeIed "bIadder, prostate, vas
deferens". Received fresh and ﬁIaced in formaIin is a 14 x 5.9 x 4 cm
cystoprostatectomy specimen w1t attached mesenter1c fat. The prostate measures
5 x 4 x 3.5 cm. The Ieft seminaI vesicIe measures 2.5 x 1 cm and the Ieft vas
deferens 2.5 x 0.5 cm. The right seminaI vesicIe measures 4 x 1.5 cm and the
right vas deferens 3 x 0.5 cm. The right haIf of the prostate is inked b1ue and
the Ieft haIf is inked black. The bIa der measures 6 x 6 x 8 cm. The right and
Ieft ureteraI stumps measure 2 x 0.4 cm and 2.4 x 0:6 cm, resEectiveIg. The
anterior and posterior surfaces of the bIadder are 1nked bIac . The Iadder is
opened anteriorIy anng the urethra using a Y-shaped incision and reveaIs
tan—brown, g1istening, wrinkIed mucosa over the dome. The remainder of the
bIadder demonstrates a firm, white—tan, poorIy circumscribed, irreguIarI

shaped. granuIar, friabIe mass. It is grosst based on the anterior waI but
extends around the IateraI waIIs to the posterior waII in an aImost
circumferentiaI manner. It measures 6 x 3 x 2 cm. There are aIso two 0.3-0.5
cm, circuIar. raised, white—tan pIaques on the dome. The prostate and bIadder
are seria11¥ sectioned. The Iargest mass grosst invades through the right and
Ieft Iatera waIIs of the bIadder to a max1mum depth of 2.1 cm. It is apparent
at the inked margins of the r1ght and Ieft Iatera waIIs. The mass aIso invades
through the posterior waII, in eriorIy at the tr1gone to a depth of 0.7 cm, 1 cm
away rom the nearest bIack inked margin. MuItipIe phIeboIiths are identified.

A150 received is a 6 x 4 x 3 cm aggregate of yeIIow, IobuIated fibroadipose
tissue that is detached from the main specimen. Identified is one firm noduIe
measuring 2 cm in greatest dimension. It is bisected to reveaI a noduIar,

weii—circumscribed. white—yeIiow mass. Representative sections are submitted as
o ows:

E1: distaI urethraI margin

E2: Ieft ureteraI margin

E3: right ureteraI margin E4: smaII pIaque and adjacent normaI dome
E5: Iarger pIaque and adjacent normaI dome

E6: norma] anter1or waII and normal posterior waII, posterior inked bIack
E7: trigone, posterior waII

E8: Ieft 1ateraI/anterior waII

E9: right IateraI/anterior waII

E10: Ieft waII and prostate

E11: right waII and prostate

E12,E13: representative prostate

E14: representative biIateraI seminaI vesicIes and vasa deferentia
E15,E16: extravesicuIar noduIe bisected

E17,E18: 1eft ureteraI margin candidates

E19 Ieft ureteraI margin candidate

PIease note E8 is decaIcified due to calcific vesseIs. PIease note gross
photographs are taken.

F. The sixth container is additionaIIy IabeIed "right distaI ureter stitch on
non—margin side". Received fresh and pIaced in formaIin is a 0.5 cm tubuIar
structure with an externaI diameter of 0.4 cm and a pinpoint Iumen. A stitch is
identified at the non—margin side. The margin side is removed and submitted
face down in cassette F1. The remainder is seriaIIy sectioned and entirer
submitted in cassette F2.

Intraoperative consuit Diagnosis:
AlFs. R1ght per1c Iym h node: Lymph node, no tumor.
BlFS. Le t per1c Iymp node: Metastat1c urotheIia1 carcinoma.
