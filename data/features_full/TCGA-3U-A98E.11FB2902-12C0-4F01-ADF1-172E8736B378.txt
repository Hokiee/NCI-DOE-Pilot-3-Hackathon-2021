C1inica1 History:

The patient is a year 01d fema1e with mesothe1ioma who undergoes 1eft
thoracotomy.

Specimens Received:

A: Aortic adven tissue

B: AP window node

C: Pericardium cyst; removai
D: #7 1ym h node

E: Left p uera

Gross Description:

Received are five containers, each 1abe1ed with the patient‘s name and medicai
record number.

A. Container A_is further_designated "1. Aortic adven tissue." Received fresh
for frozen section diagnOSis is a 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm pink-tan, rubbery tissue.
that is entire1y frozen. Frozen section diagnOSis is "pOSitive for infiitrating

mesothe1ioma" by Dr. []. The frozen section remnant is submitted entire1y in
cassette A1FS.

B. Container B is further designated "2. AP window node." Received fresh and
piaced in formaiin are four tan-brown, rubbery fragments of tissue ranging in
measurement from 1.9 to 0.4 cm. The 1arﬁest 1ymph node is bisected to reveai a
homogeneous pa1e, white, cut surface. T e specimen is submitted as foiiows:

Bl: 1argest 1ymph node bisected
82: four candidate 1ym h nodes
B3: two candidate 1ymp nodes
B4: remaining soft tissue

C. Container C is further designated "3. Pericardium cyst; removai." Received
fresh and p1aced in formaiin is a pink-tan cystic mass measuring 4 x 2 x 1.5 cm.
The outer surface is pink and trans1ucent with a mi1d amount of adipose tissue.
The wa11 is thin and is sectioned Open to reveai approximateiy 5 CC of Ciear to
1ight, yeiiow fiuid. There are no masses or 1esions a1ong the cyst wa11 and it

appears to be simpie uni1ocu1ar cyst. The specimen is entireiy submitted in
cassettes C1—C3.

D. Container D is further designated "4. #7 1Kmph node." Received fresh and
p1aced in formaiin is a 1.8 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm pin —tan Izmph node. It is bisected

to revea1 a brown—tan, heterogenous cut surface and t e specimen is submitted in
cassette Dl.

E. Container E is further designated "5. Left piuera.” Received fresh and
piaced in forma1in is a 150.9 gram, 12.5 x 11.8 x 2.5 cm ag regate Of p1eura.
The specimen arrived in mu1tip e pieces and comes unorienteg. The majority of
the SEeCimen has thin, Kink—tan, transiucent p1eura but there are areas of
tan—w ite thickening. T e 1argest noduiar area measures 9.5 x 5.5 x 3 cm. The
vo1ume of the specimen is 250 cc. A second fra ment contains a 4 x 2 x 3.5 cm
white—tan, firm to rubber noduie. It is seria1 y sectioned to reveai a fairiy
homogeneous tan—white-pin , cut surface. Sectioning of the 1arger noduie reveais
a tan-white to focaiiy yeiiow cut surface. The tumor in most areas appears
de1ineated from the surrounding muscie and soft tissue but in other areas
appears to be Within the musc1e. The specimen is submitted as fo110ws:

E1—E8: mu1tip1e sections of 1argest noduie with surrounding soft tissue
