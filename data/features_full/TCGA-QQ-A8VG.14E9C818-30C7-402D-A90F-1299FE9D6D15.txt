GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. WLE MELANOMA RIGHT LOWER BACK
Received fresh in single matching container and subsequently ﬁxed in formalin, labeled
“melanoma right back”, is an wide excision specimen consisting of an ellipse of skin and
underlying soft tissue. The specimen measures 21.3 cm x 10.1 cm and is excised to a variable
depth of 2.0 cm medially to 5.0 cm laterally. A well healed scar is identiﬁed on the medial
aspect of the skin surface measuring 5.2 cm in length, located 2.2 cm from the medial surgical
margin. A ﬁrm mass is palpable through the length of the specimen in the soft tissue. The
specimen is oriented by sutures as follows: a single suture marks the medial most margin, a
double suture marks the cephalad (superior) margin and a triple suture marks the lateral margin.
The specimen is inked as follows: deep margin: black, medial margin: green, lateral margin: red,
cephalad (superior) margin: blue and the caudal (inferior) margin: orange. The specimen is
serially sectioned perpendicular to its long axis to reveal a heterogeneous mass with alternating
ﬂeshy and ﬁbrotic areas, located in the soft tissue. The medial aspect of this mass is located just
deep to the healed surgical scar and is tan-pink, ﬂeshy, measuring 3.5 cm x 3.5 cm x 2.2 cm in
maximum dimensions. The fascia underlying the ﬂeshy area is grossly negative for tumor and is
located <0.1 cm from the ﬂeshy area. Lateral to the ﬂeshy area, the mass has a tan-white to pale
yellow ﬁbrotic appearance with an inﬁltrating edge. In the central part of the specimen, another
ﬂeshy, tan-pink, fairly well-circumscribed area is identiﬁed and measuring 2.5 x 1.9 x 2.2 cm,
located approximately 0.2 cm from the deep fascial margin. Lateral to this area, the mass has a
ﬁbrotic, tan-white, inﬁltrative appearance. The medial, lateral, cephalad (superior) and caudal
(inferior) surgical resection margins are grossly negative for tumor. The remainder of the soft
tissue has a pale yellow, lobulated appearance with multiple interspersed ﬁbrous septae. Digistal
images are taken. Representative sections from the specimen are submitted for microscopic
examination as follows:

A1-A3: perpendicular medial margin submitted en-face

A4—A8: perpendicular supero-medial margin

A9-Al7: perpendicular superior margin, medial half

Al 8-A25: perpendicular superior margin, lateral half

A26-A32: perpendicular supero-lateral margin

A33-A39: perpendicular infero-lateral margin

A40-A55: perpendicular inferior margin, lateral half

A56-A63: perpendicular inferior margin, medial half

A64-A67: perpendicular infero-medial margin

A68-A75: perpendicular deep margin underlying ﬂeshy tumor mass (medial part of

specimen)

Date of Surgery:
A74-A75: tumor to closest deep margin
A76: ﬂeshy tumor mass (closest to skin) underlying previous biopsy site
A77-A78: ﬂeshy tumor mass deep to previous biopsy site
A79-A80: ﬁbrotic area (lateral to medial ﬂeshy area) to deep margin
A81-A82: ﬂeshy area in center of specimen
A83-A84: ﬁbrotic areas in lateral half of specimen
A85: representative uninvolved fat
A86-A88: additional tumor mass (closest to skin) underlying previous biopsy site

DIAGNOSIS:
A. RIGHT LOWER BACK, WIDE LOCAL EXCISION:
~MALIGNANT PERIPHERAL NERVE SHEATH TUMOR (MPNST) ARISING IN
ASSOCIATION WITH A DIFFUSE NEUROFIBROMA
~SURGICAL MARGINS NEGATIVE FOR MPNST
-SUPERIOR, INFERIOR, LATERAL AND MEDIAL SURGICAL MARGIN S
F OCALLY POSITIVE FOR NEUROFIBROMA

Comment: There is a diffuse neuroﬁbroma involving much of the tissue in the resection
specimen extending to the above captioned margins. In the region of the right paraspinous tissue
discrete hypercellular nodular proliferation of fusiform to spindled cells is present associated
with mitotic activity and cytologic pleomorphism. A prominent lymphocytic inﬂammatory cell
inﬁltrate is present. No overlying intraepithelial melanocytic proliferation is identiﬁed.

The original biopsy material suggested a melanoma arising in association with a peripheral nerve
sheath tumor. The ﬁndings in the resection specimen are more consistent with a focus of MPNST
for arising within a pre-existing neuroﬁbroma. The degree of 8100 in her neck cavity would be
unusual in MPNST however the other morphologic ﬁndings are most consistent with the above
stated interpretation The MPNST is approximately 3 mm from the deep resection margin.
