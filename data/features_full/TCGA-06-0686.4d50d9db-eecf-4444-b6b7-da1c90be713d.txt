CLINICAL HISTORY r
has mental status change and fatigue. On imaging

there is a rig t empora , lobulated, enhancing mass with central cystic
component and extensive mass effect.

OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
Not Given

Operation/Specimen: A: Brain, excision biopsy

B: Brain, right temporal tumor, excision biopsy

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: .
A and B. Brain, right, excision: Glioblastoma. MIB~1 proliferation index:

65%.
See Comment.

COMMENT
The specimens are portions of cerebrum focally infiltrated and extensively

effaced by an astrocytic neoplastic proliferation with nuclear anaplasia,
prominent mitotic activity, exuberant microvascular cellular proliferation
with vascular necrosis and thrombosis, and extensive tumor necrosis, i.e. a

glioblastoma.

Interpretation

 

POSITIVE ~ Methylated MGMT promoter is detected.

Results—Comments
Testing was done on block

TEST DESCRIETEON: Bisulfite treatment of DNA followed by PCR amplification of
both methylated and unmethylated MGMT promoter sequences, with products
detected by gel electrophoresis.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A.

Received fresh, large portion of thick, diffluent, tannish~brown material, 3 x
3 x 0.8 cm.. In total, Al and A2.

 

B.

SPECIMEN: Right temporal tumor.

FIXATIVE: None.

GENERAL: Received is a 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. aggregate of irregular, tan‘gray to
white focally hemorrhagic soft tissue fragments.

SECTIONS: Bl entirely submitted.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION .
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates gliofibrillogenesis by the
neoplastic cells. About 2% of the tumor cells express the p53 protein. With
the MIBHl there is a proliferation index of about 65% throughout the tumor.
