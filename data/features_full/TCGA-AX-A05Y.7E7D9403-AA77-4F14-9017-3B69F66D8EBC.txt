Gross Description
The specimens are received in seven formalin-filled containers, each labeled

' " The first container is labeled ”cervix. uterus. bilateral
salpingo-Dophorectomy." It consists of a hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo—oophorectom Specimen with measurements as described in the
intraoperative consu tation. There is a 4.8 x 2.5 x 0.7 cm polypoid endometrial
mass occupying the posterior uterine wall and the lateral anterior uterine
walls. The mass grossly appears to involve the lower uterine segment and a pears
to end just before the beginnin of the endocervix. The maximum myometria wall
thickness is 1.7 cm. Grossly, t e tumor appears to extend ~ 0.6 cm of total

1.7 cm wall thickness. The probable fallopian tubes bilaterally are sclerosed
and adhesed With the surrounding tissue, probably due to a rior procedure.
Lumen of both probable fallopian tubes is not identified La eled Al—posterior
cervix: A2 — posterior endocervix: A3 — posterior endomyometrium: A4 - anterior
cervix; AS - anterior endocerVix; A6 - anterior endomyometrium; A7 - posterior
endomyometrium; A8 — posterior lower uterine segment; A9 — anterior
endomyometrium; A10 — right ovary and periadenexal tissue; A11 — left ovary and
periadenexal tissue. Jar 3

The second container is labeled "left pelvic lymph node (external iliac)." It
consists of multiple irre ular fatty tissue fragments, aggregating to S x 4 x 1
cm. Dissection of these atty tissue fragments reveals seven lymph nodes.
Labeled 81- two lymph nodes: 82 - two lymph nodes; 83 - one lymph node; 84 — two

T e third container is labeled "left obturator lymph node." It consists of
multiple irregular tan-yellow fatty tissue fra ments, aggregating to 3 x 3 x 1
cm. Dissection of these fragments reveals two lymph nodes, the largest measuring
1.5 x 1 x 1 cm. Labeled Cl— one lymph node; C2 - one l mph node. Jar l.

The fourth container is labeled ”right external iliac lymph node." It consists
of multiple irregular tan—yellow fatty tissue fragments aggre ating to 6 x 3 x 1
