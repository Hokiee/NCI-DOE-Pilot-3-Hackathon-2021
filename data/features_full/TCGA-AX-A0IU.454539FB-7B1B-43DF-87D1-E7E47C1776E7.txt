GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1) Received in fixative, labeled with the patient's name and unit number and "uterus,

; cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries", is a 232 gram specimen including a previously
opened uterus (10.5 x 7.2 x 5.5 cm), left fallopian tube (5.7 cm in length, 04—o.6 cm
in diameter), left ovary (2.5 x 2.2 x 1.1 cm), right fallopian tube (6.2 cm in length,
0.5-0.7 cm in diameter), right ovary (3.1 x 2.2 x 1.4 cm). The external surface of
the uterus is dull and covered by multiple fine adhesions. There is an area (1.5 x
1.0 cm) in the lower pole of the left ovary which is ragged and probably represents a
resection margin (inked black). There is no visible gross lesion on the external
surface of the specimen. The cervix measures 2.2 x 2.0 cm and is covered by red~tan
slightly hemorrhagic smooth mucosa. The external os is slit—like and measures 0.4 x
0.2 cm. The endocervical canal is 2.7 cm in length and has pink—tan herringbone
mucosa. The endometrial cavity measures 5.5 cm in length x 3.7 cm from cornu to
cornu. There is an extensive exophytic papillary growth involving almost the entire
endometrium sparing only the lower uterine segment, 0.3 cm on the anterior surface and
1.1 cm from the posterior surface. The uninvolved endometrium has pink—tan appearance
and measures 0.2 to 0.4 cm in thickness. The tumor mass is white-tan, fragile and
papillary. The tumor measures 6.2 cm (combined on anterior and posterior surface) x
5.2 cm x 1.4 cm (maximum thickness). The central portion of the tumor is necrotic.
Grossly, the tumor invades myometrium with the maximum extent of the anterior uterine
wall, 1.4 cm of muscle invasion with 2.8 cm wall thickness. There is a partially
calcified leiomyoma (4.5 cm in diameter) located within the myometrium of the
posterior wall with a focal area of hemorrhage. Both fallopian tubes have previously
removed central portions, consistent with a history of bilateral tubal ligation.
There is a paratubal cyst (0.4 cm in diameter) with smooth internal lining and filled
with yellow fluid, which is located in the distal portion of the right fallopian tube.
otherwise, the fallopian tubes are unremarkable. The left ovary is composed of
sclerotic white-yellow tissue with multiple corpora albicantia. The right ovary has
smooth and glistening pink-tan surface with white-yellow sclerotic parenchyma and
multiple corpora albicantia. The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted as
follows:
