CLINICAL HISTORY:

    

with ovarian carcinoma, malignant ef u31cn an. asc1tes.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Right ovary (AFl)", received fresh. A 162 gram, 12.2 x 9.5 x 3.8 cm
aggregate of lobulated, friable, gray—tan tissue with focally adherent blood
clot. ‘Representative tissue is froaen as AFl. The remnant is submitted as
Al. Additional sections submitted as A2—3.

B. “Uterus" (gross consult), received fresh. A 75.4 gram, 7.5 x 4.5 x 3.8 cm
uterus with an attached 3.5 x 2.4 cm cervix and attached 5.8 x 0.6 cm right
fallopian tube. The serosa is markedly roughened with multiple fibrous
adhesions and focally discolored green, tan. The ectocervix is smooth,
gray—white and glistening with a central patent 1.4 cm os extending into a
trabecular yellow endocervical canal. The endometrium is granular, grayetan
and less than 0.1 cm in uniform thickness. The myometrium is 1.4 cm in
thickness and contains two intramural white circumscribed nodules each 0.8 cm
in diameter. Sectioning of the fallopian tube reveals a patent lumen and
abundant hemorrhage in the adjacent peritubular soft tissue.

Block Summary:

Bl—2 Anterior and posterior cervix, respectively.

83—4 Anterior and posterior endomyometrium respectively.
BS Right fallopian tube.

Also received is a 529 x 4.5 x 2.6 cm aggregate of granular gray—tan-tissue
from which representative sections are submitted as 36.

C. “Omentum”, received fresh. Four fragments of finely lobulated yellow—pink
adipose aggregating 14.5 x 11.5 x 0.6 cm. No discrete lesions or nodules are
noted. Representative sections are submitted as Cl and 02.

Each fragment is sampled.

D. "Left tube and ovary“, received fresh.‘ A 16.? gram aggregate of tissue
composed of a 4.5 x 0.5 cm segment of fallopian tube adjacent to a nodular and
slightly distorted 3.7 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm ovary. The serosa is markedly granular
and studded with small friable nodules. Sectioning the tube reveals a patent
lumen. Sectioning of the ovary reveals a yellow—white fibrous cut surface.
Representative sections from the ovary are submitted as D1 and from the tube
as D2. '

E. "Bladder flap tumor", received fresh. A 7.5 x 4.4 x 2.2 cm aggregate of
soft, friable, pink—tan tissue from representative sections are submitted as
E1 and E2.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONdULTATION: '
A. "Right ovary": AFl- adenocarcinoma—
B. "Uterus“ (gross consult) 1 no evidence of endome rial carcinoma
