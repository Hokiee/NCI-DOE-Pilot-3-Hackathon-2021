Left axi11ary 1ymphadenopathy, atypica1 me1anocytic 1esion removed from back in

GROSS DESCRI PTION

1. Labe1ed "1eft axi11ary contents": The specimen consists of skin and deep
subcutaneous

tissue measuring 23 x 22 x 12 cm. On one surface there is a skin e11ipse measuring
16 x 7

gm which is c1ear, a1though there is increased wrink1ing and skin markings. Most
o t e

specimen is composed of a 1arge tumor which measures 14 cm in diameter. In
addition there

are sma11er sate11ites of tumor in the deep portions of the specimen.
Apﬁroximate1y 80% of

e tumor 15 necrotic. Additiona1 sate11ite tumor nodu1es measure up to 5 cm.
Some are

necrotic with the appearance of the main mass, and others are smooth encepha1oid
1ight

brown. There are a1so mu1tip1e sma11 brown gross1y benign 1ymph nodes. samp1ed as
1A—1C —

1arge mass, 1D - axi11ary vein, 1E — sate11ite tumor mass, 1F — one sate11ite node.

two1sate11ite nodes, 1H - two sate11ite nodes, 11 — one sate11ite node, 13 _

sate€11te nodes, 1K - skin. lL—lN additiona1 encepha1oid sate11ite tumor.

ﬁ'f Labe1ed "supra—axi11ary 1ymph node“: The specimen consists of mu1tip1e pieces
0 at

pad varying in size from 1.0 up to 4.0 cm. There is a soft brown 1ymph node
measuring 0.7

1:cm. No additiona1 1ymph nodes are identified. Samp1ed as 2A - 1ymph nodes' 23 ~
at.

3. Labe1ed "1eft supra— axi11ary 1ymph node for frozen section" The specimen
consists of

a 1. 3 cm choco1ate brown 1ymph node. Entire1y embedded in cassette 3FSA.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION (FS): — Benign 1ymph node.

4. Labe1ed "1eve1 II and III 1eft axi11ary 1ymph nodes": The specimen consists of
a

triangu1ar fat measuring 5.0 cm. It contains mu1tip1e soft brown 1ymph nodes. Cut

sections are smooth brown and they appear benign. samp1ed as 4A - two 1ymph nodes
bisected, 4B - remaining 1ymph nodes.

5. Labe1ed "1eft subscapu1aris 1ymph nodes": The specimen consists of a fat pad
measur1ng . _ _
6 cm. No 1ymph nodes are 1dent1f1ed on gross exam. Samp1ed in cassette 5A.

Microscopic sections are prepared and interpreted.

MICROSCOPIC

Tamer has a mixed spind1e and epithe1ioid pattern. It is found in irregu1ar whor1s
an

Easic1es. Tumor ce11s are 1arge, hyperchromatic, and sometimes mu1tinuc1eated.
T ere are

occasiona1 nuc1ear pseudoinc1usions. and frequent mitotic figures, some of which
are

abnorma1. Immunostain for $100 protein is strong1y positive in a1most a11 tumor

Immunostain for HMB-45 shows foca1 weak staining in 1ess than 5% of the tumor

DIAGNOSIS

l. LABELED "LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS".
METASTATIC MALIGNANT MELANOMA (14 CM DIAMETER).
- APPROXIMATELY 80% OF TUMOR IS NECROTIC.

- METASTATIC MALIGNANT MELANOMA WITHIN MULTIPLE ADDITIONAL LARGE LYMPH
NODES.

- THIRTEEN ADDITIONAL LYMPH NODES ARE BENIGN.
- UNREMARKABLE LEFT AXILLARY SKIN.
— AJCC PATHOLOGIC STAGING T1 N2a.

2. LABELED "BIOPSY 0F SUPRAAXILLARY LYMPH NODE".
- THREE BENIGN LYMPH NODES.

3. LABELED "BIOPSY OF LEFT SUPRAAXILLARY LYMPH NODE FOR FROZEN SECTION".
- ONE BENIGN LYMPH NODE.

4. LABELED "LEVEL II AND LEVEL III LEFT AXILLARY LYMPH NODES".
- SIX BENIGN LYMPH NODES.

5. LABELED "LEFT SUBSCAPSULARIS LYMPH NODE".
- FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE.
- LYMPH NODES ARE NOT IDENTIFIED.

ADDENDUM

ADDENDUM NUMBER ONE

Agditiona1 sections were submitted in cassettes 10 and 1P of the en1arged 1ymph
no es

1susgected to contain metastatic ma1ignant me1anoma. Four of these five additiona1
ymp . . . .
nodes contain metastatic me1anoma. Therefore, d1agnos1s 1 1s rev1sed as fo11ows:

DIAGNOSIS:

1. LABELED "LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS":

- METASTATIC MALIGNANT MELANOMA WITHIN FIVE OF NINETEEN LYMPH NODES.
LARGEST METASTASIS IS A BULKY MASS MEASURING 14 CM DIAMETER.
APPROXIMATELY 80 PERCENT OF BULKY TUMOR MASS IS NECROTIC. V
UNREMARKABLE LEFT AXILLARY SKIN.
