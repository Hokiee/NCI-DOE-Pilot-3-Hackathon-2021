CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Lung mass.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in four parts, each labeled with the

patient's name.

1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'left upper lobe wedge

resection, r/o carcinoma'. It consists of a wedge shaped portion of
lung, measuring 9 x 4 x 4 cm. The specimen weighs 36 grams. There is
a staple line identified on the specimen measuring 9 cm and 3 cm in
length. The staple line is inked black and the pleural surface is

inked blue. The pleural surface shows dimpling at one area. Serial
sectioning of the specimen reveals a gray white firm irregular mass,
measuring 3.5 x 3.4 x 1.8 cm. The mass is 1 cm away from the staple
line. The mass has a gray white cut surface. The remainder of the

lung has tan pink spongy parenchyma. One piece cut from the mass is
submitted for intraoperative microscopic examination. Representative
sections are submitted.

2. Part two is received in formalin, labeled 'station #9 lymph

node'. It consists of a single piece of tan maroon irregular soft
tissue, measuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is bisected and
entirely submitted.

3. Part three is received in formalin, labeled 'station #11 lymph

node'. It consists of a single piece of tan maroon irregular soft

tissue consistent with lymph node, measuring 1.5 x 0.9 x 0.2 cm. The
specimen is bisected and entirely submitted for microscopic
examination.

4. Part four is labeled 'upper lobe completion lobectomy'. It

consists of a lobe of lung measuring 15 x 8 x 4 cm. The specimen
weighs 169 grams. There are two staple lines identified on the
specimen, measuring 15 cm and 8 cm in length. The staple line is
inked black. The bronchus measures 2.5 cm in diameter and the
bronchial vessels measures 2.0 cm in diameter. The bronchial
vascular margin is shaved. Serial sectioning of the specimen shows
tan maroon spongy parenchyma. No definite mass lesion or fibrosis is
identified. Representative sections are submitted for microscopic
examination.

ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS:

KRAS and EGFR were sent on- for patient—

. The test is to be performed on tissue from case

The case report, slides, and blocks for the

cited accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist
whose signature appears below reviewed the original pathology

report, examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1D
appropriate to the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis.

x9 unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to- where the
subject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be
issued when the results of this molecular test are available.

ADDENDUM #2:

MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY
KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS
Specimen #

Body Site: Left upper lobe of lung
Specimen Type: Slides
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma

RESULTS: Wild-type gene.

INTERPRETATION:
No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.

COMMENT:

Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor
prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS
mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly
associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.

This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of

the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated

for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in
fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In
particular the test performance has been established in samples of
colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor
these mutations, although several other tissues are also known to
harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,
appendix, etc.).

Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide
additional information regarding this patient's probability of

response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if
clinically indicated. See references.

METHOD/LIMITATIONS:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

ADDENDUM #3:

EGFR Mutation Analysis

Body Site: Left upper lobe of lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: No mutation detected

INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified; however 18-20% of
patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and without identifiable
mutations are reported to be responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor therapies.

COMMENT: This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine
kinase domain; based on the current literature, the vast majority of
mutations are expected to occur in these exons. The analytical
sensitivity of the assay is 10-20%, thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected.

Most data published to date pertain to gefitinib (lressa(r)).
Similar data have been seen in studies using erlotinib (Tarceva(r)).

Homozygosity for the frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A
was identified. The polymorphism is not likely to have clinical
significance.

This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.

METHOD/LIMITATION:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified

and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary electrophoresis
and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative results may
occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic
heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

ADDENDUM 4:

Fluorescence ln-Situ Hybridization (FISH)

Body Site: Left upper lobe of lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma

INTERPRETATION:

Negative for a rearrangement involving the ALK gene. Three to four
copies of ALK were observed in 64.0% of cells, and five to six
copies of ALK were observed in 16.5% of cells, suggesting the
presence of a neoplasm with gains of chromosome 2 or 2p.

Probe #Nuclei Examined % Positive Nuclei %
Control values

2p23(ALK)V 200 0 02.2

A total of 200 cells were scored.

FINDINGS: FISH was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections
using dual color break-apart prob_) to the-

gene at 2p23. this probe flanks the entire gene. If a rearrangement
involving ALK is present, inversion or translocation, one of the two
probe signals separates as one red (orange) and one green signal. In
this specimen, separated signals were present in 0% of the nuclei
scored. Based on laboratory validation data, these results are

within the normal limits.
