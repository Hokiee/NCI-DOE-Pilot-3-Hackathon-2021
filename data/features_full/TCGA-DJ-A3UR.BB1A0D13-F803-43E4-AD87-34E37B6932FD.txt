1). The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled “Three tracheal and superior medlastlnal lymph nodes" ‘
and consists of three lymph nodes measuring 0.3 cm. 0.3 cm, and 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. Entirely submitted for frozen

section.

Summary of sections:
FSC - frozen section control

2). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Total thyroidectomy" and consists of a thyroid weighing 19 g. The specimen is
previously inked and sectioned. The right lobe measures 4.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm , the left lobe measures 4.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm and the
isthmus measures 2.5 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm. The external surface is covered by a thin fibrous capsule and attached muscle anterioriy.
The posterior surface of the specimen is inked black. and the anterior is inked blue. Sectioning reveals 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm well
circumscribed tan ovoid nodule in the right lobe abutting the anterior capsule. Sectioning through the remaining tissue reveals three
white nodules in the isthmus, left, right, lobes averaging 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. The remaining thyroid parenchyma is red tan and
beefy. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for and a photograph has been taken. The remaining tissue
is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
