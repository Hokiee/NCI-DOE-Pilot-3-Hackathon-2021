GROSS DEFGRIPTION:

D. The specimen consists piece of tissue, 2.5 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm.
Submitted in toto for QB.

The specimen is submitted in tote for frozen section. -

E. The specimen is labelled "superior mesenteric lymph noden and consists of
one piece of lymphoid tissue which measures 1.0 cm in largest dimension. The
specimen is submitted in note in R.

F. The specimen is labeled “pancreas, (Whipple's specimen)". The specimen is

composed or the head of the pancreas, which measures 6.0 x 5.0 x 2.5 cm with

d. attached lower segment of stomach, which measures 7.0 x 5.0 cm and duodenal

a 9 tissue which measures 24.5 cm in length and 4.5 cm in circumference. A tumor

a“: mass measures 4.5 x 2.0 x 2.5 cm is identitied in the pancreas surrounding the
common bile duct. The tumor mass is poorly circumscribed and yellow/white in
color. There are areas of cystic formation and no area of hemorrhage or
necrosis in the tumor. The common bile duct is patent and the tumor has been
previously out along the common bile duct. The tumor is in contact with the
ampulla grossly, and is about 3.7 cm away from the bile duct resection
margin. The stomach and the upper segment of the duodenal mucosa is grossly
unremarkable. The mucosal surface of the lower 8.5 cm of the duodenum is
hemorrhagic in color.

Representative sections or the specimen are submitted as follows:
F1 - is the solace pancreatic resection margin.

32, F3 — tissue from uncinate pancreas.

F -bile duct resection margin.

F5 ~ stomach resection margin.

F6 ~ duodenal resection margin.

F7 to F9 - serial section of the ampulla region.

F10 to F19 — serial section of the tumor along the common bile duct
(from close to ampulla to for item ampulla.

P20 — tumor and small bowel.

F21 and F22 tumor extending close to the sercsal Surface of pancreas.

F23 random sections of the duodenum.
