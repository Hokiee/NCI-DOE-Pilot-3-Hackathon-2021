FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

A. Kidneydclt renal max
8. Base of toll. renal mass

Clinical HistogrlOgoraﬂve Bx:

Lott renal mass

r05 De ri o :
A. Single specimen designated left renal mass - initially received in a fresh state for
Oncogenotyping studies. is an ovoid and lobuiar portion of rod-tan. sot! tissue. 3.2 x 2.2 x 2.2 cm and 5
grams. The likely surgical margin is marked blue. The superﬁcial surface is glistening with light plnk~yetiow
changes. now marked orange. Sectioning demonstrates a well circumscribed, softened. partially
degenerated. yellow-tan tumor mas. measuring 2.2 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm. The tumor mass abuts the deep
surgical margin. and overlying renal capsule. The tumor partially abuts or approaches within 0.3 cm of the
peripheral surgical margins. The s cimen is entirely submitted for microscopic evaluation. in a
sequential fashion in A1'A6.i

B. Part B designated base of left renal mass. Received in formalin is a single discrete fragment of partially
oaulerized light pink and gray soft tissue measuring 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.1 cm. The fragment is submitted within a
filter bag in 81.

Microscopic gescrigtion;
A. Mlmscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic ﬁndings are reflected in tho diagnosis
rendered.

8. Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic ﬁndings are reﬂected in the diagnosis
rendered.

lntradepartrnental consultation: -has reviewed a representative slide of tumor and concurs
with the presence of a positive margin.
