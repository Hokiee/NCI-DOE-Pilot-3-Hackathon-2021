GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in the fresh state in two parts for frozen section evaluation.

A. _This is fragments of soft. tan and black lymph node measuring 8 mm in aggregate.
totally examined by frozen section as block A1.

B. This is fragments of soft, black lymph node measuring 8 mm in aggregate, totally
examined by frozen section as block Bl.

C. This Specimen is received in the fresh state from the operating room for permanent
section evaluation and consists of fragments of soft. black lymph node measuring 1 cm in
aggregate. totally submitted as block C1.

D. This specimen is received in the fresh state from the operating room for evaluation of
surgical margins and for tumor banking. requests evaluation of the specimen for
bronchial margin and for a parenchymal margin staple line present on the specimenr The
specimen consists of a left upper lobectomy specimen which measures 18 x 10 x 6 cm.
Present centrally is an area of distorted visceral pleura with underlying palpable tumor.
Blue ink is applied to the visceral pleural surface. Sections reveal a firm. partly
necrotic tan tumor which measures 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm, located 1.5 cm from the parenchymal
margin of concern to and 3 cm from the bronchial margin. Representative sections
of the tumor are removed by aseptic technique and submitted for tumor banking. Three soft,
black peribronchial lymph nodes are present measuring up to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension.
The following sections are submitted:
