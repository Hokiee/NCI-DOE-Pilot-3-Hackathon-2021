GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. Submitted fresh labelled "right upper lobe." It

consists of a lobe of lung tissue submitted for tissue
procurement. Lobe has a large perihilar lymph node present which
appears to have encased the bronchus at the point of resection.
This node, on cut section is 2.5 cm in greatest extent and has a
mottled tan and black cut surface. There is an area of pleural
thickening and puckering on the apical portion of the lobectomy.
Serial sections taken through the lung reveal a large discrete
circumscribed tumor in the apex measuring 2.3 x 1.9 x 1.5 cm. It
too has a granular tan and black cut surface appearance and is
sharply demarcated from the surrounding lung. It approaches the
visceral pleural surface but does not appear to involve it.
Adjacent to tumor there is an area of discoloration and thickening
ofthe lung parenchyma as well as some apparent emphysematous
changes in the more distal parenchyma. Portion oftumor and normal

tissue submitted for tissue procurement per request ofthe surgeon.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — bronchial margin; 2 — positive hilar lymph node
with encased bronchus; 3— hilar node; 4 — positive hilar lymph node

and second lymph node; 5—8 — tumor; 9 — additional lung section.

 

B. Submitted 10% formalin labelled "level 10 lymph node" is

a 1.5 cm aggregate of anthracotic soft tissue. -

C. Submitted fresh for frozen labelled "level 3 lymph node"

is a 1 cm nodule of anthracotic lymph node tissue submitted
entirely for frozen section.

D. Submitted fresh for frozen labelled "level 4 lymph node"

is a 1.7 cm aggregate of soft anthracotic tissue submitted
entirely for frozen section.

E. Submitted fresh for frozen section labelled "level 7

lymph node" is a 2.5 cm aggregate of anthracotic soft

tissue submitted entirely for frozen section.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Microscopic sections of the lung carcinoma reveals a poorly
differentiated non—small cell carcinoma. The tumor is growing in
discrete nodules and packets filling the air spaces with somewhat
columnar cells with a peripheral picket—fence—Iike pattern of
growth. Individual cells are hyperchromatic with frequent mitotic
activity. The tumor is negative for mucicarmine. It does show

strong positivity for 'I'TF—1 and CEA and is negative for P63. This

indicates that it is a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.

Results of the resection are summarized in the following template.

Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma.

Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated.

Primary tumor (pT): Tumor is 2.3 cm in size and not involve the

visceral pleural surface (pT1b).

Margins of resection: Negative.

Direct extension of tumor: Absent.

Venous (large vessel) invasion: Present.

Arterial (large vessel) invasion: Negative.

Lymphatic (small vessel) invasion: Small vessel invasion present.

Regional lymph nodes (pN): 1 of 2 hilar lymph nodes contains

metastatic carcinoma. All sampled mediastinal lymph nodes are
negative for tumor (pN1).

Distant metastasis (pM): pMX.

Other findings: Focal infarction distal to the tumor.

Em physematous changes.

DIAGNOSIS

A. Lung, right upper lobectomy:
Invasive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Tumor is confined to the lung and does not involve the visceral
pleural surface.
One of two peribronchial lymph nodes is positive for metastatic
carcinoma (1/2).
Large venous vessel and lymphatic vessel invasion by tumor is
present. Emphysematous changes.
Focal distal infarction.

B. Lymph node, level 10, resection:
Negative for malignancy.

C. Lymph node, level 3, resection:
Negative for malignancy.

D. Lymph node, level 4, resection:
Negative for malignancy.

E. Level 7, resection:

Negative for malignancy.
