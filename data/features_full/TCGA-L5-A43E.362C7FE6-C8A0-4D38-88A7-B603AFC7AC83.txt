1. ”Distal esophagus proximal stomach". Received in a medium container of
formalin is a previously opened transhiatal esophagectomy specimen consisting
of distal esophagus, 7.2 cm in length, 2.3 to 4.7 cm in internal
circumference, proximal stomach, 6.0 cm in length. 9.5 cm in internal
circumference and attached perigastric adipose tissue. Specimen is notable for
a 7.0 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm circumferential tan, multilobulated, polypoid mass
arising from nodular mucosa, 3.5 cm above the gastroesophageal junction,
measurement from short lesion, 3.0 cm from the proximal staple line and 4.5 cm
from the distal gastric resection margin. The mass has tan, solid cut surfaces
and grossly does not appear to invade into the underlying Hall. ihe uninvolved
esophageal and gastric mucosa are unremarkable. The perigastric adipose tissue
is dissected and palpated to reveal multiple possible lymph nodes, ranging
from 0.2 to 1.0 cm in greatest dimension.
1A‘0. One continuous longitudinal section through tumor sunnitted from
proximal to distal to include esophageal and gastric mucosa, proximal ends
inked orange.
1E~G. Mass to include blue inked radial soft tissue margins.
iH-J. Tumor.
iK-M. Lymph node candidates submitted intact. ,
TN and 0. Each contain one lymph node candidate. Eisected. . Fat
retained.
2. ”Cervical esophageal margin”. Received in a tall small container of
formalin is a 0.8 cm in length, 1.2 cm in diameter stapled cuff of esophagus.
The staple line is shaved and the specimen is submitted en Face in cassette
2A. Staple line retained.
3. ”Appendix". Received in a tall small container is a 5.5 cm in length, 0.8
cm in diameter appendix with attached mesoappendix. The serosa is a tan-pink,
smooth, glistening with arborizing vessels. The appendix is serially cross
sectioned to reveal a fatty Hall, 0.3 cm in greatest thickness surrounding a
pinpoint lumen.

PROCEDURE: SPMI VERIFIED BY: *

ESOPHAGUS, GASTROESOPHAGEAL JUNCTION, INCLUDING CARDIA, CARCINOMA

LOCATION: Distal esophagus
SIZE: 7.0 cm including both poiypoid high-grade dysplasia and
carcinoma.

HAS IT BEEN TREATED PREOPERATIVE WITH CHEMO/RADIATION THERAPY?: No
TYPE OF CARCINOMA: Adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's mucosa
DEPTR OF INVASION: Superficial submucosa

NUMBER OF POSITIVE LYMPH MODES / TOTAL NUMBER OF NUDES EXAMINED: 0/10
DISTANT METASTASIS: Unknown

RESECTION MARGIN INVOLVED: No

pTTb no

PROCEDURE: spox VERIFIED BY :~

1-2. Distal esophagus, resection: Invasive adenocarcinoma extending into
superficial submucosa arising from extensive Barrett’s high-grade dysplasia.
Margins free. Ten lymph nodes negative for carcinoma. Please see TEMPLATE for
details. See COMMENT.

3. Appendix, resection: No significant abnormality.
COMMENT:

Most of the carcinoma is differentiated and confined to the mucosa. There is (“f
one focus of undifferentiated carcinoma that extends into the superficial
submucosa.
