DIAGNOSIS:

A. Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and

bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy:

Endometrial adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, FIGO grade
3 (of 3)

is identified forming a mass (6.0 x 3.5 x 2.2 cm)
circumferentially

involving the endometrial cavity and the lower uterine
segment. The

tumor invades 1.7 cm into the myometrium (total myometrial
thickness, 2.0 cm). The tumor does not involve the
endocervix.

Lymphovascular space invasion is identified. The margins
are

negative for tumor. There are multiple (6) intramural
leiomyomas

(ranging in size from 0.5 cm to 2.4 cm in greatest
dimension) in the

myometrium. The bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes are
uninvolved.

B. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(13) right
pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

C. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(14) left
pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

D. Lymph nodes, right para—aortic, lymphadenectomy:
Multiple (4)
right para-aortic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

E. Lymph nodes, left para-aortic, lymphadenectomy:
Multiple (6)
left para—aortic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

With available surgical material [AJCC pleNO] (7th
edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic

examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation
of the

Aspecimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent
sections are

reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive
changes

identified on permanent section review will be reflected
in a

revised report.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled "uterus, right and left
fallopian tubes

and ovaries" is a 220.0 gram uterus with attached
bilateral tubes

and ovaries. The uterine serosa has focal fibrous
adhesions. There

is a 6.0 x 3.5 x 2.2 cm exophytic polypoid soft tan
circumferential

mass in the body and lower uterine segment of the
endometrial cavity

grossly invading 1.7 cm. The myometrial thickness is 2.0
cm. There

are multiple (6) intramural leiomyomas (ranging in size
from 0.5 cm

to 2.4 cm in greatest dimension). There is a 2.5 x 2.0 x
1.7 cm

right ovary with a smooth outer surface and a solid cut
surface with

a 7.5 x 0.6 cm right fallopian tube which is unremarkable.
There is

a 2.7 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm left ovary with a smooth outer
surface and a

solid cut surface with a 7.4 x 0.6 cm left fallopian tube
which is '
unremarkable. Representative sections submitted.

Received fresh labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes" is a

B.
4.5 x 4.0

x 1.2 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. Lymph
nodes

submitted.

C. Received fresh labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes" is a
7.5 x 7.0

x 1.2 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. Lymph
nodes

submitted.

D. Received fresh labeled "right para-aortic lymph nodes"
is a 1.2

x 1.0 x 0.9 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.

Lymph
nodes submitted.

E. Received fresh labeled "left para—aortic lymph nodes"

is a 1.2 x

1.0 x 0.4 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.
Lymph nodes

submitted.
