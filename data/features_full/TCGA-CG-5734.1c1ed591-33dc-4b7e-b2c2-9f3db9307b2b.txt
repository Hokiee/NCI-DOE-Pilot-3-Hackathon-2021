  

Findings and diagnosis in response to t 1e question:

1) involves regular splenic tissue, divided into red and white pulp with the appropriate
trabecular structure.

II) involves free fatty tissue and free lymph nodes.

Ill) involves a poorly differentiated advanced gastric carcinoma- in this case an
invasive adenocarcinoma of the intestinal type,

with inﬁltration of all wall layers (p T 21)),

with extensive lymphatic vessel penetration (L 1 —'1130 below),

with free resection margins in the mucosal area.

In addition, in eight out surfaces there are lymph node metastases from the carcinoma
described and, adjacent to these, indurated fatty connective tissue and

inﬁltration of the omental tissue and

partially also of the serosa (p T 3).

1V) involves regular anastomotic rings, here of the small bowel type with appropriate
villous and crypt relief, lined with cylinder cells and goblet cells.

In respect of the pancreatic situation, further secondary resections will follow (p T 3 l
p T 4).

 

A consultation was held about the deﬁnitive TNM classiﬁcation.

This is deﬁned by the inﬁltiation cf the omental tissue in this case with inﬁltration of the
peiitoneum and, additionally to the initial ﬁndings with inﬁltiation of the lymph nodes in
the area of the omentum in four out surfaces.

In the panc1eas these a1e inﬂammatory reactive changes.

The tumour classiﬁcation is as follows:

ICDO-DA—M 8140/3
pT3, pN t, L 1.

In respect of the operative specimen a clear margin of healthy tissue was removed locally
(cf. also where necessary the corresponding operative report).
