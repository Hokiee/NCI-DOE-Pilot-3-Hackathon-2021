Clinical History

=-year-old man experienced falls ago. and was emergently decompressed of a large
right temporal

lobe tumor that extended to the frontal lobe and insula. with herniation.
Operative Diagnoses
Right temporal brain mass.
Operation I Specimen
A: Brain, excision biopsy
Pathologic Diagnosis
Brain, right temporal, excision: Mixed oligoastrocytoma, anaplastic (WHO grade III).
See Microscopy Description and Comment.
Comment
The sections contain large portions of brain extensively inﬁltrated and effaced by a very cellular glial
neoplastic
proliferation. The neoplastic cells have a mixed oligo astrocytic phenotype. there is focally brisk mitotic
activity. and
the MlB-1 proliferation index is about 75% in the more active areas. There is also focal endothelial
hyperplasia and
some microvascular proliferation. There are focal areas of necrosis and hemorrhage with some pigment,
most likely
associated wit previous surgical procedure.
The findings are interpreted as those of an anaplastic oligoastrocytoma.

NEGATIVE - No evidence of EGFvalI mutation is detected
Results-Comments
TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from parafﬁn tissue block (A1)
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive moleculartarget in glioblastoma because it
is amplified,
overexpressed. and/or mutated in up to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant
lll

(EGFvaIl) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is commonly expressed in
glioblastoma.

Cell culture and in vivo models of glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIlI as deﬁning prognostically
distinct

subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFvall has been shown to sensitize tumors
to EGFR

tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from
formalin fixed.

parafﬁn embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is then amplified using
standard PCR

technique for DNA templates. PCR products are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of
this assay

has been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells.

FDA Comment: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic test.
This test

was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the

as required

by CLIA ’88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the US. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are

procedures

and/or diagnostic criteria.

Loss of Heterozygosity 1p, 19q Assay (LOH)
Date Ordered: Date Reported: ,

Interpretation

NEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1p and chromosome arm 19q is NOT detected.
Informative loci are: D181612, 018496, D19SZ19, 0198412, and PLA2G4C

Results-Comments

Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (A1). DNA extracted from a
corresponding

blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.

H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)/ Tumor DNA
pairs using 3

markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1p are D13548, D1S1592, and 018552 (with D18468,
D1 S1612, and

D13496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D198219, D198412, and PLAZG4C (with
D198606 and

D1981182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLAZG4C which is a
minisatellite (26

nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and
ease of

interpretation. The backup markers are used if the ﬁrst line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninfom'iative or

othenrvise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the

typical ﬁnding in oligodendrogiiomas with 1p and 19g deletion.

TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neopiastic cells in the sample may preclude the
detection of

MGMT Promoter Methylation
Date Ordered: Date Reported: -
Interpretation
NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected.
Results-Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor parafﬁn block —A1
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit

from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulﬁte
treatment of

DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic

Addendum
Date Ordered: Date Reported:
Addendum Diagnosis

Review of the slides confirms the diagnosis of a high-grade mixed oligodendroglial and astrocytic glioma.
A regional

area of increased cellular atypia and cellular density associated with focal microvascular proliferation is
noted. Focal

necrosis is also present. Considering these features, the differential diagnosis includes a high-grade
oligoastrocytoma

in transition to glioblastoma with oligodendroglial component, WHO grade IV. Clinical correlation is
recommended.

Addendum Comment

This addendum is issued for the purpose of pathology review requested by the clinical oncology team for
treatment

protocol considerations.

Brain excision biopsy:
CONTAINER LABEL: brain tumor.

FIXATIVE: Formalin. NO PIECES: many red to gray tan fragments. SIZENOL: 5 x 4. 5 x 2.0 cm; 15. 55
grams

CASSETTES: 1-3.

Microscopic Description

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates an overall sparse gliofibrillary back ground. The
CD34

depicts a monotonous capillary-type microvascular network, with a few areas that have endothelial
hyperplasia, and a

couple of areas with few vessels with microvascular cellular proliferation. Many celIs weakly over express
the p53

protein, and only a small minority strongly over expresses the protein. With the MIB-1 there is very high
proliferation

index that reaches 75% in the more active areas.
