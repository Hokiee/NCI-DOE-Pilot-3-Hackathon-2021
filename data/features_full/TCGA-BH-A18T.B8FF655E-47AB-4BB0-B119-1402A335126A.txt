ESTROGEN/PROGESTERONE AND HER-ZINEU REPORT

Using appropriate positive and negative controls, the test for the presence of these hormone receptor proteins is
performed by the immunoperoxidase method. and reported according to the consensus statement on edjuvant _
therapy for breast cancer, of; A positive ER or PR tumor shows any nuclear Immunostalmng, and rs
semiquantitated as indicated below.

Result Semiquantitative Statement
ER negative Percent cells staining as: (0 100%).
PR negative Percent cells staining as: (0 100%).

- IS OBSERVED IN MORE
HER-ZINEU DAKO HERCEPTEST. A WEAK TO MODERATE COMPLETE MEMBRANE STAINING
THAN 10% OF THE TUMOR CELLS. HER-ZINEU IS INTERPRETED AS WEAKLY POSITIVE (SCORE 2+).

NOTE: Her-ZlNeu FISH was ordered and will be Subsequently reported.

The Her-Zlneu and estrogen/progesterone receptor assays were performed with FDA approved methods.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

PART 1: BREAST'CRLEK’ GHT‘SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY-
A. INFILTR iNG DUCTAL CARCINOMA, 3.1 CM, POORLY DIFFERENTIATED. NOTTINGHAM SCORE I 9/9
TTUEULES = 3. NUCLEAR GRADE = 3. MITOSES = 3).
B. LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.
C. SEPARATE FOCI OF DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, SOLID TYPE, HIGH NUCLEAR GRADE.
D
E

. THE DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU EXTENDS CLOSE ( < 0.1 CM) TO THE POSTERIOR SURGICAL MARGIN
OF RECECTION. ‘

. ALL SURGICAL MARGINS OF RESECTION ARE FREE OF TUMOR.
F. NON-NEOPLASTIC BREAST WITH FIBROCYTIC CHANGES.

PART 2: SENTINEL LYMPH MODE #1, RIGHT AXILLA, BIOPSY -
ONE (1) LYMPH NODE. NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0(1), (see comment).

PART 3: SENTINEL LYMPH MODE #2, RIGHT AXILLA. BIOPSY -
ONE LYMPH NODE. NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR , (0i1).(see comment).

PART 4'. NON-SENTINEL LYMPH NODE. RIGHT AXILLA, BIOPSY —
.. ONE LYMPH NODE. NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR, (0/1).

COMMENT:
Cytokeratin (AE1I3) stains have been performed and conﬁrm the negative status of the sentinel lymph nodes.
