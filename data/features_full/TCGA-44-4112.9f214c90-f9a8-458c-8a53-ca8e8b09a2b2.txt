CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Lung carcinoma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Received fresh labeled "level 3 lymph node" are two
soft tan—gray tissues in keeping with lymph nodes
measuring
0.8 cm in greatest dimension and 2.4 x 1.3 x 0.6 cm. The specimens
are bisected and entirely submitted independently in two blocks
(one
bisected node per cassette). AS—Z.
B. Received fresh labeled "level 10" is a slightly
rubbery, 2.4 x 1.8 x 1.4 cm tan gray-red tissue in keeping
with lymph node which is sectioned and entirely submitted in two
blocks. AS—Z.
C. Received fresh labeled ”middle lobe" is a slightly
fragmented, 1.4 X 0.9 x 0.6 cm soft tan gray—black tissue
which is bisected and entirely submitted in one block. ASwl.
D. Received fresh labeled "level 10" are three intact to
fragmented soft tan gray—black tissues in keeping with
lymph nodes measuring up to 1.8 x 1.6 x 0.7 cm. The specimens are
entirely submitted in three blocks as labeled. AS-3.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 a Two whole lymph nodes; 2,3 — sectioned largest
lymph node . -

E. Received fresh labeled l’RUL“ is a 362 gram, 17 x 12.5
X

GROSS DESCRIPTION
4.3 cm lobectomy specimen with attached 1 cm in length,
1.3
x 0.9 cm in diameter bronchial stump. The pleura is focally
retracted with a subjacent palpable mass along the medial inferior
aspect. On sectioning, the aforementioned palpable mass is well
circumscribed, pale tan white—gray and measures 5 x 4.6 x 4 cm.
The
lesion extends to within less than 0.1 cm of the inked pleural
surface. A portion of the tumor and a portion of normal parenchyma
are submitted for tissue procurement as requested. The tumor is
greater than 3.8 cm from the bronchial stump margin. The
parenchyma

 

 

throughout the remainder of the specimen is spongiform to focally

consolidated tan pink—red. No additional mass lesion or

abnormality

is identified. A slightly fragmented, 1.4 cm in greatest dimension
tan pink—gray to tan—black tissue in keeping with lymph node is
recovered from the hilum. Representative sections are submitted in
eleven blocks as labeled. Rs~11.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Bronchial stump margin; 2 — vascular margin; 3w

* tumor to inked pleural surface; 6 — tumor to normal parenchyma;
7—10 ~ random from remainder of specimen; 11 — bisected perihilar
lymph node.

F. Received fresh, labeled "R4" is a 4.6 x 3.4 x 1.3 cm.

aggregate of soft lobulated golden yellow adipose tissue.
Several apparent fragmented soft tan gold to gray black tissues in
keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 3.3 cm. in greatest
dimension are present. The specimen is entirely submitted in four
blocks as labeled. AS—4.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - Seven whole presumptive lymph nodes; 2,3 — one
bisected presumptive lymph node (one~half per cassette); 4 —

residual adipose tissue.

G. Received fresh, labeled "subcarinal" are two intact to

GROSS DESCRIPTION

slightly fragmented soft tan gray—black tissues in keeping
with lymph nodes measuring up to 3 cm. in greatest dimension. The
specimens are bisected and entirely submitted in three blocks as
labeled. RS—3.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — One bisected node; 2,3 — one bisected node
(one—half per cassette).

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma

Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated

Primary tumor (pT): The tumor measures 5 cm in dimension and
invades into the pleura, pTza.

Margins of resection: Negative for tumor

Direct extension of tumor: Tumor invades into the pleura and is
focally present on the pleural surface.

Vessel invasion: Present

Regional lymph nodes:Metastatic carcinoma is identified in a hilar
lymph node and also in two of 10 R4 lymph nodes. The other

submitted

 

 

nodes are negative for tumor.

Distant metastasis: PMX.

3x5, 5x1, 4x1

DIAGNOSIS

A. Lymph node, level 3, excision ~— Two lymph nodes negative for
metastatic carcinoma (0/2).
B. Lymph node, level 10, excision H“ One lymph node negative for

metastatic carcinoma (0/1).
C. Lymph node, middle lobe, excision —— One lymph node negative for
metastatic carcinoma (O/l).

DIAGNOSIS

D. Lymph node, level 10, excision —- Three lymph nodes negative for

metastatic carcinoma (0/3).

E. Lung, right upper lobe, excision -— Invasive poorly

differentiated adenOCarcinoma (see tumor characteristics in the
microscopic description). Tumor extends to the pleural
surface.

One of four hilar lymph nodes is positive for metastatic
carcinoma (1/4).
F. Lymph node, R4, excision —— Two of 10 lymph nodes positive for
metastatic carcinoma (2/10).
The largest metastasis measures 0.7 cm in dimension.
Extracapsular extension by tumor is identified.
G. Lymph node, subcarinal, excision —— Two lymph nodes negative for
metastatic carcinoma (0/2).
