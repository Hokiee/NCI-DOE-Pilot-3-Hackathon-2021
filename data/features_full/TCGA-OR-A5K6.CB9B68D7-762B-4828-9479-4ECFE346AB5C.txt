DIAGNOSIS

(A) LEFT ADRENAL TUMOR:

ADRENOCORTICAL CARCINOMA (8.0 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION), CONFINED TO THE ADRENAL GLAND. (SEE
COMMENT) >

Margin of resection, no tumor present.

COMMENT

This large tumor shows diffuse growth pattern with extensive necrosis, and the tumor cells show focal areas of Fuhrman nuclear
grade 3. Clear cells compromise less than the 25% of tumor cells. There are? mitotic ﬁgures in 50 high~power ﬁelds. The overall
features are consistent with adrenocortical carcinoma. _ was consulted.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT ADRENAL TUMOR - A left adrenalectorny, 8.0 x 5.5 x 5.0 cm, weighing 0.15 kg., with attached adipose tissue. There is
a separate portion of unremarkable adipose tissue. 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm.

The adrenal gland is nearly entirely replaced by a well circumscribed encapsulated tumor, 8.0 cm in greatest dimension.
The cut surfaces are variegated, yellow, tan and red with friable hemorrhagic areas (approximately 40% of the tumor). The tumor
abuts the capsule and adjacent adipose tissue.

There is minimal residual normal adrenal cortex and medulla.

INK CODE: Black - surface of adrenal gland.

SECTION CODE: A1 -A3, hemorrhagic. friable areas of tumor with margin; A4, A5, tan ﬁrm areas of tumor; AB-AB, yellow
areas of tumor with adjacent adipose tissue; A9, A10. tumor with adjacent residual adrenal tissue; A11, A12, representative

residual adrenal tissue. _'
