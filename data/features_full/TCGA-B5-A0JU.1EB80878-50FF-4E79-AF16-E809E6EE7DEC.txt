GROSS EXAMINATI :
A. "Uterus, cer‘ix, bilateral tub s and ovaries (AFl-Z)", rec ived fresh for
frozen section 5 a 194 gram, 12. x 17.6 x 4.3 cm uterus wit. attached
bilateral ovari s. The anterior esection margin is inked bl'e and the
posterior resection margin is ink d black. The uterus (119 g am, 12.2 x 11.2
x 4.3 cm) has a tan-pink. smooth arose and a 1.1 cm patent c rvical 05 with
grossly unremarkable mucosa. The uterus is opened to reveal 7.2 x 4.9 x 2.5
cm polypoid, furgating, tan—bro mass with hemorrhage locate primarily in
the anterior endometria; cavity d extending approximately 1 5 cm into the
posterior cavity. The mass invol es the anterior lower uteri e segment,
however, is not grossly invasive. The maximum thickness of t or is 2.2 cm
and grossly invades the myometri , 0.4 cm of 2.2 cm. The t or does not
appear to grossly invade the end ervical canal. The uninvcl ed endometrium
is 0.1 cm thick. tan-brown, and ossly unremarkable. The r inder of the
myonetrium is grossly unremarkab . A full-thickness represeLtative section
of the anterior endcmyonetrial s is bisected and frozen as AFl—Z. The
frozen section remnants are submitted in blocks Al—Z, respectlvely.
