FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Colleen-moat..- -

PART 1:
ATE AND BILATERAL. SEMINAL VESICLES, PROSTATECTOMY —-

PROST
. INVASIVE POORLY DIFFERENTIATED PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 3 + 4 = 7.
TUMOR INVOLVES BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT LOBES AND HAS A GREATEST NODULAR DIAMETER 0F1.3

CM.
THE TUMOR INVOLVES LESS Tliwﬁm THE 1913;. EROSIAIEMOLU-ME.

THE TUMOR IS. ORGAN CONFINED AND SHOWS N0 EVIDENCE OF EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION.
BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES AND VAS DEFERENS ARE FREE OF TUMOR.

ALL EXAMINED SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR.

BENIGN PROSTATIC GLANDS ARE PRESENT AT THE INKED SURGICAL MARGIN.

FOCAL PERINEURAL INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

NO EVIDENCE OF ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

HIGH GRADE PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA IS IDENTIFIED.

TNM PATHOLOGIC STAGE = pT2c N0 NIX.

TNM HISTOLOGIC GRADE = G1.
BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERTROPHY AND CHRONIC MODERATELY ACTIVE PROSTATITIS ARE NOTED.
