GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "left pelvic lymph nodes" and are
multiple fragments of ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 5.7 x 5 x 1.1 cm in aggregate. Multiple possible

lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging from 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.1 up to 1.9 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm. Cassettes are
submitted as follows:

A1: 2 possible lymph nodes

A2: One bisected lymph node

A3: One bisected lymph node

A4—A6: One lymph node

B. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "right pelvic lymph nodes" are
multiple fragments of ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 4.5 x 3.2 x 0.7 cm in aggregate. Two possible

lymph nodes are identiﬁed measuring 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm and 2.3 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm. Cassettes are
submitted as follows:

B1: 2 possible lymph nodes 7

32-34: Additional possible lymph nodes

C. PROSTATE

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "prostate" is an intact
prostatectomy specimen weighing 36 g and measuring 4.2 cm from right to left, 4 cm from anterior to
posterior. and 3.5 cm from apex to base. The capsule is smooth and red. ink code: Apex-red, anterior-
orange, and posterior-black. base-blue, right lateral-green. left lateral-yellow. The apex and base are
removed from the specimen yielding a new weight of 15 g. The specimen is serially sectioned from
apex to base to reveal ﬁrm tan ﬁbrous parenchyma. The right and left seminal vesicles, 1.5 x 1 x 0.5,
and 2 x 1.6 x 0.8 cm, respectively, are bisected to show beige tan cystic tissue. The right and left vas
deferens, 2.7 x 0.5. and 2 x 0.7 cm, respectively, are serially sectioned to show ﬁrm tan tube structure.
A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement, the remainder entirely submitted:
C1-02: Right Apex

03-04: Left apex

C5: Level i right side

C6: Level i left side

07: Level II, capsule, right side

CB: Level ll, capsule, left side

C9-C10: Level III, right side

C11: Level III. left side

C12-C13: Right lateral base

C14-C15: Right base

C16: Right base, bladder neck margin

C17: Left base, bladder neck margin

018-020: Left base

021-022: Left lateral base

C23: Right seminal vesicle. right vas deferens

C24: Left seminal vesicle, left vas deferens
