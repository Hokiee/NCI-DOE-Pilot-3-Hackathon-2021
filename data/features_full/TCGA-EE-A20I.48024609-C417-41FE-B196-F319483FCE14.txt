SQPPLEMENTARY REPQRT

The remainder of specimen 2 has been submitted for histological examination and largely consists of skin
and subcutis. A small amount of residual melanoma is seen. No lymph node tissue is identiﬁed.

The diagnosis from the original report is unchanged.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Three specimens were received.

I. "R MEDIAL THIGH". An excision of skin l5 x 5mm with subcutis 25 x 20 x 15mm inked blue. Half of

nodule (20mm diameter) for tumour banking remainder divided into three sections and all embedded in one
block.

2. "R GROIN". Excision of skin and subcutis '28: x 15 x .15mm with a subcutaneous nodule 15mm diameter.
Half for tumour banking. One full face'embedded in block A.

[ HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

3. "R LATERAL THIGH". An excision of skin 23 x 13 x 5mm with an irregular skin thickening measuring
10 x 5mm which appears to come close to one transverse margin. This overlies a region of brown
discolouration within the subcutis, which is irregular, measuring approximately 6 x 4mm. Three transverse
sections demonstrating all of lesion embedded in one block and remainder excluded.

MICROSCOPIC REP RT

1. "R MEDIAL THIGH". »

Microscopy of skin shows a deposit of malignant epithelioid and spindle cell tumour with a morphology
consistent with melanoma. The tumour is located within the dermis and superﬁcial subcutis. Ajunctional
component is not identiﬁed and the appearance would be consistent with a metastasis.

The deep margin is clear by 0.4mm and the closest peripheral margin is clear by 1.5mm

2. "R GROIN". ,

The specimen consists of skin to a level of fascia. Microscopy a deposit of partially necrotic pigmented
malignant epithelioid and Spindle cell tumour with a morphology consistent with melanoma. The tumour is
located within the subcutaneous tissue extending to the level of fascia. No associated lymph node tissue is
identiﬁed to suggest a lymph node metastasis (additional tumour will be sampled as a supplementary report
will be issued if lymph node tissue is seen). A junctional component is not identiﬁed and the appearance
would be consistent with a metastasis.

The deep margin is clear by 2.7mm and the closest peripheral margin is clear by 2.5mm.

3. "R LATERAL THIGH" _. .l '

Microscopy of skin shows a deposit of partially necrotic malignant epithelioid and spindle cell tumour with a
morphology consistent with melanoma. The tumour is located within the dermis and superﬁcial subcutis. A
junctional component is not identiﬁed and the appearance would be consistent with a metastasis.

The deep margin is clear by 0.7mm and the closest peripheral margin is clear by l.lmm.
