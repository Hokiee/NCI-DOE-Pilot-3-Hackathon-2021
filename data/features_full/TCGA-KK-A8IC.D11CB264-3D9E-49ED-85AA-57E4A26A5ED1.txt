DIAGNOSIS

(C) PROSTATE AND SEMlNAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 9 (4 + 5). (SEE COMMENT)
TUMOR EXTENDING INTO EXTRAPROSTATIC TISSUE.
TUMOR INVADING RIGHT SEMlNAL VESICLE.
MARGINS OF RESECTION, FREE OF TUMOR.
PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH GRADE.
LYMPHATICNASCULAR INVASION PRESENT.
Left seminal vesicle and segment of vasa deferentia, no tumor present.
One periprostatic lymph node, no tumor present.

COMMENT

The prostate gland contains a single focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor is located in the right lateral, right
posterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior, left posterior and left posterolateral peripheral zone. The tumor focus measures 3.0 x
1.5 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in two cross sections and extensively in the apex and base
regions. The tumor exhibits extraprostatic extension in the right superior neurovascular bundle region. Extraprostatic extension is
present in three sections and the added length of extraprostatic tumor is 8.0 mm. The margins of resection are free of tumor. The
tumor invades in the intraprostatic portion of the right seminal vesicle. The margins of resection are free of tumor.

GROSS? DESCRIPTION

(C) PROSTATE AND SEMlNAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (5.6 x 3.0 x 3.7 cm, 46 grams, post ﬁxation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
right and left posterolateral aspects of the prostate appears symmetrical. A palpable nodule is present in the right base region.
Serial cross sections after ﬁxation demonstrate a ﬁrm area consistent with tumor in the right peripheral zone of the two cross
sections of the prostate. There is a portion of extraprostatic tissue attached to the left side of the prostate. The surface of the
fragment which does not represent the true margin is inked blue. Similarly, blue ink is applied to the surface of the prostate in
areas under sutures.

The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

SECTION CODE: Cl-CS, extraprostatic tissue attached to left side of prostate; C4-CS, right seminal vesicles and
segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; 07-01 1, left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from
the base towards the tip; C12, prostatic base, right border; Ci3-C17, prostatic base, right posterior border; 018-025, prostatic
base, central portion; 026, prostatic base, left border; 027—C31, prostatic base, left posterior border; C32-036, apex anterior; C37,
C38, apex left; 039-042, apex posterior; C43-C46, apex right; C47-C48, detached portions of margin of resection according to

specimen radiograph; 049-057, sections of the two cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.
The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in
black. Blue ink (C2, C10, 011, C39-C42) and orange ink (050-053, 056 and C57) denote surfaces and do not represent the true

margin of resection.
