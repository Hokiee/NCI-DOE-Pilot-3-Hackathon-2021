Specimen Received: q J &/ I D/I ‘4

A: Thymoma (FS)
B: Mediastinum for ﬂow only

Final Pathologic Diagnosis:
Anterior mediastinum, resection of mass:

Thymoma, WHO type 32 (see Note).

-confined to mediastinum without either gross or microscopic evidence of
invasive growth.

—one benign lymph node present adjacent to thymus.

The examination of this case material and the preparation of this report were
performed by the staff pathologist.

Note:

Sections through the specimen show thymoma, WHO type BZ. The tumor appears
circumscribed without any microscopic evidence of invasive growth. Although
tumor cells are present within 1 to 2 mm of the inked surgical margin (tumor
surrounded by ﬁbrous capsule), there is no evidence of tumor transection and,
thus, the tumor appears to have completely excised. Nonetheless, clinical
followup for potential recurrence is warranted.

lntraoperative Consult Diagnosis:

FSA: Thymus, partial resection:
Tumor present. Thymoma vs. lymphoma.
F/S TAT: 10 mins.

Gross Description:

The specimen is received fresh for frozen section evaluation and is additionally
labeled " thymoma (FSA+X)" and consists of an 8.5 x 6.5 x

3.3 cm irregular partially fragmented portion of yellow-tan to tan-brown fatty
fibrous tissue. The specimen is notable for a 5.8 x 3.4 x 2.8 cm nodular and
encapsulated gray-white mass. The mass abuts the inked outer membranous
surface. Sectioning reveals a white-tan ﬂeshy cut surface with delicate
intervening gray-white septations. There are no areas of hemorrhage or necrosis.
The remainder of the uninvolved cut surface is yellow-tan and lobulated with
focal hemorrhage. There is one focus measuring 1.7 cm in greatest dimension
suspicious for a fatty replaced lymph node.

Representative sections as follows:
1 FSA resubmitted for permanent section;

2 encapsulated tumor to inked outer surface;

34 tumor to adjacent fatty tissue/thymoma;

5 additional full thickness section of mass;

6-7 representative sections of adjacent fatty tissue;
8 possible fatty replaced lymph node.

Microscopic Description:

The ﬁnal diagnosis of each specimen incorporates the microscopic examination
findings.

Procedures/Addenda:

Interpretation

Flow cytometric analysis of thymus shows a precursor T—cell population and
mature T-cells. B cells are too few to assess clonality. Correlation with
morphology is mandatory for final diagnosis.
