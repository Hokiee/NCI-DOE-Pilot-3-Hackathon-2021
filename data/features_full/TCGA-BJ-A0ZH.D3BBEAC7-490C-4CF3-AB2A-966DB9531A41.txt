MOLECULAR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY TESTING:

 

A. BRAFVSOOE mutation IDENTIFIED.

B. Mutations in NHA861, HRASST, KRAS12/13, and RET/PTC1, RET/PTca and PAXJ/PPARg rearrangements NOT
identified.

NOTE:

Nucleic acids were extracted in the amount sufﬁcient for testing. Ampliﬁcation of GAPDH and KRT7 controls was
acceptable. ‘

BACKGROUND:

Mutations in either BFlAF or RAS genes or RET/PTC rearrangements are found in more than 70% of papillary thyroid carcinomas
(1). BRAFVSOOE (T1799A) mutation has been associated with more aggressive behavior of papillary carcinoma (2) and may be
used for preoperative risk stratiﬁcation of patients with papillary thyroid cancer (3). Mutations in the HAS genes or PAXS/PPAHg
rearrangement occur in ~70% of follicular thyroid carcinomas and with lower freauencv in oncocytic (Hurthle cell) carcinomas (4).
Based on a recent prospective study of FNA samples (5) and our experience at detection of BFlAF mutations and
FlET/PTC and PAXB/PPAth rearrangements in thyroid FNA samples correlated with ~100% probability of cancer. whereas
detection of HAS mutation correlated with malignancy in 83-87% of cases and with benign follicular adenoma or hyperplastic
nodule in 13-17%. However, single cases of false-positive BRAF mutation detection in thyroid FNA samples have been reported in
the literature (6) and therefore the results of molecular testing should be interpreted in combination with clinical information.

MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS:

Thyroid FNA samples were collected in the nucleic acid preservative solution. For cytology samples and frozen samples, extraction of DNA and
RNA was performed from the sample provided using standard laboratory procedure. Optical density readings were obtained. Real-time PCR was
performed on the , )Ialform to amplify BFlAF codons 5994901, NRAS ceden 61, HRAS codon 61, and KRAS codons 12/13 sequences.
Post-PCFi melting curve analysis was used to detect possible mutations. Single-step real-time FtT-PCR was performed to amplify the fusron paints
of RET/PTC1, FIET/PTCS. and PAX8/PPAHg rearrangements on A8!7500. If required. the mutation type was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of
the PCR products on Ampliﬁcation of the GAPDH and KRT7 genes was used to control quality and quantity of RNA and amount of
epithelial cells present in the specimen. DNA or FINA from samples positive for each of these mutations were used as positive controls.
Amplification at 35 cycles or earlier was considered sufficient for the analysis. The limit of detection is approximately 10-20% of alleles with
mutation present in the background of normal DNA and RNA.
