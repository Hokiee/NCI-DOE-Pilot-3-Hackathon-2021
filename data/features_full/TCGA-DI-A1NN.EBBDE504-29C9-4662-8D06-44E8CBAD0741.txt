Comment: The tumors involved in ovaries and tubes are small foci and are contiguous with benign ovarian and tubal and epithelial
cells. These tumors may represent independent primaries rather than metastasis from uterine cancer.

(A) OMENTUM - A flap of a grossly unremarkable omental adipose tissue measuring 360 x 15.0 x 0.8 cm. Representative

sections are submitted.
SECTION CODE: Representative sections are submitted in cassettes A1 -A10. A small amount of normal tissue is

submitted to Tumor Bank.

(B) CERVIX, UTERUS, BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES - A 10.5 x 7.0 x 5.5 cm uterus with attached unremarkable ovaries
(each 2.5 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm) and unremarkable right fallopian tube (6.0 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter). The left fallopian tube
has a bulbous fimbrial end measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. The left fallopian tube measures 6.0 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter
proximally. Located within the fundus and extending posteriorly up to the lower uterine segment is a 6.5 x 4.5 x 1.5 cm ill-defined,
soft, friable, polypoid mass that involves the anterior and posterior walls. Tumor invades the myometrium and is 0.5 cm away from
the serosal surface. The myometrium Is 1.5 cm in thickness. Tumor tissue is submitted for the Tissue Bank.

INK CODE: Uterine serosa - black; deep margin (not the true margin) - yellow.

SECTION CODE: B1-BS, full thickness section with yellow indicating the deeper surface; B4-BG, full thickness section
with tumor. yellow indicating the deeper surface; B7, tumor with posterior lower uterine segment; B8, tumor with normal
endometrium, anterior uterine wall; BS, tumor with normal endometrium, anterior uterine wall; B10, anterior lower uterine segment;
811, posterior cervix; B12, anterior cervix; B13-B15, right ovary, entirely submitted; B16-B19, right fallopian tube, entirely
submitted; 320-821, left ovary, entirely submitted; 822-823, left fallopian tube, fimbriated end; 824-826, remaining left fallopian

_C) LEFT PERIAORTIC LYMPH NODES - A fragment of fibroadipose tissue with embedded lymph nodes (3.6 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm).
Several lymph nodes are dissected. The largest one measures 3.0 cm in the greatest dimension and is grossly positive for
netastatic carcinoma. One representative section of the largest lymph node is submitted for frozen section diagnosis. A touch
oreparation is made. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows.
. SECTION CODE: CI, representative section of the grossly positive lymph node for frozen section diagnosis; C2-C3,
r inder of the lymph node; C4, eight possible lymph nodes; C5, CG, one possible lymph node serially sectioned. j

*FS/DX: METASTATIC CARCINOMA.
(D) RIGHT EXTERNAL ILIAC LYMPH NODES - A single fragment of a fatty tissue measuring 4.5 x 2.5 x 0.6 cm. Dissection
reveals four possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 up to 0.9 cm in their greatest dimension. Possible lymph nodes and the rest of
the fatty tissue are entirely submitted.

SECTION CODE: D1, two possible lymph nodes; D2, two possible lymph nodes; D3, the rest of the fatty tissue.
(E) LEFT PARAAORTIC LYMPH NODES — A single nodule measuring 3.5 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm. Cut surface is glistening tan-gray,
centrally bright yellow and entirely submitted in E1-E3.
(F) RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES - Multiple fragments of fatty tissue measuring in aggregate, 5.0 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm. Dissection
reveals multiple possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.4 up to 2.0 cm in their greatest dimension. Possible lymph nodes and the
rest of the fatty tissue are entirely submitted.

SECTION CODE: F1, one possible lymph node; F2, one bisected possible lymph node; F3, one sectioned possible lymph
node; F4, one sectioned possible lymph node; F5, one sectioned possible lymph node; F6, F7, rest of the fatty tissue.
(G) LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES - Several fragments of fatty tissue measuring in aggregate, 3.5 x 2.8 x 1.0 cm. Dissection
reveals multiple possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.7 up to 1.4 cm in their greatest dimension. Possible lymph nodes and the
rest of the fatty tissue are entirely submitted.

SECTION CODE: G1, two possible lymph nodes; G2, one sectioned possible lymph node; GB, one sectioned possible
lymph node; G4, one sectioned possible lymph node; G5, rest of the fatty tissue.
