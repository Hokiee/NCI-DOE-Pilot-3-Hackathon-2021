GROSS DESCRIPTION.

A BREAST CA INFERIOR @BREAST
Received fresh labeled with patient name designated "a. breast ca inferior left breast" is a portion of
resected breast tissue weighing 50 gm and measuring 6.0 x 4.0 x 3.5 cm. The overlying beige-tan
ellipse of skin measures 5.0 x 3.0 cm. The surface of the skin has a thickened rough appearance. The
specimen is received with orientation, the single suture designating anterior, double-lateral and triple-

ER: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion score: 5 + Intensity Score 3
PR: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3

 

COMMENT:
The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the
proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of
cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak
intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring
range from 0 to 8.
ER/PR positive is deﬁned as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is deﬁned as an Allred score of
less than or equal to 2.
Methodology: Fixation Type and Length: Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (

') for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Antibody and Assay Methodology:
Mouse anti-human ER and PR, _
Comment: This assay can be used to select invasive oreast cancer patients for hormone therapy (1).
ER and PR analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the ER (ER 1D5,
1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100) antibody provided by , following the manufacturer's instructions
listed in the package Insert. This assay was not modiﬁed, and adherence to all instruction and
guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical staining
characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (1), information provided by the
reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department.

METHODOLOGY
Methodoloov: Fixation Type and Length: Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (

‘) for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Antibody and Assay Methodology:
Rabbit anti-human HER2, HerceptestTM (FDA—approved test kit), Control
Slides Examined: External kit-slides provided by manufacturer (ceII lines with high, low and negative
HER2 protein expression), and in-house known HER2 ampliﬁed control tissue were evaluated along
with the test tissue. These control slides run along side of this patient's sample showed appropriate
staining. Adequacy of Specimen: Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma identiﬁed for
HER2 evaluation.
Scoring Criterion and Scoring System:
IHC Level of Expression(Score) /Tumor Cell Membrane Staining Pattern
Negative (0)/Absence of Staining
Negative (1+)/Faint Incomplete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells
Equivocal (2+)NVeak complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells
Positive (3+)/Strong complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells
Equivocal Category for HER2 IHC results: A HER2, 2+ staining result that is interpreted as equivocal
may not indicate gene ampliﬁcation. A FISH test for HER2 gene ampliﬁcation will be ordered for all
HER2 IHC 2+ results.
COMMENT
This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for Trastuzumab (Hereptin) therapy
(1,2). Clinical Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective

response and overall survival for patients with metastatic HER2—positive breast cancer, regardless of
whether HER2 tumor status was determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to
adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease
recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2 protein over-expressed or gene ampliﬁed
invasive breast cancer (3).

HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved
HercepTest (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This
assay was not modiﬁed, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed.
Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results
in the medical literature (4), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of
staining performance within the Pathology Department.

HER2 TEST VALIDATION

This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised
recommendations and guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the
jointly issued recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected
breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC as outline above and interpreted as, negative
(score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without knowledge of the previous reported
results.

These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as ampliﬁed or non-ampliﬁed and
the HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance
between the IHC and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC.
9 of the 80 cases were interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-ampliﬁed by
FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be ampliﬁed.

The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests
performance and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proﬁciency and the interpretation of
HER2 assays. The laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including
the CAP proﬁciency testing program.

Patthsion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit

Case No
Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED
Clinical Interpretation of results
Ampliﬁcation of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase ﬂuorescence in-situ
hybridization (FISH) on formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn embedded tissue sections using a chromosome
17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the H

. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17

signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no
ampliﬁcation of the HER2/neu gene.

Block used A1 Source of case: RPCI
Tissue ﬁxation formalin-ﬁxed tissue Outside Case NozNA
Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes

HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.11
This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of
CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic
mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded.
Method of ratio enumeration: manual count
Limitations
The Vysis Patthsion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is
intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free
and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding
adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into
consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status.
No

(. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-
2/neu
gene ampliﬁcation status alone.
Overview of this test
FDA APPROVED REAGENT

patients for whom Herceptin® therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the
