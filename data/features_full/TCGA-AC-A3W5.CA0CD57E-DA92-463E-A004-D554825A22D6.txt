a 0.5 x O. 4 x 0.4 cm lymph node candidate The candidate is Msected along its
longitudinal axis, and one alcohol—fixed touch preparation , as well as

one scrape preparation are prepared from the cut surface. The candidate
is entirely submitted as two sections in one cassette.

x 0.7 x 0.6 cm portion of tan—yellow fibroadipose tissue. Within the tissue is
a 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm lymph node candidate. The candidate is bisected along its
longitudinal axis, and one alcohol—fixed touch preparation as well as
one scrape preparation ‘ are prepared from the cut surface. The candidate
is entirely submitted as two sections in one cassette.

#4 Received fresh labeled right breast lumpectomy, stitch single long cranial,
double short medial, is a 5.8 cm (cranial to caudal) x 4.2 cm (medial to
lateral) x 2.0 cm (superficial to deep) portion of fibroadipose tissue, oriented
as stated above. The superficial margin is inked blue and the deep margin is
inked black. Sectioning demonstrates a stellate, moderately well circumscribed
2.6 x 2.2 x 1.0 cm white, indurated mass. Within the mass is a 0.4 cm in
greatest dimension hemorrhagic biopsy cavity. The mass demonstrates the
following measurements of the margins: medial—0.3 cm, lateral—0.9 cm,
superficial-0.9 cm, deep—1.0 cm, caudal—1.1 cm and cranial-1.6 cm. The
remainder of the parenchyma is composed entirely of lobulated adipose tissue.
There are no additional discrete mass lesions or nodules identified. Seven
sections are submitted in seven: "A—G". Block summary: "A", medial
perpendicular; "B", lateral perpendicular; "C", superficial and_deep
(differentially inked) perpendicular; "D", superficial perpendicular; "E", deep
perpendicular; "F", caudal shave: "G", cranial shave.

Representative fresh tumor and normal tissue provided to i and the

#5 Labeled right breast mass, cranial margin, is a 5.0 x 3.2 x up to 1.3 cm
cup—shaped portion of tan yellow-fibroadipose tissue, oriented with a cranial
map marker on one surface. The cranial margin is inked black and tangential
sections are taken. The remaining tissue is serially sectioned to demonstrate
no gross focal mass or lesion. Six representative sections are submitted in
five: "A—E". Block summary: "A-D", entire cranial margin, tangential; "E",
perpendicular sections through the remaining tissue.

#6 Labeled right breast mass, medial margin, is a 3.0 x 3.0 x up to 1.0 cm
cup-shaped portion of ten yellow fibroadipose tissue, oriented with a medial map
marker on one surface. The medial margin is inked black. The tissue is
serially sectioned to demonstrate no gross focal mass or lesion. The tissue is
entirely submitted as nine perpendicular sections in six: "A-F".

#7 Labeled right breast mass, caudal margin, is a 3.0 x 2.5 x up to 0.8 cm
cup—shaped portion of tan yellow fibroadipose tissue, oriented with a caudal map
marker on one surface. The caudal margin is inked black. The tissue is serially
sectioned to demonstrate no gross focal mass or lesion. The tissue is entirely
submitted as eight perpendicular sections in five: "A-E".

#8 Labeled right breast mass, lateral margin, is a 3.3 x 2.3 x up to 0.9 cm
cup—shaped portion of tan yellow fibroadipose tissue, oriented with a lateral
map marker on one surface. The lateral margin is inked black. The tissue is
serially sectioned to demonstrate no gross focal mass or lesion. The tissue is
entirely submitted as eight perpendicular sections in four: "A—D".

#9 Labeled right breast mass, deep margin, is a 5.0 x 3.2 x up to 1.6 cm
cup—shaped portion of tan yellow fibroadipose tissue, oriented with a deep map
marker on one surface. The deep margin is inked black, and tangential sections
are taken. The remaining tissue is serially sectioned to demonstrate no gross
focal mass or lesion. Seven representative sections are submitted in five:
"A-E". Block summary: "A-D", entire deep margin, tangential; "E", perpendicular
sections through the remaining tissue.

Comment
The pleomorphic LCIS noted at the final medial margin is remote from the main
tumor mass and likely represents an incidental finding.
