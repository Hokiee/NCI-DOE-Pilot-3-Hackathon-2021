Clinical Diagnosis 5 History:
High grade leiomyosarcoma.

Specimens Submitted:

1: Left kidney, left colon and retroperitoneal mass
2: Intra abdominal blood clot

3: Splenic

DIAGNOSIS :

1. Soft tissue, Left kidney, left colon and retroperitoneum; resection:

— Leiomyoearcoma, high grade. with focal areas of necrosis (10%
microscopic estimate).

- The tumor measures: 8.0 x 7.5 x 7.5 cm.

- The mitotic count is 40 NP/lo HPFs.

- The adjacent segment of colon and renal parenchyma are unremarkable

- Two benign lymph nodes in pericolonic fibroadipose tissue (0/2)

- The tumor is covered grossly by a thin membranous layer of fibrous
tissue, that shows focal disruption and a large defect with hemorrhagic
changes (6x 3.5 cm). Microscopically the tumor extends closely to the inked
surface.

- colonic. renal vascular. and ureter margins are negative for tumor.

2. Blood clot, Intra abdominal; biopsy:
— Blood admixed with focal reactive mesothelial cells (see note). N
tumor seen.
Note: The selected slides have been reviewed with
3. 'Spleen'; excision:

- Accessory spleen and peri-splenic soft tissue with subserosal edema
and reactive changes.

I ATTBST THAT THE ASOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON HY PERSONEL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

Gross Description:

1). Received fresh is a piece of soft tissue labeled “left kidney, left
colon and retroperitoneal mass". Specimen measures 12 x 11.5 x 10.4 cm and
consists of kidney (10 x 7 x 4.2 cm) with two segments of attached ureters
(9.4 cm). a segment of colon (12.4 cm) and a soft tissue mass (3 x 7.5 x 7.5
cm). The segment of colon shows unremarkable intestinal mucosa. Serial
sectioning kidney reveals unremarkable renal parenchyma. Two ureters (see
photo) are kinked due to adventitia adhesion to adjacent tumor mess
resulting dilatation of proximal segments of ureters (0.5 cm in dianoter).
No gross involvement of ureteral muscular wall is seen. No adrenal gland is
identified. The retroperitoneal mass is situated in the mesentery adipose
tissue with no extension into adjacent colon or kidney. There is a large
defect area (6 x 3.5 cm) with associated hemorrhage. Serially sections
reveal a well circumscribed mass, covered by a layer of fibrous tissue
(surface inked blue) with disruption and previously described defect. The
mass appears white. soft and flesh with no appreciable necrosis seen.
However, marked hemorrhage is noted with blood clots present at the
peripheral of mass and mesenteric soft tissue, where defect is located.
Portion of lesion is submitted to TPS.

2) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled, 'Intra-abdominal blood
clot', and consists of multiple brown organized blood clots measuring in
aggregate 5.5 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm. The specimen is photographed and
representatively submitted.

Summary of sections:
U - undesignated

3) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled, 'Splenic', and consists of
a tan-brown firm nodule measuring 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm with a smooth external
surface. Attached to the nodule is yellow fatty tissue measuring 1.0 x 0.5 x
0.2 cm. 0n sectioning, the nodule reveals a brown homogenous cut surface.
The specimen is photographed. The nodule is trisected and entirely
submitted.
