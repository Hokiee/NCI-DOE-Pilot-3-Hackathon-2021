NOTE: Q40 .2 1.24/1 9

Microsatellite instability' is not detected' in the carcinoma hy inuntmohistochemistry; therefore, the likelihood that the
carcinoma is due to sporadic or hereditary (i. e.: Lynch syndrome-associated) defective DNA mismatch repair“ is very low.
However, immunohistochemistry may not detect rare polymorphisms or missensc munitions in DNA mismatch repair proteins
in up to 10% of cases. If strong clinical suspicion persists, additional testing is suggested.

Arclu'ved slides and paralﬁn blocks were reviewed for ease block A10 containing normal tissue and carcinoma was selectedfor MSl analysis.

Immohistoehemical studies were pufonned on fornilin ﬁxed. pram-embedded tissue with adequate positive and negative control sections, including internal
positive control tissue.

.They have not been cleared or approved by the U S Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval' is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purpose. They should not be regarded as investiudonal or ﬁor research.
This laboratory is certiﬁed under the Clinical Laboratory Improvemem Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-BS) as qualiﬁed to perform highmnplexity clinical laboratory
testing.

The specimen is labeled "RIGHT COLON "and is received unﬁxed. It consists of terminal ileum measures 5 cm in length and 3.5 cm
in greatest circumference. colon measures 18 cm in length and 8 cm in greatest circmnference, appendix measures 8.5 cm in length
and 0.7 cm in greatest diameter. The serosa is congested covered by mesocolonic fat measures 34 cm thickness. Upon opening. the
lumen contains fecalith material. There is a friable, polypoid. centrally ulcerated pink-tan mass measuring 5.5 x 4.5 x 1.6 cm. The
masses and the proximal colon. 2 cm from ileocecal valve. 7 cm from the proximal margin of resection and 11 cm from the distal
margin of resection. The mass invades the muscularis propria, approximately 3 cm from the radial margin. The colon mucosa is
congested with a focal black discolored area surrounding the mass. The ileocecal valve is unremarkable The ta-mirlal ileum mucosa is
congested with no lesions. There are few diverticulum'with no gross evidence of perforation. The appendix serosa is congested The
wall is intact. The lumen is narrow, contains fecalith material. There are 20 lymph nodes ranging from 0.4-1.2 cm in maximum
dimensions Representative sections are submitted. the entire mass is submitted.
