A. KRAS oodon 12/13 mutation NOT identified.

6. EGFR Exon 19 mutation NOT identified.

C. EGFR Exon 21 mutation NOT identiﬁed.

D. EGFR amplification IDENTIFIED (see in situ Procedure}.
Note:
KRAS cndun 12:13 mutations are found In approximately 10.30% lung adenocarcinomas and associated with history of
smoking (1). EGFR axon 19 and 21 mutations are present in about 10% of- and up to 40% in the
population, common in non-smokers and assouiatnn with the tumor response to treatmont with ESPN Inhibitors (2).
These mutations are mutually exclusive and their presence may have prognostic anchor therapeutic implications (3,4).
Clinical Studies Shaw high EGF’R gene copy number by FISH analysis (amplification) to be aoooclated with favorable
clinical benefit (Cllnical response. stable disease, tlma to progression, and survival) in patients with advanced non~5mail
cell lung cancer treated with EGFRtyrosino kinase inhibitors.

Fluorosoenoe in-situ hybridization Studion performed on the adonocarcinoma shows a ratio of EGFR gone to the centromoro of
chromosome 7 of 2.65 indicating EGFR amplification in the targetod region. The rate of hyporpioidy for the onntromore of
chromosome 7 was 25.8%, and the monosomy rate was 36.4% In the analyzed cells. The signal to nucleus ratio (SNR) for tho
EGFngenI-z was 5.7. 66 cells were analyzed In the targeted region.

Interpretation guidelines for EGlfR Geno‘Copy Number by FISH:

 

 

Ratio of EGl-R to the centromoro of chromosome 7:
Less than 2.0: No EGFR ampliﬁcation
Greater than 2.0: EGFR amplification

Hyperpioirly: Greater than Mo oontromere copieslcell.
$NR. The average number of EGFR signals per analyzed coll within the targeted region.

Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy number by FISH analysis to be associated with iavombio clinical benefit (clinical

response. stable disease. time to progression. and survival) in patients with advanced nariusmall cell lung cancer treated with
EGFR tyrosine kII'IEBG inhibitors.
