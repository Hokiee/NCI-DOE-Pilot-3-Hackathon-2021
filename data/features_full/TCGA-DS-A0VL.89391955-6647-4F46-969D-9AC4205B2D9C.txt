ORDERING PHYSICIAN:
Case: COLLECTED: RECEIVED:

CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Patient is a year old female with history of CIN 3 on
biopsy and a recent pregnancy.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

UTERUS AND CERVIX (HYSTERECTOMY):

— Invasive squamous cell carcinoma, moderately
differentiate —

— Depth of invasion 0.4 cm out 2.0 cm cervical thickness
- Extensive lymphovascular invasion.

- Posterior radial soft tissue margin 0.9 cm

- No invasive tumor on sections from the anterior cervix

— Closest vaginal margin 2 cm

— Parametria are negative for malignancy

— Decidualized endometrium and myometrium, consistent with
history of recent pregnancy

LYMPH NODE, RIGHT PELVIC (BIOPSY):
— Two lymph nodes negative for carcinoma (0/2)

LYMPH NODE, RIGHT PERIAORTIC (BIOPSY):
- One lymph node negative for carcinoma (0/1)

LYMPH NODE, LEFT PELVIC (BIOPSY):
— Four lymph nodes negative for carcinoma (0/4)

LYMPH NODES, LEFT PERIAORTIC (BIOPSY):
— One lymph node negative for carcinoma (0/1)

MICROSCOPIC EXAM:

Sections of the cervical tumor show nests of malignant
cells. The nests appear to be infiltrating cervical glands
and there are bands of collagen surrounding many of the
nests. The malignant cells are somewhat radially located
around the edges of the nests. Central necrosis within the

nests is prominent. The tumor cells have a high nuclear to
, cytoplasmic ratio with nuclei containing loose chromatin and
a small nucleoli. Mitotic figures are abundant.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh in five containers bearing
the patient's name and hospital number.

Part #1, labeled "uterus and cervix," consists of a 1128—gm
uterus and cervix with no attached adnexa. The uterus
measures 14.5 cm from cornu to cornu, 17 cm from cervical 05
to top of fundus, and 9 cm from anterior to posterior. A
probe extends into the cervical os 14.5. The cervix is
round with a defect in the posterior 6 o'clock position.
The defect appears to be within a lesion that is 3.5 cm from
lateral to lateral and is 2 cm from anterior to posterior
and involves the entire posterior aspect of the cervix. The
defect appears as a chunk out of this lesion that is 1.5 cm
deep and 1.5 cm on its side. The cervix itself is 5 cm from
lateral to lateral and 4 cm anterior to posterior. There is
2 cm of attached vaginal wall that is attached from the 6
o'clock to the 9 o'clock position. On the anterior and left
side there is approximately 1 cm of attached vaginal wall.
The serosa on the uterus is pink and unremarkable. The left
parametrium is inked with black ink and the right
parametrium is inked with green ink. Upon opening the
uterus, the cervical canal measures 3.5 cm and the
endometrial cavity is 10.5 cm vertically and 7 cm at its
widest point. The endometrial cavity is covered with a

(% boggy, hemorrhagic-appearing endometrium. The myometrium is
thick and boggy—appearing. The maximum thickness is 3.5 cm.
The cervix is dissected away from the specimen and entirely
submitted as follows:

A1—A6 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock
A7-A13 3 o'clock to 6 o'clock
A14—A24 6 o'clock to 9 o'clock
A25—A30 9 o'clock to 12 o'clock
A31-A36 right parametrium
A37-A39 left parametrium
A40—A47 uterus

Part #2, labeled "right pelvic lymph node," consists of two
fragments of fibroadipose tissue. The first piece is 1.5 x
1 x 0.7 cm and the second is 2.1 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. The
specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes B1 and 32.

Part #3, labeled "right periaortic," consists of one lymph
node that is 2 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm and another small piece of
fibroadipose tissue that is 1 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The specimen
is entirely submitted in cassettes C1.

Part #4, labeled ”left pelvic lymph node," consists of a
fragment of fibroadipose tissue that is 2.5 x 0.7 x 1.2 cm.
The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted in cassettes
D1 and D2.

 

Part #5, labeled "left periaortic lymph nodes," consists of
one piece of fibroadipose tissue that is 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm.
The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette E1.
