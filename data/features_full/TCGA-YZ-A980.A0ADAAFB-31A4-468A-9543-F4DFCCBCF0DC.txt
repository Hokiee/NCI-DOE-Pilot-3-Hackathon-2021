*****Clinical History*****

Melanoma left eye WMMi‘Cﬁq-Lz
(94,3) 3/1127”
*****Final Pathologic Diagnosis*****

Eye, left, enucleation:

Malignant melanoma, mixed cell type.
Ciliary body involvement present.

No extrascleral extension.

See Synoptic Report.

All controls show appropriate reactivity.

The immunohistochemical and/or in situ hybridization tests reported here,
except for those addressing HER—ZNeu overexpression, have been developed
and their performance characteristics determined by the
Immunohistochemistry and ' ‘

1d are not required to
have nor do they have FDA approval. ‘

The above diagnosis is based on my personal examination of the slides and,
if indicated, other material relevant to the case. I have reviewed and
approved this report prior to its release.

*****MICROSCOPIC:*****
A microscopic examination of H&E and PAS stained slides was performed.

*****SPECIMEN(S) RECEIVED:*****

Eye, enucleation

*****GROSS DESCRIPTION:*****

The specimen is received in one properly labeled container with the
patient‘ 5 name and accession number.

A. The specimen is designated "left eye" and consists of a left
eye that is 2.2 cm horizontally, 2.4 cm vertically, and 2.2 cm from
anterior to posterior. Translumination of the specimen reveals a tumor
that is 1.5 x 1.3 cm in the superior anterior aspect of the globe. The
optic nerve is cut flush with the globe. Upon trisecting, the tan-gray
rubbery tumor is 1.4 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm. The tumor is present on the superior

anterior aspect of the globe adjacent to the ciliary body. The tumor is 1.9
cm from the optic nerve stump. No gross extrascleral extension is noted.
