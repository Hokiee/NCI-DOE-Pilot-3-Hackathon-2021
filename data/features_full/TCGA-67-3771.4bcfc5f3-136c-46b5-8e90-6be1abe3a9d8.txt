D. The specimen is submitted fresh for TCGA study as "left upper lobe
(time of resection 12:01)“ and consists of a lobe of lung weighing 162
grams and measuring 23 x 9 x 2 cm. The pleural surface is deep red purple
and reticulated by carbon pigment with a firm puckered 2 x 2 cm area along
the lateral apex. There is an adjacent 2 x 2 cm roughened focally
hemorrhagic area. The hilum exhibits a 4.5 cm staple line. Removal of
the staple line reveals two segments of bronchi measuring approximate 1 cm

each in diameter and four vessel margins varying 0.3 cm to 0.5 cm in
diameter. Several grey black friable nodules are clustered about the
hilum. Sectioning reveals a 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm yellow tan tumor which
appears to abut the puckered area of the pleura previously described and
is 4 cm from bronchial margin. The adjacent roughening corresponds to the
diffusely thickened pleura measuring up to 0.3 cm in maximum thickness.
The pulmonary parenchyma distal to the tumor is deep red and honeycombed.
The remaining pulmonary parenchyma is deep red and airless.

Representative sections are submitted, multiple (9):
