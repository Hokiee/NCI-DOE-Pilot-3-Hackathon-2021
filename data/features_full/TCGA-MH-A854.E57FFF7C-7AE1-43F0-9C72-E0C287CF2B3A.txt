COMMENT: The tissue submitted in parts C-E was fragmented; adequate
assessment of surgical margin and accurate tumor size is not possible.

Gross Description
Specimen Material: A. Renal, R mid lateral tumor:

B. Renal, R lower pole tumor:
C. Renal, R mid anterior tumor:
D. Renal, R superior lateral tumor:

E. Renal, R upper medial lesion:

Part A: The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "RIGHT MID LATERAL
RENAL TUMOR", and consists of a 28 gram well-circumscribed, circular mass
(4.5 x 4 x 2.5 cm). One side of the renal mass has a rim of

normal-appearing, tan-gray renal parenchyma; the other side is an

encapsulated ﬁrm mass. The specimen is serially sectioned, and the cut

surface shows a friable, hemorrhagic, yellow mass that does not appear to
extend through the renal capsule. The tumor abuts the inked resection

margin. A portion of this tumor is submitted for further studies (tissue
banking).

Ink Code:

Resection margin of kidney orange :"

Cassette Code:

A1-8: Inked renal resection margin with adjacent tumor (resection margin
entirely submitted)

A9: uninvolved renal parenchyma

Part B: The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "RIGHT LOWER LOBE
RENAL TUMOR", and consists of a single tan-gray nodule (1.7 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm).
The cut surface shows a hemorrhagic yellow nodule. The specimen is

serially sectioned and entirely submitted in 31-2.

Part C: The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "RIGHT ANTERIOR MID
LESION RENAL TUMOR", and consists of two tan-gray nodules (1.2 x 0.6 x 0.4
cm in aggregate). The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette C1.

Part D: The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "RIGHT SUPERIOR
LATERAL RENAL TUMOR", and consists of two tan-gray fragments of tissue (1.8
x 1.4 x 0.4 cm in aggregate). The specimen is submitted entirely in D1.

Part E: The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "RIGHT UPPER MEDIAL
RENAL LESION", and consists of multiple fragments of tan—gray tissue (0.9 x

0.7 x 0.3 cm in aggregate). The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette
E1.
