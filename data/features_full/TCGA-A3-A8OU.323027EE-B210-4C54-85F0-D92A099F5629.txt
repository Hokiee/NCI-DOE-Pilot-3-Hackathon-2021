Gross Description:

A. The specimen is labeled right renal mass and is received without fixative. It consists of a resection of
renal tissue which measures 5 x 4 x 3 cm. The cauterized renal margin is inked blue. The cortical surface
of the kidney is bulging and on sectioning there is a thinly encapsulated yellow—tan to pale red slightly
lobulated to cavitary appearing mass which measures 3.5 x 3.3 x 3 cm. lt grossly is 0.9 cm from the closest
renal resection margin. Representative tissue is obtained for genetic studies. Representative sections of
the renal mass are submitted in cassette A1 -A5.

 
 

 

B. The specimen is labeled base of right tumor and is received without fixative. It consists of a 5 x 4 x 3
cm fragment of tan to reddish brown cauterized tissue. It is submitted for frozen section as F82. The tissue
remaining from frozen section is submitted for permanent section in cassette B1.

Microscopic Description:
A. Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic findings are reflected in the diagnosis
rendered. An intradepartmental consultation with _was obtained.

B. Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic findings are reflected in the diagnosis
