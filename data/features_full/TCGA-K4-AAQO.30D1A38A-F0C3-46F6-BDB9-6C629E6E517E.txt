Case Clinical Information
BLADDER CANCER

Gross Description

A. Received in formalin labeled with the patient!s name and
“left distal ureternFS“ is a yellow/tan tissue measuring 5 x 5 x
1 mm thick. Entirely submitted in A1.

B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"right distal ureteers" are two yellow/tan tissues. Each
measures 3 mm in greatest dimension. Entirely submitted in El.

C. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
”left obturator lymph nodes" are multiple fragments of finely
divided fat measuring 2 x 2 x.2 cm. The dominant lymph node is
bisected and totally submitted in C1. A second lymph node is
bisected and submitted in C2.

D. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"left external iliac lymph nodes" are two fat pads measuring 2 x
2 x 2 cm in compact aggregate. No significant induration is
encountered. All material is submitted in Dl-D3.

E. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"left internal and common iliac lymph nodes" is a fat pad
measuring 5 x 4 x 1.2 cm thick, An area of dominant fatty
induration is bisected and submitted in El-Ez; remaining
induration in E3.

F, Received in formalin labeled with the patient‘s name and
"right obturator lymph nodes“ is a fat pad measuring 2 x 2 x 2
cm. There are two areas of induration which are bisected and
submitted in separate cassettes, F1, F2.

6. Received in formalin labeled with the patient‘s name and
“right external iliac lymph nodes“ is a fat pad measuring 5 x 3
x 1.5 cm. An area of dominant induration is bisected and
submitted in G1; remaining subtle induration in 62.

H. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"right internal and common iliac lymph nodes" is an irregular
fragment of fibroadipose tissue measuring 8 x 3.5 x 2 cm thick.
A dominant area of induration is bisected and submitted in H1;
remaining induration in H2-H3.

1. Received in formalin labeled with the patient‘s name and
"bladder and prostate" is a specimen so designated, overall
measuring 14 cm superior to inferior x 12 am right to left x S

cm anterior to posterior. The specimen is inked blue on the
right; black, left. The included prostate measures 3.5 cm
superior to inferior x 4 cm right to left x 2.5 cm anterior to
posterior. The bladder cavity measures 3 cm superior to
inferior x 2 cm right to left x 1.5 cm anterior to posterior.

It appears distinctly contracted and is associated with a
conspicuous transmural mass involving the entire anterior wall
of the bladder measuring overall 5 x 3 x up to 1.5 cm thick.

The mass projects along the posterior bladder wall for 3.5 cm on
the right and left. The right and left seminal vesicles on
palpation measure 1.3 x l x 0.8 cm and 2 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm in
greatest dimensions. The ureteral stubs are deeply retracted,
but are not sampled at this time since they are reflected in "A"
and “B“. The posterior bladder mucosa appears unremarkable.
Grossly, the anterior surgical resection margin appears free of
tumor for a minimum of 0.5 cm grossly. The section code is as
follows: llzleﬁt seminal vesicle and shave of left vas;
12=right seminal vesicle and shave of right vas; I3=sheve of
distal prostate; I4~IG=mid-p0sterior prostate; I7-I9=superior
posterior prostate; I10, Illcsagittal plane sections of left
anterior bladder wall; I12=sagittal plane sections of right
anterior bladder wall in relationship to inked anterior margin;
Ila-115=additiona1 sections of left lateral bladder wall
proceeding inferior to superior; and Ils-Ilsuright lateral
bladder wall and additional representative sections proceeding
inferior to superior. ‘

J. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
“hernia sac" is a fibromembranous specimen measuring 3 x 1.5 x 1
cm with an area of nodularity at one end. Entirely submitted
in J1.
