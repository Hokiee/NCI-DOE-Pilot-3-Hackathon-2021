A. The specimen consists of the right breast. measuring 21 x 20 x 5.5 cm
weighing 1067 grams. No axillary tail is attached. No orientation is

ind

provided. The breast is covered With an ellipse of tan-white skin, measur ng

17 x 7 cm. The nipple is retracted and measures 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm. No
discrete ulceration. fissure. or exudate is identified. The nipple is

surrounded by unremarkable tan-brown areola. Approximately 2.2 cm away frnn

the nipple is a poorly defined. slightly raised tan-brown area. measuring

 

.7

x 0.6 cm. No discrete scar is identified. The deep surface reveals a lar e
mechanical defect. measuring 5 x 2 cm and 3 cm in depth. The specimen app ars

to have been sectioned by the surgeon. The deep surface is inked black an

the specimen is serially sectioned. The sections show a very poorly
circumscribed. tan-white fibrotic area. measuring approximately 4.5 x 3.5

3.5 cm. The fibrotic area reveals a well defined irregular mass. measuring

2.5 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm and a hemorrhagic area. measuring 0.7 cm in greatest

(

dimension. The mass is composed of tan-white firm tissue and is approximazely
1.4 cm from the deep margin. One possible intramammary lymph node. measur mg

1.2 cm in greatest dimension. is identified. The lymph node is bisected a d

no discrete neoplastic involvement is present. The surgical resection margins
are unremarkable. Separately received in the same container are five portions

of irregular tan-yellow adipose tissue. measuring 5 x 5 x 1 cm in aggregate.

No discrete lesion or lymph node is identified in the separate portions.
Representative sections are submitted in thirteen cassettes as follows:

cassette 1 - mass with deep margin: cassettes 2 and 3 - additional sections of

mass; cassettes 4 through 6 - random sections from the fibrotic area. away

from the mass; cassettes 7 through 10 — sections from the four quadrants;
cassette 11 - lymph node: cassette 12 - nipple and tan—brown area of the s
cassette 13 ~ random sections from the separate portions.

B/BPC. The specimen consists of one portion of tan—yellow adipose tissue.
measuring 5 x 4 x 2 cm. The specimen has been bisected in pathology
consultation. The specimen is senf lly sectioned and four pos 'ble lymph

measuring 8 x 8 x 2 cm in aggregate. On palpation. fifteen possible lymph
nodes. ranging from Qggucm_tq_141mein greatest dimension. are identified.
Three lymph nodes are grossly invo ved by neoplasm.
are submitted in four cassettes as follows: cassette 1 . six intact lymph

nodes; cassette 2 - one bisected lymph node; cassette 3 - three lymph nodes:

cassette 4 - five intact lymph nodes.

2=== MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: ==----==------

A, B/BPC. & C. Serial sections in twenty slides are examined.
specimen A show breast within an extensively infiltrating mammary lobular
carcinoma. focally with pleomorphic features. Tumor is widely infiltrative
_closest approach to deep margin is approximately 9 mm. Maximum tumor size
difficult to assess on glass slides alone. but combining the grossly evided
tumor mass with the additional fibrotic areas. all of which are involved by
carcinoma of the gross impression of up to 4.5 cm is felt to be accurate as
true assessment of the infiltrative tumor. The intramammary lymph node
sampled in block A11. as well as seventeen additional lymph nodes submitter
parts B/DPC & C are all extensively involved by metastatic carcinoma

' morphologically identical to the mammary primary. There is also evidence c

extranodal spread involving the soft tissue surrounding several of the lymph

nodes.
