GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries", received fresh and placed in

formalin is a 134 gram (10.8 x 6 x 1.3 cm) hysterectomy specimen. The specimen
is opened to reveal a 6 x 5 x 3.8 cm pedunculated soft yellow-tan mass
primarily located within the posterior endometrial cavity (4.5 x 3.3 cm). The
mass is located 4 cm from the internal cs (0.7 cm) and does not grossly
appears to invade the lower uterine segment endocervical canal. The mass is
sectioned to demonstrate a fleshy, focally lobulated white-tan cut surface
with focal areas of cystic change up to 0.7 cm. The mass does not appears to
invade the underlying myometrium (1.3 cm). The remainder of the endometrium is
grossly unremarkable (0.1 cm). Three intramural nodules up to 1.7 cm in
greatest dimension are identified. These nodules are well circumscribed,
whorled, white—tan with a bulging cut surface. No areas of hemorrhage and

necrosis are identified in these nodules.

bosselated ovary. The cut surface of the ovary is grossly unremarkable.
Representative sections of left adnexa are submitted in block A14.

B. "Left pelvic nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 6.4 x 5.1 x
1.5 cm aggregate of yellow~tan fibroadipose tissue which is dissected for
apparent lymph node candidates. Twelve lymph node candidates are identified

lymph node candidates. Two lymph node candidates are identified and measures
2.5 cm and 1 cm in greatest dimension. One lymph node candidate is submitted
in block D1. One lymph node candidate is submitted in block D2 (bisected)

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: hysterectomy and salpingoophorectomy, with node dissection

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 6th Edition): pT2a pNO pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution‘s Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

DIAGNOSIS: .
A. "UTERUS, CERVIX, BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES" (RADICAL HYSTERECTOMY):

UTERUS: 134 GRAMS
ENDOMETRIUM:
TUMOR SITE: CORPUS FUNDUS
HISTOLOGIC TYPE: MALIGNANT MIXED MULLERIAN TUMOR
FIGO GRADE: 3
TUMOR SIZE: 6 X 5 X 3.8 CM.
MAXIMUM DEPTH OF MYOMETRIAL INVASION: 0.0 CM, IN A 1.3 THICK WALL.
LYMPHATIC/VASCULAR INVASION: NEGATIVE
ADJACENT NON-NEOPLASTIC.ENDOMETRIUM: BENIGN ENDOMETRIAL POLYP AND
ﬂTROPHIC ENDOMETRIUM
REMAINING MYOMETRIUM: LEIOMYOMATA AND ADENOMYOSIS.
CERVIX: ENDOCERVIX POSITIVE FOR GLANDULAR INVOLVEMENT BY TUMOR,
NEGATIVE FOR STROMAL INVASION
SEROSA: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.
SPECIMEN MARGINS: NOT INVOLVED

OVARIES AND FALLOPIAN TUBES, BILATERAL: NO PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS.

B. "LEFT PELVIC NODE" (LYMPH NODE DISSECTION):

TEN LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (0/10).

 

C. "RIGHT PELVIC NODE" (LYMPH NODE BIOPSY):

NINE LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (0/9).

__D. "PARA-AORTIC NODE" (LYMPH NODE BIOPSY):
TWO LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (0/2).

COMMENT: The uterine tumor is composed of a proliferation of malignant

appearing epithelial elements, mainly glandular in appearance, along with an

extensive malignant appearing stromal component with heterologous elements

including rhabdoid cells. This is interpreted to represent malignant mixed

Mullarian tumor. Multiple sections do not demonstrate any definite muscular or
nvaSion.
