COMMENT:
Part 2: The permanent section of the left ureter-i resection margin Show. mild urothelial atypla, which. at most,

represent; low grade intraurothoiial neoplasla (dyapiaaia). Theme is no evidence of carcinoma in Situ or invasive
carcinoma at the margin.

Part 3: A section of the bladder wall with adjacent vaginal wall (block SC) Show: tumor Inflltrating between smooth
muscle bundlec, which are felt to represent the outer bundle. of detrucor muscle, rather than vaginal wall smooth
muscle. Vaginal wall involvement by tumor I: therefore not evident
