COMMEN‘F

The prostate gland contains three separate foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, one in the transition zone and two in the peripheral
zone. The dominant tumor focus is located in the left and right transition zone. This tumor focus measures 3.0 x 0.8 cm in the
largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in three cross sections and extensively in the apex and base regions. The
second largest tumor focus is located in the right lateral, right posterolateral, and right posterior peripheral zone. This tumor focus
measures 2.5 x 1.0 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in three cross sections and extensively in the apex
' and base regions. The third tumor focus is located in the left anterolateral, left lateral, left posterolateral. and left posterior
peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 2.5 x 0.4 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in three cross
sections and focally in the base region. All tumor foci are conﬁned to the prostate. The margins of resection are free of tumor.

GROSSDESCRIPTION

(F) PROSTATE AND SEMlNAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (4.5 x 3.5 x 4.5 cm, 39 grams, post-ﬁxation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
right posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the left side. A nodule is palpated in the right base
region. Serial cross sections after ﬁxation demonstrate a firm area consistent with tumor in the right peripheral zone extending
from the first to the third cross sections of the prostate.

The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor. Also included in the container is a
detached portion of tissue consistent with seminal vesicle (3.0 x 1.8 x 0.7 cm).
