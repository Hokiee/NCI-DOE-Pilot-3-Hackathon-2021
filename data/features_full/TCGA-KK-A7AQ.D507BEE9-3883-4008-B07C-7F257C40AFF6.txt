DIAGNOSIS

(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 7 (4+3) WITH TERTIARY GLEASON GRADE 5 COMPONENT
(SEE COMMENT).
TUMOR CONFINED TO THE PROSTATE.
Margins of resection free of tumor.
Right and left seminal vesicles, no tumor present.
Segments of right and left vasa deferentia, no tumor present.
PERINEURAL INVASION PRESENT.
No lymphovascular invasion identiﬁed.
PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH GRADE.

' COMMEN'E:

The prostate gland contains four foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, two in the peripheral zone and two in the transition zone. The
dominant tumor focus is located in the right lateral, right posterclateral, right posterior, mid posterior and left posterior peripheral
zone. This tumor focus measures 1.4 x 0.5 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the ﬁrst two cross
sections of the prostate and extensively in the apical region. This tumor focus exhibits predominantly Gleason grades 4 and 3. A
minor component of Gleason grade 5 is present. This tumor exhibits an extensive cribriform pattern and also intraductal spread.
The presence of intraductal spread is confirmed by a stain for basal cell markers and racemase (PIN 3). The second tumor focus
is located in the left and right transition zone. This tumor focus measures 1.1 x 0.3 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension
and it is present in two cross sections, and focally in the base region. The third tumor focus is located in the right anterolateral and
right lateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 1.0 x 0.1 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in
one cross section. The fourth tumor focus is located in the right transition zone. This tumor focus measures less than 0.2 x 0.1
cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension. and it is present in the ﬁrst cross section and focally in the apical region.

All tumor foci are conﬁned to the prostate. The margins of resection are free of tumor. lmmunostaining.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (4.7 x 3.8 x 3.5 cm, 48 grams. post-ﬁxation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
posterclateral aspects of the prostate is scant and symmetrical. A nodule is palpated in the right apex. Serial cross sections after
fixation demonstrate a firm area consistent with tumor in the right side of the ﬁrst cross section of the prostate.

Spec1men DatelTlme:

The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

SECTION CODE: C1-C4, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; 05-08,
left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; 09, ﬂap over posterior surface; 010, 011,
prostatic base, right border; 012-014, prostatic base, right posterior border; 015-023, prostatic base, central portion; 024, 025,
prostatic base, left border; 026-028, prostatic base, left posterior border; 029, apex anterior; 030, C31, apex left; 032, 033, apex
posterior; C34, apex right; 035, detached portions of margin of resection according to the specimen radiograph; 036-051, sections
of the four cross sections of the prostate according to the specimen radiograph.

The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in
black.

Blue ink (09, 12—14, 38, 42, 46 and 50) and orange ink (C42, 43, 46, 47, 50 and 51) denote surfaces that do not represent
the true margin of resection.
