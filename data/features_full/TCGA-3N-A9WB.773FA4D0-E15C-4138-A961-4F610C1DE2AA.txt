COMMENT:
The frozen section diagnosis is conﬁrmed. Regarding staging, definite lymph node tissue is not present in

the part 5 “left axllt nodule“ specimen, this is interpreted as an in-transit metastasis which. according to staging
criteria is pNzhi Clinical and surgical correlation are recommended.

measuring 5 x 2.5 cm that ties 1.5 cm from both the 12 and 6 o‘clock margins. The specimen is serially sectioned.
One portion of the nodule lies within 0.2 cm of the deep margin. The remaining skin is grossly unremarkable. A

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:

A. Malignant melanoma is identified with multiple expansile nests of malignant cells extending into the
subcutaneous tissue and displaying readily apparent mitoses numbering 8 mitoses] mm’. Satellite nodules are
apparent with separate loci oi melanoma within the dermis and subcutaneous tissue away from the main mass.
Areas of lymph vascular space invasion are identiﬁed. Prior biopsy site changes are noted. Malignant melanoma
extends to within 4 mm. of the deep margin (slide A3) and to within 9 mm. of the medial (anterior) margin at 9:30
o'clock (superior. short stitch designated 12 o'clock during gross examination). A compound dysplastic nevus with
moderate atypie is noted in slide A7. This not present at ink. lntravascuiar malignant melanoma extends to within 5
mm. of the 12 o'clock superior margin. Melanoma invades to a Clark's level of V and to a Breslow depth of 1 cm.
Intralymphatic malignant melanoma extends to within 5 m. at the 5:30 o'clock inferior margin.

El. Malignant melanoma is present involving adipose tissue. This extends to cautertzed tissue edge.
Definite lymph node tissue is not seen.
