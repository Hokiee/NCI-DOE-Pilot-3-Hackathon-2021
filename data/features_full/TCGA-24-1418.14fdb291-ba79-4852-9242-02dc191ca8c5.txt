Specimenlsl Received:

A: UTERUS, CERVIX. BILATERAL TUBES AND OVAREES
B: OMENTUM

Gross Description;
ﬁns are received in two containers of lormalln, each labeled” The first container Is Iabefed
I

it contains a uterus with bilateral adnexa. The uterus has ar. serosal surface consistent
with Implants and measures 8.0 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm. The tan 3.2 x 3.2 cm ectocervix is unremarkable with a 0.7 cm slit-like
os. The uterus has been previously opened to show a 2.5 x 0.5 cm canal and a 3.5 x 1.51an-brovvn unremarkable
endometrium. The right ovary measures 2.2 x 1.8 x 1.3 cm and is sectioned to show a tan-yellow parenchyma. The
right fallopian tube measures 6.5 cm 1.5 x 1.0 cm with numerous firm yellow-tan nodules on the paratubai soft tissue
surface. The fallopian tube ls sectioned to show a lumen ranging from 0.1 cm to 0.5 cm. The left ovary measures 3.0
x 1.5 x 1.5 cm and is sectioned to show a tan-yeilow, vagueiy nodular cut surface. The left fallopian tube 3.5 x 1.0 x
0.8 cm and has numerous. vaguely nodular tan-white firm areas adhesed to paratubal soft tissue. Labeled A1 and A2 -
right ovary; A3 - right fallopian tube; A4 and A5 - left ovary; A6 and A7 - left fallopian tube; A8 - posterior cervix: A9 —
anterior cervix; A10 - posterior uterus; A11 - anterior uterus; A12-14 - right ovary and fallopian tube. entirely submitted;
A1547 Left ovary and fallopian tube entirely submitted. Jar 2.

The second container is labeled "omentum.“ It contains ~ 20 pieces of previousiy sectioned omentum, measuring 18 x

18 x 1.5 cm in aggregate. The omentum is further sectioned to show firm willie-tan tissue intermixed with librofalty
tissue, grossly consistent with metastatic omental caking, largest focus measuring > 2 cm.

SYNOPTIC REPORTiNG FORM FOR MALIGNANT OVARIAN NEOPLASMS

HISTOPATHOLOGIC TYPE
The histologic diagnosis is serous adenocaroinoma

TUMOR LOCATION
The Iooationts) of the tumor(s) is/are peritoneal primary

HiSTOLOGIC GRADE
The histologio grade Is poorly differentiated (so)

TUMOR INVASION
Tumor is identiﬁed on the ovarian surfaceIs)
Tumor does invade the adjacent fallopian Iubelperilubal soft tissue

TUMOR INVOLVEMENT
Metastatic involvement of the omentum is present

Page 2 of 3

 

TUMOR SIZE
The maximum dimension of tumor implants outside the true pelvis Is greater than or equal to 2 cm

PREMARY TUMOR

Based on the aboveHormation, the primary tumor is classified as macrosco ic itoneal metastasis beyond pelvis
more than 2 cm in greatest dimension or regional lymph node metastasis ﬂ

REGIONAL LYMPH uooes (N) -

The regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed

DISTANT METASTASIS (M)

The status of distant tumor site cannot be assessed
STAGE GROUPING

The Finai AJCC/UlCC/FIGO stage is TSCINXJMX

The paihoiogic stage assigned here should be regarded as provisional, and may change after integration of cllnicai
data not provided with this specimen.
