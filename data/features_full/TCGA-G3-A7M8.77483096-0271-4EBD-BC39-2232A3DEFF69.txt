Gross Description

Received fresh is a single specimen cc"*““‘“ ”“o requisition and specimen container
are labelled with the patient's name, The cassette and are
labelled with the Surgical Number

The container is designated "left liver“. The specimen consists of a partial hepatectomy
specimen weighing 666.1 g and measuring 23.0 x 12.0 x 6.0 cm. The resection margin is
painted blue. The outer surface has a vaguely nodular appearance. On sectioning, the
liver parenchyma has a micronodular, cirrhotic appearance with an orange/brown
discoloration. Three potential lesions are identified. The largest is a circumscribed
soft tan/yellow nodule approaching the painted resection margin and this measures 2.1 cm
in diameter. A second blood—filled cystic lesion is seen at the opposite end 0: the
reeeccion specimen and it measures 0.9 cm in diameter. It approximates the capsule.
Another small hemorrhagic area is seen near to this second lesion, but it is unclear
whether or not this represents a separate lesion. There is an apparent fullness to one of
the portal tract areas adjacent to the inked resection margin. Otherwise, no other mass
lesiona are identified.
