Report Signed:

Final Diagnosis:

Procedure: Radical prostatectomy with right and leﬁ pelvic lymph node dissections.
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma of the prostate, acinar type.
Histologic grade:
Primary pattern: 4 Secondary pattern: 4
Total Gleason Score: 4+4=8.
Tumor quantitatlon: Tumor can be seen in both the right and left prostate extending from apex to base on the right
side, involving the left apex and left mid prostate, and sparing the left base. Largest diameter of carcinoma on the right
is 14 mm in diameter, and on the left is 10 mm in diameter in the right mid prostate and left apex, respectively.
Extraprostatic extension: There is focal extraprostatic extension in the posterior right mid prostate, in an area less
than 1 mm in length.
Margins: The distal urethral, proximal urethral, apical, bladder neck, and external capsular margins are all negative
for carcinoma.
Lymph-vascular invasion: Absent.
Perineural invasion: There IS permeural invaSIon wtthm the body at teh earcmoﬁia and in carcmoma mvolvmg the
capsular condensation in the right posterior prostate.
Seminal vesicle invasion: Absent.
Treatment effect on carcinoma: Not applicable.
Lymph nodes: Six pelvic lymph nodes toal, not designated as to laterality, all negative for carcinoma.
Additional pathologic findings: High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.
Ancillary studies: DNA pioidy ordered on block A8 (to be reported in an ADDENDUM).
Pathologic staging: pT3a, pNO
Biorepository sample (if applicable): Yes, contains carcinoma.
Block(s) containing malignancy suitable for additional testing: A3, A4, A7, A8, A10, A12, A14, A16.

Parafﬁn-embedded tissue (Block A8) was forwarded to r for DNA Ploidy by . The
report r’ interpreted by l follows:

Source: Prostate, radical prostatectomy, block J A8

Results:

The cancer cells are DNA near diploid; DNA index =1.15.

DlA ploidy test results have been validated by our iaboratory for l‘ormnl‘n-ﬁxed, parafﬁn embedded tissue sections. Amlysis was performed using the V
instrument < . which determined DNA ploidy status by comparing the DNA content ol'tumor cells and control cells (selected by operator). This
test was developed and its performance diaractcristics determined by ' ‘ .‘his test has not been cleared or approved

by the us. Food and Drug Administration.
Proliferation index (MlB-l) = 3.81%.

Ki»67 Antigen immunohistoehemical test results have been validated by our laboratory for paratlin embedded tissue sections ﬁxed in formalin. Testing is
performed using the MIB-l -"‘-“‘ and a polymer-hosed detection system All controls show appropriate reactivity. Image ccllcclionand analysis is performed using
