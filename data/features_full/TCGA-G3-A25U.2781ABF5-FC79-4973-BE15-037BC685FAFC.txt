GROSS DESCRIPTION:

B: The specimen consists of a portion of fibrofatty tissue measuring 1.4 x 1.1
x 0.2 cm. Within it is a lymph node with a maximal dimension of 0.9 cm.
Entirely submitted in cassette B.

C: The specimen consists of a portion of liver weighing 423 gm and measuring
16.8 x 8.9 x 7.4 cm. The outer capsule is smooth with a slightly micronodular
appearance. The specimen has previously been treated with silver nitrate and
the surgical margin has been"inkea”blaCKT”The surgiCal‘margiﬁ“mé§§ﬁfé§”11.3 x
7.1 cm. Within the liver is a well circumscribed tan yellow nodule measuring
6.0 x 5.8 x 7.3 cm. It has a soft rubbery consistency with a central area of
irregular hemorrhage. Within uninvolved parenchyma there are small areas
suspicious for tumor within the vascular space. The uninvolved parenchyma is
smooth, tan and has a subtle micronodular appearance. The closest tumor to the
surgical margin is 0.9 cm and is within 1 mm of the capsule.

 

Cassette submitted as follows:

C1 through C11 — shaved margin of the surgical margin closest and farthest
away.

C12 through C14 — sections of tumor with capsule.

C15 and C16 — suspicious for tumor emboli.
