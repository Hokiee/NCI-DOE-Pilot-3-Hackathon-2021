FSEA, F828: Malignant tumor present suggestive of saroomatoid portion of malignant mesothelioma.

Gross Description
The specimen is received in 13 parts in a container labeled with the patient‘s name and medical record number.

Specimen #1 is designated “Previous incision” and consists of an elongated fragment of skin with the surgical tape
applied on the surface measuring 15.0 cm x 0.8 cm x 1.5 cm. There is an incisional scar present on the surface of the skin
measuring 10.0 cm in length. Multiple representative sections are submitted in three cassettes from the frozen section.

Specimen #2 is designated “Rib“ and consists of a portion of rib measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. Representative sections
are submitted in one cassette.

Specimen #3 is designated "Level 4“ and consists of multiple fragments of yellow-tan adipose tissue measuring in
aggregate 3.0 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm. Within the adipose tissue, at least eight lymph nodes are identified measuring from 0.2 up
to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. The entire specimen is submitted in two cassettes.

Specimen #4 is designated ‘Levei 9" and consists of three pink-tan ovoid firm tissue measuring 1.0, 1.5 and 2.5 cm in
greatest dimension respectively. The specimen is bisected and submitted in three cassettes.

Specimen #5 is designated "Level t0“ and consists of a single pink to yellow-tan ovoid soft tissue measuring 1.0 cm in
greatest dimension. The specimen is bisected and submitted entirely in one cassette.

Specimen #6 is designated “Level 2“ and consists of two pink-tan ovoid soft tissue measuring 0.9 cm in greatest
dimension respectively. The entire specimen is submitted in one cassette.

Specimen #7 is designated "Pleura' and consists of multiple fragments of pink-tan to yellow-tan soft tissue consistent with
pleura measuring in aggregate 35.0 cm x 15.0 cm x 6.0 cm. The soft tissue shows multiple pink~tan tumor nodules
measuring from 0.2 up to 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted in five cassettes.

Specimen #8 is designated ‘Lung" and consists of a single brown, spongy, unoriented, unstabled lung parenchyma
measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in two cassettes.
