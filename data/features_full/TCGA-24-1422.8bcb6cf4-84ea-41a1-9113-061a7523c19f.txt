SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

 

lntraoperative Consultation:

An tntraoperative non-microscopic consultation was obtained and Interpreted as: 'Brought to frozen area is a 'rtght tube
and ovary.’ consisting of a multicystlc ovary measuring 7.3 x 4.? x 4.5 cm and a fallopian tube measuring 6.3 cm in
tength and 0.7 cm in diameter, weighing 85 grams total. The serosal surface of both ovary and fallopian tube are
studded with nodules, ranging from 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm to 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. 0n the surface of the ovary is a 0.6 x 0.4 x
0.3 cm nodule. somewhat different in character. Sections show a firm and tan-white cut surface. The outer sudaca is
inked black. The ovary is sectioned to reveal muttlple cysts with smooth inner linings and trabeculations, measurini T

  
  

to 4.0 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm. A section was taken of a serosal nodule, and frozen as ‘FSt .' Rest for permanents.“

Microscopic Description and Comment:

Hlstologlc sections from the right ovary show a large cyst that appears to be paraovarian. it is lined by benign ciilated
epithelium is most consistent with a benign serous cyst adenoma. On the surface of this cyst, however. are small
nodules of metastatic high grade serous adenocarcinoma. The bulk of the malignant tumor in this case is located in
the omentum with small implants on both fallopian tubes. left ovary. and on the serosai surface of the uterus. These
findings are most consistent with a primary peritoneal carcinoma.

Histor :
”with ascites and a pelvic mass. Operative procedure: Examination under
anes es 3. exp are dry aparo omy, otal abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, iniracolic

omentectomy. and optimal tumor debulking.

Gross Description;
w The first container is

The specimens are received in three Iormaiin-filled containers, each labeled

labeled “right tube and ovary.‘ it contains a tissue cassette labeled "F81“ that holds a 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm piece oi
yellow-tan tissue. Also in the container is a previously inked and sectioned right adnexa, consisting of a 7.3 x 4.7 x 4.5
cm multicystic ovary, and a 6.3 x 0.7 cm ialloplan tube. There is a 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm white-tan, firm nodule on the
surface of the ovary. In addition. the serosai surface of the ovary and fallopian tube are studded with nodules ranging
from 0.1 x 0.1 cm to 0.5 x 0.3 cm. as described in the lntraoperative non-microscopic consultation. The ovary is
sectioned to show a 4 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm muitiioculated cystic mass with a white-tan, smooth inner fining. There are no
sond areas within the cystic mass. The uninvolved ovary is sectioned to show yellow-tan. unremarkable ovarian
parenchyma. The fallopian tube is sectioned to show whi - sa with a patent lumen. Labeled A2 to A7 — ovary
with cystic mass (A4 - serosal nodule); A8 - Iaiiopian NEW

The second container is labeled "uterus. cervix, left tube and ovary.“ it contains a 43 gram uterus with attached cervix.
The uterus measures 7 cm from superior to interior. 4 cm from cornu to cornu. and 3 cm from anterior to posterior. The
serosai surface of the uterus shows fibrous adhesions anteriorly. However, it is smooth and shiny posterioriy. The 2 x
2 cm tan ectocervix has multiple areas of red-brown pinpoint hemorrhages with a 0.6 cm external 05. The 1.7 cm long
endocervical canal is lined by pink-tan mucosa and has scattered Nabothlan cysts, the largest measuring 0.4 cm. The

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

3.5 x 1.2 cm endometrlal cavity is pink-tan and unremarkable. The endometrium ls 0.2 cm thick; the myometrium is 0.8
cm thick. The myometrium contains three well circumscribed. tan-white. firm lesions with whorled cut surfaces. free of
hemorrhage and necrosis, measuring 1 cm, 0.6 cm, and 0.5 cm in greatest dimension, consistent with ieiomyomas.
The largest telomyoma shows focal caicitication. There is also a 0.5 x 0.3 cm subserosai lelomyoma anterioriy. Also in
the container is a detached, to gram left adnexa including a 2.5 x 2.2 x 1 cm ovary and a 4 x 0.6 cm attached fallopian
tube. The surface of the ovary and fallopian tube shows extensive fibrous adhesions. There are multiple paratubal
cysts, the largest measuring 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. The ovary is sectioned to show yellow-tan unremarkable
ovarian parenchyma. The fallopian tube is sectioned to show white-tan mucosa with a patent lumen. There are no
discrete lesions. Labeled Bi and B2 - anterior and posterior ectocervix; 83 and 84 - anterior and posterior lower
uterine segment; E35 and BS - anterior and posterior endomyomefrium; B7 - leiomyoma: BB - felt ovary; BQ - left ovary
with paratubai cyst; i310 - left fallopian tube. Jar f.

The third container is labeled ‘ornenturn.' It contains an 18 x 10 x t.5 cm piece of yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue.
Sectioned to show ‘ ite-tan. llrm tumor implants, the largest measuring 2.5 cm in greatest dimension.
Labeled Ct and C2
