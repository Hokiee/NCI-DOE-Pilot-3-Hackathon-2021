CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
- ex-smoker (20 pack-years), now with a 2.6 cm LUL nodule.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in eight parts, each labeled with the
patient's name.

1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'left upper lobe nodule r/o
carcinoma'. It consists of a wedge biopsy of the lung measuring 10

x 5 x 2.5 cm. The specimen is received previously incised. Also

noted two stapled lines measuring 10 cm and 3.5 cm. The stapled line
is shaved and the pleura around the staple is inked black. Also

noted on pleura is focal puckering and fibrotic area. Cutting into

the specimen reveals a grey-white firm nodule measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x

1 cm. The nodule located is 1.5 cm and 1 cm from both stapled lines.
Frozen section performed on the nodule and resubmitted for permanent
section. The remainder of the parenchyma is pink-red blotchy and
crepitant. Representative sections are submitted.

2. Part two is received in saline, labeled 'station 8 lymph node'.

It consists of two pieces of tan and black soft tissue measuring 1.0
x 0.5 x 0.4 cm and 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is submitted
entirely in one cassette.

3. Part three is received in saline, labeled 'station 10 lymph
node'. It consists of a piece of black soft tissue measuring 1.2 x
0.6 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted entirely in one cassette.

4. Part four is received in saline, labeled 'station 11 lymph node'.
It consists of a piece of black soft tissue measuring 1.0 x 0.3 x
0.2 cm. The specimen is submitted entirely in one cassette.

5. Part five is received fresh, labeled 'left upper lobectomy'. lt

consists of a 174 gram upper lobe of the left lung measuring 18 x 8

x 3.7 cm. Along the pleural surface of the lung, is a row of

surgical staples extending from the anterior medial apex, obliquely
along the anterior lateral pleura for a length of 13.5 cm. The

visceral pleura is smooth, reddish purple from subpleural hemorrhage
and outlined by black lymphatics. The area surrounding the staples
on the anterior surface is inked in green, and the staples are
removed revealing dark-red lung parenchyma with a homogeneous cut
surface. The lung is serially sectioned and no lesions are grossly
seen or palpated. Representative sections are submitted in seven
cassettes.

6. Part six is received in saline, labeled 'station 6 lymph node'.

It consists of four irregularly-shaped fragments of tan and black

soft tissue measuring 1.7 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. The specimen
is submitted entirely in one cassette.

7. Part seven is received in saline, labeled 'station 5 lymph node'.

It consists of two irregularly-shaped pieces of black soft tissue
measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm and 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The specimen
is submitted entirely in one cassette.

8. Part eight is received in saline, labeled 'station 7 lymph node'.

It consists of one small piece of black-flecked tan soft tissue
measuring 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is submitted entirely in
one cassette.

ADDENDUM # 2 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS:

KRAS and EGFR were sent on- or patient

The test is to be performed on tissue from case

The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited

accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose
signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,
examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1D appropriate to
the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9
unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to- where the

subject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be
issued when the results of this molecular test are available.

ADDENDUM 2:

RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12A (c.35G>T) mutation in codon 12 of
the KRAS gene.

INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to
correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase
inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer.

COMMENT:

KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking
history.

This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of

the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected.

This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and
codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin
embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been
established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung
carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other
tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of
pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).

METHOD/LIMITATION:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

ADDENDUM 3:

Genzyme Specimen #:-.

EGFR Mutation Analysis
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: No mutation detected

INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified; however 18-20% of
patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and without identifiable
mutations are reported to be responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor therapies.

COMMENT: This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine
kinase domain; based on the current literature, the vast majority of
mutations are expected to occur in these exons. The analytical
sensitivity of the assay is 10-20%, thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected.

Most data published to date pertain to gefitinib (lressa(r)).
Similar data have been seen in studies using erlotinib (Tarceva(r)).

Homozygosity for the frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A
was identified. The polymorphism is not likely to have clinical
significance.

This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.

METHOD:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.
