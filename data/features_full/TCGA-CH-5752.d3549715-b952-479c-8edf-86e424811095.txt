Diagnosis

1. Poorly differentiated, max. 2.8 cm adenocarcinoma of the prostate in both lobes with marked
perineural growth along major nerves, inﬁltration of the periprostatic connective tissue in the
region of the right middle section of the prostate and the right base of the prostate, as well as
invasion of the vessels. Tumor—free seminal vesicles and seminal ducts.

2. Six tumor—free lymph nodes.

3. Three tumor—free lymph nodes.

Remark

Carcinoma inﬁltrates are found in the peripheral and transitional zone of both sides with right-
sided predominance. Carcinoma cells extend to several points (right lateral apex, right medial

apex, left medial apex) < 0.1 mm on the green and blue labeled preparation margin. The color
labeling itself is tumor-free. Small foci of carcinoma differentiated as Gleason 3 are seen as a

tertiary Gleason score.

Summarizing tumor classiﬁcation: p’I3a, pNO (0/9), Gleason 4+4 = 8; G3, Li, V0.

A follow—up report will follow on the question of a possible ne ‘
differentiation.
