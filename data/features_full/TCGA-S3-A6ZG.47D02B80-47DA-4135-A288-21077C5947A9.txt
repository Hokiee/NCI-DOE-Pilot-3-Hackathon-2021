48 hours). It consists of an ovoid piece of yellow-tan fatty tissue with 3 sutures designate l silk anterior, 2 silk medial margin and 3
silk posterior margin. Specimen measuring 5 x 4 x 4 cm. The specimen is oriented and inked as follow: Anterior-yellow, posterior—
hlack, superior-orange, inferior-red, medial~hlue. and lateral margin with green color. On sectioning cut surface shows 1.5 x l x 1 cm

ESTROGEN RECEPTORS: 90 %, POSITIVE.
PROGFSTERONE RECEPTORS: 80 %, POSITIVE.
STAINING INTENSITY: MODERATE

HER-ZNEU: SCORE 0, NEGATIVE.

Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed parafﬁn embedded tissue (Block I32) using the following monoclonal
antibodies: Estrogen receptor (Clone SP1). Progesterone receptor (Clone ,l E2) and Her—2neu Clone 485); control sections
for I-IER-ZNeu are provided within a kit (score 0 MCF-7, score l+ T-47D, score 2+ MDA-MBASS, score 3+ BT-474). Detection
system used: polymer. Primary antibodies, reagents and control sections for HER-Zneu are all provided by

All controls show appropriate reactivity.

Reactivity of Estrogen and Progesterone receptors is determined based on the percentage of positively stained nuclei of tumor
cells. Reference values (CAP accreditation program checklist 2010 and guidelines on webpage):

Positive: nuclear staining in 1% or greater than I% of invasive carcinoma cells

Negative : nuclear staining in less than 1% of invasive carcinoma cells

Staining intensity: is reported as weak, moderate or strong.

HER-luau reactivity is reported applying the CAP scoring guidelines (CAP accreditation program checklist 2010 and guidelines on
webpage):

Score 0 = Negative: No immunoreactivity, or faint weak immunoreactivity in <10% of tumor cells but only a portion of the
membrane is positive.

Score 1 = Negative: Faint weak immunot'eactivity in 10% or >lO% of tumor cells but only a portion of the membrane is positive.
Score 2+ = Equivocal: Weak to moderate complete membrane immunoreactivity in > 10% of tumor cells or

circumferential intense membrane staining in <30% of cells.

Score 3+ = Positive: More than 30% of the tumor cells must show circumferential intense and uniform membrane staining. A
homogeneous (chicken wire) pattern should be present.

In the evaluation of the score the pathologist is assisted by the computerized

Equivocal results for HERQneu (Score 2+) will be subsequently followed by a reflex dual-color lSH testing.

lmmunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin ﬁxed, parafﬁmembedded tissue (Block B6, BS) with adequate positive and
negative control sections.

The invasive carcinoma shows scattered positivity for E-cadherin. The results support the above interpretation.
Also the results of a P63 stain support hte above ﬁndings.
