I!!Report: Electronically Reviewed and Signed Ou—

Intraoperative Consultation:

An intraoperative nonwmicroscopic consultation was obtained and interpreted as:
'Called to pick—up ‘left tube and ovary' consisting of a 6 x 3 x 1.5 cm adnexal
specimen with a few separate fragments of redntan tissue. The ovary and
fallopian tube show adhesicns with nodularity; Representative tissue frozen as
FSl. Remainder for permanents,“

- ‘

Sections show a poorly differentiated serous adenocarcinoma consistent with a
primary peritoneal serous carcinoma as the omental mass appears dominant and the

ovaries are atrophic with only surface implants. The tumor is distinctl
different than the iatient'i iiiiicarcinoma._

History:
The patient is Fwith a history of breast cancer. Cytologic
evaluation of a omina ascrtes s owed adenocarcinoma. Operative procedure and

findings: Examination under anesthesia, exploratory laparotomy, bilateral
salpingo—oophorectomy, omentectomy, left ureterolysis, tumor debulking, left
cervical lymph node aspiration, lymph node sampling (pelvic).

Gross Description
Received are four formalin—filled containers, each labeled

The first container is additionally labeled “left tube and ovary.‘ It contains
a segment of fallopian tube which is adhesed to an atrophic ovary and the
adjacent soft tissue. The fallopian tube measures 5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in
diameter. The adjacent atrophic ovary measures 2.1 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. Covering

the external surface of the fallopian tube, paratubal soft tissue, and ovary are
numerous tan—grey granular nodules which measure up to 0.4 cm in greatest
dimension. The fallopian tube is serially sectioned; the lumen is patent with
no focal lesions. The atrophic ovary is bisected; the cut surface is tan—grey {
with no focal lesions. The frozen section specimen is submitted in A1 (F31).
Additional sections of fallopian tube and ovary are submitted in A2 to A4. Jar
1.
The second container is labeled Bright tube and ovary.“ It contains a fallopian
tube with adjacent atrophic ovary. The fallopian tube measures 5 cm in length
and up to 0.4 cm in diameter. Multiple simple cysts are identified at the
fimbriated end. Sections of the tube disclose a patent lumen with no focal
lesions. The adjacent atrophic ovary measures 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.6 cm. The surface

is tan—white and smooth. The Ovary is bisected; the cut surface Shows tan—grey
parenchyma with no focal lesions. Fallopian tube and ovary labeled B1 and BZ.
Jar l.

The third container is labeled “omentum.” It contains a single segment of
yellow lobular adipose tissue which measures 25 x 11 x 2.5 cm. The omentum is
diffusely replaced by a tan-white maes.

The fourth container is additionally labeled 'left pelvic lymph node.“ It
contains a single lymph node surrounded by yellow lobular adipose tissue. The
lymph node measures 2.2 cm in greatest dimension. It is bisected to show

tanvwhite tissue with no focal r ss lesions. The lymph node is submitted
entirely. d .
