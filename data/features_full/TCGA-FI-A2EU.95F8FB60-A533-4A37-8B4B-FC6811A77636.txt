Gross Description . ‘ . _ .
The specimens are received in seven formalin-filled containers, each labeled

The first is labeled "uterus/cervix/bilateral tubes and ovaries."

It contains a total abdominal hysterectomy bilateral salpingo-oophorectom
specimen consisting of a 115 gm uterus (8.§ x 6.0 x 3.0 cm) right ovarg ( .0 x
x 1.0

.0 x 0.5 cm), right fallopian tube (5.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm). le t ovary (2.
x 0.5 cm). and le t fallopian tube (5.0 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm). The uterine serosa is
brown and_smooth without adheSions or protrusions. The cervical as measures 0.4
cm. A vaginal cuff is present posteriorly (1.1 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm ) and is inked
blue. The eatocerv1x is focally hemorrhagic. 0n section, the cervix and lower
uterine segment show a Circumferential golden brown, possibly ulcerated region

measurin cm in length. A 0.6

cm Nabot ian cyst is identified in the
endometrial caVity measures 3.5 x 1.5 cm..The endometrial cavity shows a left
cornual fleshy, soft, partially hemorrhagic polyp (2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm) involving
both anterior and posterior uterus. The polyp is 5.5 cm from the ectocervix. On
section, the polyp is pink, soft, and homogenous. It does not appear to deeply
invade the uterus. The endometrial cavity. otherwise, is tan-brown an
unremarkable. The right and left ovaries are tan—white and cerebriform. On
section they are brown and unremarkable.

The faliopian tubes have a smooth brown surface and are patent. Left
tuba-ovarian adheSions are identified. Labeled A1 - posterior cervix, va inal
cuff and ulcerated region; A2 - anterior cervix with ulcerated region: Ag —

The second container is abelod "right pelvic lymph node." It contains multiple
oieces of fatty tissue measuring in aggregate 5.0 x 4.5 x 2.0 cm from which six
ymph nodes, measuring 1.0, 1.7, 1.5 .3, 3.0. and 3.7 cm in reatest dimension
are dissected out. La eled Bl 7 two lymph nodes in entirety; B - one lymph node
bisected; B3 - one lymph node in entirety; B4 - one lymph node bisected; BS —

one lymph node bisected. Jar 1. .
The t ird container is labeled "right periaortic lymph node." It contains
multiple fragments of yellow fatty tissue measuring in aggregate 3.0 x 2.0 x 2.0
cm from whic a Single lymph node measuring 1.2 x .4 0.4 cm is dissected.
Labeled C - lymph node, isected. Jar 1.

The fourth container is laboled "left pelvic lymph node." It contains multiple
fragments of yellow fatty tissue measuring in aggre ate 5.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm from
which four lymph nodes. ranging from 1.3 to.2.5 cm n greatest dimension are
dissected. Labeled Dl - Single lymph node bisected; DZ — three lymph nodes in
entirety; 03 — single lomgh node bisected. Jar 1.

The fifth container is a eled ”left periaortic lymph node." It contains
multiple fragments of yellow fatty tissue measuring in aggregate 1 x 0.5 x 0.5
cm from whic a single l mph node measuring 0.3 cm in greatest dimension is
dissected. Labeled E1 — ym h node, submitted in entirety; E2- remaining tissue

for lymph node search. Jar .
The sixth container is labeled "cecal adhesion." It contains a 0.9 x 0.2 x 0.1
cm piece of brown-gray.soft tissue. Labeled F1. Jar 0.

The seventh container is labeled "omentom." It contains a 13.0 x 6.5 x 0.7 cm
