DIAGNOSIS:
1. Retroperitoneum, left, with portion of sigmoid colon, tumor. resection:

~ Dedifferentiated liposarcoma arising in a background of
well-differentiated liposarcoma. (see Note)

— The tumor measures 13.0 cm in greatest dimension.

- The dedifferentiated component constitutes more than 95% and is a low
grade spindle cell sercoms.

- Well-differentiated liposarcoma, lipoma-like.

- The tumor is covered with a thin fibrous membrane.

— Segment of colon with no significant pathologic changes.

Note: Prior biopsy 'as reviewed.

2. Salt tissue, deep iliac vein, resection:
- Well-differentiated liposarcoma, sclerosing-type.
— Four benign lymph nodes (0/4) .

3. Colon, distal margin, excision:
- Benign segment of colon.

4. Colon, proximal margin, excision:
— Benign segment of colon.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

Gross Description:

1). The specimen is received fresh. labeled “left retroperitoneal
liposarcoma with sigmoid colon". It contains a segment of sigmoid colon
with attached tan-yellow mass. The sigmoid colon measures 24.5 cm in length
and 2.5 cm in average circumference. A tan-white to tan-yellow mass is
identified at the ssrosa surface of the sigmoid colon, measures 13 x 9.5 x 8
cm. Cut surface is ten-yellow, slightly gelatinous, there are tan-white firm
areas identified. The mass is covered by a thin membrane. Upon opening of
the sigmoid colon, the mucosa is unremarkable. The membrane of the mass is
inked black. Photographs are taken. T85 is taken. The specimen is
representatively submitted.

Summary sections:

S-sigmoid colon, representative

M.-mass, representative

P—firm area, representative

ADD—additional sections adjacent to the mass

2). The specimen is received in formalin labeled, llThe iliac vein' and
consists of pink-tan fibrofatty cauterized tissues measuring 2.3 x 1.5 x 0.8
cm. Submitted in total.

Summary of section:
U-undesignated

3). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Distal margin“ and
consists of a ring of pink tan soft tissue measuring 2.5 x 2.3x 1.1 cm.
Multiple sutures and staples are attached. The mucosal surface is pink tan
and focally hemorrhagic. The sutures and staples are removed and the soft
tissue is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U - undesignated

4). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled 'Proximal margin“ and
consists of a ring of pink tan soft tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.3x 1.1 cm. The
mucosal surface is pink tan and focally hemorrhagic. The soft tissue is
entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U - undesignated
