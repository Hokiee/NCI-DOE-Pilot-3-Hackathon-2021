I. Bladder, prostate and seminal vesicles (radical cystoprostatectomy):
Bladder:
Invasive high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma (2.5 cm in greatest dimension).
Tumor invades through muscularis propria into perivesical adipose tissue as a 2.5 cm
extravesical mass.
No angiolymphatie invasion is identiﬁed.

5... a. ' , W :d
Surgical resection margins, urethral and ureteral margins are negative for tumor.
Three lymph nodes. negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/3).

Prostate and seminal vesicles:

Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4+3=7, bilateral, organ conﬁned.

A minor component of Gleason pattern 5 is present.

A dominant tumor nodule is present in the mid region of the prostate and measures
approximately 1.8 cm.

Right anterior apical margin is focally positive for tumor (block l5).
