PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:

SPECIMEN LABELED "RIGHT KIDNEY":
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, clear-cell type, (2.4 cm), Fuhrman Grade II/IV

(focally III/IV), involving the mid and inferior pole.
Tumor embolus is present at the renal vein margin.
Tumor is confined to kidney (except for tumor emboli).
Extensive tumor emboli are present in vasculature.
Ureteral and arterial margins are negative for tumor.
Gerota's fascial and soft—tissue margins are negative for tumor.
AJCC Classification (6th Edition): pT3b Nx Mx.
The non-neoplastic kidney will be evaluated by Renal Pathology, and the

findings will be reported in an addendum.

CLINICAL DATA:
History: None given.
Operation: Right radiCal nephrectomy.

Operative\Findings: None given.
Clinical Diagnosis: Renal cell carcinoma.

TISSUE SUBMITTED:
A/l. Right kidney.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen, Part A, is received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, unit

number, and "#1. Right kidney", consists of a 483—gram radical nephrectomy
specimen (overall dimensions 17.0 x 7.2 x 5.0 cm) consisting of kidney (10.2 x
6.3 x 4.8 cm) and attached yellow/tan lobulated perinephric adipose tissue (up
to 3.5 cm in thickness). Extending from the renal hilum is a segment of ureter
(6.2 cm length x 0.3 cm in diameter), a segment of renal artery (1.6 cm length
x 0.4 cm in diameter}, and a segment of renal vein (0.5 cm length x 1.0 cm in

diameter).

In the mid pole, there is a well-circumscribed golden yellow focally

‘ hemorrhagic mass (2.4 x 2.4 x 1.0 cm), which grossly appears to arise from the
renal parenchyma and focally distorts but does not appear to invade into the
renal sinus. Upon, sectioning, the mass is confined to the renal parenchyma,
does not grossly appear to involve the renal capsule, and comes within 2.4 cm
of the perinephric soft tissue resection margin.

Within the renal vein, there is a loosely adherent friable hemorrhagic
red/brown to yellow/brown necrotic tissue (probable tumor thrombus) contiguous
with the aforementioned mass, which grossly appears to come within 0.2 cm of
the renal vein margin (previously sampled en face in the frozen section room).
The aforementioned comes within 2.4 cm of the renal artery margin and 5,5 cm of

_the ureteral margin.

A 0.9 cm inferior to the aforementioned mass, in the inferior pole of the

, kidney, there is a well—circumscribed yellow/tan friable nodule (? satellite
lesion, 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm).

The pelvic calyceal system exhibits smooth, glistening tan mucosa. The

corticomedullary junction is distinct. No lymph nodes are identified within

the perinephric adipose tissue. '

A representative section of the specimen was photographed.

which 7 (3.5 %) are globallygsclerosed. The remaining glomeruli show mild
diffuse mesangial expansion; overt nodular glomeruloscleroeis is not noted at
this time. There are no discernible craters or double contours of the
glomerular basement membranes. Rare distal tubules contain PAS—positive
hyaline casts. Less than 5% of the cortical parenchyma shows tubular atrophy
and interstitial fibrosis. Arteries and arterioles exhibit a mild to focally
moderate degree of sclerosis; some small arteries reveal significant narrowing
of the lumen by accumulation of connective tissue in the subintima. Arterioles

show early focal hyaline degeneration.

METAPHASES COUNTED: 10 ANALYZED: 6 scones: 4 BANDING: GTG

INTERPRETATION:
All metaphases contained clonal aberrations including loss of the short arm of

chromosome 3, which is a characteristic finding in renal cell carcinoma, clear
cell type.

COMMENTS:
Mosaicism and Small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the

standard methods employed. Chromosome analysis was performed at a level of 400
bands or greater.

INDICATION FOR TEST:
