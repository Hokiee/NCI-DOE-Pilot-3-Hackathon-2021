Breast, right, simple mastectomy. Multiple (2) nodules of 1nvasive mammary carcinoma are N I) 1
identiﬁed. Inﬁltrating lobular carcinoma, Nottingham grade I (of III) [tubules 3/3, nuclei 1/3,
mitoses 1/3; Nottingham score 5/9] 15 identiﬁed forming a mass (1.] x 0.9 x 0.8 cm) located 1n ~..
the upper outer quadrant of the breast [AJCC pTlc]. This cancer shows HERZ/neu protein “ '
overexpression (scored as 2+; see comment below) and has metastasized to right axillary sentinel
lymph node No.1D as a roughly 1.1 mm keratin positive collection of tumor cells barely visible
by routine H&E morphology (see comment regarding right axillary sentinel lymph node excision
below).

Inﬁltrating ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade I (of III) [tubules /3, nuclei /3, mitoses /3;
Nottingham score /9] 15 identiﬁed forming a second lesion (1.7 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm) in the upper outer
quadrant located 0. 6 cm inferior and medial to the ﬁrst lobular carcinoma mass [AJCC pTlc].
This tumor also shows HERZ/neu protein overexpression (scored as 2+; see comment below).
However, there is no morphologic evidence of metastasis by this second lesion into any of the

sentinel lymph nodes.

Extensive ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate nuclear grade, is present within and outside the
invasive component with a separate nodule in the central/deep breast, 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm, located
1.4 cm medial to the inﬁltrating ductal carcinoma. Angiolymphatic invasion is not seen. The
non-neoplastic breast parenchyma shows proliferative ﬁbrocystic changes. Biopsy site changes
are present. The tumor does not involve the nipple, overlying skin, or underlying chest wall. All
surgical resection margins, including the deep margin, are negative for tumor (minimum tumor
free margin, 0.4 cm, anterior/superior margin).

Lymph nodes, right axillary sentinel, excision: A single (of 12) right axillary sentinel lymph
node is positive for metastatic carcinoma [AJCC 9N1 mi (sn)]. This positive sentinel node is
designated No. 1D (tissue block A4) and is characterized by a roughly 1.1 mm collection of
keratin positive tumor cells without much in the way of H&E morphologic correlation. As noted
above, this microscopic focus of cancer has lobular features. The remaining 11 right axillary
sentinel lymph nodes are negative for metastatic cancer (veriﬁed by keratin immunostaining).
Blue dye is identiﬁed in right axillary sentinel lymph nodes No. 1A, No. 2A, No. 3A, No. 3B, and
No. 4. Blue dye is not identiﬁed in right axillary sentinel lymph nodes No. 13, No. 1C, No. ID,
No. 28, No. 2C, No. 2D, or No. 3C.

HERZ/neu protein overexpression is weakly positive, score of 2+, according to the interpretation
guidelines in the FDA-approved HercepTest. This degree of overexpression is seen in both tumor
nodules (using tissue blocks 32 and B4). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for
HERZ/neu ampliﬁcation will be performed and reported in an addendum.

HERZ protein immunohistochemical (IHC) test results are only valid for non-decalcified parafﬁn
embedded specimens ﬁxed in neutral buffered formalin or Bouin's ﬁxatives. Testing is
performed using commercially available kit/reagents employing a polyclonal antibody and a
polymer-based detection system.

a No ampliﬁcation for HERZ/neu is demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH,
performed in Laboratory Genetics) (blocks 82 and B4) according to the interpretation guidelines

in the FDA approved Patthsion Her2 DNA Probe Kit.
