COMMENT:
The in situ carcinoma is noted outsite of invasive carcinoma component, near the inferior margin, focally involving the
inferior margin, in three out of fifty-eight slides. Entire specimen was submitted for histological evaluation.

NO deﬁnite Iymphovascular invasion was seen in the current specimen. No lymphatic Invasion was seen in the previous
