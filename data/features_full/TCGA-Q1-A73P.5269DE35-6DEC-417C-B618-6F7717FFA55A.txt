GROSS DESCRIPTION:

1. Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and "radical hysterectomy specimen left
tube and ovary“ is a 209 g uterus, 9.6 x 4.6 x 5.8 cm, and an attached left
salpingo—oophorectomy with left fallopian tube, 7.5 in length and 0.9 cm in diameter, and
left ovary, 3.9 x 2.5 x 1.7 cm. The uterine serosal surface has a smooth, purple to
red—tan appearance and focally ragged around the lower uterine segment to cervix ending in
a ring shaped, tan—white portion of vaginal cuff. The cervix is smooth and pinketan, 3.8 x
3.0 cm, with a slitlike cs, 1.6 cm across. An irregular, tan—white to brown, mass is
observed protruding from the 05 opening. Upon opening the specimen the mass, 1.0 x 1.0 x
1.0 cm, grossly appears to involve only the distal portion of the endocervical canal, 3.6
x 1.0 cm, which is pale tan and slightly hemorrhagic with herringbone mucosa, and the
central ectocervix around the os. The endometrium is slightly hemorrhagic and averages
approximately 0.5 cm.in thickness. Upon sectioning the remaining uterus, the myometrium has
an average thickness of 2.2 cm.

Ink code: Anterior parametrium and lower uterine segment resection margin—blue
Posterior parametrium and lower uterine segment resection margin—black

CASSETTE SUMMARY:

CASSETTE lA—lB: Anterior parametrium and cervix with tumor

CASSETTE 1C~1D: Anterior parametrium and cervix with tumor, complete extent, bisected
CASSETTE lE—lH: Posterior parametrium and cervix with tumor

CASSETTE lJ—lK: Anterior endomyometrium

CASSETTE lL—lM: Posterior endomyometrium

CASSETTE 1N: l parametrial lymph node

CASSETTE 1P: Left fallopian tube

CASSETTE 1Q: Left ovary

2. Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and "right tube and ovary" is one 32 g
right salpingo—oophorectomy specimen with right fallopian tube, 10.0 cm in length and 1.0
cm in diameter, and right ovary, 3.5 x 2.2 x 1.6 cm. The ovary has a cut surface which is
yellow tan and homogenous with grossly visible corpora lutea. The fallopian tube is
patent, pink~tan, and has a fimbriated end. The specimen is representatively sampled and
submitted in cassettes 2A and 2B.

3. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and right pelvic lymph nodes.
Received is a 6 x 3.5 x 2 cm aggregate of slightly hemorrhagic yellow gold fibroadipose
tissue. The specimen is dissected for possible lymph nodes, 9 possible lymph nodes are
identified ranging from l—2.l cm in greatest dimension. The specimens is submitted as
follows:

CASSETTE 3A: 2 possible lymph nodes

4. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and left pelvic lymph nodes.
Received is a 6 x 3.5 x 1.7 cm portion of slightly hemorrhagic yellow gold fibroadipose
tissue. The specimen is dissected for possible lymph nodes, 5 possible lymph nodes are

identified ranging from 0.5—5 cm in greatest dimension. The specimens is submitted as
follows:

CASSETTE 4A: 3 possible lymph nodes

CASSETTE 4B—4C: One lymph node bisected

CASSETTE 4De4E: One lymph node serially sectioned

5. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and left vaginal margin. Received

are 2 pale pink to pale tan irregular tissue fragments ranging from 3.5—5 cm in greatest

dimension. The specimens are serially sectioned and entirely submitted in cassettes 5A
through 5C.

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and right para—aortic lymph nodes.
Received is a 2 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm portion of slightly hemorrhagic yellow gold fibroadipose
tissue. The specimen is dissected for possible lymph nodes, one lymph node is grossly
identified that is 2 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The specimens is submitted as follows:

CASSETTE 6A: One lymph node bisected

7. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and left para—aortic nodes.

Received is a 1.6 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm portion of slightly hemorrhagic yellow gold fibroadipose

tissue. The specimen is dissected for possible lymph nodes, no lymph nodes are grossly
identifiable. The specimens is submitted as follows:

CASSETTE 7A: Specimen entirely submitted
