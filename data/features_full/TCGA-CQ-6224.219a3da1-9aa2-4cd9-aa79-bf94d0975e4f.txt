5. The specimen is labeled the patient's name and as "left hemiglossectomy". It consists of a
portion of left tongue measuring 3.4 SI x 2.5 ML x 7.0 cm AP cm. The specimen is oriented by
the surgeon. There is an ill defined ulcerated brown-tan tumor involving the lateral surface of the
tongue. The tumor measures 2.5 SI x 1.0 ML x 3.3 AP cm. It is located at 0.3 cm from the deep
soft tissue margin, 1.3 cm away cm from the medial/superior tongue margin, 1.7 cm from the
anterior tongue margin, 1.7 from the posterior tongue margin and is 0.8 cm away from the inferior
floor of mouth margin. The remaining tongue mucosa is grossly unremarkable.

The deep/medial soft tissue margin is painted with India ink and the posterior margin is painted
with green dye. A representative section of the tumor including deep soft tissue margin is
examined at intraoperative consultation. Representative sections are submitted.
