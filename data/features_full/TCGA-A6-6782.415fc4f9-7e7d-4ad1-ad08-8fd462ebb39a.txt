SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

SPECIMEN
Extended right hemicolectomy

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Hepatic flexure carcinoma

GROSS DESCRIPTION

Received fresh labeled "extended right hemicolectomy" is a

previously unopened 26 cm. segment of proximal right colon
with attached 8 cm. of distal ileum surfaced by smooth to slightly
scabrous tan pink serosa with a moderate amount of mesocolon,
mesentery, and unremarkable omentum. An unremarkable 3.5 cm.
appendix averaging 0.8 cm. in diameter is present. A focus of
serosal retraction including a portion of omentum is noted at the
distal end of the specimen. The overlying surface is inked blue.
On opening, there is a circumferential, 4.8 x 3.2 cm. tan white
tumor located 8 cm. from the distal margin. The tumor has a maximal
thickness of 1.5 cm., grossly extending through the muscularis to
within 0.1 cm. of the inked free radial serosal surface. The tumor
appears to extend into the retracted and adherent omentum (see
blocks 2 and 3). A portion of tumor and a portion of normal mucosa
are submitted for tissue procurement as requested. The proximal and
distal margins of the specimen measure 3.7 and 6.6 cm. in
circumference respectively. The ileal and remaining colonic mucosa
is glistening tan pink with regular folds and the walls average 0.5
cm. in thickness. No additional mass lesion or abnormality is
identified. A few soft to slightly rubbery pale tan white to tan
pink tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 1.0 cm. in
greatest dimension are recovered from the attached mesocolon and
mesentery. Representative sections are submitted in 12 blocks as
labeled.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Proximal and distal margins; 2 and 3 - tumor
extending into associated omentum; 4 - tumor to closest inked free
radial serosal surface; 5 - tumor to normal mucosa; 6 - ICB; 7 and 8
— random from remainder of colon; 9 — appendix; 10 and 11 — ei

whole lymph nodes per cassette; l2 - seven whole lymph nodes. 3-

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma.
Histologic grade: High-grade (poorly differentiated)
Primary tumor (pT): The tumor extends through the full thickness of
the wall and through the pericolonic adipose tissue to the serosal

surface, pT4a. Proximal margin: Negative for tumor.

Distal margin: Negative for tumor.
Circumferential (radial) margin: Tumor extends to within less than
1 mm of the radial margin.
Distance of tumor from closest margin: 8 cm from the distal margin
Vascular invasion: Areas highly suspicious for vascular invasion
identified.

Regional lymph nodes (pN): pNO (0/25)

Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: Perineural invasion is
identified.

Distant metastasis (pM): pr

Other findings: Ileocecal valve lipoma. Appendix with fibrous
obliteration of the tip.

DIAGNOSIS
Colon, right, hemicolectomy —
Invasive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (see tumor
characteristics in
the microscopic description).
