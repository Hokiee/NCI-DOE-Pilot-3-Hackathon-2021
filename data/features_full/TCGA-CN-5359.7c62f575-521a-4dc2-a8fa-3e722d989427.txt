GROSS DESCRIPTION:

Part 1 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name and "right
marrow

margin". It consists of multiple fragments of tan soft tissue
measuring in

largest 0.1 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette 1A.
Part 2 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name and "left
marrow

margin". It consists of small fragments of tan soft tissue measuring
0.5 x

- is submitted fresh in a single container labeled with the
patient' s

name, medical record number, patient' s initials xx and designated
"complex

resection". It consists of a partial mandibulectomy specimen, 9.2 x
6.5 x 6.0

cm, comprising eleven attached incisor, premolar and molar teeth, and
also

attached anterior tongue, floor of the mouth and a bilateral neck
