CLINICAL INFORMATION:

Pre-Op Dx: Bladder cancer

Post-Op Dx: Same

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A: The specimen is received fresh from the 0.R. and labeled "Right distal
ureter-f/s". It consists of a short segment of ureter which is 0.4 cm in length
and 0.3 cm in diameter. Entirely submitted for frozen section in cassette AFS.

B: The specimen is received fresh from the 0.R. and labeled "Left distal
ureter-f/s“. It consists of a short segment of ureter which is 0.3 cm in length
and 0.3 cm in diameter. Entirely submitted for frozen section in cassette BPS.

C: The specimen is received fresh from the 0.R. and labeled'"Bladder, fallopian
tubes and ovaries“. It consists of a bladder with attached bilateral tubes and
ovaries. Overall, the specimen measures 23 x 15 x 5 cm with a smooth, glistening,
mobile peritoneum which is 18 x 12 by less than 0.1 cm. The bladder itself
measures 7 x 7 x 3 cm. There is a soft pink vaginal cuff‘at the distal aspect of
the bladder urethra which is 2 x 2 x 2 cm. The specimen is inked black around the
outer surface and the specimen is opened along the anterior aspect to reveal a
large ulcerated tumor 5 x 2.5 cm in the ‘trigone area and focally in the proximal
urethra. The urethra itself is 3.5 cm long by 1.5 cm in circumference and appears
unremarkable. The rest of the bladder mucosa appears to be unremarkable. The
bladder wall around the tumor is thickened 2.0 cm in thickness and the uninvolved
wall is 0.5 cm in thickness. Both attached ureters are opened longitudinally to
reveal unremarkable mucosa with the right ureter 6.5 cm long by 0.6 cm in
circumference and the left ureter 5.5 cm long by 0.6 cm in circumferenCe. The
specimen is taken back to the O.R. to show the surgical staff in aid to the patient
care. The tumor is then serially sectioned to reveal gross invasion through the
muscularis wall but not into perivesical fat grossly. Representative sections of
the tumor are submitted from C1 to C13. Representative sections of the normal
bladder mucosa are submitted in cassettes C14 through C18. The perivesical fat is
examined for lymph nodes and a few possible lymph nodes are identified and
submitted in cassettes 019 and C20. Bilateral tubes and ovaries are examined. The
right ovary is 2.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm and the left ovary is 2 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm. The right
fallopian tube is soft pink tubular structure 2.5 cm in length by 0.6 cm in
diameter, and the left fallopian tube is 3 cm long and 0.5 cm in diameter.
Representative sections are submitted in cassettes C21 through C23.

D: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Left para aortic LN“. It
consists of one piece of soft yellow fatty tissue measuring 3 x 2 x 1 cm. No
obvious lymph nodes are identified. Entirely submitted.in one cassette.

E: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled l‘Left common iliac LN". It
consists of multiple small pieces of soft yellow fatty tissue measuring in

aggregate 3.6 x 3.5 x 0.3 cm. No obvious lymph nodes are identified. Entirely
submitted in one cassette.

F: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right para caval LN". It
consists of two pieces of soft yellow fatty tissue measuring in aggregate 4 x 2.5 x

0.5 cm. No obvious lymph nodes are identified. Entirely submitted in one
cassette.

G: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right common iliac L. nodes“.
It consists of three pieces of soft yellow fatty tissue measuring in aggregate 5 x

4 x 1.5 cm. No obvious lymph nodes are identified. Entirely submitted in three
cassettes.

H: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right LN of cloquet". It
consists of one small piece of soft yellow fatty tissue measuring 1.6 x 1.4 x 1 cm.
No obvious lymph nodes are identified. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

I: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right external iliac LN". It
consists of multiple pieces of soft yellow fatty tissue not measured No obvious
lymph nodes are identified. Entirely submitted in four cassettes.

J: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled “Right obturator hypogastric
LN". It consists of multiple pieces of soft yellow fatty tissue measuring in

aggregate 7 x 6 x 2 cm. No obvious lymph nodes are identified. Entirely submitted
in five cassettes.

K: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled “Left LN of Cloquet“. It
consists of one piece of soft yellow fatty tissue measuring 2.6 x 1.6 x 1 cm. No
obvious lymph nodes are identified. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

L: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Left external iliac LN“. It
consists of three pieces of soft yellow fatty tissue measuring in aggregate 4 x 2 x
1 cm. No obvious lymph nodes are identified. Entirely submitted in two cassettes.

M: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled 'Left obturator hypogastric
LN“. It consists of multiple pieces of soft yellow fatty tissue measuring in

aggregate 6 x 5 x 2 cm. No obvious lymph nodes are identified. Entirely submitted
in five cassettes.

N: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Vaginal wall abscess". It
consists of a small strip-like fragment of soft pink mucosa—like tissue which is
1.4 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

0: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled “Right pre-sciatic LN“. It
consists of a small piece of soft yellow fatty tissue measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm.
No obvious lymph nodes are identified. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

P: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Left pre-sciatic LN". It
'consists of a small piece of soft yellow fatty tissue measuring.2 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm.
No obvious lymph nodes are identified. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

Q: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right prox ureter". It
consists of a stapled segment of ureter which is 0.6 cm in length by 0.3 cm in

diameter. The Specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in one
cassette.

R: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Left prox ureter". It
consists of a stapled segment of ureter with attached fat which is 0.9 cm long by

0.3 cm in diameter. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in
one cassette .
