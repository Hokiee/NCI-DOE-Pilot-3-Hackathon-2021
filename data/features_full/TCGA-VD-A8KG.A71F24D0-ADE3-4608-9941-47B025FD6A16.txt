MICROSCOPY

Sections show a focally pigmented choroidal melanoma with

with exudative / haemorrhagic retinal detachment. The tumour

loops are not present in the planes of section. The
lymphocytic infiltrate within the tumour is minimal. Tumour
necrosis is not seen. There is focal tumour extension into
the sclera through a vascular channel. No evidence of tumour
involvement is seen in sections from optic nerve or vortex
veins examined. Tumour cells are not seen at the resection
margins. '

Elsewhere, the cornea shows no significant abnormality. The
anterior chamber angles are open and the anterior chamber is
deep. The iris shows no significant abnormality but the
ciliary body appears atrophic with hyalinisation of oiliary
processes. The lens shows subcapsular degenerative changes.
Retina overlying the tumour is slightly atrophic and Bruch's
membrane appears breached in the sections examined.

DIAGNOSIS

Right eye, enucleation: Choroidal melanoma of predominant
spindle cell type.

com

lmmunohistochemistry for assessment of expression of Melan-A
and HSP27 by tumour cells will be performed.

Molecular genetic examination of DNA extracted from the
tumour cells will be also carried out using
multiplex-ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA),
looking at chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and B. A supplementary report
will follow in due course.

swsnmmmr REPORT

In the meantime, molecular genetic analysis of tumour DNA
extracted from the fresh uveal melanoma tissue was performed
using the technique termed multiplex ligation—dependent
probe amplification (MLPA) . These investigations were

miscowron _

The kit P0278 from = which examines for gain: or
losses in 31 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and a, was used.
The DNA concentration was measured using : and the
quality assessed using multiplex—POE prior to the MLPA
reaction.

The DNA concentration was high and of good quality on
assessment. The MLPA reaction was run at least twice on
differing occasions, resulting in similar results.

The results of the sequence analysis of the MLPA products is
printed on a separate report. In summary, sequence analysis
demons trated:

4 borderline losses on chromosome 1, 7 borderline losses in
chromosome 3 (equating to chromosome 3 loss), gains of

chromosome 6p, and gains of chromosome Sq. --

These molecular data require correlation with the clinical
and morphological data for metastatic risk assessment.

SUPPLEMENTARY AND FINAL REPORT
In the meantime immunohistochemistry was performed: the

tumour cells demonstrate positivity for MelanA, BAPl
(cytoplasmic only) . and HSP—27 (score 3).
