FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS
FSA) No frozen section done.
FSB) No frozen section done.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Is submitted fresh for possible frozen, labeled "right

pelvic lymph nodes". It consists of a 6 x 4 x 2 cm.
portion of lymph node—bearing fat, which contains numerous steel
clips. The section of the fat reveals the presence of five
suspected lymph nodes. The smallest of these is 5 mm. in size, the
largest 3 cm. Bisecting all of the lymph nodes shows them to be
made up of soft fleshy reddish—brown tissue without grossly
suspicious areas of metastasis, therefore no frozen sections are
performed as per request of Dr.
BLOCK SUMMARY: Block [**09—30**] — Quadrisected lymp no e, {**09—
30**] in each
cassette; blocks 5,6 — bisected lymph node, half in each cassette;
block 7 - two additional lymph nodes. RS-7.

B. Is submitted fresh, labeled “left pelvic nodes’l and
consists of a 3 x 3 x 2 cm. mass of lymph node—bearing
fat.
The section of fat reveals a large single lymph node present,
measuring 4 x 2 x 1 cm. Bisecting the node shows it to be soft,
without evidence of any firm or suspicious areas. Therefore, no

frozen section is done per request of Dr. —

bisected, half submitted in each cassette. RS—Z.

C. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin,

labeled

"prostate" is a 28 gm prostate. This has an inserted catheter and

the prostate, itself, is 4.5 x 3.5 x 3.2 cm. This has attached

bilateral adnexa. The seminal vesicles average 2.2 x 1 x 0.7 cm
and

the vasa deferentia average 2.2 x 0.5 cm. The right side is inked

blue and the left side is inked black. The adnexa is amputated

from
the specimen and the apical and bladder margins are coned from the

 

specimen. The remainder of the specimen is sectioned from apex to
base to show a pink-tan rubbery and nodular cut surface with no
other discrete gross lesions identified. Representative sections
of
the specimen which include the entire prostate are submitted as
follows: Block 1 — apical margin; block 2 — bladder margin; blocks
3, 4 — slice 1 full thickness composite; blocks 5, 6 ~ slice 2 full
thickness composite; blocks 7, 8 — slice 3 full thickness
composite;
blocks 9, 10 — slice 4 full thickness composite; blocks 11, 12 _
slice 5 full thickness composite; blocks 13, 14 — slice 6 full
thickness composite; block 15 — last slice, slice 7, bisected full
thickness composite; block 16 — base of adnexa and possible vas
deferential margin. RS—16 (entire prostate submitted).
D. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin,
labeled
"splenic flexure colon." The specimen consists of a 7 cm
long portion of colon which is stapled at both ends. The ends of
the specimen are arbitrarily inked blue and black. The serosa is
pink—tan smooth glistening and the specimen is partially covered
with fat. The specimen is previously opened to show a pink—tan
smooth glistening mucosa, having a circumference of 8.5 cm. There
is a large exophytic mass measuring 4 x 3.2 x 2.2 cm. This is
located equidistant in the specimen. There are two additional
small -
polyps grossly identified in the mucosa which are 0.2 cm and 0.3 cm
in greatest dimension. The smaller is located 2 cm from the
nearest
luminal margin (inked black) and the larger is located 1.5 cm from

GROSS DESCRIPTION
the tumor located equidistant between both luminal margins. Lymph
nodes are grossly identified in fat. The cut surface of the tumor
shows minimal invasion into the muscularis propria, not through the
muscularis propria, and comes within 1.5 cm of the deep more radial
margin. Representative sections of the specimen are as follows:
BLOCK SUMMARY: Block 1 — Representative luminal margins; block 2 —
small polyp; blocks E**ll—30**] — representative sections of tumor
to normal
and radial margin; block 6 H has two possible lymph nodes. RS-6.

E. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin,
labeled
"rectum and sigmoid." The specimen consists of a
rectosigmoid colon which is 13 cm long. The specimen is opened at
one end (inked blue) and at the opposite end is stapled. The
stapled end is inked black. The specimen is partially covered with
pink—tan, smooth glistening serosa and yellow lobular fat. The

 

retroperitoneal reflection is located 5 cm from the black inked end.
The specimen is opened to show a pink— tan smooth glistening mucosa
with an average circumference of 7 cm. There is a large exophytic
mass which is 5.5 x 3. 5 x 1.2 cm located 2. 5 cm from the distal
margin. There are additional small polyps which range from 0. 5 cm
to 1 cm. These are located within 0.5 cm of the blue—inked end to

cm of the black inked end. The cut surface of the small polyps

shows no discrete invasions of muscularis propria. The cut surface

has a large mass and shows invasion through the muscularis propria

and comes within 2.5 cm of the radial margin. Lymph nodes are

grossly identified in the fat. Representative sections of the

specimen are as follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY: Block 1 — representative luminal margins which

include small polyp at proximal end; blocks 2, 3 — additional

polyps; blocks [**01u01**] — tumor to normal and deep; block 7 w

representative radial margin; blocks 8, 9 — have nine possible
lymph

nodes each; block 10 — has five possible lymph nodes; block 11 —
has

four possible lymph nodes; block 12 — has one possible lymph node

GROSS DESCRIPTION
bisected. RS~12. -
F. Received in formalin labeled "appendix” is a grossly
unremarkable appendix, partially covered with yellow
lobular fat and pink—tan smooth glistening serosa. The specimen is
6.5 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is sectioned to Show an intact wall
with
an average thickness of 0.4 cm. The lumen ranges from pinpoint to
0.3 cm. No other discrete gross lesions are identified.
Representative sections of the specimen are submitted in one

cassette with the proximal end inked. RS—l. —
