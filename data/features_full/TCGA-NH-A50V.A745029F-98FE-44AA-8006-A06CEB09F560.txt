GROSS DESCRIPTION:

Received fresh for tissue banking is a 25 cm segment of large bowel. The bowel is received
with cecum and a 6.0 cm appendix. The colon is consistent with a right colectomy specimen
and includes a 5.5 cm segment of small bowel. The cecum is indurated. and the serosa is
focally puckered. The serosa is inked blue. The bowal is opened to have a linear 9.0 x
4,0 x at least 1.0 cm tumor mass. The mass fills and involves the cecum and extends to the
ileocecal valve to be circumferential involving the ileocecal valve. The tumor diffusely
extends to involve and focally extend through the bowel wall. There is an area of tattoo
dye in the ascending colon. This area of tattoo dye is approximately 2.5 x 2.5 cm and is
6.0 cm from the lleocecal valve and at least 10 cm from the distal margin. The tumor is at
least 15 cm from the distal margin. The mesenteriC/fat margin is 4.5 cm. The remainder of
the mucosa of the large bowel and small bowel are unremarkable with normal tan folds.

There is a diverticular area of puckerlng in the distal segment of colon which is at least
2.5 cm from the distal margin. The surrounding adipose is sectioned to have multiple
nodular lymph nodes. Both tumor and normal are sampled for tissue banking. The specimen
is sampled as labeled:

1 — proximal margin

2 — distal margin

3 — mesenteric fat margin nearest tumor

4 — representative sections of appendix

5 — ileocecal valve

6-9 — sections of tumor with representative sections showing tumor to normal
mucosa. associated underlying fat. inked serosa

10 A representative sections of normal bowel and bowel with submucosal tattoo dye

11 - sections of diverticular puckering and distal ascending colon

12 — whole lymph nodes

13 - one lymph node bisected

14 — whole lymph nodes

15 — whole lymph nodes

16 — whole lymph nodes

17 — whole lymph nodes and ? tumor implant

18 - two lymph nodes. each bisected
