INTERPRETATlON AND DIAGNOSIS:

1-5) BRAIN TUMOR: ANAPLASTIC ASTROCYTOMA. WHO GRADE III. SEE COMMENT.

 

   

COMMENT: While some of the lesion is grade II, tiasue in IA has the
cellularity, nuclear atypia, and mitotic activity of a grade III
lesion. The MIB~1 rate is approximately 5%. While there are some
oligodendroglioma features, i.e. round uniform nuclei and
perivaecular haloee. the tumor, overall, has features of astrocytome.
Molecular studies found changes consistent with lees of
heterozygosity on 19g, but not on 1p. As such. the 1p/19q codeletion
associated with oligodendrogliome was not present. Isolated loss of
19q is not uncommon in astrocytomaa.
