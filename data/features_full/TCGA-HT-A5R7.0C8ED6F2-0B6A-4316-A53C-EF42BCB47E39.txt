Brain tumor.

GROSS DISCRI’TIONI
1. Received fresh for frozen section, labeled with the patient's name and
"tight parietal tumor;” is an irregular portion of tan-white and hemorrhagic

soft txssue measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. A smear is performed and the entire
specimen is frozen as F1 A.

Frozen section diagnosis:
Infiltrating glioma, favor high grade.

Whe tissue block is subsequently submitted for permanent sectioning.

GROSS DEBCRIPTION:
2. Received fresh for frozen section, labeled with the patient:s name and '
“enhancing nodule,” is a polypoid portion of ten orange soft tissue measuring

0.7 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. A smear is performed the entire specimen is frozen as
FZA.

Frozen section diagnosin-
High-grade glioma.

The tissue block is subsequently submitted for permanent sectioning.

3. Received in formalin. labeled with the patient's name and 'right parietal
tumor perm,‘ are multiple irregular fragments of tan-white to red soft tissue
measuring in aggregate to 3.0 x 2.0 x 0.6 cm. The entire specimen is
submitted in cassettes 3A to 33.

Mrcnoscouc DEBCRIP’I’IWI ’

1-3. Sections demonstrate a diffusely infiltrative astrocytic neoplasm.
Atypia ranges from milé to marked‘ Cellularity has a similar range. Most of
the tumor cells resemble fibrillary or gemistocytic astrocytes. Some cells
lack obvious processes and there is a suggestion of perinucleer halos but the
overall phenotype of the tumor appears to be astrocytoma. Microvascular
proliferation and necrosis are not seen. Unfortunately, specimens one and two
are the most cellular. These demonstrate only an occasional mitosis an the
frozen section artifact makes identification difficult.
