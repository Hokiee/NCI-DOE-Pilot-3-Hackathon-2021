PART A RECEIVED FRESH LABELED LEFT PARTIAL MASTECTOMY LONG
EQUALS LATERAL SHORT EQUALS SUPERIOR, IS AN OVOID PORTION OF YELLOW-PINK
FATTY TISSUE MEASURING '7 X 6 X 3.5 CM. THE SPECIMEN IS ORIENTED BY TWO
SUTURES AND MARKED AS FOLLOWS: LATERAL ORANGE, MEDIAL RED, SUPERIOR
GREEN, INFERIOR BLUE, SUPERFICIAL BLACK. DEEP YELLOW. A LARGE PALPABLE
9 MASS IS FELT WITHIN THE SPECIMEN INFERIOR AND MEDIALLY. SECTIONING
REVEALS A ROUNDED PINK-TAN MASS MEASURING 2.4 X 2.2 X 2.7 CM IN GREATEST
DIMENSIONS. THIS APPROACHES THE SUPERFICIAL, DEEP AND INFERIOR MARGINS,
GROSSLY EXTENDING TO WITHIN 0.2 CM OF EACH OF THESE. IT IS GREATER THAN
1 CM FROM THE OTHER MARGINS. THE SPECIMEN CONSISTS OF PINK-TAN FIBROUS
TISSUE IN THE MEDIAL ASPECT OF THE SPECIMEN AND YELLOW FATTY TISSUE MORE
LATERALLY. A RIBBON CLIP IS IDENTIFIED WITHIN THIS LESION. SECTIONS ARE
SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: Al-TREPRESENTATIVE PERPENDICULAR MEDIAL MARGIN.
