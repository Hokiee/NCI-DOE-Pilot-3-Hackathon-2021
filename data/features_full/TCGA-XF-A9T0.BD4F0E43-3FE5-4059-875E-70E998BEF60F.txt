B: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Apical urethral
margin F/S". It consists of two strips of soft pink mucosal tissue which together

measures 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. "Entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis in
cassette BFS.

C: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Bladder/prostate".
It consists of a cystoprostatectomy specimen which includes bladder and prostate.
Overall, the specimen measures 27.5 x 11 x 4.5 cm with a smooth, glistening, mobile
peritoneum which measures 23.5 x 10 by less than 0.1 cm. The peritoneum does not
appear to be involved by tumor. The bladder itself measures 7.4 x 5 x 3.5 cm. The
specimen is palpated to reveal firmness involving the anterior bladder neck and
this area is inked black on the outside as well as the entire prostate. The
specimen is then opened along the anterior prostatic urethra to reveal a large,
exophytic, fungating, firm, pink tumor involving most of the anterior bladder neck
wall measuring 7.6 x 3.3 x 2.2 cm with the involved wall measuring 2 cm in maximal
thickness. The tumor approaches within less than 0.2 cm of the inked resection
margin. The tumor is split into half as the result of the opening incision. The
uninvolved bladder wall measures 1.2 cm in thickness and the rest of the bladder
mucosa appears unremarkable. Both ureterovesical junctions are identified and are
- patent. The attached ureters are opened longitudinally to reveal an unremarkable
mucosa. The right ureter measures 6 cm in length and 0.5 cm in circumference, and
the left ureter attached to kidney measures 20 cm in length and 0.6 cm in
circumference. The prostate measures 5 x 4.5 x 4.5 cm. The seminal vesicles are
palpated from the posterior side with the right seminal vesicle measuring 2 x 1 x 1
cm and the left seminal vesicle measuring 2.1 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm. The prostatic
urethra appears excavated and measures 3.1 cm in length by 2.6 cm in circumference.
There is a focal area of hemorrhage in the posterior wall of the urethra which
measures 0.4 x 0.3 cm and which represents a possible biopsy site. The
verumontanum itself measures 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. Representative sections of the
bladder tumor and bladder are submitted in cassettes C1 to C28. The prostate is
then serially sectioned from apex to base (1 through 9) to reveal gross hypertrophy
of the transitional zone. Sections are submitted in cassettes C29 to C51.

D: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled “Left kidney“. It
consists of a nephroureterectomy specimen which is attached to the bladder and
prostate by its ureter (bladder and prostate represent part C) and overall measures
21 x 12.4 x 4 cm, including the perinephric fat. The kidney itself measures 12 x 5
x 3 cm. The ureter attached to the bladder measures 20 cm in length and 0.6 cm in
external diameter. The kidney is bivalved and reveals unremarkable cortex and
renal medullary tissue. The renal pelvis appears slightly dilated. The junction
of the proximal ureter and renal pelvis is narrowed to the extent that it is
difficult to open utilizing scissors. Once opened the circumference at the

 

 

    

uh.-
narrowest point of the ureteropelv c junction is 0.4, b t is otherwise
unremarkable. The mucosa of the entire ureter, ureteropelvic junction and renal
pelvis appears grossly normal. No mass lesions or other mucosal abnormalities are
appreciated. The opened specimen is demonstrated at this point to the surgeon. The
vascular margins including renal artery and vein are then identified with the renal
artery measuring 3 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter and renal vein measuring 3 cm
in length by 1 cm in diameter. The renal cortex measures 1 cm in maximal thickness
and the medullary tissue 1 cm in thickness. The perirenal fat is serially
sectioned but no adrenal gland is identified as well as no obvious hilar nodes.

INTRAOPERATIVE FROZEN CONSULTATION:

AFS: Right distal ureter:
— no high grade atypia or tumor identified

BPS: Apical urethral margin:
- no high grade atypia or tumor identified

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

A—B: See final microscopic—diagnosis.

C: Sections of the bladder show multiple foci of urothelial carcinoma in situ
(flat lesion) [C2,3—5,7,8,10,11,13,14,16,18,20,21,24,26]. This includes the
trigone (C10) and left ureterovesical junction (C8). Sections of the mass around
the bladder neck show a deeply invasive poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma
(ell—26), that focally involves the perivesical soft tissue (C19,25,26). Sections
of the attached left ureter show focal reactive changes but no evidence of
dysplasia or malignancy. No lymphovascular invasion is seen and all resection
margins are free of both urothelial dysplasia and malignancy.

Sections of the prostate show unilateral prostatic adenocarcinoma (€30.43),
Gleason‘s score 7 (3+4). The carcinoma is confined to the prostate without
involvement of either the capsule or periprostatic soft tissue. Also seen are
several foci of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN III) [€29.34].
The prostatic urethra shows no evidence of urothelial dysplasia and no invasive
urothelial carcinoma is seen in any of the sections of the prostate. Bilateral

seminal vesicles show no evidence of malignancy. Resection margins are free of
malignancy,

D: Sections of the kidney that include the entire ureteropelvic junction, show no
urothelial dysplasia or malignancy. The mucosa of the renal pelvis is
unremarkable. Sections of renal parenchyma show no significant histopathologic
change. Six renal hilar lymph nodes are identified, all of which are free of
malignancy and show no significant histopathologic features.

E-R: See final microscopic—diagnosis.
