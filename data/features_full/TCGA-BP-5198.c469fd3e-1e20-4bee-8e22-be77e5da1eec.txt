Gross Descripti-oénz

1). The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "right upper pole renat mass." It consists of a 6.5 x 6 x 5.5 cm wedge shaped
portion of kidney with a suture marking the deep margin and a second suture marking the vascular margin. The vascular margin
is grossly not Involved by the tumor but a tumor embolus can be grossly identiﬁed in the lumen of the vessel. The parenchymal
margin is inked black and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 6.0 X 4.5 x 4.0 cm well circumscribed encapsulated tumor.
The cut surfaces of the tumor are tan-yellow to orange and show focal hemorrhagicfnecrotic areas . The clearance from the
resection margin is 0.4 cm. A representative section of the nearest margin is submitted for frozen section diagnosis.
Representatively submitted. Portions of the tumor are submitted for TPS and the Specimen is photographed.

Summary of sections:

T - tumor

PM ~ parenchymei margin

VM - vascular margin

VT - tumor embolus in the vessel
RS - representative sections

ADD —- additional sections

2). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Paracavai lymph nodes" and consists of multiple pink tan ﬁrm possible lymph
nodes ranging lrom 0.6 to 2.6 cm in greatest dimension. Ali identiﬁed lymph nodes are submitted.

Summary of sections:
LN -- lymph nodes
BLN-- bisected lymph node
