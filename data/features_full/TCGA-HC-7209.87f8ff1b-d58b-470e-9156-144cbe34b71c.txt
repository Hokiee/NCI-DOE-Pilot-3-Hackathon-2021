' GRsos DESCRITION:
The specimen is received in two formalin ﬁlled containers labeled with the patient’s name

A. Additionally labeled #1 and contains a 4.8 x 4.0 x 1.5 cm aggregate of yellow-tan ﬁbrofatty soft tissue. On palpationr two ﬁrm fatty possible lymph
nodes are identiﬁed 0.9 and 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. The largest is inked. Both pieces are bisacted and all tissue is submitted in caesette A labeled

‘3. Additionally labeled iii and contains a 44.9 gram, 4.8 x 4.5 x 4.3 cm prostate received with attached bilateral adnexa having overalldimensions of 3.5
x 3.5 x 1.1 cm. Prostatic capsule is pink—tan and shaggy. The specimen is inked as follows: right side - blue; and lelt side — black. The base and apical
margins are coan and serially sectioned. The remainder of the specimen is serially sectioned from apex to base to reveal a 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm well

 

 

circumscribed yellow—tanﬁnn nodule located in the posterior aspect and approaching to within 0.3 cm of the inked capsule. The remainder of the cut
surface is pink-tan and focally cystic with diffuse pedurethral nodularity. No additional discrete lesions are identiﬁed. Representative sections are
submitted in cassettes 81-18 labeled 1 designated as follows: 1—rig ht prostateiseminal vesicle junction; 2~lelt prostatelseminal vesicle
junction; 3-4-apical margin, perpendicular: s—o—oase margin. perpendicular. 7—9-right anterior, apex to base; 10-12-Iight posterior. apex to base; 13-
15»Ieft anterior, apex to base; 16-18—leit posterior. apex to base. Additionally. a yellow and green cassette are submitted for Genomics rasearch each
