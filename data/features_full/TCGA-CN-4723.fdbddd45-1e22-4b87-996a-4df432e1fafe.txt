CHIEF COMPLAINTI PRE—OP! POST—OP DIAGNOSIS: The patient is a_nan who presents with hoarseness, and was
found to have a largely right sided laryngeal lesion. The biopsy conﬁrmed the squamous cell carcinoma. A CT scan shows T4
lesion with direct invasion through the thyroid cartilage.

PROCEDURE: Total laryngectomy. bilateral neck dissection.

SPECIFIC CLINICAL QUESTION: Margin. lymph nodes.

OUTSIDE TISSUE DIAGNOSIS: Yes — squamous cell carcinoma.

PRIOR MALIGNANCY: No.

CHEMORADIATION THERAPY: No.

ORGAN TRANSPLANT: N0.

IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: No.

OTHER DISEASES: No.

 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

LARYNX, LEFT AND RIGHT CERVICAL LYMPH NODES, LEVEL 2-4 RIGHT THYROID, TOTAL LARYNGECTOMY,
BILATERAL NECK DISSECTION, RIGHT THYROED LOBECTOMY ~
A. INVASIVE TRANSGLOTTIC SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED, 3.8 CM INVADENG
THROUGH THYROID CARTILAGE AND INTO ANTERIOR SOFT TISSUE.
NO PERINEURAL OR ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION SEEN.
ALL SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR.
THIRTY~SIX RIGHT AND NINETEEN LEFT CERVICAL LYMPH NODES, FREE OF TUMOR.

aspect of the right thyroid, without grossly obvious invasion. and is 1.0 cm from aryepiglottic mucosa] margin and 2.0 cm from
superior mucosal margin. The anterior surface is covered by red-brown skeletal mUscles, which are grossly unremarkable. No
parathyroid glands identiﬁed near right thyroid lobe. The right thyroid gland is soft gelatinous beefy red and unremarkable. The
sectioning of the bilateral neck soft tissue demonstrate right level 2 lymph nodes, ranging from 0.2 to 2.6 cm, right level 3 lymph
nodes, ranging from 0.6 to 3.0 cm. right level 3 lymph nodes, ranging from 0.3 to 1.1 cm, left level 2 lymph nodes. ranging from 0.2
to 1.8 cm, left level 3 lymph nodes, ranging from 0.5 to 2.2 cm, and left level 4 lymph nodes, ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 cm.
Representative sections are procured for the tissue banking. Digital images are taken. Anterior soft tissue margins are inked.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:
