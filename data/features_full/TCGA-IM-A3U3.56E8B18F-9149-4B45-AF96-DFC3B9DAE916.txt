Gross Description:

A. Received in formalin labeled “Right lobe of thyroid suture mark upper pole” is a 9.6 grams of right lobe of thyroid
measuring 5.5 x 2.3 x 1.0 cm. The external surface is inked in black. The parathyroid gland is not present grossly. Cut
sections reveal grey-white well-defined tumor mass measuring 1.3 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm and less than 0.1 cm from the
capsule, 2.0 cm from isthmus resection margin. This tumor is located in the mid pole. Toward inferior pole, there are
multiple grey-tan cystic cavities measuring from 0.3 to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. Specimen submitted in toto in 14
cassettes as follows:

Cassette #1: Resection margin

Cassettes #2—4: Superior pole

Cassettes #5—8: Mid pole, the lesion in toto
Cassettes #9-14: Inferior pole

B. Received in formalin labeled “Left lobe of thyroid stitch superior' is 16.0 grams of left lobe of thyroid measuring 5.0
x 3.0 x 2.0 cm. The external surface is inked in black. Parathyroid gland is not present. Cut sections reveal grey-tan
well deﬁned nodule (3.2 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm) with hemorrhagic and cysts, located at less than 0.1 cm from capsule and 0.5
cm from the isthmus resection margin. This nodule is extending from superior to inferior pole. Specimen submitted in
toto in 12 cassettes as follows:

Cassettes #1-5: Superior pole
Cassettes #6—9: Mid pole
Cassettes #10-12: Inferior pole

C. Received fresh labeled “RIO parathyroid" is a grey-tan tiny fragment measuring 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm. Submitted in
toto in 1 cassette for frozen section.

D. Received in formalin labeled “Right central midline compartment" is yellow fibroadipose tissue measuring 4.0 x 3.0
x 1.0 cm. There are 5 possible lymph nodes measuring up to 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. Specimen submitted in
toto in 6 cassettes as follows:

Cassette #1: Largest bisected
Cassette #23: Two lymph nodes per cassette
Cassette #4-6: Adipose tissue
