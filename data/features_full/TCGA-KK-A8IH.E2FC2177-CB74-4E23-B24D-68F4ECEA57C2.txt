DIAGNOSIS

(C) POSTERIOR BLADDER NECK:
Adipose tissue with vessels and ganglion, no tumor present.
No prostatic tissue present.
(D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESlCLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA. GLEASON SCORE 7 (4+3) WITH TERTIARY GLEASON GRADE 5
COMPONENT. (SEE COMMENT).
TUMOR EXTENDING INTO EXTRAPROSTATIC TISSUE.
MARGINS OF RESECTION FREE OF TUMOR.
Right and left seminal vesicles. no tumor present.
Segments of right and left vasa deferentia. no tumor present.
PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH GRADE.

COMMENT

The prostate gland contains two foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, one in the peripheral zone and one in the transition zone. The
dominant tumor focus is located in the right lateral, right posterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior and left posterior peripheral
zone. This tumor focus measures 2.0 x 2.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension. and it is present in two cross sections and
extensively in the apex and base regions. This tumor focus exhibits extraprostatic extension in the right superior neurovascular
bundle region and right bladder neck region. Extraprostatic extension is present in three sections

and the added length of extraprostatlc extension is 9.5 mm. The margins of resection are free of tumor. The second tumor focus
is located in the right and left transition zone. This tumor focus measures 3.0 x 1.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension,

and it is present in two cross sections and extensively in the apical region. This tumor focus is conﬁned to the prostate. All
margins of resection are free of tumor.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(C) POSTERIOR BLADDER NECK — A portion of tan-gray tissue (1.1 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm). Submitted in toto in C.
(D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESlCLES — A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (5.2 x 2.6 x 3.2 cm. 35 grams. post-ﬁxation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
right posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than atong the left side. A nodule is palpated on the right side of
the prostate. Serial cross sections after ﬁxation demonstrate a ﬁrm area consistent with tumor in the right posterolateral peripheral
zone of the two cross sections of the prostate.

Spec1men Date! Tlme:

The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

SECTION CODE: D1—D4, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; D5-D7,
left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; D8, D9, prostatic base, right border; D10, D11,
prostatic base, right posterior border; D12-D15, prostatic base, central portion; D16, D17, prostatic base, left border; 018-020,
prostatic base, left posterior border; 021-023, apex anterior; D24, apex left; D25, D26, apex posterior; D27, D28, apex right; 029,
detached portions of margin of resection according to the specimen radiograph; D30-D37, sections of the two cross sections of the
prostate according to the specimen radiograph.

The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in
black.

Orange ink (D30) indicates surfaces that do not represent the true margin of resection. Multiple blocks ( D30, 31, 36 and

37) submitted for decalciﬁcation.
