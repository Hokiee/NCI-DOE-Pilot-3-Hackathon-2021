Gross Description:

—
1) The specimen is received fresh, labeled ”Right kidney". It consists of a right radical nephrectomy with attached adipose
tissue weighing 704 gm and measuring 15.2 x 10.4 x 4.5 cm. Most of the adipse tissue is on one of the poles of the kidney and
measures 10.5 x 15.2 x 1.0 cm. The oposite pole is distorted by a mass. Sections through the kidney reveal a
well-circumscribed tumor measuring 9.4 x 8.4 cm. The center of the tumor has a yellow scar. The surrounding area has a
variegated took ranging from yellow to red to tan. The tumor is very fragite and focally cystic. The tumor approximates the pelvis
but does not seem to be extending into the ureter,.the renal vein, or; the artery. The tumor is very hemorrhagic and is limited by
the renal capsule and does not extend into the overlying adipose tissue. No adrenal gland is identiﬁed. Portions of the specimen
has been photographed and a portion has been submitted for TPS. Representative section is submitted.

Summary of Sections:
HM - hilar margin
RSFT - renai sinus fat with tumor

RPT — renal parenchymal tumor
AKT - adjacent kidney with tumor
T - tumor

NKE - normal kidney

UM .. ureteral margin

2) The specimen is received in formalin. labeled "Paracavat nodes". it consists of twa irregular pieces of adipose tissue
measuring 3.5 x 2.9 x 0.9 cm and 3.6 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm. Ali the identiﬁed lymph nodes are submitted along with the remaining

adipose tissue.
Summary of Sections:

LN — lymph nodes
ADP - adipose tissue

3) The specimen is received in formalin. tabeled "Right adrenal". It consists of a focally disrupted adrenal gland with

overlying adipose tissue measuring "3.1 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm. The cut section shows hemorrhagic and otherwise appears unremarkable.
