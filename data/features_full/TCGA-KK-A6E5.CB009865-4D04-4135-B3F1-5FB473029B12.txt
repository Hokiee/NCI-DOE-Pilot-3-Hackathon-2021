DIAGNOSIS

(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 7 (4+3) WITH TERTIARY GLEASON GRADE 5
COMPONENT.
TUMOR INVADING RIGHT SEMINAL VESICLE AND PERIVESICULAR SOFT TISSUE.
MARGINS OF RESECTION ARE FREE OF TUMOR.
PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH GRADE.
Left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens, no tumor present.

COMMENT

The prostate gland contains four separate foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, two in the peripheral zone and two in the transition
zone. The dominant tumor focus is located in the right lateral, right posterolateral and right posterior peripheral zone. This tumor
focus measures 2.0 x 1.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in two cross sections and extensively in the
apex and base regions. This tumor focus invades the right seminal vesicle, including intra and extraprostatic portions, and focally
perivesicular soft tissue. The margins of resection are free of tumor. The second tumor focus is located in the left lateral, left
posterolateral and left posterior peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 1.5 x 0.4 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension
and it is present in two cross sections and focally in the apex and base regions. The third tumor focus is located in the right
transition zone. This tumor focus measures 1.0 x 1.0 cm in the largest cross section dimension and it is present in two cross
sections, extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. The fourth tumor focus is located in the left transition zone. This
tumor focus measures 0.1 x less than 0.1 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the ﬁrst cross section of
the prostate. The non-dominant tumor foci are lower histologic grade and confined to the prostate with negative margins.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and attached segments of right
and left deferentia.

The prostate gland (4.7 x 3.3 x 4.0 cm, 33.0 gm, postfixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the right
posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the left side. Nodules are palpated on the right side of the
prostate and left mid region. Serial cross sections after ﬁxation demonstrate a ﬁrm area consistent with tumor in the right
peripheral zone of the two cross sections of the prostate.

The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

SECTION CODE: C1, CZ, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C3, C4,
left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; CS, prostatic base right border; C6-C10,

black. Orange ink (036) denotes surfaces that do not

represent the true margin of resection.
