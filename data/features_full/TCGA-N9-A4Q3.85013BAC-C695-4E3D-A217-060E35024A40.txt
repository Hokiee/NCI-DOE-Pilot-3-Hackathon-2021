COMMENT

The tumor arises in association with endometrial polyp. It consists mainl of carcinomatous component (serous carcinoma and
endometrioid carcinoma with papillary features) and a minor (20%) sarcomatous component. which is a high-grade unclassiﬁed
sarcoma without heterologous elements,

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) SEGMENT UTERINE ARTERY - A segment of vascular tissue measuring 1.1 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter and
specimen is sectioned and reveal no lesion grossly seen. A cross section and longitudinal section of the specimen is submitted in
A.

(B) UTERUS, FALLOPIAN TUBES AND OVARIES - An 8.5 x 6.0 x 4.5 cm uterus with attached unremarkable ovaries (left; 20 x

    

0.61 x 0.4 cm, right; 1.7 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm). An unremarkable fallopian tube (left 6.7 cm in length with a diameter of 0.5 cm, right; 6.5
cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter.

The specimen is Opened at 3 and 9 o'clock direction. Located within the fundus is a 5.5 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm soft, friable,
polypoid mass that involves the anterior wall. Tumor does not invade the myometrium. Tumor does not extend into the lower
uterine segment of cervix. The adjacent normal endometrium has a maximum thickness of 0.1 cm. The myometrium has two
intramural white firm and whorled nodules from 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm tO 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm.

SECTION CODE: B1, cervix at 12 o'clock; 82, cervix — 6 o'clock; B3-BQ, representative sections of the tumor; B10, tumor
with anterior wall; B11, anterior full thickness of the uterus; B12, posterior full thickness of the uterus; B13, two nodules
representative sections; B14, left ovary bisected and entirely submitted; B15, left fallopian tube, representative section; B16, right
ovary bisected and entirely submitted; B17, right fallopian, representative section. A portion of tumor and normal tissue is
submitted for tumor bank.

*FS/DX: POLYPOID MASS WITHOUT GROSS EVIDENCE OF DEEP INVASION.

(C) LEFT PELVIC NODE — Multiple fragments of yellow—pink adipose tissue measuring 9.0 x 7.0 x 1.0 cm in aggregate. Multiple
lymph nodes identified with the largest measuring 5.0 x 2.5 x 0.8 cm. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows.

SECTION CODE: C1, four possible lymph nodes; C2, three possible lymph node; 03-06, one lymph node bisected in eac
block; C7—C12, one lymph node (largest) serially sectioned.

(D) LEFT COMMON ILIAC SENTINEL LYMPH NODE, COUNT 514 — One piece of pink soft tissue (5.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm, one
possible lvmoh node identiﬁed measuring 5.0 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm in greatest dimension, serially sectioned and entirely submitted in
D1-DS.

(E) LEFT COMMON LYMPH NODE - One piece of pink soft tissue (2.5 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm). One possible lymph node identified
measuring 1.4 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm and is bisected and entirely submitted in E.

(F) RIGHT COMMON ILIAC LYMPH NODE — One piece of pink soft tissue (7.0 x 2.0 x 0.4 cm). One possible lymph node
identified measuring 3.3 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm and is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in F1 -F2.

(G) RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE - A fragment of yellow-pink soft tissue (5.0 x 5.0 x 1.0 cm in aggregate). Multiple lymph nodes
identified with the largest measuring 3.2 cm in greatest dimension and entirely submitted as follows.

SECTION CODE: G1-G4, one possible node bisected in each block; GS, 66. one possible node serially sectioned (large:
one); G7, GS, one possible lymph node serially sectioned; 69, one possible node.

(H) PARAAORTIC LYMPH NODE - A 3.2 x 2.7 x 0.4 cm portion Of ﬁbroadipose tissue. The tissue is dissected to reveal six
possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm - 2.7 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm.

SECTION CODE: H1, one possible lymph node; H2, one possible lymph node; H3, one possible lymph node bisected;
H4, one possible lymph node serially sectioned; H5. one possible lymph node serially sectioned; H6, one possible lymph node
serially sectioned. Entire specimen is submitted.

(l) OMENTAL BIOPSY - A 19.5 x 5.0 x 0.6 cm sheet of ﬁnely lobulated adipose tissue. The specimen is serially sectioned to
reveal cut surfaces composed Of unremarkable finely lobulated adipose tissue. A definite mass is not grossly identiﬁed.

SECTION CODE: l-l4, representative sections.

ADDENDUM

This modified report is being issued to report special studies/lHC/Molecular studies.

MOLECULAR RESULTS

Endometrial carcinoma, microsatellite instability testing:
Microsatellite-stable tumor (see technical report).

Intact (positive) nuclear expression Of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMSZ by immunohistochemistry.

TECHNICAL REPORT

DNA extracted from microdissected parafﬁn-embedded tumor (T) in sections from block BS and non-neoplastic tissue (N) from
block B16 was analyzed by a PCR-based method followed by capillary electrophoretic detection. A panel of seven microsatellite
markers recommended by the NCI (BAT25, BAT26, BAT40, D28123, 058346, 0178250 and TGFBRZ) was evaluated to detect
changes in the number of microsatellite repeats in tumor as compared to normal tissue. NO allelic shift was detected in the tested
microsatellite markers.

Immunohistochemistry for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PM82 was performed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of
the endometrial carcinoma.

”This test was developed and its performance determined by en
cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used fo
clinical purposes.

COMMENT

Microscopic examination of H&E stained deeper sections Of the sentinel lymph node (left common iliac lymph node, D)
demonstrates no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. Pancytokeratin immunohistochemistry was also performed for the sentinel
lymph node. These sections demonstrate no evidence of metastatic carcinoma.

The original diagnosis remains unchanged.
