Gross Description:

A.

Received in forrnalln is a yellow ovoid tissue weighing 74 grams and measuring 9 x 5 x 6 cm. The specimen ls oriented
with one short suture-superior margin and double black sutures-lateral margin. At the anterior aspect. there is an ellipse of
white skin. 4 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm. Margins inked as follows: superior margin in blue. Inferior margin in green. lateral margin in
orange. medial margin in red. anterior margin in yellow and posterior margin in black. On multiple cross sections. there is
an ill-defined ﬂrm tumoral mass with focally hemorrhagic areas measuring 2.2 x 2 x 2 cm. present at less than 0.1 cm from
deep margin (closest margin) and 0.5 cm from anterior margin. 2 cm from superior and inferior margins. The rest of the
breast presents a white fibrotic breast tissue, the stroma to fat ratio is approximately 30-70%. Representative sections are
submitted in twelve cassettes as follows:

1 Superior margin

2 interior margin

3 Lateral margin

4 Medial margin

5 Anterior margin (skin)

Received fresh are two lymph nodes measuring from 1 cm to 4 x 1 x 0.8 cm. Submitted in toto in three cassettes for
frozen section as follows:

1 Small lymph node

2&3 Large lymph node

Received fresh Is a possible lymph node. 1.5 x 1 x 0.6 cm. Submitted in toto In one cassette for frozen section

Received in formalin are two yellow. pale tan tissue fragments. the smaller one is 1.2 x 1 x 0.2 cm and the bigger one is
1.5 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm. Submitted in toto in two cassettes as follows:

1 Smaller tissue

2 Bigger tissue. bisected. submitted in toto

Received is a yellow fibroadlpose tissue segment. 11 x 9 x 2 cm. There are twelve possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.5

to 1.8 cm in greatest dimension. They are bisected. Representative sections are submitted in twelve cassettes as follows:
