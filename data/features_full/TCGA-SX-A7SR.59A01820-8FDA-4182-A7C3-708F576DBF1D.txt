, Surgical Pathology Report
REVISED REPORT
Clinic Number: Name:
DIAGNOSIS:
AMENDED REPORT :

The tumor grade was incorrectly given in the synoptic portion
of the final diagnosis. The correct Fuhrman nuclear grade is grade
3, as stated in the summary paragraph for part B, at the beginning
of the final diagnosis section.

AMENDED FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

A. Lower pole cyst, right kidney, excision: Benign fibrous-walled
cyst lined by flattened tubular epithelium, with associated smooth
muscle and renal cortical elements present, consistent with simple
renal cyst. Additional findings include the presence of multiple (at
least 3) tubulopapillary adenomas, each measuring less than 2 mm. No
evidence of malignancy detected.

B. Mass, upper pole, right kidney, right partial nephrectomy:
Papillary renal cell carcinoma, Fuhrman nuclear grade 3, forming a
partly cystic and necrotic mass that measures approximately 10 cm in
diameter. There is extensive necrosis and hemorrhage, with numerous
foamy macrophages present. The morphologithistologic pattern is
predominantly type 2, although a minor component of type 1 is
identified. The renal parenchymal margin of resection is negative
for tumor. See synoptic report, below:

Procedure/laterality: Partial nephrectomy, right.

Histologic type: Papillary renal cell carcinoma.

Nuclear grade (Fuhrman, 1—4): 3.

Tumor size: 10 cm.

Tumor site: Upper pole, right kidney.

Tumor focality: N/A.

Sarcomatoid features: Not identified.

Tumor necrosis: Present.

Macroscopic extent of tumor: Tumor limited to kidney.
Microscopic tumor extension: Tumor limited to kidney.
Surgical margins: Negative.

Lymph—vascular invasion: Not identified.

Lymph nodes: N/A.

Pathologic findings in nonneoplastic kidney: N/A.

Pathologic staging (AJCC 2010): pT2a.

Biorepository sample: Mirror image section of tissue sent for
biobanking is positive for involvement by papillary renal cell

carcinoma (95%). A separate smaller piece of nonneoplastic kidney
is negative for involvement by tumor.

Block(s) containing malignancy suitable for additional testing:
Blocks B3, B4, BB, and B9.

CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Right renal mass.

SPECIMEN(S):
AzRight kidney lower pole cyst
B:Upper pole right renal mass

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

Performed by Pathologist's Assistant

A. Received fresh labeled and "right kidney

lower pole cyst" is an irregular portion of fibromembranous and
fatty tissue with no discrete solid area. The specimen is 4 x 2 x
0.8 cm. Entirely submitted in three cassettes labeled
Al-AB.

B. Received fresh labeled and "right upper pole

renal mass" is a roughly spherical mass of gray-brown tissue covered
on surface by soft, lobulated fat. The opposite surface has grossly
evident renal parenchyma. The specimen is 803 g and 10 x 9 x 8.5 cm.
The grossly evident renal parenchymal margin is inked black. The cut
surface demonstrates a dominant central cavity filled with thick,
red-brown fluid and necrotic debris. The wall of the structure
ranges from 0.3 cm to 1.5 cm in thickness. The thicker areas have
associated solid, mottled yellow and tan areas. The inked
parenchymal surgical margin ranges from 0.2 cm to 1.5 cm from the
mass. There is no gross extension of the mass through the renal
capsule. Adrenal gland is not identified. Sampled in ten cassettes
labeled Bl—BlO. Bl-BZ) Parenchymal surgical margin
samples; B3-B9) additional samples of mass; B10) mirror image of
biorepository samples (normal kidney and apparent tumor),

Support for the diagnosis in this case may have included the
use of immunohistochemistry tests that were developed and whose
performance characteristics were determined by '

They have not been Cleared
or approved by the 0.5. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not
necessary. These tests should not be regarded as investigational
or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (‘CLIA') as qualified
to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.
