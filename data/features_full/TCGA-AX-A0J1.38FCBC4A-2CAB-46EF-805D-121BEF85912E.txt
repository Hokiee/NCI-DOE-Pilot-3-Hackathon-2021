Intraoperative Consultation:

An intraoperative non~microscopic consultation was Obtained and interpreted as:
"called to ﬂick—u an 82 gram, 7 x 4.2 x 3.5 cm uterus with bilateral tubes and
ovaries. T e rig t ovary measures 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm. The right fallopian tube
measures 4 x 0.5 cm. The left ovary measures 2 x 1 x 0.7 cm. and the left
fallopian tube measures 4 x 0.7 cm. The uterus is opened to show a large
polypOid mass measuring 4 x 3.3 x 2 cm that replaces the endometrial caVity,
ocated 1 cm from the cerv1cal canal. The mass appears to involve the lower
uterine segment. Tissue was taken for and Tumor Bank. The remainder for

_., . _ rhe first container is labeled "cervix. uterus, tubes and
ovaries." It contains a single 82 gram specimen consisting of uterus, bilateral
tubes and ovaries, and cervix. The uterus measures 7 cm from superior to .
inferior, 4.2 cm from medial to lateral, and 3.5 cm from anterior to posterior.
The uterine surface is tanTpink and smooth with two round, smooth, raised .
putative leiomﬁomas measuring 2.2 and 1.7 cm in diameter. The cerVix measures
2.2 x 2 cm wit a slit—like os measuring 0.4 cm. No cervical leSions are
identified. The uterus has been previousl opened to show an endocervical canal
measuring approximately 2.5 x 0.4 cm. Within and extending the 4.0 x 3.3 x 2.5
cm myometria cavity is a tan, polypoid mass measuring 4 x 3.3 x 2 cm. The mass
extends inferiorly along the endometrial canal to involve the lower uterine
segment grossly. The cervix does not appear to be involved. The uterus has
been previously sectioned to show the mass extending approximately 0.6 cm into
the 1.8 cm thick myometrium.

The left ovary has a smooth. homo enous surface and measures 2 x 1 x 0.7 cm.

The ovary is sectioned to Show a argely heterogenous white—yellow cut Surface.
No focal lesions are identified. The left fallopian tube measures 4 x 0.7 cm
and is unremarkable. The right ovary has a smooth, shiny surface and measures 2
x 1 x 0.5 cm. The ovary is serially sectioned to show a homogenous white-yellow
cut surface. The right tube measures 2 x 4 x 0.5 cm. -

Labeled A1 - left ovary; A2 - putative left tube (no definitive tube
identified); A3 - right ovary; A4 - right putative tube (no definitive tube
identified); AS and A6 — uterine fibrOids; A7 and A8 - posterior endometrial

PRIMARY TUMOR (TNM category/FIGO Stage)
Tumor invades less than one-half of the myometrium (le/IB)

STAGE GROUPING . .
The overall pathologic AJCC stage of the tumor is Tla/NO/Mx

The pathologic stage assigned here should be regarded as provisional, and may
change after integration of clinical data not provided With this speCimen.

The performance characteristics of some immunohistochemical stains, fluorescence
in-situ hybridization tests and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry Cited in
rhic rennrf (if anv) were determined by the Surgica Pathology Department at
part of an on oing quality assurance program and in
compliance with federally mandated regu ations drawn from the C inical
Laboratory Improvement Act of 1988 (CLIA '88). Some Of these tests rely on the
use of "analyte specific reagents" and are subject to specific labeling
requirem nts by t e US Food and Drug Administration. Such diagnostic tests may
only be performed in a facility that is certified by the Department of Health
and Human Services as a high complexity laboratory under CLIA '88. The FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used
for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investi ational or for
research. Nevertheless, federal rules concerning the medica use of analyte
specific reagents require that the following disclaimer be attached to the

report: _ _

This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by
the Surgical Pathology Department of It has not been
cleared or approved y the U. 5. Food and Drug AdminiStration.
