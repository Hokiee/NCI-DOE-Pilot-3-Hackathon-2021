Some of the immunohistochemistry and lSH tests were developed and their performance characteristics were determined by the
Department of Pathology. They have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They shouid not be
regarded as investigations! or for research. This laboratory is certiﬁed under the Clinical Laboratory improvement Amendments of
1988 (CLlA ’88) as qualiﬁed to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS lS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL}. AND THAT I HAVE
REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT.

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Gross Dgscrigtion:

llThe specimen 'is received fresh, labeled "Prostate and seminal vesicles”.

it consists of a prostate and seminal vesicles.

The total weight is 58.5 grams.

The prostate measures 4.3cm from apex to base, 5.0cm transversely,

and 3.7cm from anterior to posterior.

The right and left seminal vesicles measure 3.5 x 1.3 and 4.0 x 1.5 cm, respectively.
The external surface of the prostate is smooth.

The prostate is inked (righl=green. left=blue) and ﬁxed in formalin overnight.

The prostate is serially cut from apex to base at approximately 3-4 mm intervals.
The prostate is entirely submitted.

Summary of Sections:

RA—right apical margin

LA-left apical margin

BN-bladder neck margin

RSV-right seminal vesicle

LSV~left seminal vesicle

A-H -serial sections of prostate (apex to base)

2).The specimen is received in formalin labeled. "prostate left base “, and consists of a 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm tan-pink piece of soft
tissue . The specimen is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U» undeslgnated

3).The specimen is received in formalin labeled. "periprostatic fat", and consists of multiple pieces of adipose tissue measuring 3.0
x 2.0x 0.5 cm in aggregate. There is a 0.3 x 0.2 cm firm calciﬁed nodule identiﬁed. The specimen is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U-- undesignated
CN-calcitied nodule

4).The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "right hypogastric lymph nodes", and consists of two firm lymph nodes. The largest

measures 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and the second lymph node 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm in greatest dimension. All identiﬁed lymph nodes are
submitted.

Summary of sections:
BLN - bisected largest lymph node
LN — lymph node

5).The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes", and consists of 7x 6 x3 cm fatty tissue. Five pink tan
firm lymph nodes ranging from one to four cm in greatest dimension. Ail identified lymph nodes are submitted.

Summary of sections:
SSLl— serially sectioned iymph node #1
SSL2-- serially sectioned lymph node #2
SSL -- serially sectioned lymph node #3
LN--two lymph nodes
