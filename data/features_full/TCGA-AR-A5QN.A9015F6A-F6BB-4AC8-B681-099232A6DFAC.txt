A Lymph nodes, left tracheoesophageal groove, excision: Multiple (3) lymph nodes are
negative for tumor.

0501‘?

B. Thyroid, left, total lobectomy: Follicular adenoma (3.3 x 3.2 x 1.8 cm).

C. Breast, right, simple mastectomy: Fibroadenoma measuring 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm at the previous
biopsy site in the upper outer quadrant. Remainder shows non-proliferative ﬁbrocystic changes.
Multiple (2) right axillary lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

D. Breast, leﬁ, inferior flap, biopsy: Negative for tumor.
E. Breast, left, inferior margin at 6 o'clock, excision: Involved by carcinoma.
F. Breast, left, new inferior margin, re—excision: Negative for tumor.

G. Breast, left, modiﬁed radical mastectomy: Invasive lobular carcinoma, Nottingham grade II
(of III), [tubules 3/3, nuclei 2/3, mitoses 1/3; Nottingham score 6/9], forming multiple (6) masses
(lower inner quadrant, 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm and 1.4 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm; inferior/central, 3.2 x 2.2 x 1.4
cm; central, 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm; lower outer quadrant, 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm and 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm)
in the left breast. Ductal carcinoma in situ and lobular carcinoma in situ are present. The non—
neoplastic breast parenchyma shows nonproliferative ﬁbrocystic changes. A second core biopsy
site is present in the upper outer quadrant which shows biopsy site changes. The tumor does not
involve the nipple, overlying skin, or underlying chest wall. Dermal nevus forming a 1.5 x 1.3 x
0.3 cm raised, brown, pigmented lesion on the lateral aspect of the skin. All surgical resection
margins, after multiple (2) re—excisions of the inferior margin (see parts E and F), are negative for
invasive carcinoma by 1.2 cm, deep margin. Multiple (10 of 19) left axillary lymph nodes are
positive for metastatic carcinoma. The largest metastasis measures 11.0 mm. Extranodal
extension is not present.

MIB-l has been ordered on parafﬁn-embedded tissue.

This ﬁnal pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section
histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are
reviewed to conﬁrm these ﬁndings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section
review will be reﬂected in a revised report.
