HISTORY: -

‘J male with bladder tumor.
GROSS:
Two specimens are received in formalin each pr0perly labeled and
identified.

A. The first specimen is designated "bladder tumor, anterior wall and

dome". It consists of multiple pieces of fibroelastic tissue measuring
4.5 cm x 4.5 cm x 1.5 cm in aggregate. It is entirely submitted in
Al-AS.

B. The second specimen is designated "left renal pelvis biopsy“. It

Consists of one piece of tissue measuring 0.1 cm. It is entirely
submitted in Bl.

MICROSCOPIC:

A — The bladder resection contains extensive exophytic and invasive
high grade papillary urothelial carcinoma infiltrating in nests and
cords with areas of clear cell morphology. Invasion into muscularis
propria is identified. Areas of necrosis and calcification are also
seen. Lymphovascular invasion is difficult to evaluate due to
extensive cautery artifact and the presence of cleft—like spaces around
some tumor nests, but no definite lymphovascular invasion is seen. No
perineural invasion is seen.

B — The left renal pelvis biopsy consists of a small fragment of
papillary urothelium with enlarged nuclei and rare mitotic figures.

The pleomorphism is less marked than in the bladder specimen and there
is a lower nucleus to cytoplasm ratio. No lamina propria is present to
allow for evaluation of invasion.
