Gross Description

Specimens A through F are received. each is labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.

Specimen A is received fresh for intraoperative consultation and further labeled "11L lymph node" and consists of a lymph node
measuring 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm along with multiple fragments of soft tissue measuring 2.0 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm in aggregate. The soft

tissue fragments are submitted for frozen section in "A1FS." The lymph node is bisected and submitted for frozen section in
cassette "A2FS."

Specimen B is received fresh for intraoperative consultation and further labeled “#7 lymph node" and consists of one lymph node
measuring 2.7 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm. The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted for frozen section in cassette "B1FS." (Dictated

Specimen C is received fresh for intraoperative consultation and further labeled "anterior 11L lymph node" and consists of

multiple fragmented lymph nodes measuring 2.7 x 2.0 x 0.4 cm in aggregate. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen
section in cassette "C1FS."

Specimen D is received fresh for intraoperative consultation and further labeled "left lower lobe“ and consists of a lobe of lung
weighing (ﬁxed weight) 258.3 grams and measuring 18.0 x 13.2 x 4.9 cm. The pleura ls red-purple to pink. and wrinkled with

moderate carbonaceous pigmentation. There is a staple line measuring 5.1 cm. just above the hilum. The pleura about the hilum
is tagged. There is a ﬁrm palpable mass with overlying retracted pleura measuring 7.2 x 6.2 x 4.2 cm. The mass is 1.5 cm from
the bronchial margin. The mass upon sectioning has a ﬁrm gritty cut surface with areas of necrosis and black pigmentation. The
mass abuts. and possibly involves aimay, more distal. The mass is 2.2 cm from the stapled margin. The uninvolved
parenchyma is red-pink, soft and hemorrhagic, with diffuse mild carbonaceous pigmentation. A small slightly elevated
subpleural nodule is identiﬁed along the distal medial aspect measuring 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. . Three peribronchial lymph nodes
are identiﬁed measuring up to 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm. The staple line is removed and the parenchymal margin is inked green. The
pleural overlying the mass is inked blue. Representative sections are submitted for frozen and permanent sections as stated
below in the block summary.

Specimen E is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and "#6 lymph node" and consists of
a black lymph node with attached soft tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is sectioned and entirely submitted in
cassette "El
