Diagnosis

This concerns a right hemicolectomy preparation with a tubulovillous adenoma in the
cecum, with mild dysplasia of the cylindrical epithelium, with peritumorous, chronic
recidivated concomitant inﬂammation with acute inﬂammatory activity. There is a second
tubulovillous colon mucus adenoma in the colon ascendens with mild dysplasia of the
cylindrical epithelium and reactive concomitant inﬂammation, with tubular adenomas in
the area of this second one, with a mucinous carcinoma (corresponding to a mucus-forming
adenocarcinoma), with moderate to slight differentiation — corresponding to
histopathological differentiation grade 2-3, with tubulovillous adenoma sections on the
surface, with tumor infiltration of the colon wall layers to the tunica muscularis, with
peritumorous chronic recidivated concomitant inﬂammation, with moderate chronic
lymphandenitis of the tumor-free local lymph nodes (0/13) and with tumor-free overview
slices from all other preparation sections described.

According to the preparation sections at hand, the spreading of the mucinous carcinoma in
the colon transversum corresponds to a tumor stage of pT2, pNO, MX, R0.
