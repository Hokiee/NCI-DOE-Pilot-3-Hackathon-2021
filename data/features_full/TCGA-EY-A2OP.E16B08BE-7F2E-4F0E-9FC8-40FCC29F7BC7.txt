Gross Description:
Received are five appropriately labeled containers.

Container A is additionally labeled "right periaortic" and is
received in formalin. The specimen consists of two fragments of
yellow/tan fibroadipose tissue that measure 4.5 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm.
Within fibroadipose tissue, four lymph node candidates are
identified that range in size from 0.7 up to 1.5 cm in

greatest dimension.

Block Summary:

A1 - Two lymph node candidates

A2 — One lymph node candidate

A3 — One lymph node candidate, NTR

Container B is additionally labeled "left periaortic" and is

received in formalin. The specimen consists of a single fragment
of yellow/tan fibroadipose tissue that measures 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.9
cm. Within fibroadipose tissue two lymph node candidates are
identified. These range in size from 0.5 up to 1.3 cm in
greatest dimension.

Block Summary:
Bl — One lymph node candidate
BZ - One lymph node candidate, bisected, NTR.

Container C is additionally labeled "right pelvic" and is
received in formalin. The specimen consists of a single fragment
of yellow/tan fibroadipose tissue that measures 5.0 x 4.5 x 1.2
cm. Fourteen lymph node candidates are identified within
fibroadipose tissue and range in size from 0.4 up to 4.5 cm in
greatest dimension. The largest lymph node measures 4.5 x 2.3 x
0.7 cm.

Block Summary:

Cl — Six lymph node candidates

C2 - Five lymph node candidates

C3 — One lymph node candidate, bisected

C4 — One lymph node candidate, bisected

C5-C7 — Largest lymph node candidate, sectioned
C8 — Remaining fibroadipose tissue, NTR

Container D is additionally labeled "left pelvic" and is
received in formalin. The specimen consist of single fragment of
yellow/tan fibroadipose tissue that measures 4.0x 3.5 x 0.8 cm.
Three lymph node candidates are identified within the specimen
and range in size from 0.7 up to 3 cm in greatest dimension. The
largest lymph node candidate measures 3.2 x 2.2 x 0.6 cm.

Block Summary:

01 ~ Two lymph node candidates

D2—D3 — Largest lymph node candidate, sectioned
D4 - Remaining fibroadipose tissue, NTR

Procedures/Addenda:
Addendum

Addendum

The following addendum is issued to report the results of
estrogen and progesterone receptor and p63 immunohistochemical
studies.

Results:

Estrogen receptor (Ventana, clone SP1):

Interpretation: Approximately'60—70% of tumor cells show
moderate (2+/3) nuclear immunoreactivity.

Progesterone receptor (Ventana, clone 1E2):
Interpretation: Approximately 5% of tumor cells show moderate
(2+/3) nuclear immunoreactivity.

p63: Tumor is negative (with a postive control slide).

Site: Endometrium

Performed on block: E10

Fixation: 10% neutral buffered formalin
Fixation time: Not specified.

Comment:

The lack of p63 staining in the confluent areas of tumor growth
supports interpretation as adenocarcinoma with extensive solid
pattern growth and supports classification as grade 3
endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
