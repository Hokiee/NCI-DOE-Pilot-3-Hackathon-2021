Histologically, the tumor with an alveolar architecture composed with zellballen. These
zellballen are separated by thin layers of connective tissue. Tumor cells have a relatively
broad eosinophil to basophil granular cytoplasm. The nuclei are large and pleomorph with
coarse chromatin. Often very large cells with bizarre and strongly enlarged nuclei are found.
Single mitoses (1/30 HPF) are visible, one atypic mitosis was found. No evidence for
necrosis, vessel invasion, capsule destruction or invasion into adjacent adipose tissue. With
PAS staining, the total score sums up to 3
