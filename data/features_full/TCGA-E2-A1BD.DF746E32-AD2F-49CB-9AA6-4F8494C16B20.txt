B. WLE RIGHT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. SENTINEL NODE 1 RIGHT AXILLA
Received fresh is a tan pink lymph node 1.8 x 1.1 x 0.5cm. The specimen is serially sectioned and three
touch preps are taken. Toto A1.
B. WLE RIGHT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "WLE right breast needle localization" is an
oriented 989, 8 x 4.5 x 4cm needle localized lumpectomy with radiograph. lnk code: anterior-yellow,
posterior-black. superior-blue, inferior-orange. medial-green, lateral-red. Specimen is serially sectioned
from superior to inferior into 11 slices revealing a tan while firm stellate mass 2.3 x 1.8 x 1.7cm, 0.4cm
from the closest medial margin and 0.5cm from the anterior margin in slices 8—10. A portion of the
specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representatively submitted:
81: superior margin slice 1
B2: slice 2
83-84: slice 3
35-37: slice 4
