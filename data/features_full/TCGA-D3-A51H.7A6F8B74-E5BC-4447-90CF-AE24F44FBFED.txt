GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) RIGHT AXILLARY CONTENTS, LEVEL 1, 2 AND 3 WITH OVERLYING INVOLVED ULCERATED SKIN AND PORTION OF
PECTORALIS MAJOR AND LATISSIMUS DORSI MUSCLE - The specimen measures 16.5 x 9.0 x 7.0 cm soft tissue covered by
an ellipse of skin (11.0 x 7.2 cm). The skin is remarkable for hyperpigmented ulcer (3.2 x 2.5 cm) located 1.1 cm from the closest
skin margin. The specimen is dissected to reveal twenty three lymph nodes ranging from 1.0 to 5.5 cm with one large matted
lymph node (6.0 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm). Representative sections submitted in twenty-eight cassettes as follows.

SECTION CODE: A1-A4, four ends of the skin ellipse, the margin inked blue and submitted ink side up; A5, A6.
representative sections from the hyperpigmented area of the skin with ulceration; A7, four lymph nodes; A8-A18, one lymph node
bisected in each cassette; A19-A26, representative sections from the large lymph nodes (all lymph nodes are grossly positive. one
lymph node in each cassette); A27, A28, four representative sections from the matted lymph node.

Representative sections from the lymph nodes are submitted for tissue bank.

(B) SUPERIOR ASPECT AXILLARY SKIN — A triangular shave of skin measuring 6.7 x 3.0 cm and excised to a depth of 0.4 cm.
The skin is grossly unremarkable. The peripheral margin and the deep margin is inked blue. Representative sections are
submitted in three cassettes as follows.

SECTION CODE: B1, 32, true side margin, shaved and submitted entirely, ink side up; B3, two representative sections
from the skin with deep margin; and side not true margin.

(C) ADDITIONAL INFERIOR AXILLARY SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE - A triangular shape of skin (13.0 x 4.5 cm and
excised to a depth of 2.0 cm). Also received with the specimen is a piece of adipose tissue (3.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm). The adipose
tissue is dissected to reveal four lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 cm to 1.6 cm. The lymph nodes are submitted entirely in three
cassettes.

INK CODE: The triangular shape of skin is inked as follows: true and the deep margin - blue.

SECTION CODE: C1, two lymph nodes; 02, C3, one lymph node bisected in each cassette; representative sections from
the triangular shape are submitted in cassette 04-09 as follows: C4, tip, ink side up; CS-CB, true margin, shaved, ink side up, true
margin shaved ink side up; C9, two representative sections of the deep margin.
