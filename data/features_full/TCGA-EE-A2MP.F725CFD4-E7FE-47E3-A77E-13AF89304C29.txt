MICROSCOPIC REPORT

 

"LEFT INGUINAL LYMPH NODE SUPERIOR".

A total of 19 lymph nodes were retrieved, including one tumour nodule assumed to represent complete
replacement of a lymph node by metastatic melanoma. This is characterised by pleomorphic epithelioid cells
with large, oval nuclei, prominent nucleoli and inconspicuous amphophilic cytoplasm. Numemus mitoses
are seen and there are areas of necrosis. The tumour cells show strong nuclear and cytoplasmic
immunohistochemical staining for 8100, and are also Melan A and HMB45 positive (with focal strong
staining for HMB45) (1/19).

SUMMARY
Left inguinal lymph nodes — METASTATIC MELANOMA IN 1 OF 19 LYMPH NODES (1/19).
