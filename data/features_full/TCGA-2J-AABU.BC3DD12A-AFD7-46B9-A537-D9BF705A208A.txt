V C)
DIAGNOSIS: 97‘ J 5/6” 9'
A. Lymph nodes, common hepatic artery, biopsy: Multiple (3) lymph
nodes are negative for tumor.

B. Pancreas, neck margin, excision: Low-grade pancreatic
intraepithelial neoplasia (PanTN) is present. Negative for
malignancy.

C. Common hepatic duct, margin, excision: Negative for tumor.

D. Lymph node, hepatic hilar, biopsy: A single (1) lymph node is
negative for tumor.

E. Head of pancreas, duodenum, portion of j ejunum and gallbladder,
common bile duct, Whipple resection: Invasive grade 3 (of 4) duetal
adenocarcinoma, is identiﬁed forming a solid mass (3.3 x 3.2 x 2.6
cm) located in the pancreatic head. The tumor extends beyond the
pancreas involving the peripancreatic soft tissue and duodenal
submucosa. Gallbladder shows mild chronic cholecystitis.
Angiolymphatic invasion is present. Perineural invasion is present.
Tumor necrosis is absent. All surgical resection margins are
negative for tumor (minimum free margin, 1.2 cm, uncinate margin).
Carcinoma in situ (low-grade PanIN) is present at the pancreatic
margin. The adjacent non-neoplastic pancreatic parenchyma contains
low-grade PanIN. Multiple (2 of 24) regional lymph nodes are
positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.

Frozen section histologic interpretation of common hepatic artery
lymph nodes performed by:

This ﬁnal pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic
examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the
specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are
reviewed to conﬁrm these ﬁndings. Any substantive changes
identiﬁed on permanent section review will be reﬂected in a
revised report.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received fresh labeled "common hepatic artery lymph nodes" is a

3.0 x 2.2 x 0.8 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. Lymph
nodes submitted. Grossed by

B. Received fresh labeled "pancreatic neck margin" is a 2.9 X 1.9 x
0.7 cm portion of pancreatic parenchyma with orientation. All

submitted. Grossed by

C. Received fresh labeled "common hepatic duct margin" is a 1.0 x
0.8 x 0.5 cm portion of tan-red tubular tissue with orientation.
Margin submitted. Grossed by

D. Received fresh labeled "hepatic hilar lymph nodes" is a 2.5 x 1.7

x 1.1 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. Lymph nodes
submitted. Grossed by

E. Received fresh labeled "head of pancreas, duodenum, portion
jejunum, common bile duct, gallbladder" is a Whipple specimen
consisting of 35.0 cm in length portion of duodenum, 6.1 x 4.2 x 4.0
cm portion of pancreas, 10.1 x 4.3 x 1.1 cm gallbladder. The
pancreatic uncinate margin is inked yellow and shaved, the portal
vein groove margin is inked black and submitted perpendicularly.
There is a 3.3 x 3.2 x 2.6 cm diffusely inﬁltrative mass within the
head of the pancreas, 1.2 cm from the uncinate margin. The mass
grossly extends into the small bowel wall over an area of 8.5 cm,
involving the ampulla, and into the surrounding soft tissue. A

stent is present within the main pancreatic duct. The gallbladder
contains no choleliths. Peripancreatic lymph nodes and periduodenal

lymph nodes are identified. Representative sections are submitted.
