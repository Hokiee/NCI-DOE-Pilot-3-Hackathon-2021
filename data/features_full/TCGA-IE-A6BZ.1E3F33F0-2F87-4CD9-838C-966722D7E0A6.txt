Gross Description:

Received in formalin, labeled "right buttock mass" is a

24 x 21 x 11 cm tan. lobulated irregular fibrofatty soft tissue with attached
suture designating proximal margin. The specimen is inked and step sectioned
revealing a 19 x 11 x 8 cm tan, soft lobulated heterogeneous well delineated,
focally hemorrhagic/necrotic (30%) mass, which abuts the nearest peripheral
margin, coming to within 0.9 cm from the distal margin and 2 cm from the
proximal margin. The remaining cut surface consists of tan, lobulated fat and
tan to red, homogeneous muscle.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:
1 proximal margin taken perpendicular;
2 mass to distal margin;
3-12 random mass (inked resection margin in cassettes 3-5).

Microscopic Description:

The final diagnosis of each specimen incorporates the microscopic examination
findings.
