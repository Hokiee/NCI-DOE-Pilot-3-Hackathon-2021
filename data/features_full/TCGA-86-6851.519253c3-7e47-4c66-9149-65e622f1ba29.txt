A. Labeled left upper lobe lesion.
Received fresh for intraoperative
consultation is a previously incised and
diffusely ragged wedge of lung
measuring 7 x 3 x 2.2 cm. There are 2
firm gray and brown lesion measuring
1.0 and 1.4 cm in greatest dimension.

B. Labeled left upper lobe bronchial
margin. Received fresh for

intraoperative consultation is a 150 g lobe
of lung measuring approximately

15 x 10 x 4 cm. the pleural surface is tan
to red and smooth to slightly

wrinkled with two staple lines adjacent to
the hilum measuring 3.8 and 13

cm in length. The larger passes through a
2.5 x 2.2 cm firm white-tan to

red mass that comes to within 2.0 cm of
the bronchial margin. Immediately
adjacent to the bronchial margin is a 1.5
cm gray-white lymph node grossly
positive for metastatic tumor. The
bronchial margin and adjacent lymph
node

are sampled for frozen section. The
background lung is tan to red and
spongy with no other nodules or masses
lesions. Another hilar lymph node is

not identified.

Sections show a
poorly differentiated
invasive
adenocarcinoma with
both

acinar and solid
growth patterns. The
tumor extends to the
subpleura.
lmmunohistochemical
stains are performed
with appropriate
control reactions

to confirm this
histologic impression.
The malignant cells
are positive for
cytokeratin 7, TTF-1,
Napsin-A while
negative for
cytokeratin 5/6. The
malignant cells show
rare focal positivity
for p63. An elastin
stain shows

no convincing
penetration of the
visceral pleural elastic
layer by the

tumor.

2. Histologic grade: Poorly
differentiated.

with extranodal extension into
peribronchial soft tissues.

7. Parenchymal margin: lnvolved
by carcinoma.

8. Vascular margins: Free of tumor.

10. Lymph nodes: One of two
peribronchial lymph nodes positive
for

metastatic tumor (1/2). One benign
para-aortic lymph node (0/1). Four
benign hilar lymph nodes (0/4).

11. Size of largest metastatic
deposit: 1.3 cm.
