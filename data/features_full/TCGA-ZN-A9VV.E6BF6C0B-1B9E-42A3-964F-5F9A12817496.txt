GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received fresh, in four parts, each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.

Part A, "rib", consists of two fragments of rib (1.9 x 1.9 x 0.7 cm and 14.5 x

1.5 x 1.3 cm). No gross lesions are appreciated. A sample of bone marrow from
each portion of rib is submitted.

Micro A1: Bone marrow from longer portion of rib, multi frags, Rss.
Micro A2: Bone marrow from shorter portion of rib, multi frags, RSS.

Part B, "port site #1", consists of a single fragment of tan/pink soft tissue
(5.1 x 2.7 x 2.6 cm) with attached skeletal muscle (4.7 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm). The
aspect of the specimen opposing the skeletal muscle is covered by a portion of
tan/pink glistening fibromembranous tissue. A firm, rubbery, tan/white nodule
(0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm) is present on the surface. The specimen is serially

sectioned to reveal a firm, tan/white, well—circumscribed nodule (3.5 x 2.4 x

1.9 cm), abutting but not invading into the skeletal muscle. Representative
sections are submitted.

Micro Bl—B2: Representative mass to skeletal muscle, 1 frag each, RSS.

Part C, "2R", consists of a single fragment of tan/pink/yellow soft tissue (3.3
x 1.4 x 0.9 cm), containing a single lymph node (1.1 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm), which is
bisected and submitted in its entirety.

Micro C1: 2R lymph node, 2 frags, ESS.

Part D, "diaphragm", consists of two fragments of unoriented tan/pink/red
skeletal muscle with attached fibroadipose tissue (1.1 x 0.7 x 0.6 and 2.5 x
1.3 x 0.6 cm), which are submitted in toto.

Micro 01: Diaphragm, 2 frags, ESS.

Part E, "level 7", consists of one fragment of tan/pink anthracotic soft tissue
(1.0 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm), which is submitted in toto.

Micro E1: Level 7 lymph node, 1 frag, ESS.

Part F, "level 8", consists of a single fragment of tan/pink/white soft tissue

(2.2 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm) with two lymph nodes (0.7 and 0.9 cm), which are submitted
in toto.

Micro Fl: Level 8 lymph nodes, 2 frags, ESS.

Part G, "pleura and diaphragm", consists of multiple irregular fragments of
tan/pink soft tissue consistent with pleura (24.5 x 14.5 x 2.8 cm in aggregate)
with attached skeletal muscle (12.5 x 11.2 x 2.1 cm in greatest dimension).
There are multiple nodular, friable, tan/white, rubbery nodules present
involving the pleura (ranging 0.1 cm to 14.2 cm, maximum thickness 2.8 cm).

The largest nodule is present on the apparent lateral portion of the specimen.

Rebels? Rem“, .

Sections through the nodules reveal multiple cystic spaces, focal papillary
projections, and areas of gelatinous, friable tumor with hemorrhage consistent

with necrosis. The tumor abuts but does not grossly invade through diaphragm.
Representative sections are submitted. '

Micro Gl—G7: Representative tumor nodules to skeletal muscle and pleura, 1—2
frags each, RSS.

Part H, "level 7 #2", consists of three fragments of tan/pink anthracotic soft
tissue (ranging 1.1 x 0.4 x 0.2 to 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm), which are submitted in

Micro H1: Level 7 node, 3 frags, ESS.

Part I, "4R", consists of a single fragment of tan/pink anthracotic soft tissue
(1.2 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm), which is submitted in

Micro 11: 4R node, 1 frag, ESS.

Part J, "port site 1 #2", consists of a tan/white skin ellipse (2.0 x 0.9 cm)
with underlying fibroadipose tissue (2.1 x 1.3 x 0.4 cm), which is submitted in

Micro J1: Port site #1 part 2, 1 frag, ESS.

Part K, "port site #2", consists of a tan/white skin ellipse with subcutis (2.3
x 0.9 x 0.5 cm) and a separate fragment of tan/red/yellow soft tissue (2.3 x

1.7 x 0.9 cm). A separate fragment of soft tissue is bisected. The entire
specimen is submitted.

Micro K1: Skin, 1 frag, Ess.
Micro K2: Soft tissue, bisected, 2 frags, ESS.

Part L, "RML wedge", consists of a severely disrupted pulmonary wedge resection
(5.7 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm) with a stapled resection margin (5.7 cm, blue). The
entire specimen is submitted.

Micro L1—L2: Right middle lobe, 2 frags each, ESS.

By his/her signature below, the senior physician certifies that he/she
personally conducted a microscopic examination ("gross only" exam if so stated)

of the described specimen(s) and rendered or confirmed the diagnosis(es)
related thereto.
