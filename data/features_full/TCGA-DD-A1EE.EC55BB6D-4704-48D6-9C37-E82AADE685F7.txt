Portion liver segment VII (540 grams; 13.8 x 11.2 x 9.7 cm),
tissue from liver segment V (biopsy, No. 1 - 1.5 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm;
No. 2 - 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm), tissue from liver segment VIII
(core biopsies — 1.0 cm in length and 1.5 cm in length), tissue
from the spleen (biopsy, 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm), and gallbladder
(9.4 x 4.7 x 2.2 cm with a cystic duct lymph node, 3.4 x 2.6 x
2.0 cm).

DIAGNOSIS: r’
Liver, segment VII, resection: Grade 3 (of 4) hepatocellular
carcinoma forming a dominant mass, 9.7 x 9.5 x 8.4 cm. Multiple
(at least 25) smaller tumor nodules are identified adjacent to
the larger mass, as well as away from it, ranging in size from
0.1 cm to 2.2 cm. Background liver shows cirrhosis with nodular
regeneration. Surgical margins are negative for tumor (closest 1
mm). Liver, seg nt V (No. 2), biopsy: Grade 2—3 (of 4)
hepatocellular carcinoma, 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm. Liver, segment
VIII, needle core biopsy: Grade 2—3 (of 4) hepatocellularw’
carcinoma. Liver, segment V (No. 1), biopsy: Cavernous
hemangioma, 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm.

Spleen, biopsy: Benign splenic tissue.

Gallbladder, cholecystectomy: Mild chronic cholecystitis and
cholesterolosis. A single cystic duct lymph node is benign.
