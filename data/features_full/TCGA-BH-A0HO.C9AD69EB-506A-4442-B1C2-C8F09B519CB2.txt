~ . . FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
PART 1 : WI", SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY AT 10 O'CLOCK -

INVASIEWNO SPECIAL TYPE, WITH ABUNDANT CALCIFICATIONS.
NOTTINGHAM GRADE 2 (TUBULE FORMATION: 2, NUCLEAR PLEOMORPHISM: 2. MITOTIC ACTIVITY: 2;
TOTAL SCORE = SIB).

THE INVASIVE TUMOR MEASURES 1.8 CM IN LARGEST DIMENSION.

DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, NUCLEAR GRADE 2, CRIBRIFORM TYPE WITH CALCIFICATIONS.

THE DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU CONSTITUTES 5% OF THE TOTAL TUMOR VOLUME AND IS PRESENT
ADMIXED WITH THE INVASIVE COMPONENT.

LYMPHOVASCULAR SPACE INVASION IS NOTED.

RESECT ION MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.

INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS 0.1 CM FROM THE NEAREST (ANTERIOR) MARGIN AND IS 0.2 CM FROM THE
POSTERIOR MARGIN (PLEASE SEE PART #2 FOR NEW ANTERIOR MARGIN).

THE NON-NEOPLASTIC BREAST SHOWS FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES AND COLUMNAR CELL CHANGES.
PREVIOUS BIOPSY SITE CHANGES.

THE INVASIVE TUMOR CELLS ARE POSITIVE FOR ESTROGEN RECEPTORS (H SCORE OF 200),
PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR (H SCORE OF 290) AND NEGATIVE FOR HER-2 AS PER PREVIOUS
PATHOLOGY REPORT
