TCGA Pathology Reports

Gross Description

 

A. Labeled lymph node 10R. There is a 1.4 x 0.7 cm dark gray lymph node
with a small amount attached pale yellow adipose tissue.

B. Labeled right upper lobe. Received fresh for intraoperative consultation
is a 28 g stapled wedge of lung measuring 6.7 x 4.2 x 2.3 cm. The pleural
surface is dark gray to pale tan with subtle puckering and previous

incision near the midpoint. Upon sectioning, the cut surfaces are tan to

red and spongy with a 1.9 x 1.3 cm poorly-defined, firm pale tan subpleural
nodule, located 1.0 cm from the stapled edge. Sampled for frozen section.
No other lesions are noted.

C. Labeled lymph node 9. There is a 0.7 cm dark gray lymph node with
attached fat.

D. Labeled lymph node 4R. There is a 2.9 x 2.0 x 0.8 cm portion of tan
fibroadipose tissue containing 2 possible lymph nodes measuring 0.5 x 0.3
cm and 1.5 x 0.8 cm. Upon sectioning, the cut surfaces of the larger are
gray to black and smooth.

E. Labeled right upper lobe sump. There is a 1.1 x 0.9 cm black and tan
soft tissue fragment. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

F. Labeled lymph node R7. There are 2 dark gray to black soft tissue
fragments with attached adipose tissue measuring 1.6 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm and 2.5
x 1.2 x 1.0 cm.

G. Labeled right lower lobe with margins on bronchus. Received fresh for
intraoperative consultation is a 165 g lobe of lung measuring 13.5 x 13 x 5
cm. The pleural surface is tan to pale gray, lightly wrinkled and

glistening with a 3.2 x 2.5 cm ovoid subpleural mass with a slightly raised
and somewhat scalloped rim surrounding a flat center. Upon sectioning, the
subpleural mass is up to 1.5 cm thick with pale tan cut surfaces showing
central cavitation. The mass comes to within 5 cm of the bronchial margin,
which is shaved and submitted for frozen section. The background parenchyma
is red and spongy with cystic spaces up to 1.7 cm along the periphery of
the base. Within the hilum is a 0.8 cm black lymph node.

Microscopic Description

Diagnosis Details

Comments

 

A. Microscopic performed.

B. Sections reveal an invasive
adenocarcinoma, mixed subtype with acinar
and lepidic growth patterns. The invasive
acinar component measures 0.7 cm

within a tumor displaying a prominent
lepidic pattern. There is extensive
subpleural scar formation with both the
frozen section slide and the

permanent slide of the frozen section
demonstrating the extensive scar. The
invasive adenocarcinoma is predominantly
present on the adjacent section

submitted for permanent section evaluation
(block B2). For additional

details please see the checklist.

C-F. Microscopic performed.

G. Sections reveal an invasive
adenocarcinoma, mixed subtype with
papillary, acinar, lepidic, micropapillary, and
solid growth patterns

(predominant pattern is papillary). One
benign anthracotic lymph node is

also identified. A special stain for elastin
was performed with appropriate

controls. It supports the initial H&E
interpretation of subpleural

involvement. For additional details please
see the checklist.

H. Microscopic performed.
