(A) LEFT KIDNEY:

 

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR) CELL TYPE, FUHRMAN

NUCLEAR GRADE 4 (12.0 CM).
TUMOR EXTENDING FOCALLY INTO PERIRENAL ADIPOSE TISSUE.
TUMOR iNVADING BLOOD VESSEL 1N RENAL HILUI'III. (SEE COMMENT)
Vascular, ureteral, and soft tissue margins of resection free of

tumor.
Adrenal gland, no tumor present.

COMMENT

Grossly no renal vein invasion was identified .In one of the sections
from the tumor in relation to the renal hiiar region (parts A7 and A8)
there is tumor invading the lumen and partially the wall of a thick
waEIed vessel. This is not consider diagnostic of renal vein invasion.

GROSS DESCRiPTION

(A) LEFT KIDNEY — A left radical nephrectomy(24.012.5 x 10.5 cm).
Within the upper to mid pole is a partially poorly circumscribed,
heterogenous, hemorrhagic, and necrotic mass (12.0 x 8.5 x 8.0 cm). The
tumor displays multiple focal areas of extension through the renal
capsule into the perirenal adipose tlssue. Medlally the tumor is seen

at the perirenal soft tissue margin. The mass also extends into the

slnus and also into the renal pelvis. No renal vein invasion is

identified. The uninvolved renal parenchyma appears unremarkable. The
left adrenal gland is present (3.2 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm) and Is unremarkable.

A portion of renal parenchyma and tumor is submitted to the Tissue
Bank.

ENK CODE: Blue, medial soft tissue margin with tumor.

SECTION CODE: A1, renal vein and ureter margin, en face; A2-A4,
tumor with medial soft tissue margin, perpendicular; A5-A8, tumor in
relation to renal pelvis and sinus; A9, tumor In relation to renal
sinus; A10, tumor in relation to normal kidney; A11, A12 tumor in
relation to periadipose tissue; A13, tumor in relation to normal kidney;
A14, A15, representative sections of more viable appearing tumor; A16,
representative sections of left adrenal gland; A17, A18, representative
sections of normal kidney.

(B) LEFT 12TH RIB - A portion of rib (8.5 x 1.3 x 0.!9 cm). There are
no gross abnormalities. No tissue is submitted for histology. Gross
diagnosis only.

CLINICAL HISTORY
Left renal mass.
