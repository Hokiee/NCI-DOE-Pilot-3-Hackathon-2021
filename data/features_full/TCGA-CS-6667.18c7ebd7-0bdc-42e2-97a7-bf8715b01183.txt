NEU-N IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAIN:
NEGATIVE IN TUMOR CELLS.

POSITIVE STAINING OF NON-NEOPLASTIC CORTICAL NEURONS IN AREA
INFILTRATED BY ASTROCYTOMA CELLS.

Microscopic Description:

The tumor is composed of moderately pleomorphic glial cells. The glial
tumor cells infiltrate cerebral grey matter and cortical neurons are
present that are surrounded by tumor cells. Many tumor cells show
positive immunohistochemical staining for GFAP. No ganglion cell
component of the tumor is identified on chromogranin
immunohistochemical stain. Many tumor cell nuclei show positive
immunohistochemical staining for p53.

The Ki67 proliferation index of this neoplasm is 1.9%.

This infiltrating glial neoplasm is best classified as astrocytoma, WHO
grade II.

neoplasm, oIigodendrocyte tumor versus astrocytoma. Frozen section

1. Left parietal tumor consistent with g|ioma: Received fresh for
frozen labeled with the patient's name and #1 left parietal tumor
consistent with g|ioma is an aggregate of tan-red soft tissue measuring
1.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm. Touch preps are prepared. Approximately 70% of the
specimen is submitted for frozen section. The remainder is entirely
submitted in one additional cassette. This specimen is for rapid
processing.
