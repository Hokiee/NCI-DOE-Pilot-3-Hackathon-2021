and negative AEl/AE3 and CAM 5.2 stains and by the characteristic
electron microscopic features

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
This case is received in two parts.

Part A is labeled with the patient's name, and "left
testicle." It consists of an apparent orchiectomy specimen that
measures 10 x 8 x 6 cm and weighs 270 grams.- The tunica vaginalis is
smooth, glistening and pinkish in color. There is 1 cm long apparent
spermatic cord attached with the specimen. The specimen is bivalved
to reveal presence of a white, fleshy, homogenous tumor mass. On
further sectioning through the mass, there is a hemorrhagic discreet

area identified that measures 3 x 2 cm. This tumor mass seems to be
replacing the entire testicular tissue. No recognizable normal
testicular tissue seen. The tumor is not involving either the tunica
vaginalis or the tunica albuginea, although it is approaching tunica
albuginea on gross examination. No areas of necrosis were identified.
Representative sections are taken as follows: '
Cassette 1:. Spermatic cord margin.

Cassette 2: Mid spermatic cord.

Cassette 3: Distal spermatic cord.

Cassette 4: Tumor with adjacent soft tissue at the superior margin.
Cassettes 5 and 6: Discrete red area seen on sectioning.

Cassettes 7-through 10: Representative sections through the tumor.

Part.B of the same case was received fixed in formalin labeled with
the patient's name. and "right inguinal mass." It consists
of an oval soft tissue specimen that looks like a gonad. It measures
3.5 x 1.5 x 2 cm and has 5 x 3 x 1.5 cm fibroadipose tissue attached
to it. The surface of this oval gonad type specimen is smooth, tan-
gray and glistening. The specimen is inked, bivalved to reveal the
presence of a discreet tan-brown homogenous cut surface which is
encapsulated. No apparent spermatic cord could be identified with
this specimen. On further sectioning, the specimen continued to show
tan-brown homogenous cut surface without any other lesions.
Representative sections are submitted in a total of six cassettes.
