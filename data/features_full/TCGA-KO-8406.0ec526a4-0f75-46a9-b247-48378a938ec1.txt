COMMENT

Immunoperoxidase study for keratin 7demonstrates that the tumor cells
are positive. The results of the study are consistent with the
diagnosis of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma.

The supplemental report is being issued to report the results of an
additional study performed after the original diagnosis was issued.
There is no change in the diagnosis.

DIAGNOSIS
(A) RIGHT KIDNEY:
CHROMOPHOBE RENAL CELL CARCINOMA , FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3 (3.0
CM). (SEE COMMENT)
TUMOR CONFINED TO THE KIDNEY.
Ureteral, vascular and soft tissue margins of resection free of
tumor.

COMMENT

Immunoperoxidase studies demonstrate that the tumor is positive for
keratin and EMA and negative for CD10 . The results of the
immunoperoxidase studies support the diagnosis of chromophobe renal cell
carcinoma. The stain for keratin 7 is pending. A supplemental report

will follow.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) RIGHT KIDNEY - The specimen consists of a right kidney with
perinephric adipose tissue (overall 12.0 x 6.0 x 5.0 cm), consisting of
kidney (10.0 x 5.0 x 3.5 cm), and to the attached unremarkable ureter
(2.0 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter).

A well-circumscribed tumor (3.0 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm) has a tan-brown
homogeneous appearance without necrosis or hemorrhage. The tumor is in
the middle of the kidney, closely abuts the perihilar adipose tissue.

No gross invasion into the sinus adipose tissue is identiﬁed. The
tumor is well conﬁned in the renal parenchyma (0.7 cm away from the
closest renal capsule). No hydronephrosis is identified. The remaining
renal parenchyma is grossly unremarkable.

INK CODE: The perinephric adipose tissue surface close to the
tumor is inked black.

SECTION CODE: A1, ureter and renal wing margin, en face; A2-A5,
tumor with adjacent pelvis and perihilar adipose tissue; A6-A8, tumor
with adjacent renal parenchyma and perinephric adipose tissue; A9, tumor
with adjacent renal parenchyma; A10, tumor alone; A11, renal parenchyma
next to the tumor; A12, unremarkable renal parenchyma away from the
tumor. Representative sections of the tumor are submitted to the tumor
bank and the remainder of the tumor is entirely submitted for permanent

section. -
