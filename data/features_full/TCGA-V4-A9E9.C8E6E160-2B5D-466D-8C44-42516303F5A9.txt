The eyeball measures 25 mm and the optic nerve 5 mm. Samples have been made for cryo
preservation .The specimen has been then included entirely.

Microscopy

The eyeball is occupied by a tumor proliferation which morphologic features are those of a
fusiform cell melanoma. The lesion is loaded with melanin pigment. The mitotic index is
low with Imitosis out of 10 high 400 magniﬁcation ﬁelds. The lesion inﬁltrates the internal
third of the sclera. There is no extra scleral extension. The tumor proliferation is distant from
the internal emergence of the optic nerve. The optic foramen, the pre and post laminar section,

the cut end and the meningeal sheaths are free of tumor. The iris, the ciliary body and the
anterior chamber are free of tumor.

Conclusion
Choroidal melanoma with fusiform cells
Size ofthe lesion: 15 mm

Low mitotic activity

Optic nerve (optic foramen, per and post laminar sections), meningeal sheaths and cut end of
optic nerve free of tumor

The iris, the ciliary body and the anterior chamber are free of tumor.
