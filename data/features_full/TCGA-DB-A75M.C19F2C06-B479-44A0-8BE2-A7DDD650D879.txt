 

i’inal Diagnosis:
. Brain, right parietal #1 & #2. resection: Low grade diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade II).

lmmunohistochemical stains performed on parafﬁn sections of the right parietal lesion (block Bl) reveal the
mnplastic cells are positive for GFAP and reveal a high level of p53 labeling. The Ki-67 proliferation index is
!'\w overall with focal increase. [DH-1 (R132H) is negative. These ﬁndings are consistent with the above
diagnosis.

Siren in consultation with

l’ymsequencing for DH will be reported in an addendum.
