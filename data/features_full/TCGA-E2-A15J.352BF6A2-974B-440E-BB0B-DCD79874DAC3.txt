INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:

TPNT PB/T PCIT PD1 IT PDZ/T PD3fT PD4-SLN #1 , #2, #3, #4: No tumor seen.
Diagnoses called a Dr to Dr. at (A, B, C, D).

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 LEFT AXILLA

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "SLN #1" is a 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.5-cm lymph node; sectioned, a
touch prep is performed, and lymph node is submitted entirely in cassette A1.

8. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 LEFT AXILLA

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "SLN #2" is a 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm lymph node; sectioned,
touch prep is performed, submitted entirely in cassette B1.

C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #3 LEFT AXILLA

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "SLN #3" is a 1 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm lymph node; sectioned, a
touch prep is performed, and lymph node is submitted entirely in cassette C1.

D. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #4 LEFT AXILLA

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "SLN #4" are 4 lymph nodes, 0.4 x 0.4 x 0 .2 cm, 0.3 x 0.3
x 0.2 cm. 0.3 x 0.2 x 0 .2 cm. and 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm; 4 touch preps are performed, and lymph nodes are submitted
respectively and entirely in cassettes D1-D4.

E. LEFT BREAST

Received fresh labeled with the patient‘s identiﬁcation and “left breast“ is an oriented 574 g, 24 x 19 x 4.5 cm
mastectomy with 10.5 x 4 cm skin ellipse and 1.3-cm everted nipple. Ink code: Anterior/superior-blue,
anterior/inferior-orange, and posterior-black. Specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 10 slices with
nipple in slice 7 revealing:

1) 3.5 x 3.4 x 2.2 cm area of hemorrhage and containing a biopsy site in the lower outer quadrant to the lower mid
section in slices 46 at is closest to the anterior margin at 2.3 cm

2) 5.5 cm superior to the biopsy site, in slice 6, is a 1.5 x 1.4 x 1.4 cm irregularly shaped ﬁrm tan mass in the upper
inner quadrant that is closest to the anterior margin at 0.2 cm.

Within the axillary region is a 1 cm ﬁrm tan lymph node. Representatively submitted:

E1: slice 4, L00 granular region lateral to biopsy site

E2: slice 5, most lateral aspect of area of hemorrhage and biopsy site

E3: slice 6, most inferior aspect of biopsy site extending to the anterior margin/skin

E4: slice 6, most inferior aspect of biopsy site extending to the posterior margin

E5: slice 6. mid anterior region of biopsy site

E6: slice 6. mid posterior region of biopsy site

E7-E8: slice 6. ﬁbrous tissue connecting biopsy site of lesion

E9-E11: slice 6, upper inner quadrant mass including posterior margin (trisected)

E12: slice 7, ﬁbrous tissue medial to biopsy site

E13: slice 7. ﬁbrous tissue medial to mass

E14: slice 10, LIQ

E15: slice 9, UIQ

E16: slice 3, UOQ

E17: slice 2, L00

E18—E19: nipple, perpendicular sections

E20: skin and bisected lymph node

DIAGNOSIS:

A. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #1. LEFT AXILLA, EXCISION:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1).

B. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #2, LEFT AXILLA, EXCISION:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1).

C. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #3. LEFT AXILLA, EXCISION:
— ONE LYMPH NODE. NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1).

D. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #4, LEFT AXILLA, EXCISION:
- FOUR LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/4).

E. BREAST, LEFT, MASTECTOMY:

- INVASIVE DUCTALCABCINMQMA, SBR GRADE 1, MEASURING 1.7-CM

-INTERMEDTATE NUCLEAR GRADE, DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, SOLID, CRIBRIFORM, MICROPAF'ILLARY
AND PAF'ILLARY TYPES WITH CENTRAL NECROSIS, MICROCALCIFICATIONS AND LOBULAR EXTENSION

- SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR

— FIVE LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/5)

- LOW GRADE AND HIGH GRADE (PLEOMORPHIC) LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU

- TWO BIOPSY SITES WITH FIBROSIS ABD GRANULATION TISSUE

- SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT AND SEE NOTE.

NOTE: Two lesions are grossly identified, both located in slice #6 (outer quadrants/central). The upper lesion is
DCIS extending from slice #4 to slice #6, measuring approximately 3-cm. The second lesion is located centrally
showing invasive ductal carcinoma, measuring 1.7-cm. The tissue sections between two lesions (slides #7 and #8)
show no invasive or in situ ductal carcinoma.
