GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received unfixed in 8 parts.

Part 1 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and "right floor of
mouth margin". The specimen consists of a tan, soft, friable portion of
tissue measuring 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm. Following frozen section consult the
specimen is entirely submitted in cassette labeled 1AFS.

Part 2 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and "left floor of
mouth margin". The specimen consists of a tan—gray, soft to firm, fragment of
tissue measuring 0.7 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. Following frozen section consult the
specimen is entirely submitted in cassette labeled 2AFS.

Part 3 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and "deep floor of
mouth margin". The specimen consists of a tan—brown, soft to firm and
roughened fragment of tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.2 cm. Following frozen
section consult the specimen is entirely submitted in cassette labeled 3AFS.
Part 4 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and "deep ventral
tongue margin". The specimen consists of a tan—brown roughened fragment of
tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm. Following frozen section consult the
specimen is entirely submitted in cassette labeled 4AFS.

Part 5 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and "floor of mouth,
base of tongue, stitch is superior". The specimen consists of a resection of
floor of mouth measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm. There is a stitch present
designating the superior aspect.

There is a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm tan—gray, ulcerated lesion present located 0.3
cm from the sutured superior aspect and 0.1 cm from the deep aspect. There
is

a 3.0 x 1.0 cm area of leukoplakia.

Digital images are taken.

Ink code:

Red— banked tissue

Section code:

5A— 5E — lesion, serially sectioned from left to right

Part 6 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and "right neck level

1—3". The specimen consists of a selective neck dissection measuring 13.0 x
5.0 x 1.0 cm.
The specimen is divided into 3 equal levels. There is a 5.0 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm

gland present in level 1 weighing 10 g. The portion of gland is serially
cross—sectioned revealing yellow, soft and focally hemorrhagic and lobular

parenchyma. Five potential lymph nodes are dissected out of level 1 ranging

in size from 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. 15 potential lymph
nodes

are dissected out of level 2 ranging in size from 0.2 cm to 1.0 cm in
greatest

dimension. Multiple lymph nodes are dissected out of level 3 ranging in size

from 0.3 to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The remainder of the tissue

consists of tan—yellow, soft and focally hemorrhagic adipose tissue.

Ink code:

Blue—external surface of gland

Section code:

6A — representative cross section of gland

6B — potential lymph nodes from level 1

6C, 6D — potential lymph nodes from level 2

6E, 6F — potential lymph nodes from level 3

Part 7 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and "left neck level 2

and 3". The specimen consists of an unoriented selective neck dissection

measuring 8.5 x 5.0 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is divided into two equal parts

and potential lymph nodes are dissected out of each part.

Multiple lymph nodes are dissected out at the first part ranging in size from

0.2 cm to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. Multiple potential lymph nodes are

dissected and the second part ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 0.7 cm in

greatest dimension. The remainder of the tissue consists of tan—yellow,

focally hemorrhagic adipose tissue.

Section code:

7A, 7B — potential lymph nodes from level 2

7C, 7D — potential lymph nodes from level 3.

Part 8 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xx and "right anterior

floor of mouth margin". The specimen consists of a tan—gray, soft to firm,

focally hemorrhagic and roughened fragment of unoriented tissue measuring 2.0
n is entirely submitted in cassette labeled 8A.

cific use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA has
determined such approval s not necessary f clinical use. Tissue fixation
ranges from a minimum of to a maximum Of}.- hours.

This laborator certi ed under the Cli al Laboratory Improvement
Amendments of ("CLIA") as qualified to perform high—complexity clinical
testing. Purs to the requirements of CLIA, ASR's used in this laboratory

have been established and verified for accuracy and precision. Additional
