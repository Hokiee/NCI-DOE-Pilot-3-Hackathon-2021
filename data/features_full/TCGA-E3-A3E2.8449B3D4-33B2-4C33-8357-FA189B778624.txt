GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. PRE TRACHEAL LYMPH NODE
Received in formalin and labeled as "pre tracheal lymph node" is a pink-tan lymph node measuring
0.8x0.5x0.3cm. Submitted in toto in block A1.
B. THYROID WITH PARATRACHEAL NODES
Received fresh for tissue procurement and labeled "total thyroid with paratracheal node" is a 159m
thyroid gland with the right lobe measuring 5.0x2.5x0.9cm, isthmus is 1.5x1.2x0.30m and the left lobe is
4.0x2.5x0.7cm. The serosa is unremarkable. The specimen is inked as follows: posterior-red, anterior
left lobe-blue, anterior isthmus-orange. anterior right lobe-black. Specimen is serially sectioned from
superior left lobe to inferior and the isthmus from left to right and no abnormalities are seen. The right
lobe is sectioned from superior to inferior and there is a well circumscribed, ﬁrm, white-tan nodule
present measuring 1.0x1.0x0.7cm which is located in the mid portion of the medial side. The remainder
of the parenchyma has a meaty red appearance. Specimen is submitted in toto as follows:

81-84: left lobe, serially submitted from superior to inferior

BS: isthmus
86-312: right lobe. submitted from Superior to inferior, mass is submitted in toto in block 810
Representative section is submitted for tissue procurement.
C. RIGHT PARATRACHEAL NODE
Received fresh and labeled as "right paratracheal node" is a 0.7x0.4x0.3cm lymph node. It is submitted
in toto for frozen section in block labeled FSCl.
