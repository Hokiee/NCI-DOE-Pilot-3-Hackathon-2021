GROSS DESCRIPTION:

1) Received fresh. labeled with the patient's name, number and "uterus, tubes and
Ovaries", is a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salplngo—oophorectomy specimen
consisting of uterus (10.0 x 4.0 x 4.5 cm), right ovary (2.8 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm), right
fallopian tube (5.5 x 0.5), left ovary (2.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm), and left fallopian tube
(4.5 x 0.4 cm). The uterus is opened and part of tumor and left fallopian tube
(normal tissue) is sutnutted for research. On opening the uterus, the endometrial
cavity is 5.0 cm x 3.0 cm, and there is a 4.5 x 4.5 x 2.0 cm, yellow-tan fleshy tumor
involving the corpus of the uterus and fungating to involve the superior part of the
endometrium. The tumor grossly involves more than 90$ of the myometrium and almost
extends to the serosal surface superiorly. The lower segment of the uterus,
endocervical canal (3.2 cm in length), and cervix are grossly uninvolved by the tumor.
There is a 5.0 x 4.0 x 3.5 cm, soft to firm, subserosal leiomyoma in the anterior
lower segment of the uterus. The bilateral adnexa is grossly uninvolved by the tumor.
Bilateral ovaries are covered with pink‘tan to red serosal surface and on sectioning
reveal pink, homogeneous parenchyma. The left fallopian tube is grossly unremarkable

and the right fallopian tube has multiple small paratubal cysts ranging from 0.1 to
0.3 cm in maximum diameter. The specimen is representatively sectioned and submitted
as follows:

CASSETTE SUMMARY:

nodes, there are three red-tan ovoid lymph nodes identified, ranging from 0.5 x 0.5 x
0.2 cm to 2.0 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm. All lymph nodes identified are submitted as follows:

CASSETTE SUMMARY:
Cassette 4: Three lymph nodes.

Received in formalin, labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes" and with the patient's name,
is an aggregate of irregular portions of yellow—tan lobulated adipose tissue, 5.5 x
