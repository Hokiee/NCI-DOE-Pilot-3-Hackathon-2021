GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen consists of a 153 gram, 15.2 x 7.1 x 3.5 cm, segment of
liver displaying a tan—red, granular resection margin with multiple
staples and clips. The resection margin is inked black. The
overlying capsule is tan~pink to purple, and granular with abundant
modularity. The capsular aspect is inked blue. The specimen is
serially sectioned to reveal a 5.3 x 5.2 x 4.8 cm, tan-yellow to
white, granular, nodular mass that is 1.3 cm from the liver resection
margin. The mass is multifocal ranging from 0.2 to 5.8 cm in greatest
dimensions. The smaller nodules extend to within 0.3 cm of the
hepatic resection margin. The masses grossly extend to the overlying
capsule. The uninvolved liver parenchyma is tan—yellow to brown and
unremarkable.

Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1—4— largest mass to
resection margin; 5— smallest nodule to closest resection margin: 6—9—
nodules to overlying capsule: 10— largest mass with adjacent
uninvolved liver parenchyma. Please note a representative portion is
taken for tissue bank.
