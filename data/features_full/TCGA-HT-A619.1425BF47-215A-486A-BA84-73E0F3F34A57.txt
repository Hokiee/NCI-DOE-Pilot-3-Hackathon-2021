Pathology report for

Discussion:
Numerous MIB-1 reactive cells are present throughout the specimen. in the most
proliferative areas, a labeling index of 9.6 percent is calculated. This high level,

combined with the borderline mitotic count warrants classiﬁcation as anaplastic/grade

Diagnosrs:

Anaplastic oligodendroglioma, grade III 5:11. 5W Nos @7115
- MIB—l LI = 9.6% 96.) 4/th '3

Microscopic Description:

Microscopic examination of frozen section and permanent material reveals a glial
neoplasm composed of a proliferation of cells with prominent perinuclear halos. Overall,
the tumor cell population demonstrates moderate nuclear atypia and a paucity of
ﬁbrillary processes, with occasional cells showing more pronounced atypia. Up to 3
mitotic ﬁgures per 10 high power ﬁelds are encountered. Neither necrosis nor
microvascular proliferation are identified. The tumor infiltrates both the white and grey
matter. There is background hemorrhage and scattered calciﬁcations. Foreign surgical
material is focally encountered. The histologic features are consistent with an
oligodendroglioma.
