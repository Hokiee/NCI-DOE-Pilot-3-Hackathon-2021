REVISED REPORT (Addendum/Procedure included)

SLIDE DISPOSITION:

DIAGNOSIS:

A. Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy

and bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy: FIGO grade II (of
III)

endometrial adenocarcinoma,Nendometrioid_typg, is
identified forming ‘H—_~‘“‘—='

a mass (5.0 x 3.8 x 3.2 cm), located in the dome uterine
wall. The

tumor invades 1.3 cm into the myometrium (total wall
thickness 1.4

cm). The tumor does not involve the endocervix.
Lymphovascular

space invasion is not identified. The margins are
negative for

tumor. The bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes are not
involved.

B. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(28) right
pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

C. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(17) left
pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

D. Lymph nodes, right peri—aortic below inferior
mesenteric artery,

lymphadenectomy: Multiple (7) right peri—aortic lymph
nodes below

inferior mesenteric artery are negative for tumor.

E. Lymph nodes, right peri-aortic above inferior
mesenteric artery,

lymphadenectomy: Multiple (3) right peri—aortic lymph
nodes above

inferior mesenteric artery are negative for tumor.

F. Lymph nodes, left peri-aortic below inferior
mesenteric artery,

lymphadenectomy: Multiple (3) right peri—aortic lymph
nodes above

inferior mesenteric artery are negative for tumor.

G. Lymph nodes, left peri—aortic above inferior
mesenteric artery,

lymphadenectomy: Multiple (2) left peri—aortic lymph
nodes above

inferior mesenteric artery are negative for tumor.

This final pathology report is based on the

gross/macroscopic

examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation
of the

specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent
sections are

reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive
changes

identified on permanent section review will be reflected
in a @l,

revised report.

outer surface

and a solid cut surface with a 4.2 x 0.7 cm left fallopian
tube.

Representative sections are submitted.

B. Received fresh labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes" is a
6.3 x 5.0

x 2.0 cm aggregate of adipose tissue and lymph nodes. All
lymph

below IMA"

 

is a 4.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm aggregate of adipose tissue and
lymph nodes.
Lymph nodes submitted.

E. Received fresh labeled "right peri-aortic lymph nodes
above IMA"
