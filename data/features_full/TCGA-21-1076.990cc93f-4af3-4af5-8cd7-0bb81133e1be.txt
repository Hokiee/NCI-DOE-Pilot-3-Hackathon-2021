Source of Tissue: 9. Labeled #9, "left lung"
Frozen Section Diagnosis: 9FS- BRONCHIAL MARGIN WITH NO TUMOR SEEN.

Gross Description: Received fresh for frozen section evaluation with patient name and
medical record number labeled "left lung". It consists of a 481 gram right lung specimen
with an overall measurement of 24 X 13 x 6.5 cm. The lower lobe measures 14 X 10 X 6 cm
and the upper lobe measures approximately 15 X 10 X 6 cm. The bronchial margin is

 

unremarkable. The bronchial margin was procured for frozen section consultation and the
residue is submitted in 9FS. The diapln'agmatic surface is normal appearing. Multiple
bronchial and peribronchial lymph nodes are found measuring up to 2 cm and a few are tan
and ﬁrm. Vascular margins are unremarkable. On dissection through the hilum, tumor
comes to within 1.4 cm from the margin and closely approaches an airway and vessel

(E and F). Sections disclose a 8 X 8 x 6 cm tumor in the left lower lobe. Tumor grossly is
adhesed to the upper lobe (9.1). Tumor is adhesed to the costal soft tissue with rib and
associated soft tissue measuring 10.5 X 9 X 1.4 cm. Sections show no gross invasion into
the costal resection. Tumor is tan and approximately 80% is necrotic. Elsewhere the lower
lobe is pink and spongy while the upper lobe is predominantly red and dense.

Designation of Sections: 9A- vascular margin, 9B—9D- hilar and peribronchial lymph
nodes, 9E—9F- tumor approaching hilum, 9G— tumor with pleura, 9H- tumor in relationship
to adjacent lung tissue, 91— tumor in relationship to costal soft tissue, 91— tumor in
relationship to left upper lobe adhesion, 9K— uninvolved lower and upper lobes, 9L— costal
resection/ribs, following decalcification.

9. Lung, left (left pneumonectomy):

- Squamous cell carcinoma, moderate to poorly differentiated (8.0 cm).
— The visceral pleura is negative for tumor.

— The bronchial, vascular and costal resection margins are free of tumor.

 

- Sixteen peribronchial lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma
(0/ l 6). -

~ Emphysematous changes.

- Chronic inﬂammation with fibrous adhesions to chest wall.
