GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. RIGHT RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY
Received fresh with matching patient name and medical record number is a kidney with peri-renal fat
and adrenal weighing 341 grams and measuring 16 x 9 x 6 cm overall. The kidney proper measures
12.5 x 6.5 x 5.0 cm. The outer surface is inked and the kidney is bivalved to reveal tumor in the upper
pole of the kidney measuring 5.1 x 3.5 x 2.8 cm. The cut surface of the tumor appears pale yellow to
gray-white. The tumor is very close to the renal capsule but with an intact capsule. The tumor is
approximately 1.5 cm away from the renal pelvis. The adrenal gland measures 6.5 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm. The
blood vessels at the hilum measures approximately 0.7 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. The
ureter measures 5.0 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter. A small portion of the tumor is taken for
tissue procurement. The kidney is serially sectioned and two small gray-white lesions measuring 0.2
cm is noted, one is approximately 1.0 cm from the larger tumor and the other one is close to the lower
pole of the kidney. The hilar fat is dissected and no lymph nodes are identiﬁed. The adrenal gland is
serially sectioned to reveal a 0.5 cm nodule with bright yellow cut surface. Representative sections are
submitted for microscopic examination as follows:

A1: blood vessel and ureter margin

A2: tumor in relation to the renal capsule

A3: tumor in relation to normal-appearing kidney

A4: tumor in relation to the adrenal

A5-A7: tumor in relation to the peri-renal fat and inked margin

A8: additional section of tumor

A9: normal-appearing kidney

A10: unremarkable renal pelvis and the kidney section with small nodule close
to the larger lesion

A11: small nodule in the lower pole of the kidney

A12: section of adrenal

A13: section of adrenal nodule

None provided
