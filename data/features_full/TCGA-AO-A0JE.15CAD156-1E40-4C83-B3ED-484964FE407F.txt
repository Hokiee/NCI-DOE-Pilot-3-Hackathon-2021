1) The specimen is received initially fresh for frozen section
consultation, which was later canceled, labeled, "Sentinel node number one,
level 1, right axilla', and consists of a single lymph node measuring 1.8 x
1.2 x 0.6 cm. Cut section shows fleshy red-tan appearance. Specimen is
entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U bisected lymph node

2). The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation labeled,
"Sentinel node number two, level 1, right axilla", and consists of a single
lymph node measuring 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is bisected and
entirely frozen. A sample is submitted to TPS.

3) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right breast mass". It
consists of a round piece of fibroadipose tissue measuring 11.5 x 10.0 x 4.0
cm. The specimen is oriented with short suture superior and long suture
lateral. The specimen is inked and the margins are entirely shaved.
Sectioning of the central portion of the tissue reveals a firm stellate
shaped gray-tan mass measuring 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm located at the lateral
aspect of the tissue. A portion of the tissue is submitted for TPS. The
rest of the tumor is entirely submitted for histologic examination.
Representative section of the remaining tissue are also submitted.

4) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Additional medial margin,
stitch marks final margin breast". It consists of a fragment of
fibroadipose tissue measuring 4.0 x 2.0 x 0.4 cm. The surface of the tissue
marked with stitch is inked black. The tisue is serially sectioned to
reveal a fibroadipose cut surface with no gross pathologic abnormality. The
specimen is entirely submitted.

Summary of Sections:

5) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Superior lateral tissue,
right breast". It consists of a round piece of fibroadipose tissue
measuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm. The surface of the tissue marked with stitch
is inked black and the tissue is serially sectioned to reveal a fibroadipose
cut surface with no gross pathologic abnormalities. The specimen is
entirely submitted.

Summary of Sections:

6) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Levels 1 and 2, right
axillary contents, with tags attached". It consists of a fragment of
adipose tissue measuring 7 x 4 x 3 cm with attached tags designating levels
1 and 2. Dissection of tissue reveals multiple lymph nodes ranging in size
from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm to 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. All lymph nodes are entirely
