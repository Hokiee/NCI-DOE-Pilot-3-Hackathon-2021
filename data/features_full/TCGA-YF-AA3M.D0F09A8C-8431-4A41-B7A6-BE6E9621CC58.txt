cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter. the entire speCimen is frozen for intraoperative consultation in one tissue block.
(3T1)

8. Received fresh. labeled is a pink tan segment of ureter (0.6 x 0.5 cm).
The entire specimen is frozen for intraoperative consurtatiou in one tissue block. (8T1)
C. Received in formalin. labeled is a radical cystoproslalectomy specimen

containing bladder (8 x 6 x 4.5 cm). prostate (4 x 4 x 3 cm). There is a soft. tan-pink papillary tumor (2 x 1.5 x 1 cm)
located at the posterior wall. The remainder of the bladder mucosa is edematous and congested; however, no other
gross lesions are noted. The right and left ureters margins were submitted sepanaely. The prostate consists of

vesicle (2 x 1.3 x 1 cm). right vas deferens (2 cm in length by 0.4 cm in diameter). and left vas deferens (2 cm in
length by 0.4 cm in diameter) are unremarkable. (R815) 1'. ureter margin. 2: right lateral. 3: left lateral, 4: anterior, 5:
