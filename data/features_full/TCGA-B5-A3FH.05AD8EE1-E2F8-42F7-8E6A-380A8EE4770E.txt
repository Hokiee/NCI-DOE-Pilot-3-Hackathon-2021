CLINICAL HISTORY:
Pre‘op diagnosis: Malignant neocorpus uteri.

Procedure: Laparoscopic hysterectomy.
GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Uterus, tubes and ovaries" (AFl—AFZ), received fresh for frozen section
diagnosis is a 398 gram, 13.5 x 11.0 x 9.0 cm hysterectomy specimen with
attached cervix (5.0 x 3.0 cm). The specimen was opened by the surgeon. The
serosal surface is markedly distorted by multiple subserosal and myometrial
leiomyomata, but otherwise grossly unremarkable. Opening the specimen
demonstrates a cervical canal (2.5 cm in length x 1.5 cm in diameter) which is
white—tan and has a herringbone pattern. The endometrial canal (7.5 cm in
length x 5.5 cm from cornu to cornu) is markedly distorted by large,
calcified, submucosal leiomyomas, the largest of which (5.0 x 4.6 x 4.2 cm) is
located in the anterior myometrium. Two other large, submucosal leiomyomas

are located in the posterior myometrium and measure 4.5 x 3.8 x 3.2 cm and 3.0 SJ) E;
x 3.0 x 1.9 cm. All leiomyomas are calcified. The endometrium demonstrates :5 <‘
red—tan, hyperplastic mucosa with a fungating lesion located primarily on the ”
anterior side (4.5 x 3.5 cm). A photograph is taken. This fungating mass 5? Eé
is 0.9 cm of the anterior lower uterine segment. This area overlies the 9‘ (9
largest calcified leiomyoma and for this reason we will not be able to obtain 9 (a,
full thickness sections in this area. .E+
The right fallopian tube is 6.0 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter and upon ,
sectioning grossly unremarkable. The right ovary (2.0 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm) is .
white—tan, cerebriform and grossly unremarkable. The left fallopian tube (6.7

cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter) is upon sectioning grossly unremarkable. p, E:-
The left ovary (1.2 x 1.1 x 0.4 cm) is white—tan, cerebriform and grossly V1
unremarkable. if §

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:

PROCEDURE: Total laparoscopic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy,
bilateral pelvic and paraaortic lymph node sampling.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 7th Edition): pTla pNO pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

HYSTERECTOMY AND BILATERAL SALPINGO—OOPHORECTOMY):
