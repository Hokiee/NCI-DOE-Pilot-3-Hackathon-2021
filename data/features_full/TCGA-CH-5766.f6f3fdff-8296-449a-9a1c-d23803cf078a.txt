Diagnosis

1. Predominantly poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate in the peripheral zone
on both sides with left rectolateral predominance. Maximum tumor spread 2.2 cm. Marked

perineural tumor invasion. Left rectolateral extraprostatic tumor growth with inﬁltration of the
periprostatic fatty tissue. No identiﬁable invasion of the vessels. Tumor—free seminal vesicles.

2. Tumor—flee portions of seminal vesicle.
3. Two tumor-free lymph nodes.

4. Lymph node micrometastasis of the prostate carcinoma diagnosed under 1. in one of two
lymph nodes. Maximum tumor spread 1.9 mm

Remark

In summary, the tumor is classiﬁed as follows: p133, pNimi (1/4), L0, V0; Gleason 4+3 = 7
(approx. 80% Gleason 4).

In the region of the tissue defects, carcinoma cells extend to the artefactual preparation margins
(yellow labeling). The other preparation margins are tumor-free.
