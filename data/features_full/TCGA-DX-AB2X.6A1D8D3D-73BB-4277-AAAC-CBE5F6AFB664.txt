DIAGNOSIS: 1/
1. SP: RIGHT LEG MASS; RESECTION:

-HIGK GRADE UNDIFFERENTIATED SPINDLE, EPITHELIOID AND PLEOMORPHIC
NEOPLASM MOST CONSISTEN‘T WITH UNDIFFERENTIATED SARCO‘MA.

-TUMOR SIZE:8 x 6 x 3 CM.

-NECROSIS PRESENT (20% GROSS ESTIMATE)

-VASCULAR INVASION IS PRESENT.

-SKIN WITH SURFACE SUPERFICIAL ULCER

—MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE.CLOSEST MARGIN IS DEEP-1m! FROM TUMOR LIMITED BY
FASCIA.

NOTE: IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINS SHOW THAT THE TUMOR CELLS ARE NEGATIVE FOR
MELANOMA MARKERS (S-lOO, HMS—45, TYROSINASE. A-103), CYTOKERATIN AEl/AES,
p63/4A4, DESMIN, LCA, CD30, ALK-l, AND CD34. RARE POSITIVITY IS SEEN WITH
CD31 AND FOCAL LABELLING IS SEEN WITH CD163. THESE FINDINGS IN ADDITION TO
THE IMMUNOS PERFORMED ON PREVIOUS BIOPSY (POSITIVITY FOR VIMENTIN, FOCAL
SMA, FOCAL CD31V1AD NEGATIVE STAINING FOR EMA, CD34, DESMIN, MYOGENIN, CAM
5.2, FLI-l, CD63 AND P63) DO NOT SUPPORT ANY SPECIFIC LINEAGE. BASED ON
NEGATIVE STAINING FOR MELANOMA MARKERS, CYTOKERATINS AND LCA, THIS TUMOR IS
BEST CLASSIFIED AS AN UNDIFFERENTIATED PLEOMORPELC SARCOMA.

Note:

Some of the imunohistochemistry and ISH tests were developed and their
performance characteristics were determined by the Department of Pathology.
They have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is
not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not
be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified
under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA ' 88) as
qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF

THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

*** Report Electronically Signed Out ***

Gross Description:

1). The specimen is received fresh labeled “right leg mass" and consists of
an oriented by sutures rhombus-shaped large skin excision measuring 16 x 12
x 4.5 cm with a slightly eccentric hemorrhagic ulcer measuring 1 x 0.5 cm.
The margins are inked as follows: deep - black, lateral - blue and medial a
green. Serial sectioning reveals a non-encapsulated lobulated grey fleshy
solid tissue mass measuring 8 x 6 x 3 cm. Approximately 20% of the mass
shows grossly appreciable tumor necrosis. The specimen is photographed and
sampled for TPS. Representative sections are submitted.
