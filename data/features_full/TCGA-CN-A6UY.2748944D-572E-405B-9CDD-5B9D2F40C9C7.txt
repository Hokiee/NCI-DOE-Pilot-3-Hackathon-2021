soft

tissue. The specimen is entirely evaluated using frozen section. The
frozen

section remnant is submitted in cassette SAPS.

Formalin Exposure Time: 71 Hours

Part 6 is received fresh for intraOperative consultation labeled with
the

patient's name, initials XXX, medical record number, and "right
pharyngeal

wall". It consists of a 2.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm un—oriented segment of tan-
white

soft tissue. The specimen is entirely evaluated using frozen section.

Part 7 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled with
the

patient's name, initials XXX, medical record number, and "deep base of
tongue

margin". It consists of a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm un—oriented, tan—gray
portion of

soft tissue. The specimen is entirely evaluated using frozen section.

Part 8 is received fresh labeled with the patient‘s name, initials XXX,
medical record number, and "additional left base of tongue". It
consists of a

1.9 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm un—oriented, tan—gray portion of soft tissue and a
0.5 x Y

0.5 x 0.2 cm aggregate of tan-gray tissue fragments. All tissue is
submitted

in cassette 8A.

surface

partially surrounded by gray mucosa at the lateral aspect. The exposed
surface

of the lesion is slightly friable and the cut surface is dense and
smooth with

infiltrative borders. The lesion abuts the anterior and deep edges and
is 2.0

cm from the lateral wall. The remainder of the uninvolved specimen is
composed

of a brown muscular tissue surfaced by filiform gray mucosa.

Digital images are taken and tissue from the lesion is banked
Representative sections from medial to lateral are submitted in
cassettes 9A —

9D.

MICROSCOPIC:

Microscopic examination substantiates the above diagnosis.

The following statement applies to all immunohistochemistry, Insitu
Hybridization Assays (ISH & FISH), Molecular Anatomic Pathology, and
Immunofluorescent Testing:

The testing was developed and its performance characteristics
determined by

the as required by
the CLIA

'88 regulations. The testing has not been cleared or approved for the
specific use by the 0.5. Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA has
determined such approval is not necessary for clinical use. Tissue
fixation
ranges from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 84 hours.
This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments of 1988 ("CLIA") as qualified to perform high-complexity
clinical
testing. Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA, ASR's used in this
laboratory
have been established and verified for accuracy and precision.
Additional
information about this type of test is available upon request.
