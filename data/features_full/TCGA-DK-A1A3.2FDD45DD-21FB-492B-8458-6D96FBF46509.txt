Gross Description:

1. The specimen l5 received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled "distal margin urethra" and consists of a fragment of tan-
red soft tissue measuring 1.3 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm. Entirely submitted for frozen section.
Summary of sections: FSC — frozen section control

2) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes" and consists of multiple pink tan ﬁrm lymph nodes ranging
from 0.2 to 3.4 cm in greatest dimension. A portion of the specimen is sent for TPS. All identiﬁed lymph nodes are submitted in
seven cassettes. Summary of sections: LN — lymph nodes, BLN - bisected lymph node

3) The specimen is received fresh, labeled I'right pelvic lymph nodes," and consists of multiple pink tan ﬁrm lymph nodes ranging
from 0.4 to 4 cm in greatest dimension. A portion of the specimen is sent for TPS. All identiﬁed lymph nodes are submitted in eight
cassettes. Summary of sections: LN - lymph nodes, BLN — bisected lymph node

4) The specimen is received fresh labeled, "bladder, urachus, urethra. prostate, seminal vesicles, perivesicle tissue and lymph
nodes, distal ureters, portions of bilateral ureteral stents". it consists of a cystoprostatectomy measuring 13 cm from superior to
inferior, 8.5 cm laterally and 4.5 cm from anterior to posterior. The anterior aspect of the bladder is inked black and the posterior
blue. The prostatic urethral margin is shaved and submitted. The bladder is opened along the anterior midline to reveal an
ulcerated tumor mass measuring 3 x 1 cm which is grossly situated within the trigone area. The lesion measures 0.3 cm from the
left oriﬁce and is present at the right. Two green ureteral stents are present measuring 8.5 and 12 cm in length by 0.2 cm in
diameter. Both ureters are probe patent measuring up to 0.2 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion is sectioned to reveal apparent
invasion into the bladder wall/prostate up to 0.6 cm. Extension to the inked fat is grossly not identiﬁed. The remaining bladder
mucosa is hemorrhagic and verrugated without other mass lesions. Discrete perivesical lymph nodes are grossly not identiﬁed.
Deﬁnite urachal remnant is not identiﬁed. The prostate is serially sectioned to reveal unremarkable prostatic parenchyma.
Representative sections are submitted including two sections from each prostatic quadrant and transition zone. TPS is submitted.
Gross photographs are taken.

Summary of sections: UTHM — urethral margin, RUM— right ureter margin, LUM - left ureter margin, L— lesion

RUO — right ureter oriﬁce, LUO— left ureter oriﬁce, LP — left posterior wall. LA - left anterior wall, RP — right posterior wall

RA— right anterior wall, TRI — trigone, DOM—dome, U- urachal area, F - perivesical fat, RSV — right seminal vesicle

LSV — left seminal vesicle, RA — right apex prostate, LA — left apex prostate. RAM — right anterior mid prostate

RPM — right posterior mid prostate, LAM - left anterior mid prostate, LPM - left posterior mid prostate, RAB - right anterior base
prostate, RPB — right posterior base prostate. LAB — left anterior base prostate, LPB — left posterior base prostate

5) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left vas deferens" and consists of a segment of tan tubular elastic tissue. with
attached small amount of unremarkable fat, measuring 10 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. Representatively submitted.
Summary of sections: BE — both ends, RS - representative sections

7) The specimen IS received in formalin, labeled "Right vas deferens" and consists of an unoriented segment of tan elastic tissue,
measuring 3 cm in length and 0.2 cm in average diameter. Entirely submitted.
Summary of sections: BE — both ends. RT - remaining tissue

8) The specimen is received fresh labeled, "Portion of right ureteral stent" and consists of an elongated tubular green stent
measuring 27 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is photographed. Gross only.

tissue. Bisected and entirely submitted. Summary of sections: U - undesignated

10) The specimen rs received fresh labeled, "Portion of left ureteral stent" and consists of an elongated tubular green stent
measuring 25 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is photographed. Gross only.

11) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Distal margin urethra" and consists of two fragments of tan soft tissue,
measuring 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.1 and 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted. Summary of sections: U - undesignated

12) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Distal leﬂ ureter" and consists of a 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm fragment of tan soft tissue.
Entirely submitted. Summary of sections: U ~ undesignated

13) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "High proximal margin left ureter, distal" and consists of a 1.6 x 0.8 x 0.2 cm
piece of tan soft tissue. Entirely submitted. Summary of sections: U - undesignated

14) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Distal right ureter clip on proximal margin" and consists of a 1.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm
tubular piece of tan soft tissue, consistent with a dilated ureter. A clip demarcating the proximal margin is identiﬁed. Entirely
submitted. Summary of sections: UE -— unclipped end, CE — clipped end, RT - remaining tissue
