Diagnosis

1. Predominantly poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma iimited to the prostate on both sides
(Gleason 4+3=7; tertiary grade 5) with the main focus in the right peripheral zone.
Gleason 4 portions make up 70% and Gleason 5 portions account for less than 5% of the tumor.

 

Maximum tumor diameter 1.5 cm. No extraprostatic tumor growth. Muitifocal tumor
involvement of perineural sheaths. The main preparation shows tumor-free surgical margins.

In addition numerous foci of a prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (high grade, PIN) and signs of
myoglandular prostatic hyperplasia. Urothelium of the prostatic urethra shows no dyspiasia.
Tumor—free, regularly structured seminal vesicle and seminal duct.

2. 2 tumorufree lymph nodes.
3. 1 tumor—free lymph node.
4. Tumor—free soft tissue with vessels and nerves.

Summary tumor classiﬁcation
pTZc, maximum tumor diameter 1.5 cm, Gleason 4+3=7, tertiary grade 5, pNO (0)3), R0.

Remark

In the corresponding frozen section analysis there was a right microfocal tumor involvement of
the green labeled surgicai resection margin (0.6 mm contact line).

Additional immunohistochemicai studies will follow to clarify the vascular status. The
results wiil be presented in a follow—up report.

Follow—up report

(Immunohistochemistry: 132—40, CD31).

in the additional immunohistochemical studies that have since been carried out in two
representative tumor blocks, there is no evidence to suggest a tumor invasion of the vessels.

Otherwise, the conciuding tumor classiﬁcation is as foilows:

pT20, maximum tumor diameter I.5 cm, Gleason 4+3:7, tertiary grade 5 (Gleason 4 = 70%,
Gleason 5 <5%), L0, V0, pN0 (0/3), R0.
