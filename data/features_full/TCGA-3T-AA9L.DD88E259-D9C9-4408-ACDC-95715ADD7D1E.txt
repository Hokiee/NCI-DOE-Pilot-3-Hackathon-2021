Mediastinal mass. Right VATS.

Sgeclmen(s) Received

A: inferior mediastinal mass. FS

Gross Descrigtion

Specimen A is received fresh along with the patient's name. medical record number and as "inferior mediastinal mass. F8.” The
specimen consists of twu fragments of soft tissue mass. the larger one measures 6. 0 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm and weighs 25 gm. The
specimen is already incised when received. The smaller fragment measures 2.5 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm and weighs 2.6 grams. An
ill-deﬁned encapsulated mass lesion is identiﬁed in the larger fragment and measures 5.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm. The cutting surface of
this lesion showing yellowish and flesh color. A representative section from this ill-deﬁned mass lesion is submitted for
intraoperative consultation as "A1FS." Another ill-deﬁned mass lesion is identiﬁed in the small fragment which measures 0.5 x

0.5 x 0.2 cm. the cutting surface of this small ill~deﬁned mass lesion is ﬁsh—flesh. The outside surface of the entire specimen is
inked blue. Sections submitted are indicated below. Dictated by ' -

CASSETTE SUMMARY:

A1 FS: A representative section of the mass lesion from the larger fragment (inlraoperative consultation)
A2—A7: Representative sections of the mass lesion from the larger fragment

A8: Representative sections of the small fragment with the small mass lesion

Microscogic Descrigtion

Microscopic examination performed.

Flow Cytometry

Interpretation
Flow cytometric immunophenotyping of the submitted mediastinal mass is performed using antibodies to the listed analytes.

Electronic gates are placed around cell clusters displaying light scatter properties corresponding to lymphocytes (98% of total
sample). The remainder of the sample is comprised of apparent debris and/or nonviable cells.

Status: Signed Out

Phenotypic analysis reveals a distinct population of cells with low light scatter properties comprising approximately 98% of the
total sample which express CD2. variable CD3. partial CD4. CD5. CD7. partial C08. 0038, and CD45.
