MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

A. Sections are of a benign lymph node with anthracotic pigment. There
is no malignancy.

B. Sections are of a benign lymph node with similar findings as
described above. There is no malignancy.

C. Sections are of a benign lymph node. There is no malignancy.

D. Multiple sections are examined and sections of the vascular and
bronchial surgical margins are free of tumor. There are two benign
peribronchial lymph nodes with no malignancy. Sections of the tumor
grassly described are composed of sheets of neoplastic cells with
somewhat distinct cell borders with a small to moderate amount of
cytoplasm and large pleomorphic nuclei with irregularly clumped
chromatin pattern and prominent nucleoli and mitotic activity. There
is no definite lymphovascular invasion seen. Sections of the grossly
uninvolved lung demonstrate no significant fibrosis or significant
inflammation.

E. Sections are of a benign lymph node with no malignancy. *

GROSS:

A. Received in Formalin labeled with the patient's name, account number,
and “L4" is a single slightly anthracotic lymph node measuring 0.9 x
0.5 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is totally submitted in a single
cassette. TS-l -

B. Received in Formalin labeled with the patient's name, account number,
and "L11" is a single slightly anthracotic lymph node measuring 0.7 x
0.6 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is totally submitted in a single
cassette. T’s—1 -

C. Received in Formalin labeled with the patient's name, account number,
and “more L11" is a single anthracotic lymph node measuring 1.5 x 0.8
x 0.3 cm. The specimen is totally submitted in a single cassette.

D. Received labeled "left upper lobe” is a 20 x 8 x 6 cm in maximum
dimensions lobectomy specimen. The bronchial margin is submitted for
frozen section and frozen section diagnosis in block #1. The
specimen is serially sectioned and there is a central firm tumor with
a white—tan cut surface measuring up to 1.8 cm maximally.
Representative section of the tumor is submitted for frozen section
and frozen section diagnosis in block #2. Representative section is
also submitted for Genomics Project. The remainder of the lung is
soft and spongy and mildly anthracotic. Sections are then submitted
for permanent as follows: Cassette #3 ~ Vascular margins and lymph
nodes. #4 and #5 — Additional sections of tumor. #6 — Grossly
uninvolved lung . _

E. Received in Formalin labeled with the patient's name, account number,
and "L4“ is a single anthrscotic lymph node measuring 1.7 x 1 x 0.3
cm. The specimen is totally submitted in a single cassette. TS-l
