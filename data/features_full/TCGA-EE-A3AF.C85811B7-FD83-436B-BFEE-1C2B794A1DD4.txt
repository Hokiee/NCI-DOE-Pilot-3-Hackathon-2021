1. "ANTERIOR OCCIPITAL".

The sections show skin with underlying subcutis and skeletal muscle. There is a dermosubcutaneous ﬁbrous
scar with associated foreign body type multinucleated giant cells. There is an unremarkable lymph node in
the underlying fatty tissue, as well as a round tumour nodule composed of pleomorphic epithelioid cells with
high nucleartcytoplasmic ratio, hyperchromatic nuclei, small nucleoli and numerous mitotic ﬁgures. The
cells have amphophilic cytoplasm and intracytoplasmic pigment is present. The features are consistent with
metastatic melanoma, which may have completely replaced a lymph node.

2. "LEVEL I A NECK DISSECTION”.
Three lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy (0/3).

3. "LEVEL I B NECK DISSECTION".
Five lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy (0/5).
The section of salivary gland is unremarkable.

4. "LEVEL 11 A NECK DISSECTION".
Four lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy (0/4). The largest node shows reactive changes.

The sections of skin show a derrmosubcutaneous scar, including a granulomatous reaction to polarisable
foreign material. -

HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

5. "LEVEL II B NECK DISSECTION".

Four out of eleven lymph nodes contain metastatic melanoma (4/11). The metastases have a similar
morphology to specimen 1, and are composed of epithelioid to spindled cells with high nuclear:cytoplasmic
ratio, large, plcomorphic nuclei with prominent nucleoli, numerous mitoses and amphophilic cytoplasm with

intracytoplasmic pigment. Areas of necrosis are seen. The tumour cells show strong positive staining for
$100, HMB45 and Melan A .

6. "LEVEL III NECK DISSECTION".
Four lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy (0/4).

7. "LEVEL IV NECK DISSECTION“.
Six nodes with no evidence of malignancy (0/6).

8. "LEVEL V A NECK DISSECTION PLUS OCCIPITAL".
Five lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy (0/5).

9. "LEVEL V B NECK DISSECTION“.
Nine lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy (0/9).

SUMMARY
. Anterior occipital lymph nodes - METAS'I‘ATIC MELANOMA. please see report.

. Neck, level 1A lymph nodes - No evidence of malignancy in three lymph nodes (0/3).
