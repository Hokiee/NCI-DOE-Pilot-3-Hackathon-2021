Report : GROSS EXAMINATION:

The specimen is received fresh in a container labeled with
the name of the patient and labeled as esophagus, NOS. The
specimen consists of an esophagus and partial stomach
segment. The esophagus measures 10.5 cm in length and ranges
from 4—6 cm in circumference. The stomach measures 8.5 cm in
length and ranges from 5 to 10.2 cm in circumference. An
obstructive mass located at the gastroesophageal junction
measures 3.4 x 3.4 x 3.7 cm. The mass is polypoid and
ulcerated and encompasses approximately 99% of the GE
junction. The mass is 8.9 cm from the proximal margin and 5
cm from the distal margin. The mass extends through the wall
to within 0.1 cm of the adventitial margin, which is inked
orange. Proximal and distal margins are submitted in blocks
l—2 respectively for frozen section.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: Al: Esophageal margin free of
tumor.
A2: Gastric margin free of tumor. (

  

The adventitial margin is sampled in blocks 3 and 4.
Sections of the mass are submitted in blocks 5—8. An
additional ulcerated mass located in the stomach one cm
distal from the larger mass measures 2.2 cm in width and 0.9
cm in thickness. The second tumor measures 2 cm from the

closer gastric margin and 12 cm from the farther esophageal
margin. Representative sections are submitted in blocks
9-10. A random section of proximal esophagus is submitted in
block 11. A random section of mid esophagus is submitted in

block 12. Possible lymph nodes are submitted as foll -
Three in block 13, one in block 14, one in block 15.“

DIAGNOSIS BASED ON GROSS AND MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

Esophagus, esophagogastrectomy:

— Esophagogastric adenocarcinoma, grade 2, 3.7 cm in
greatest dimension.
— Tumor invades through muscularis prOpria into
perieSOphageal soft tissue.
— Radial (adventitial) margin is focally positive.

— Proximal and distal resection margins are negative.
— Separate gastric adenocarcinoma, grade 2, 2.2 cm in
greatest dimension.

-Tumor invades through muscularis propria into
perieSOphageal soft tissue.

— Proximal, distal, and radial resection margins are
negative.

— Two of seven lymph nodes, positive for metastatic
adenocarcinoma (2/7).
— Intradepartmental consultation obtained.
