GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. RIGHT TUBE AND OVARY
Received fresh is a 90 gm ovary and fallopian tube. There is a 7 x 5 x 4.5 cm thin walled multiloculated. translucent
paratubal cyst ﬁlled with clear ﬂuid. There are no papillary excrescences seen. Representative sections submitted for
frozen section and resubmitted for permanent examination in cassette FSAI. The ovary measures 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm.
The ovary is bisected to reveal pale yellow cut surface. One corpus luteum cyst is present measuring 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.7
cm. The fallopian tube measures 7.5 cm in length. 0.5 cm in diameter. Serial section through the fallopian tube to
reveal unremarkable cut surface. Representative sections submitted for microscopic examination as follows:

A1: cyst

A2: section from the ovary

A3: 3 sections from the fallopian tube

A4: 2 sections from the paratubal cyst
B. UTERUS WITH LEFT TUBE. OVARY AND CERVIX
Received in formalin is a 1,421 gm uterus with left fallopian tube and ovary. The uterus measures 19 cm from
superior to inferior, 10 cm from right to left, 14 cm from anterior to posterior. The cervix measures 5.5 cm in length. 4
cm in diameter. Serosal surface is pale, smooth and glistening. Multiple Ieiomyomas are identiﬁed protruding from
the anterior surface ranging in size from 2.5 cm in diameter to 9 x 5.5 x 4 cm. The anterior uterus is inked in blue,
posterior is inked in black. The uterus is bivalved to reveal multiple Ieiomyomas in the myometrium and right under
endometrium ranging in size from 0.7 cm in diameter to 8 cm in diameter. The endometrial cavity is distorted by the
leiomyomas. The Ieiomyoma is serial sectioned to reveal white whorled cut surface with focal necrosis. The uterine
cervix is sectioned to reveal a cystic lesion containing yellow sticky material at posterior cervix measuring 2.5 cm in
diameter. The left ovary measures 3 x 2 x 1.5 cm. The left fallopian tube measures 8 cm in length and 0.6 cm in
diameter. A paratubal cyst measuring 2 cm in diameter is identiﬁed with thin wall and contains clear ﬂuid. The ovary
and fallopian tube are serial sectioned to reveal unremarkable cut surface. Summary of sections submitted for
microscopic examination as follows:

6.5 x 4.8cm needle localized lumpectomy with radiograph. Ink code: anterior-orange, posterior-black, superior-blue,
inferior-yellow, medial-green, lateral-red. Specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 7 slices revealing
a 2 x 2 x 2cm tan white firm well circumscribed mass. 0.6cm from the closest posterior margin in slices 3-5. A portion
of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representatively submitted:

G1: medial margin slice 1

ER: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0
PR: Negative Allred Score: 2 = Proportion Score 1 + Intensity Score 1
COMMENT:

The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the proportion score
(0 = no staining. 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining. 3 = 11-30% of cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of
cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate
intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring range from 0 to 8.

ER/PR positive is deﬁned as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is deﬁned as an Allred score of less than
or equal to 2.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
lmmunohistochemistrv was nerfnrmed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 105, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100)
provided by Dako ) following the manufacturer 5 instructions. This assay was not modiﬁed.
Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,
information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.
