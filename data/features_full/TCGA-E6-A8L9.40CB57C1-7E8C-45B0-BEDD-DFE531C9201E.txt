DIAGNOSIS:
A. OMENTUM:
- BENIGN FATTY TISSUE

B. UTERUS. TUBES AND OVARIES:
- HIGH GRADE PAPILLARY SEROUS CARCINOMA OF THE UTERUS

— THE TUMOR INVADES INTO MORE THAN 50% OF THE MYOMETRIAL THICKNESS (15/29MM)
- LYMPHONASCULAR INVASION IS IDENTIFIED

- RIGHT OVARY WITH OVARIAN ENDOMETRIOID CARCINOMA WITH MIXED SEX CORD
FEATURES, SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT AND NOTE
- LEFT OVARY WITH FIBROMA/FIBROTHECOMA
— BILATERAL FALLOPIAN TUBES ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR
- UTERINE LEIOMYOMATA
- CERVIX WITH TUNNEL CLUSTER, NABOTHIAN CYST, AND NO TUMOR INVOLVEMENT
- SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT

NOTE: The ovarian endometrioid carcinoma shows mixed granulosa and Sertoli tumor features. The
ovarian carcinoma has morphologic features different from the serous endometrial carcinoma,

therefore, this tumor should be considered as a synchronous primary carcinoma
Case was discussed with Dr.

C. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES:
- ELEVEN LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/11)

D. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES:

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. OMENTUM
Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and ‘omentum' is a tan yellow segment of
omentum 24 x 11 x 2.50m. The specimen is serially sectioned. No lesions or nodules are grossly
identiﬁed. Representatively submitted in A1—A2.
B. UTERUS, TUBES AND OVARIES
Received fresh for frozen section is a 3939 TAH with 880. The uterus is 11cm from fundus to
ectocervix, 10cm from comu to cornu and 8.5cm from anterior to posterior. The serosa is tan pink and
smooth and inked black. The attached cervix is 30m in diameter and 2.8cm in length. The ectocervix is
remarkable for a 0.1cm patent slit like 05. The specimen is bivalved into anterior and posterior halves to
reveal a patent endocervical canal 1.6cm. The endometrial cavity is 9cm in length and 6cm from cornu
to comu and is remarkable for a 6 x 5cm tan pink friable mass occupying 90% of the endometrial cavity.
The mass grossly appears to involve less than 50% of the myometrium (6mm). The trabeculated
myometrium is 20m. The attached right tan pink cerebriform ovary is 3 x 2 x 1.8m. is bivalved to reveal
unremarkable parenchyma and a 0.7cm corpora albicantia. The attached right fimbriated fallopian tube
is 60m in length x 0.4cm in diameter. The tube is serially sectioned to reveal a patent lumen. The
attached left tan pink cerebriform ovary is 4 x 2.5 x 2cm, is bivalved to reveal unremarkable
parenchyma. The attached left ﬁmbn'ated fallopian tube is 5.5cm in length x 0.90m in diameter. The
fallopian tube is serially sectioned to reveal a patent lumen. Gross photographs are taken. A portion of
the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representatively submitted as follows:
FSB1: posterior endomyometrium
F832: left ovary
FSBS: right ovary
B4: anterior cervix
BS: posterior cervix
36-37: anterior endomyometrium
38: leiomyomas
BQ—B13: posterior endomyometrium
B14: representative section of right ovary
B15: right fallopian tube
B16: representative section of left ovary
B17: left fallopian tube
C. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES
Received in formalin labeled with the patient’s identiﬁcation and 'left pelvic lymph nodes’ are multiple
tan pink soft tissue fragments aggregating to 6.5 x 4 x 3cm. Dissection reveals eleven lymph nodes
ranging from 3.4 x 2.6 x 20m to 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3cm.
C1: four lymph nodes
C2: ﬁve lymph nodes
C3: one lymph node

C4-C5: one lymph node

D. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and ‘right pelvic lymph nodes' are multiple
tan pink soft tissue fragments aggregating to 3.5 x 2.4 x 1.7cm. Dissection reveals four lymph nodes
ranging from 3 x 3 x 1.4cm to 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.30m.

D1: two lymph nodes

D2: one lymph node

03: one lymph node

E. PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODES

Received in formalin labeled with the patient’s identiﬁcation and ‘para-aortic lymph nodes’ are multiple
tan pink soft tissue fragments aggregating to 3 x 2.6 x 1.5cm. Dissection reveals ﬁve lymph nodes
ranging from 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.6cm to 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.3cm.

E1: three lymph nodes

E2: two lymph nodes
