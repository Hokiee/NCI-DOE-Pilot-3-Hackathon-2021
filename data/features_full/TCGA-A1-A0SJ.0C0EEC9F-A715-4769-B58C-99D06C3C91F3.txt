Note: The tumor present In the main mastectomy specimen (part D) encompasses a 7.5 cm maximal
area, which includes an area of tumor satellites adjacent to a 6.5 cm solid tumor mass. The tumor
consists of infiltrating trabeculae, nests and glands of cells with ample and mostly clear cytoplasm,
and large pleomorphlc nuclei with nucleoli. Abundant mitotic figures are present. Ductal carcinoma in
situ is also present with cribriform, micropapillary, and comedo patterns, and shows cytology similar to
that of invasive tumor, with cells showing clear cytoplasm and pleomorphic high~grade nuclei. The
DCIS is present only as scattered foci admixed within the Invasive carcinoma Itself. Material from the
patient's prior biopsy (. ‘) shows analogous features.

Invasive carcinoma are present at the inked anterior—superior margin of the main specimen (slides DZ,
DB; see details in synoptic below), however, the separately submitted additional margin (part E),
shows invasive tumor that is narrowly (<0.5mm) excised (slide E8). In this specimen (part E), there
is also tumor extending to the edges of the specimen that were indicated by the surgeon as not the
new margin.

The skin nodule (part F) shows invasive ductal carcinoma (0.6 cm) within the Subcutaneous tissue,
dermis and immediately beneath the epidermis, where it is seen to Involve an area of fibrosis that is
suggestive of a skin scar. The tumor is within 0.5 mm of the excision margin, however, the separately
submitted new skin margin (part G) shows no tumor.

The extensive clear cell features and nested architecture of the tumor are morphologic features that
are often seen in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Therefore, this possibility was considered and
immunohistochemical studies were performed and evaluated on a lymph node metastasis (block B7)
and interpreted as follows:

Surgical Patholo y — . Working Draft

CD10: Negative (result does not support renal tumor).

Renal cell carcinoma Ab (RCC): Positive (result supports renal tumor).
Cytokeratin 7: Positive (result does not support renal tumor).
E-Cadherin: Positive (result does not support renal tumor).

Estrogen receptor: Negative (result does not support renal tumor).
Overall, while RCC Ab is positive, all other stains are indicative of this being metastatic breast
carcinoma in a lymph node that has features mimicking RCC.

An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors was performed on block A1
(lymph node).

The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is strong nuclear staining in >70% of tumor cells.

The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There Is at least weak nuclear staining in >10°/o of
tumor cells, with strong staining in ~5% of tumor nuclei.

Result of HERZ/neu test: This carcinoma ls indeterminate for HERZ/neu oncoprotein over-expression.

An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block A1 using the CB11 monoclonal antibody to
HER2/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 2 on a scale of 0—3 (HERZ test
interpreted by Dr.

Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HERZ/neu oncoprotein.

Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indeterminate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with
staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene ampliﬁcation. All carcinomas with staining Intensity scores of 2 are therefore
submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetlcs laboratory.

 

Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered posltlve for over-expression of HERZ/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in
this category show an excellent correlation between the results of lmmunohlstochemlcal and FISH testing, and almost always show
gene amplification.
