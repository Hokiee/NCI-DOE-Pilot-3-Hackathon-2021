GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. SLN #1 RIGHT AXlLLA
Received fresh labeled with the patient's patient and designated "sentinel lymph node number one right
axilla" is a fragment of lymphoid tissue measuring 1.9 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm. Touch preparation is performed.
Entirely submitted, A1.
B. RIGHT BREAST
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "right breast" is a previously
inked, oriented. 13-9, 4 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm lumpectomy specimen. The short suture designates superior,
long-lateral. Ink code: Anterior-yellow, posterior-black, medial-green, lateral-red, superior-blue, inferior-
orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 6 slices revealing a ﬁrm tan
mass, 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm, located 0.1-cm from the nearest anterior margin. A portion of the specimen is
submitted for tissue procurement. The remainder of the specimen is entirely submitted:
81-32: Perpendicular sections medial margin
33-34: Slice 2, B4 demonstrates mass
85-86: Slice 3, 86 demonstrates mass
87—88: Slice 4, BB demonstrates mass
39-810: Slice 5, B10 demonstrating remainder of mass
B11-B12: Perpendicular sections lateral margin
C. ADDITIONAL ANTERIOR MARGIN
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "additional anterior margin" are
two previously inked (black at ﬁnal margin) fragments of adipose tissue together weighing 1 g and
measuring 2 x 1 x 0.3 cm in aggregate. The entire specimen is submitted, C1.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #1, RIGHT AXlLLA, EXCISION:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1).

B. BREAST, RIGHT. WIDE LOCAL EXCISION:

- INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 3 WITH FOCAL NECROSIS, MEASURING 1.2-CM

CENTRAL NECROSIS, MICROCALCIFICATIONS, AND LOBULAR EXTENSION

- INVASIVE TUMOR INVOLVES ANTERIOR SURGICAL RESECTION MARGIN (SEE PART C)

- BIOPSY SITE CHANGES WITH FIBROSIS

- SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT.

C. BREAST, ADDITIONAL ANTERIOR MARGIN, EXCISION:
- FATTY BREAST TISSUE, NO TUMOR SEEN.

METHODOLOGY:
Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
Her.) analvsiswas performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit= ,

") using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modiﬁed. External kit-slides
pr0vided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-
house known HER2 ampliﬁed control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well
preserved, clearvcut invasive carcinoma was identiﬁed for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2
immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided
by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.

This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from
A800 and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. Pathology

Patthsion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit

Case No
Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED
Clinical Interpretation of results

Ampliﬁcation of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase ﬂuorescence in-situ
hybridization (FISH) on formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn embedded tissue sections using a chromosome
17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the F
, by Dr , , ». A majority of tumors cells displayed moderate polysomy 17
with 2 to 4 chromosome 17 signals and 2 to 4 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0,

consistent with no ampliﬁcation of the HER2/neu gene.

Block used Source of case:
Tissue ﬁxation formalin-ﬁxed tissue Outside Case NozNA
Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes

HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.1

This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of
CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic
mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded.

Method of ratio enumeration: manual count
Limitations

The Vysis Patthsion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is
intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free
and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding
adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical lnfonnation should also be taken into
consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status.

No

treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-

2/neu
gene ampliﬁcation status alone.
Overview of this test
FDA APPROVED REAGENT

Patthsion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of
patients for whom Herceptin® therapy is being considered. These tests were performed
of Dr.. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the

clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.
