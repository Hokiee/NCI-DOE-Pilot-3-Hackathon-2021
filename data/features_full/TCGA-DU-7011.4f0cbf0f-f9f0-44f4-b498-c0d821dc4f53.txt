Operation/Specimen: Brain, craniotom .

Clinical History and Pre—Op Dx: _ with large brain
tumor

with focal area of enhancement.

GROSS PATHOLOGY:

A. Received fresh, three fragments, 1.9 cm across in aggregate.

Soft,
tannish~gray, focally hemorrhagic. In total #1 and 2.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, right frontal: Glioma.
B. Received fresh, fragment of brain, 2.2 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm. Gray and
white matter with 0.8 cm central defect, and grayish semi—firm

white matter. In total #3—5.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, right frontal: Atypical glial
cells, no tumor.

C. "3 and 4," received fresh, one fragment of soft tissue, 1.1 cm
across. Soft, tannishmwhite, focally hemorrhagic. In total
#6 and 7.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, area of enhancement: Glioma and
couple of abnormal vessels.

D. "4," several fragments, 1.1 cm across in aggregate. Brownish~red,
soft, focally hemorrhagic. In total #8—12.

MICROSCOPIC: A. Portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white
matter. The white matter appears hypercellular and rarefied. There
is

a uniform proliferation of astrocytes with star—like cytoplasm. In

 

between these cells, there are normal oligodendrocytes and a
sprinkling

of naked hyperchromatic nuclei, which are usually round or elongated.
There are no mitotic figures or microvascular cellular proliferation.
The cerebral cortex is unremarkable.

B. Portions of cerebral cortex and white matter. The white matter is
extensively rarefied and somewhat hypercellular with a sprinkling of
atypical nuclei as described for part A.

C. Portions of cerebral cortex and white matter in which there is a
neoplasm similar to that one described for part A and B. However, in
this specimen, the tumor appears more cellular, and is infiltrating
the cerebral cortex with perineuronal satellitosis. There are also
vessels with slight endothelial hyperplasia. Mitotic figures,
microvascular cellular proliferation, and necrosis are absent.

D. Portions of cerebral cortex and white matter with neoplasm similar
to the one described above. In here, the neoplasm involves the
cerebral cortex which is focally completely effaced. In some of these
areas the background is very loose, scantily fibrillary, and suggests
microcytic change. Again, features of anaplasia are absent.

SPECIAL STAINS: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP and MIB*l were
performed on sections from blocks 4, 8 and 11.

The GFAP brings up the diffuse but regular sprinkling of the lesion by
star—like plump astrocytes, and a delicate fibrillary background.
With
the MIB—l a proliferation index of 1.5% to 2% is determined in the
more
cellular areas.

COMMENT: In all these specimens there is a low histological grade
glial neoplastic proliferation. The neoplastic cells are rounded or
elongated hyperchromatic nuclei. The neoplastic cells are diffusely
distributed throughout a rarefied brain parenchyma in which there is a
prominent proliferation of astrocytes with prominent cytoplasm that
resemble gemistocytes. In the area of enhancement, the tumor is more
cellular and/or effaces the cerebral cortex. Throughout the tumor
mitotic activity and microvascular cellular proliferation are
inconspicuous. There are no areas of necrosis. This neoplasm is most
likely an oligodendroglioma or mixed oligoastrocytoma. However, it

may
also be diagnosed as a low grade astrocytoma, perhaps with
gemistocytic
features, or as a protoplasmic astrocytoma.
