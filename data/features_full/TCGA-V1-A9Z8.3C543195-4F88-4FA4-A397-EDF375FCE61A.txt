COMMENT:

Synoptic Comment for Prostate Tumors

- Type of tumor: Small acinar adenocarcinoma.

- Location of tumor: Single very large high-grade tumor predominantly in anterior bilaterally from
apex to base, with extension into posterior areas of prostate as well.

- Estlmated volume of tumor: 36 cc.

- Gleason score: 5+4; primary pattern 5, secondary pattern 4.

- Estimated volume > Gleason pattern 3: 90%.

- Involvement of capsule: Tumor invades capsule.

- Extraprostatlc extension: Present, extensive in multiple locations: Left anterior apex (slide E2),
left and right anterior base (slides E6, 515, E17), left posterolateral base and mid gland (slides E11,
E12, 619), and extensive bladder neck invaslon Slides E16,17).

base, Gleason pattern 5 (4 x 1.5 cm) in slides El, E3456, E13, 517.

- Margin status for benign prostate glands: Benign glands at inked margins; bladder margin
bilaterally (slides 516 and 517), including additional biopsy (Part A).

 

 

- High-grade prostatic intraeplthellal neoplasia (HGPIN): None.

- Tumor involvement of seminal vesicle: Present; left side.

- Perineural inﬁltration: Present.

Collection Time!
Relevant History.-

The patient is 3 .year—old man. According to I, he undergoes laparoscopic prostatectomy and
bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection. The patient has a history of Gleason 5+5 prostate cancer.
Elevated PSA.) prompted a needle core biopsy ”which revealed prostatic
adenocarcinoma in all cores with Gleason scores from 4+3=7 to 5+5=10, with perineural invasion seen
at the left base. Bone scan in m is negative for metastatic disease.

Gross Description
The case is received in five parts, labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.

Part A is received fresh and additionally labeled “bladder neck tissue,” and consists of a single soft
irregular piece of cauterized pink-red tissue (1 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm). The entire specimen is frozen for frozen
section diagnosis 1, and subsequently submitted in cassette A1.

Part B is received in formalin and additionally labeled “anterior prostatic fat," and consists of an

irregular piece of lobulated yellow—tan fatty tissue (3.3 x 2.7 x 0.8 cm), which is entirely submitted in
cassettes 31-82. I

Part C is received in formalin and additionally labeled "right pelvic lymph node,“ and consists of multiple
irregular fragments of soft, lobulated, yellow-brown ﬂbrofatty tissue (4.7 x 4.2 x 1.5 cm). Seven
rubbery-firm, yellow-tan lymph nodes (0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm to 2.6 x x 0.6 cm) are identiﬁed. The entire
specimen is submitted in cassettes as follows:

C1: Four lymph nodes.

C2: Two bisected lymph nodes (one inked blue).
C3: One bisected lymph node.

C4-C6: Remaining flbrofatty tissue. I

Part D is received in formalin and additionally labeled “left pelvic lymph nodes,“ and consists of
fragments of soft yellow-brown, lobulated, fatty tissue and ﬂbrofatty tissue (5 x 4.2 x 1.3 cm). Three
rubbery-ﬁrm, yellow-tan lymph nodes (0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm to 4.5 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm) are identified. The
entire specimen is submitted in cassettes as follows:

X

f
i’
D1: Two lymph nodes. - W M .. 1 M W W WM
02-03: One multiply sectioned lymph node.
D4-D6: Remaining flbrofatty tissue.
Part E is received fresh and additionally labeled "prostate and seminal vesicles fresh," and consists of a
asymmetric prostate gland (48.5 gm; 4.2 cm apex to base it 5.2 cm width x 4 cm anterior to posterior)

and attached seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundles (right 4.1 x 2.5 x 0.6 cm and left 3.7 x 2.4 x 0.5
cm).

GROSS ABNORMALITIES: A well—deﬁned mass is not identified. However, an ill-deﬁned, firm, light tan
expansion of the anterior prostatic tissue is present in slices 1-6. The anterior fibrous stroma is open-
the remaining capsule is intact. The remaining prostatic parenchyma is firm and pink-tan. The seminal
vesicles are firm and gray-tan.

ORIENTED BY: Anatomic landmarks; seminal vesicles, urethra.

INKING: Anterior right - green, anterior left - blue, posterior - black.

POTENTIAL STUDIES: Snap-frozen.
