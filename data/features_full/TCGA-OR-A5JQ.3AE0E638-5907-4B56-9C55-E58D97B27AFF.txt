HISTOPATHOLOGY FOR REVIEW

MACROSCOPIC:

Received were 19 slides, labelietf _ -, ,

MICROSCOPIC:

At the request of I the slides have been reviewed. I agree with the
diagnosis of adrenal cortical carcinoma diagnosed by The

tumour is composed of variably pieomorphic cells, which are arranges in diffuse
sheets, nests and cords. The cells have emerged hyperchromatic nucleai.
There are scattered celis with markedly atypical nuclei, including
multi~nucleated forms. Occasional mitoses are present (up to 8/50 hpf).
Atypical mitoses are not identiﬁed. The cells have variable amounts of
eosinophiiio granular cytoplasm. Cell borders are indistinct. There is a
prominent myxoid stroma throughout the tumour. There are also prominent
vessels. There is no capsular or venous space invasion. however sinusoidal
invasion is seen in one area.

immunohistoohemistiy was performed. The tumour cells are positive with
calretinin and meiin A. The tumour demonstrates four of the nine Weiss
criteria, comprising high nuciear grade, loss of clear celis, diffuse
architecture and sinusoidal invasion. In view of this, and the large size of
the tumour, it is best regarded as an adrenal cortical carcinoma.

SUMMARY:
Flight adrenal gland - Adrenal cortical carcinoma.

HISTOPATHOLOGY FOR REVIEW

Slides were reviewed at the request of _treating surgeon). This
review is part of a project examining comparative genomic hybridisation on
adrenal tissue frozen at the time of surgery and involves centralised
histopathologicai review including assignment of a Weiss score to a large
number of adrenal tumours. .

Pathological Diagnosis: Adrenal Cortical Carcinoma
Weight of Adrenal Gland: 1489

Weiss score with number of Weiss criteria present:4

High nuclear grade

Less than 25% Clear celis

Diffuse architecture

Sinusoidal invasion

Note: Many of the cells have oxyphiiic cytoplasm imparting an oncocytoma like
