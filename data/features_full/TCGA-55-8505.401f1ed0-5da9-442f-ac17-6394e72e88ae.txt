bronchial margin, is a 264.1 gram, 18.5 x 14.5 x 4.5 cm long lobectomy specimen.
The pleura is purple and smooth and intact. The bronchial margin is
tangentially frozen as one cassette. There are five black pigmented lobar lymph
nodes, up to 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. Sectioning demonstrates dark
red—purple, soft parenchyma without masses, nodules or other gross
abnormalities. Twelve sections are submitted in five: "A"—"E". Block Summary:

"A","B", vascular margins, tangential; "C", lobar l ' "D", central
parenchyma; "E", peripheral parenchyma with pleura.
