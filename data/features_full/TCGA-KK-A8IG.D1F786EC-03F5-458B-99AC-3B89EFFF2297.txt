ADDENDUM

This modiﬁed report is being issued to provide additional information/results.

Addendum completed by

oraeuosrs

(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 7 (4 + 3) WITH TERTIARY GLEASON
GRADE 5. (SEE COMMENT.)
TUMOR EXTENDING FOCALLY INTO EXTRAPROSTATIC TISSUE.
TUMOR EXTENDING TO THE MARGIN OF RESECTION.
PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH GRADE.
Right and left seminal vesicles, no tumor present.
Segments of right and left vasa deferentia, no tumor present.

COMMENT

The prostate gland contains three foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, one in the transition zone and two in the peripheral zone. The
dominant tumor focus and the one of the highest histologic grade is located in the right and left transition zone. This tumor focus
measures 3.0 x 1.5 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in four cross sections and extensively in the
apical region. This tumor focus exhibits predominately Gleason grades 4 and 3. A minor (tertiary) component of Gleason grade 5
is also present. This tumor exhibits focal extraprostatic extension (less than 1.0 mm) in the right anterior surface of the prostate
and extends to the margin of resection in the anterior apical region. The extent of marginal involvement is 6.0 mm. The two
peripheral zone foci are located in the left posterolateral and right lateral peripheral zone. The tumor located in the left
posterolateral peripheral zone measures 0.8 x 0.4 cm in the largest cross—sectional dimension, and it is present in the ﬁrst cross
section of the prostate. The third tumor focus is located in the right lateral peripheral zone. This tumor measures 0.5 x 0.2 cm in
the largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in one cross section. The non-dominant tumor foci are of lower histologic
grade (Gleason score 613 + 3) and are conﬁned to the prostate with negative margins.

' GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (2.5 x 2.2 x 4.0 cm, 31 grams, post ﬁxation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
right and left posterolateral aspects of the prostate appears symmetrical. A palpable and visible nodule is observed in the left mid
region of the prostate. Serial cross sections after ﬁxation demonstrate ﬁrm areas consistent with tumor in the right transition zone
and right peripheral zone of the ﬁrst three of the four cross sections of the prostate.

The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

SECTION CODE: A1, A2, base of right seminal vesicle and right vas deferens; A3, A4, base of left seminal vesicle and
left vas deferens; A5, prostatic base, right border; A6, A7, prostatic base, right posterior border; A8, A9, prostatic base, central
portion; A10, prostatic base, left border; A11, A12. prostatic base, left posterior border; A13. A14, apex anterior; A15, apex left;
