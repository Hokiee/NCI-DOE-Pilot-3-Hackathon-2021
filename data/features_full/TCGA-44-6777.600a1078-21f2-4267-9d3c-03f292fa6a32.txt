CLINICAL NOTES

PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Lung cancer

GROSS DESCRIPTION

Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin, labeled

"left upper lobe wedge resection". The specimen consists
of a wedge of lung which is 78 gram. The specimen is 15 x 5.5 x 4
cm. and has a stapled margin of 15 cm. The pleura is violaceous
smooth and glistening. There is a l x 1 cm. umbilication in the
pleura. This focus is inked and the specimen is sectioned to show a
3.5 x 2.5 x 2.4 cm. pink tan tumor which shows fibrous stippling
present. This is contiguous within the pleural umbilication.
Representative tissue was submitted for tumor procurement. The tumor
comes within 1.5 cm. of the sacral margin (inked black). The

showing no other discrete gross lesions. Representative sections of
the specimen are submitted as follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1—4 — Representative section of tumor including
pleural umbilicatio nd surgical stapled margin; 5 - representative
of normal. RS-5
