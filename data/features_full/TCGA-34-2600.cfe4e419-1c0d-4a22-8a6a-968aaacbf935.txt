GROSS DESCRIPTION
The specimen is received in multiple parts in saline.

Part 1 is labeled "Level 7 lymph node (station 7)". The specimen consists of one irregular fragment of dark,
grey-black soft tissue resembling lymph node. The specimen measures 0.5 cm. in greatest dimension and is
entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis. The frozen section remnant is entirely submitted labeled 1FSA.

Part 2 is labeled "station 7 lymph node". The specimen consists of multiple irregular rubbery fragments of dark,
grey-black hemorrhagic soft tissue resembling fragments of lymph node. The specimens range from 0.4—0.9
cm. in greatest dimension and are entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis. Frozen section remnants
are submitted entirely labeled ZFSA.

Part 3 is labeled "right Level 4 lymph node (paratracheal). The specimen consists of two irregular rubbery
fragments of tan-grey hemorrhagic soft tissue resembling fragments of lymph node. The specimens measure
0.6 cm. in greatest dimension and 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm, respectively. The specimens are submitted entirely for
frozen section diagnosis. Frozen section remnants are submitted entirely labeled 3FSA.

Part 4 is labeled "Level 3 lymph node". The specimen consists of two irregular fragments of dark grey-black
soft tissue resembling lymph node. Each measure 1.2 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm. The specimens are submitted entirely for
frozen section diagnosis. Frozen section remnants are submitted entirely labeled 4FSA.

Part 5 is labeled "Level 9 lymph node". The specimen consists of-one irregular fragment of rubbery, tan-grey
hemorrhagic soft tissue, measuring 0.8 cm. in greatest dimension. The specimen is bisected and submitted
entirely labeled 5A.

Part 6 is labeled "biopsy of right lower lobe of lung". The specimen consists of four tiny fragments often,
hemorrhagic soft tissue, ranging from less than 0.1-0.4 cm. in greatest dimension. The specimens are
submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis. Frozen section remnants are submitted entirely labeled 6FSA.

Part 7 is received unﬁxed labeled "right lower lobe". it consists of a right lower lung lobe, measuring 18.0 x 15.0
x 6.5 cm and weighing 270 grams. The pleural surface is smooth, shiny, dark gray-pink with focal areas of
anthracotic pigmentation and no gross evidence of adhesion. About the hilus, there are only three identiﬁable
rubbery, gray-black lymph nodes, ranging from 0.5 to 1.4. Also about the hiius, the vascular resection margins
are denoted by lines of steel surgical staples. The bronchial resection margin is patent, grossly unremarkable
and submitted for frozen section diagnosis at the request o—. The frozen section remnant is
submitted entirely labeled 7FSA. The staple lines are removed and the vascular resection margins along with
hilar lymph nodes are submitted in cassette YB. The specimen is then bisected along the long axis. The cut
surface reveals spongy, gray and hemorrhagic parenchyma with a centrally located 2.0 x 7.0 x 0.1 cm lesion.
This lesion is ﬁrm, pale tan and hemorrhagic and poorly circumscribed. The remainder of the cut surface is
grossly unremarkable with patent vessels and bronchloles and occasional clot artifact. Representative tumor
and normal tissue is frozen in bulk and digital images are taken. The pleural surface surrounding the
previously described lesion is inked and additional sections are submitted as follows:

7C-G — tumor with inked pleurat margin.
7H4 - tumor with adjacent normal lung.
7J-K - random normal lung.

Part 8 is received in saline labeled "R4 lymph nodes". it consists of an irregularly—shaped portion of tan-gray
and hemorrhagic, ﬁbroadipose soft tissue with attached rubbery. gray-black lymph nodes. The specimen
measures 5.0 x 2.7 x 1.3 cm overall with the attached lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm in
dimension. The specimen is separated into three equal portions. all of which are further bisected and
submitted entirety labeled 8A through BC.
