1. (Prostate gland): Prostate gland: Weight: 62 9, Volume: 57 ml, Size: 5.0 x 6.8 x 4.8 cm.
Adherent seminal vesicles and deferent duct: right side: 3.3 cm. left side: 5.0 cm. The surface
is marked with green ink on the right side, blue ink on the left side. Apical peri-urethral a
funnel shaped 1.3 x 1.3 cm measuring tissue defect marked with red ink. Total of the cross
sections: 2.3 cm.

Date of cancer sample procurement: II I

Date of pathology report:

Gross description:

2. (Lymph nodes, right side): 5.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm measuring adipose tissue containing five
nodes measuring up to 5.5 cm.
3. (Lymph nodes. left side): 5.0 x 4.5 x 1.5 cm measuring adipose tissue containing three
nodes measuring up to 5.0 cm.

Microscopy:

1. Apex right side and left side: Right side 7 tissue blocks, left side 8 tissue blocks (total 15
tissue blocks). 3 cross sections: Right side 12 tissue blocks. left side 12 tissue blocks (total 24
tissue blocks). Basis right side and left side: Right side 8 tissue blocks, left side 8 tissue
blocks (total 16 tissue blocks). Seminal vesicles right side and left side: Right side 6 tissue
blocks, left side 9 tissue blocks (total 15 tissue blocks). Deferent ducts right side and left side:
Right side 1 tissue block, left side 1 tissue block (total 2 tissue blocks).

2. 9 tissue blocks.

3. 10 tissue blocks.

Diagnosis:

1. (Prostate gland): Poorly differentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma. Gleason 4+5=9. (Gleason
4:80%, Gleason 5:20%). Tumor involves both lobes. Maximum tumor diameter: 46 mm.
Perineural invasion. Tumor inﬁltration into prostatic adipose tissue in 6 tissue blocks mainly in
perivesical adipose tissue (invasion length 4mm. invasion depth 0.8mm). Tumor inﬁltration in

both seminal vesicles. Negative surgical margins (circumference and periurethral).

Remaining prostatic tissue with small foci prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (high grade PIN)
and signs of myoglandular hyperplasia of the prostate. Urothelium of the prostatic urethra
without dysplasia. Tumor-free deferent ducts.

2. (Lymph nodes, right side): Eight tumor-free lymph node(s) (0/8).
3. (Lymph nodes, left side): One lymph node metastasis (2.9mm without extra capsular lymph
node invasion), four tumor-free lymph nodes (115).

Tumor classification
(in consideration of the parallel report and immunohistochemical analyses):
pT3b, Gleason 4+5=9 (Gleason 4:80%, Gleason 520%), maximum tumor diameter: 46 mm,

tumor volume approx. 42.8 ml (Gleason 4: 34.2 ml, Gleason 5: 8.6 ml), pN1 (1/13), LO*, V0.
R0)

Comments:

Tumor inﬁltration into both seminal vesicles in tissue blocks BR2B, BR4B. BL1B, BLZB,
SBR1A and *SLBZB.

Tumor inﬁltration into prostatic adipose tissue in tissue blocks R10, BLSB, BR4B, SBL1A.
SBLZB and SBL4A.

Immunohistochemical analyses (DZ-40. CD31) were performed on tissue blocks SBL1A and
SBR1A. Lymphatic or venous invasion was not identiﬁed.

*At the point of lymph node metastasis a lymphatic invasion must have been present.

One macroscopic image for tumor mapping.
