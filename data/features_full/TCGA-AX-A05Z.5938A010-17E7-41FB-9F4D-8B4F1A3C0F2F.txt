Received fresh, labeled with the patient’s name and "uterus, left fallopian tube, left
ovary, right fallopian tube, right Ovary“, is a 145 gram hysterectomy with bilateral
salpingo-oophorectOmy specimen including an intact uterus with attached bilateral
fallopian tubes and ovaries. The uterus measures 9.3 cm long x 3.0 cm cornu to cornu
and 5.0 cm anterior to posterior. The serosa is pink—tan, smooth. The exocervix
measures 2.5 x 2.5 cm and it is covered by smooth, pink—tan mucosa. The endocervical
canal is covered by pink-tan granular mucosa. There is an exophytic ulcerating
friable tumor located in the anterior and posterior lower uterine segment, measuring
7.0 x 5.0 x 1.0 cm posteriorly and 6.0 x 4.5 x 1.0 cm anteriorly. The tumor is 2.0 cm
from external 03 posteriorly and 3.0 cm from external 03 anteriorly. There is a tumor
nodule in the endOCervical surface, 0.6 cm from external 09 anteriorly, measuring 0.7
x 0.4 x 0.4 cm. The tumor appears no underneath myometrium/stroma invasion. The
tumor is 0.5 cm from closest resection margin which is anterior and posterior radial
lower uterine segment/endocervical wall. The endometrium near the fundus is pink—tan,
smooth and measures 0.4 cm thick. The endometrial cavity without tumor involvement
measures 2.0 x 1.5 cm. The right fallopian tube measures 4.5 cm long x 0.5 cm in
diameter and the left measures 4.0 cm long x 0.5 cm in diameter. Both fallopian tubes
have fimbriated ends, smooth, external surface and unremarkable cut surface. The
right ovary measures 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm and it has a smooth glistening and nodular
yellow—tan cut surface. The left ovary measures 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. It has a smooth,
glistening external surface and multi-cystic cut surface. The cysts measure 0.5 to
1.5 cm in greatest diameter and all the cysts are thin—walled (<o.1 cm) and filled
with clear fluid. Representative sections submitted.

Ink Code: Anterior - blue, posterior - black.
CASSETTE SUMMARY:

Cassette 1A,1B: Anterior (12 o'clock) cervix thr0ugh lower uterine segment,
bisected, yellow ink indicating bisection site.
