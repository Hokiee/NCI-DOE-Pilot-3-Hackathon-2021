SECTION CODE: A1, fibrotic tissue; A2-A5, additional representative sections.

(B) OMENTUM ~ A fragment of fatty soft tissue measuring 30.0 x 16.0 x 1.0 cm. No focal lesions are identiﬁed within the
specimen. Representative sections are submitted.

SECTION CODE: 81-820, representative sections.

(C) LEFT TUBE, LEFT OVARY - An unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

The ovary measures 6.0 x 4.0 x 3.0 cm. Cut surface shows complete replacement of the ovary with a multilobulated,
glistening yellow tumor with focal white areas.

The fallopian tube measures 7.0 cm in length x 1.0 cm in diameter. The fallopian tube has a small 0.2 cm white nodule.
Otherwise, the fallopian tube is unremarkable. Sections are submitted as follows.

SECTION CODE: C1-C3, representative sections of ovary for frozen section; C4, representative section of fallopian tube
with nodule for frozen section; C5-C10, representative sections of ovarian tumor; C11, representative sections of unremarkable
fallopian tube.

'FS/DX: HIGH-GRADE CARCINOMA WITH CL CELL FEATURES INVOLVING OVARY, FAVOR METASTASIS FROM
ENDOMETRIUM. .

(D) UTERUS, RIGHT FALLOPIAN TUBE, RIGHT OVARY - A 9.8 x 7.0 cm uterus with attached 4.0 x 4.0 x 3.0 cervix and right
ovary and fallopian tube which measure 40 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm ovary, 5.0 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter fallopian tube. The
uterus is markedly distorted by multiple nodules. The serosal surface is tan-red, glistening and unremarkable. There is a fungating
mass protruding from the cervical 05 which is friable in consistency. After being bisected, there is a 3.5 x 3.0 x 0.8 am lesion
located in the cervical canal protruding through the cervical 05. The third portion of the cervical canal has no grossly identiﬁable
lesion. The endometrial cavity is distorted by a large nodule which upon sectioning has tan-gray, rubbery and has whorled
appearance. The endometrium measures 5.0 x 4.0 cm and is ﬁlled by a soft friable hemorrhagic tumor throughout the whole
endometrial cavity. The right ovary is distorted by multiple nodules. Fallopian tube is grossly unremarkable. There is a small
portion of vaginal cuff attached to the cervix and is grossly unremarkable.

INK CODE: Cervical margin, vaginal cuff margins are inked black.
L SECTION CODE: D1, D2, anterior vaginal cuff en face; D3, posterior vaginal cuff, en face; 04-06, lower portion of the
egg submitted perpendicularly from anterior to left quadrant; D7-D10, cervix anterior to right quadrant; D10-D12 cervix,

pos error to right quadrant; D13-D15, cervix posterior to left quadrant; D16, representative section of the tumor located in the

D23-D25, tumor in the posterior endometrium; D26. D27, remaining parametrium submitted en face; D28, right fallopian tube and
ovary; D29-D34, representative sections of fibroids. .
(E) LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE - Multiple lymph nodes ranging in diameter from 2.0 cm to 2.9 cm. A 2.1 cm lymph node has a
possible focus of carcinoma measuring 1.6 cm. Sections are submitted as follows.

SECTION CODE: E1, E2, one lymph node trisected with possible gross tumor; E3, E4, one lymph node bisected; E5,

submitted as follows.

SECTION CODE: F1. F2, one lymph node serially sectioned; F3, four possible lymph nodes; F4, two possible lymph
nodes; F5, one lymph node bisected; F6, two possible lymph nodes; F7-F11, one lymph node serially sectioned. ‘
(G) PARAAORTIC LYMPH NODES - An elongated piece of tan-red. rubbery tissue intermixed with adipose-like tissue which

SECTION CODE: G1, one lymph node bisected; G2, one lymph node bisected; 63, one lymph node bisected; G4, one
ymph node bisected; GS, one lymph node bisected; GG, one lymph node bisected; G7, one lymph node bisected; G8, G9, one
arge lymph node serially sectioned; GlO-G12. multiple matted lymph nodes.

H) RIGHT GONADAL VESSEL - An unoriented 5.0 cm segment of vessel with attached fatty tissue measuring 2.0 x 5.0 x 2.0
:m. There is a small focus of firmness adjacent to the vessel and compressing the wall, measuring approximately 0.3 x 0.3 x 2.0
:m. The entire specimen is submitted.

SECTION CODE: H1. proximal and distal vessel; H2-H8, serial sections.

I) LEFT COMMON LYMPH NODE - An irregular piece of tan-red adipose tissue like tissue with grossly recognizable lymph
odes. Specimen measures 2.8 x 2.3 x 0.9 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto in two cassettes.
