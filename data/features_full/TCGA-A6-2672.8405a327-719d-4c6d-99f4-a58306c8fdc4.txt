SPECIMEN
Right colon

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Colon cancer

GROSS DESCRIPTION
Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin labelled
"right colon" which is partially covered with pinkutan
smooth glistening serOSa and yellow lobular fat. The specimen
shows
a 6.5 x 0.7 cm appendix and the specimen is predominately covered
with abundant yellow lobular fat. The specimen is opened and has a
6.5 cm portion of small bowel and 26 cm of cecum and colon. The
specimen shows a large ectophytic mass which is 7.0 x 5.5 x 1.2 cm.
This is located 6.5 cm from the distal margin. The cut surface of
the tumor shows gross invasion into the muscularis propria,
however,
showing possible invasion into the fat. This comes within 6.5 cm
of
the radial margin. No other discrete gross lesions are identified.
The average circumference of the small bowel is 4.0 cm and the
average circumference of the cecum and colon is 7.0 cm.
Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows:
BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 _ representative luminal margins and ileocecal
valve; 2 — representative section of appendix with proximal end
inked; 3~5 — representative sections of tumor to normal and fat; 6

radial margin with lymph node at radial margin; 7—8 — nine possible

lymph nodes; 9 — six possible lymph nodes; 10 w three poseible
lymph

nodes; 11 — three possible lymph nodes; 12 — one pOSSible lymph
node

from near radial margin; 13mlé — one lymph node bisected. RS—14.
