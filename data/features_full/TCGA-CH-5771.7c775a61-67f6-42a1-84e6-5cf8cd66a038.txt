Iceman—5771
Diagnosis

1. Pooriy differentiated, multifocal, bilateral adenocarcinoma of the prostate, limited to the
organ (Gleason 4+3=7; tertiary grade 5). Gleason 4: 60%,. Gleason 5: 10%. Maximum tumor
diameter 1.6 cm. Multifocai tumor involvement of perineural sheaths.

Tumor—free surgical preparation margin.

Additional foci of a prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and signs of myoglandular
prostatic hyperplasia. Urotltelium of prostatic urethra without dysplasia.

Tumor—free, regular seminal vesicles and seminal ducts.

2. A tumor—free lymph node on the right (0/1).

3. A tumor-free lymph node on the left (0/ 1).

Tumor classiﬁcation
p120, max. tumor diameter 16 mm, Gleason 4+3=7 (Gleason 4: 60%, tertiary grade 5: 10%), R0,
pNO (0/2).

Remark
In the prior punch biopsies, Gleason 4 and Gleason 5 patterns were also identified.

Additional immunohistochemical studies were initiated to clarify the vascular status. The results
will be presented in a follow—up report.

Follow-up report
Immunohistology: CD3 I , D240

In the meantime, additional immunohistological studies were carried out to establish whether
there was invasion of blood or lymph vessels. These investigations did not show any evidence
that the tumor had inﬁltrated the blood or lymph vessels.

Final tumor classification:
pTQe. max. tumor diameter 16 mm. Gleason 4+3 7 (Gleasonéi: 60%, ternary grade 5: 10%), L0,
V0, R0, pNO (0/2).
