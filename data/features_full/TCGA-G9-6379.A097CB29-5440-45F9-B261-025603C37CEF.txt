INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:

FSAIFSB-right and left pelvic iym hn d We alive for carcinoma.
Diagnoses called by Dr. to Dr. at%

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. RIGHT PELVlC LYMPH NODES

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "right pelvic lymph nodes" is a 3 x 2 x 1 cm
piece of soft tissue containing 3 lymph nodes; the largest is inked blue and bisected. Lymph nodes are
submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis in cassette FSA.

B. LEFT PELVlC LYMPH NODES

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "left pelvic lymph nodes“ is a 2.5 x 1.7 x 0.8
cm piece of soft tissue containing 3 lymph nodes; the largest is inked blue and bisected. Lymph nodes
are submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis in cassette FSB.

C. PROSTATE

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "prostate" is a 34-9 resected prostate gland
measuring 4 cm from right lateral to left lateral. 3.6 cm from anterior to posterior. and 2.9 cm from apex
to base. The capsule is smooth. red. and intact. ink code: Anterior-orange. apex—red. base~blue. right
lateral-green. leﬁ lateral-yellow. posterior-black. After removal of apex and base, the prostate weighs
23 g and has a nodular tan parenchyma. The right seminal vesicle is 2.6 x 1.3 x 0.4 cm and the toll is
2.4 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm; they consist of cystic tan tissue. The right vas deferens is 1.7 x 0.6 cm and the left is
1.5 x 0.6 cm; they consist of tubular tan tissue. Tissue ls procured (11 Grams); submitted entirely:

021: base with right seminal vesicle and vas deferens

022: base with left seminal vesicle and vas deferens

023: right seminal vesicle and vas deferens

024: left seminal vesicle and vas deferens

DIAGNOSIS:

A. LYMPH NODE. RiGHT PELVIC. BIOPSY:
- THREE LYMPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (013).

B. LYMPH NODE. LEFT PELVIC. BIOPSY:
- THREE LYMPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/3).

C. PROSTATE. PROSTATECTOMY:
- ADENOCARCINOMA 0F PROSTATE. GLEASON GRADES 4 + 3 = 7/10. WITH A
TERTIARY ELEMENT OF GLEASON PATTERN 5.

 

- TUMOR INVADES RIGHT SEMINAL VESICLE
