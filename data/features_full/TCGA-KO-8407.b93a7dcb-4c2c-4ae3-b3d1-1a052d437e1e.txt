DIAGNOSIS
(A) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND:

 

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CHROMOPHOBE TYPE, FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3

(10.5 CM).
TUMOR CONFINED TO THE KIDNEY.(SEE COMMENT)
Ureteral, vascular and soft tissue margins of resection free of
tumor.
One perinephric lymph node, no tumor present.
Adrenal gland, no tumor present.
(B) RETROPERITONEAL LYMPH NODES:
Ten lymph nodes, no tumor present.

COMMENT

Although the tumor is in close proximity to the renal sinus, multiple
sections failed to demonstrate invasion into the renal sinus adipose
tissue. Tumor is present within vascular/lymphatic spaces in the sinus.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND - A left kidney with surrounding
perinephricfat (21.0 x 12.5 x 10.5 cm, overall), and adrenal gland (7.5

x 1.5 x 0.3 cm).

The kidney (21.0 x 12.3 x 9.0 cm) contains a variegated tan-red
well-circumscribed mass (10.5 x 12.3 x 9.0 cm), that replaces about 90%
of renal parenchyma, pushes into the perinephric fat and into the pelvis
and has possible extensive involvement of the renal sinus.

The remainder of the renal parenchyma appears unremarkable with a well
defined cortico-medullaryjunction. The renal vein, artery and ureter
margins appear unremarkable. Cut section of the adrenal gland reveals
unremarkable adrenal parenchyma. One lymph node (0.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm) is
identiÔ¨Åed in the perinephric fat.

INK CODE: Black - perinephric fat margin.

SECTION CODE: A1, renal artery, vein and ureter margin, en face;
A2-A4, tumor to perinephric fat margin (closest to tumor); A5, one
bisected lymph node; A6-A8, tumor to renal pelvis; A9-A14,
representative sections of tumor (A12 contains section with probable
tumor in parenchymal vessel; A15, A16, tumor to normal kidney
parenchyma; A17, uninvolved renal parenchyma; A18, adrenal gland;
A19-A21, additional sections from tumor adjacent to renal sinus.

(B) RETROPERITONEAL LYMPH NODES - A fragment of soft tissue measuring
8.0 x 2.0 x 0.4 cm. Multiple lymph nodes ranging from 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.4
cm to 2.2 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm identified.

SECTION CODE: B1, three lymph nodes; B2, two lymph nodes; B3, one
lymph node (1.8 cm), bisected; B4, one lymph node, sectioned; B5, one
lymph node, bisected; B6, one lymph node (2.2 cm), bisected; B7, one
lymph node.

CLINICAL HISTORY
Left renal mass, retroperitoneal mass.
