Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled #2, "right upper lobe"

Intraoierative Consultation: NEGATIVE MARGIN. NO TUMOR SEN PER DR.

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled ”, right

upper lobe". It consists of a lobe of lung weighing 238 grams and
measuring 17 x 12.5 x 4.5 cm in greatest dimension. A 0.7 x 0.6 cm
puckered area is identified approximately 4.5 cm from the stapled and
vascular margins. The bronchial and vascular margins are grossly
unremarkable. Multiple peiibronchial lymph nodes are identified measuring
from 0.1 up to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is sectioned to
reveal a 3.7 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm ill—defined firm stellate mass at

approximately 4.5 cm frorn the bronchial and vascular margins. The mass
grossly corresponds to the previously described pleural puckering. The
remaining lung parenehyma is red—brown, congested with no other masses
present. The mass grossly does not appear to involve the bronchus. The
bronchial margin is entirely frozen in TBS. Additional random sections of
the remainder of the specimen are submitted in 2A—2I.

Designation of Sections: ZFS- frozen section, ZA— vascular margins, 2B-2E-
tumor with closest pleura inked blue, 2F— tumor with adjacent uninvolved
parenchyma, 2G—21- peribronchial lymph nodes
