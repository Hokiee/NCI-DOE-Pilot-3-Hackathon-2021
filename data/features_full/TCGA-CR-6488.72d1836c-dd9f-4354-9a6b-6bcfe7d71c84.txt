Operative Findings: Unspecified

Operative Diagnosis: Unspecified

Tissue Submitted: l)ventral tongue margin; 2)ﬂoor of mouth

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1) SOURCE: Ventral Tongue Margin

Received fresh for intraoperative consultation in a container identified
with the patient's name and medical record number is a sample labeled
"ventral tongue margin." The sample consists of a 3.0 X 0.4 X 0.2 cm thin
strip of skin. The sample is bisected (inked green Where sample is
bisected) and submitted in entirety for frozen section analysis. The tissue
block was fragmented during frozen section analysis and specimen was
refrozen. The remainder of the sample is submitted in entirety for

permanent sections.
Summary of sections: 1AFSC, 2/ 1.

2) SOURCE: Floor of Mouth Margin

Received fresh for intraoperative consultation in a container identified
with the patient's name and medical record number is a sample labeled
"ﬂoor of mouth margin." The sample consists of a 3.8 X 0.3 X 0.2 cm
portion of skin with associated soft tissue. The sample is bisected (area
where sample is bisected is inked green). The sample is then submitted in
entirety for frozen section analysis and the remainder for permanent
section.

Summary of sections: 2AFSC, 4/1.

3) SOURCE: Dorsal Anterior Tongue Margin

Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and "dorsal
anterior tongue margin" is a single fragment of pink-tan soft tissue
measuring 4.0 X 0.2 X 0.2 cm and containing a pink-tan mucosal surface
along one edge of the specimen. The specimen is bisected and the cut edges
of each resulting fragment are inked in black. The specimen is submitted in
its entirety for frozen section evaluation in a single cassette.

Summary of sections: 3AFSC, 2/ 1.

4) SOURCE: Dorsal Posterior Tongue Margin

Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and "dorsal
posterior tongue margin" is a single fragment of unoriented, pink-tan soft
tissue, which measures 4.5 X 0.2 X 0.2 cm and contains a pink-tan mucosal
surface along one edge of the specimen. The specimen is bisected and the
cut edges of the resulting fragments are inked in black. The specimen is
submitted in its entirety for frozen section evaluation in a single

cassette.

Summary of sections: 4AFSC, 2/ 1.

5) SOURCE: Left Glossectomy

Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and "left
glossectomy, stitch = anterior" is a hemiglossectomy specimen measuring 7
cm from anterior to posterior X 5.5 cm from medial to lateral X 3 cm from
superior to inferior. A surgical suture is attached to one aspect of the
specimen, which is consistent anatomically with the anterior aspect. The
overlying mucosal surface of the specimen is pink-tan, smooth, shiny, and
remarkable for an area of central ulceration measuring 1.5 X 1.0 cm. This
area of ulceration overlies a palpable, firm mass exhibiting approximate,
palpable dimensions of 2.5 cm from anterior to posterior X 2.0 cm from
medial to lateral X 1.5 cm from superior to inferior. The opposite surface

of the specimen is red-brown and focally cauterized. The specimen is inked
in the following manner: anterior orange, medial purple, posterior yellow,
lateral blue, and deep black. The specimen is serially sectioned from
anterior to posterior to reveal a heterogeneous, white-tan mass with focal
areas of hemorrhage present immediately inferior to the mucosal surface and
exhibiting maximal dimensions of 2.5 cm transversely x 1.3 cm in maximal
depth X 1.5 cm from anterior to posterior. The mass appears to extend to

within 1.4 cm of the medial surgical margin, 1 cm of the lateral surgical
margin, 1 cm of the deep surgical margin, and appears widely free of the
anterior and posterior margins. Representative sections are submitted for
evaluation.

Summary of sections: 5A-5B, perpendicular approach to medial and deep
margins, 1/1 each; 5C, perpendicular approach to lateral margin, 1/1; 5D,
additional approach to lateral margin, 1/1; 5E, representative tumor, 1/1;
5F, representative perpendicular approach to posterior margin, 1/1; 5G,
representative approach to anterior margin, 1/ 1.

6) SOURCE: Left Neck Level 1B

Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and "left

neck level 1B" is a single unoriented fragment of pink-yellow fibrofatty
tissue, which measures 5 X 4 X 1.5 cm. A thorough lymph node search is
performed, which reveals 4 candidate lymph nodes, the largest of which
measuring 1 cm in greatest dimension, as well as normal-appearing salivary
tissue measuring 4 X 2.5 X 1.5 cm. The salivary tissue is serially

sectioned to reveal a homogenous, pink-tan, lobulated cut surface with no
masses or other lesions appreciated. Representative sections of salivary
tissue as well as all candidate lymph node tissue are submitted for
evaluation.

Summary of sections: 6A, representative salivary tissue, 2/1; 6B, 4
candidate lymph nodes, 4/1; 6C, largest candidate lymph node bisected, 2/ 1.

7) SOURCE: Left Neck Level 2 & 3

Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and "left

neck level 2 & 3" is a single, irregular, unoriented fragment of pink-tan

soft tissue, which measures 8 X 5 X 1.0 cm. A thorough lymph node search is
performed, which reveals 12 candidate lymph nodes, the largest of which
measuring 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. All candidate lymphoid tissue is
submitted for evaluation.

Summary of sections: 7A-7C, 4 candidate lymph nodes each, 4/1 each.
