CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm of corpus uteri. Laparoscopic total hysterectomy, B80, and

lymph node sampling.

GROSS EXAMINATION: ‘ .
A. "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries (Ari—3)", received is a 280
gram, 10.6 x 6.8 x 5.5 cm partially morcellated uterus. The specimen is
'unoriented and contains one portion of the cervix (posterior cervix) which is
detached from the specimen. The endocervical canal (2.5 x 1 cm) is white-tan
and has an herringbone pattern. The endometrial canal (not able to be
measured) has a friable, soft endometrium which begins roughly 2.5 cm from the
lower uterine segment. Sectioning reveals a 0.6 cm endometrium overlying a 2
cm myometrium. The friable endometrium does not appear to invade the
myometrium. There are multiple (greater than 20) white, whorled lesions in
the myometrium, the largest of which measures 2 x 2 x 1.9 cm. Sectioning of
these white, whorled lesions does not reveal any hemorrhage or necrosis. The
right tube (partially morcellated) and measures 3 cm in length x 0.6 cm in
diameter and has an unattached fimbriae. Sectioning reveals an unremarkable
tube. The right ovary (2.5 x l.2-x 1 cm) is white, cerebriform, and is
grossly unremarkable. The left tube is also interrupted but measures 2.5 cm
in length x 0.6 Cm in diameter. Sectioning reveals an unremarkable tube and .
fimbriae. The left ovary (2.6 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm) is white, cerebriform, and upon
sectioning contains several corpora albicantia. The serosal surface is, in
areas where it is not morcellated, smooth, tan, and grossly unremarkable.

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

diffusely and strongly positive, consistent with serous tumor. Only
superfiCial myometrial invasion is seen. The tumor does involve the lower
uterine segment, but not the cervix. All of the groSsly visible tumor has been
submitted (tumor size was grosSly difficult to determine). There are foci of

tumor cells within vascular lumens, but not directly attached to the vessel

wall, which is suggestive of, but not definite fer, vascular invasion.

I certify that I personally canduCted the diagnostic evaluation of the above

.specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).
