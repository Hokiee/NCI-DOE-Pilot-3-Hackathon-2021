GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. SENTINEL LN #1 LEFT AXILLA g/Jj/Lf
Received fresh is a tan pink ﬁrm grossly positive lymph node 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.50m. Toto A1.

B. LEFT BREAST MASS

Received fresh labeled with the patient’s identiﬁcation and "left breast needle localization" is an oriented 279, 5.5 x 5
x 3cm needle localized lumpectomy with radiograph. Ink code: anterior-yellow, posterior-black, superior-blue, inferior-
orange, medial-green, lateral-red. Specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 7 slices revealing a 2 x
1.5 x 1.5cm tan pink ill deﬁned mass, closest to anterior margin at 0.4 cm in slices 2-6. A portion of the specimen is
submitted for tissue procurement. Representatively submitted:

B1: medial margin slice 1

32: mass slice 2

33-35: slice 3

B6—BQ: slice 4

510-812: slice 5

B13: mass slice 6

814-316: lateral margin slice 7

C. LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS LEVELS 1, 2

Received fresh are multiple tan pink soft tissue fragments aggregating to 5 x 4 x 2cm. Dissection reveals 12 lymph
nodes rangingfrom 0.1 x0.1x0.1cmto13.x1x1cm.

01:4 lymph nodes

CZ: 4 lymph nodes

C3: 3 lymph nodes

C4: 1 lymph node

05-011: axillary tissue

DIAGNOSIS:
A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 1. LEFT AXILLA, BIOPSY:
— METASTATIC CARCINOMA (1.3 CM IN SIZE) TO ONE LYMPH NODE
WITH NO EXTRANODAL EXTENSION (1/1).

B. BREAST, LEFT, NEEDLE LOCALIZATION WIDE LOCAL EXCISION:
- INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA. SBR GRADE 3.
- TUMOR MEASURES 1.1 CM
- TUMOR IS 0.3 CM FROM THE ANTERIOR MARGIN.
— DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), SOLID TYPE, NUCLEAR
GRADE 3, WITH NECROSIS, MINOR COMPONENT.
- LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU (LCIS), INVOLVING A RADIAL SCAR.
- RADIAL SCAR WITH USUAL DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA AND
MICROCALCIFICATIONS.

C. AXILLARY CONTENTS, LEFT, LEVELS 1 AND 2, DISSECTION:
- EIGHT LYMPH NODES, NO TUMOR SEEN (0/8).

Pathological staging (pTN): pT 10 N 1

SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS
Specimen: Surgical Excision
Block Number: A1 (lymph node with metastasis)

 

 

ER: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3
PR: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3
COMMENT:

The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the proportion score
(0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of
cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate
intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring range from 0 to 8.

ER/PR positive is deﬁned as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is deﬁned as an Allred score of less than
or equal to 2.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136, 1:100)
provided by ‘ following the manufacturer 8 instructions. This assay was not modiﬁed.
interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,
information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.
