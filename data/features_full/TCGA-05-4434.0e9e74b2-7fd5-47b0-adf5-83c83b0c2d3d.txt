Main diagnosis/diagnoses:

Extensive and locoregionally advanced, central to peripheral, very likely primarily peripheral
bronchopulmonary, histologically mixed adenocarcinoma of the right lower lobe of the lung
with pleural invasion and metastatic dissemination to both pleural layers and lymph nodes.
Tumor classification on the basis of this material pT4 le pM1 (PIE) V1 RX, stage IV. C34.3
M 8255/3 G3.

Comment/supplementary remark:

Within the main tumor and the lymph node metastases, which are found within the lung in the
parabronchial region, at the hilus and in sample 5, the large-cell solid tumor component,
which has a partly clear-cell character, is predominant. Especially in the area of the main
tumor margin and the surrounding area the carcinoma shows glandular tubulopapillary and
bronchioloalveolar differentiation. No maturation pattern of squamous epithelium is evident
on conventional histology (immunohistochemical analysis will follow to provide as definitive
confirmation as possible of the bronchopulmonary origin of the tumor and thus exclusion of a
late metastatic spread of the reported breast carcinoma). The RX category is explained by the
fact that the tumor infiltrating the pleura and disseminated there extends as far as the pleural
surface and, with the detection of carcinoma cells in the pleural effusions, the possibility
cannot be excluded that some of them remained there. The central bronchus resection line and
the resection margins of the large pulmonary vessels and the resection preparation of parietal
pleura itself, as registered under 4., are tumor-free

Result of immunohistochemical analysis: a major part of the tumor cells with double
expression of low and high molecular weight keratins (M903 and 902). In the glandular
differentiation component, tumor cell nuclei are positive TTF1.

The immune profile confirms the diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma of the lung of mixed
differentiation.
