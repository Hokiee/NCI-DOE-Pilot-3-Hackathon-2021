GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Left breast biopsy (AF1)", fresh. A 7 x 4.9 x 1.7 cm yellow—white
fibrofatty breast biopsy notable for a 2.5 x 3.5 x 2 cm firm, white lesion.
After consultation with Dr. , it was deemed that no surgical margins
or orientation are required on this specimen. The tissue surface is inked in
black, however. Tissue from the lesion is sent to the Tissue Bank for Estrogen
and Progesterone receptor study. The frozen section remnant (AFl) was taken
from the lesion area is submitted in Block A1. A representative sampling from
the lesion area is submitted in Blocks A2—A5. Due to the fact that neither
margins or orientation is an issue in the specimen, only a sampling of the
lesion is taking-— the entire breast biopsy is not submitted.

 

B. "Left breast", fresh. A mastectomy specimen consisting of a 19 x 10 cm
ellipse of skin, a 24 x 15 x 5 cm breast and a 11 x 6 x 3.5 cm axillary tail.
The deep surfaces of the breast are inked in black. The skin ellipse contains
the nipple and surrounding areola and is notable for a 4.5 cm freshly sutured
horizontal incision medial to the nipple.

The breast specimen is notable for a 7 x 6 x 1.5 cm hollow biopsy cavity lined
by mildly firm, granular red—pink tissue 0.1 cm thick. At its closest point,
the biopsy cavity is 1.5 cm from the posterior surface, 1.7 cm from the
inferior surface, 9 cm from the superior surface, and 1.2 cm from the
overlying anterior skin surface. The remainder of breast is diffusely composed
of yellow—white fibrofatty tissue. No focal lesions are noted.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

B1~ representative section of nipple.

32— representative section of biopsy cavity and closest approach to posterior
surface.

B3— representative section of biopsy cavity and closest approach to inferior
surface.

B4- biopsy cavity and closest approach to anterior skin surface.

BS—BG- additional sections of biopsy cavity.

B7-BB- representative sections of upper medial portion of breast.

B9—BlO— representative sections of lower medial portion of breast.

Bll—BlZ— representative sections of upper lateral breast.

Bl3-Bl4— representative sections of lower portion of breast.

315— four lymph node candidates from most medial portion of axillary tail.

316- four lymph node candidates from mid portion of axillary tail.

817— three lymph node candidates from most lateral portion of axillary tail.

B18- three lymph node candidates from most lateral portion of axillary tail.

819— three lymph node candidates from most lateral portion of axillary tail.
