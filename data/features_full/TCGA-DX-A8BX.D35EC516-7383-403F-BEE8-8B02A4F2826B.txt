DIAGNOSIS:

1. SOFT TISSUE, LEFT RETROPERITON'EAL SARCOMA] LEFT KIDNEY, LEFT
URETER, LEFT ADRENAL GLAND: LARGE EOWEL, DESCEN'DING COLON; RADICAL
RESECTION:

- HIGH GRADE SARCOMA. (SEE NOTE.)

- SIZE: 27.5 CM.

— ANATOMIC INVOLVEMENT: RETROPERITONEAL FIEROADIPOSE TISSUE , SKELETAL
MUSCLE,

RENAL PARENCHYMA, AND THE WALL OF THE DESCENDING COLON.

- NECROSIS: PROMINENT (APPROXIMATELY TWO TEIRDS OF THE TUMOR, MEASURED
GROSSLY) .

- MITOTIC RATE: 65 MIT./10 HPF.
- THE TUMOR EXTENDS TO LATERAL, MEDIAL, ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR MARGINS.
- THE KIDNEY PARENCHYMA IS UNREMARKABLE.
- THE RENAL VASCULAR AND URETERIC MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

- BENIGN ADRENAL GLAND, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

- THE COLONIC MUCOSA IS UNREMARKABLE.

- THE COLONIC SURGICAL MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

- OMEN‘I'U'K, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

- EIGHT BENIGN LYMPH MODES.

2. SKELETAL MUSCLE, FINAL DEEP QUADRATUS AND PSOAS KARGIN: EXCISION:
- SARCOMA INVOLVING SKELETAL MUSCLE AND FIBROADPIPOSE TISSUE.
- TUMOR IS PRESENT AT A BLACK-INKED ADIPOSE TISSUE SURFACE.
- THE BLUE-INRED MUSCLE MARGIN OF RESECTION (SAID TO BE THE “TRUE"
SURGICAL MARGIN’

AS PER IS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
NOTE: THE TUMOR CELLS ARE NEGATIVE FOR 8-100 PROTEIN, CD34, EMA, , SKA,
DESMIN AND
THEY ARE POSITIVE FOR FXIIIA. IMMUNOSTAINS FOR 8—100 PROTEIN, CD34 AND

FXIIIA WERE PERFORMED ON BOTH HIGH GRADE CELLULAR AREAS OF PART 1 AND LESS
CELLULAR AREAS OF PART 2.

ALTHOUGH THE ANATOMIC LOCATION OF THE TUHOR AND sour NYxUID AND SCLEROBINU
FEATURES SUGGEST THE POSSIBILITY OF A DEDIFFERENTIATED LIPOSARCOKA, MULTIPLE
SECTIONS OF PERITUNORAL ADIPOSE TISSUE FAIL To REVEAL UNEQUIVOCAL FEATURES
OF A WELL DIFFERENTIATED ADIPOCTTIC NEOPLASH. THUS. IT SEEMS BEST NOT TO BE
DEFINITIVE, AND TO DESIGNATE THE TUMOR AS A PLEONORPHIC HIGH GRADE SARCOMA,

'MALIGNANT FIRBOUS HISTIOCYTOMA') .

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF

Gross Description:

1.) The specimen is received fresh labeled, "radical resection left
retroperitoneal sarcoma" and consists of a left retroperitoneal dissection
including left kidney and ureter, descending colon (including pericolic fat
and a portion of omentum), left adrenal gland, and retroperitoneel fat.
Within the retroperitoneal {at is a multilobated soft tissue mass which
distorts normal anatomic relations within the retroperitoneum. Surgical
margins are inked black. The two larger lobes of the mass measure 17.5 x
16.0 x 13.2 cm and 10.0 x 8.0 x 7.5 cm. Both lobes appear rounded in
contour and well-circumscribed for the most part. Focally, the mass appears
to extend irregularly into perirenal Eat, through the kidney capsule and
into the lower pole of the kidney, as well as into the muscularis o! the
descending colon. Medial to the descending colon, the mass has a
hemorrhagic defect measuring 2.0 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm. Pericolic fat is adherent
in this area. Sectioning through this mass reveals a firm tan-white nodular
mass with extensive necrosis (approximately 60-70% of the larger nodule).

------------------------------------------------------------ Page 3 of 4
Focally, the mass has yellowish fatty areas and focally appears fleshy. The
tumor extends to lateral, medial, anterior and posterior margins. The
superior and inferior margins are grossly free of tumor. The portion of
colon measures 47 cm in length, with a proximal margin circumference
measuring 8.5 cm and a distal margin circumference of 5.0 cm. In its
midportion, the bowel is adherent to the soft tissue mass, which invades the
muscularis. The mucosa is unremarkable. Pericolic fat along the length of
the colon measures up to 5 cm in thickness. Multiple lymph nodes are found
within the fat. The omentum measures 20.0 x 14.0 x 2.0 cm. The left kidney
measures 11.0 x 5.5 x 5.0 cm. The renal capsule is thickened and appears
infiltrated as described above. A firm whitish circumscribed nodule
penetrates to 2.0 cm into the kidney parenchyma. Sectioning of the kidney
reveals otherwise unremarkable renal parenchyma. The ureter measures 20.0 by
0.5 cm. The ureter is separable from the mass by a tissue plane. The
adrenal gland measures 5.0 n 2.0 x 1.5 cm. Sectioning reveals a hemorrhagic
center. Located laterally with respect to the descending colon, is a
portion of skeletal muscle measuring 6.0 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is
photographed. Portions of tissue are submitted for possible future electron
microscopy and for TPS.

Summary of sections:

2.) The specimen is received fresh labeled, "final deep quadratue and psoas
margin'I and consists of multiple pieces of skeletal muscle and fibroadipose
tissue measuring 15 x B x 3 cm in aggregate. The specimen is disrupted but
appears to have a smooth surface and a rough surface. at one end. The
roughened surface is inked blue and the smooth surface is inked black.
Disrupted areas are not inked. Sectioning reveals unremarkable skeletal
muscle and fibrofatty connective tissue. Representative sections submitted.
