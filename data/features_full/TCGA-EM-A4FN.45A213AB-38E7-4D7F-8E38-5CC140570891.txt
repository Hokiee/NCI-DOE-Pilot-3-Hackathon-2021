Gross Description
1. The specimen labeled with the patients name and as "right paratracheal lymph node at thymus“ consists of a piece of

ﬁbroadipose tissue that measures 2.2 x 1.6 x 0.5 cm. It contains two query lymph nodes measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 and 0.6
x 0.5 x 0.4 cm, respectively.
1A two lymph nodes

2. The specimen labeled with the patients name and as "thyroid left paratracheal node stitch left superior pole" consists of
an oriented thyroid gland with attached ﬁbroadipose tissue on the inferior aspect that weighs 17.2 g. The right lobe
measures 3.8 cm SI x 2.3 cm ML x 1.2 cm AP, the left lobe measures 3.4 cm Si x 2.3 cm ML x 1.0 cm AP and the isthmus
measures 3.2 cm Sl x 2.1 cm ML x 1.4 cm AP. The ﬁbroadipose tissue measures 4.3 SI x 3.8 ML x 1.1 cm AP. The
external surfaces have ﬁbrous adhesions and are painted with silver nitrate. No parathyroid glands are identiﬁed grossly.
The isthmus contains one well delineated nodule that measures 1.7 cm SI x 1.6 cm ML x 1.9 cm AP. A second well
delineated nodule is identiﬁed in the inferior left lobe and measures 0.8 SI x 0.7 ML x 0.6 cm AP. Both nodules are tan
and firm. Multiple lymph nodes are identiﬁed on the inferior soft tissue ranging in size from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm to 1.7 x 0.9 x
0.8 cm. The remainder of the thyroid tissue is grossly unremarkable. Tissue is stored frozen. The remainder of the
specimen is submitted as follows:

2A-E right lobe, superior to inferior

2F—H isthmus

2i~L left lobe. superior to inferior

2M one cystic lymph node bisected

2N multiple lymph nodes

3. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "left level II lymph node' consists of a piece of ﬁbroadipose tissue
that measures 2.8 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm. It contains multiple lymph nodes that range from 0.6 x 0.7 x 0.6 to 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm.
Representative sections are submitted.

3A multiple lymph nodes

4. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "left level III lymph node" consists of two pieces of ﬁbroadipose
tissue that measures 1.3 x 1.5 x 0.8 and 2.4 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm. They contain multiple lymph nodes that range from 0.2 x 0.2 x
0.2 to 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm. Representative secﬁons are submitted.

4A two lymph nodes

48 multiple lymph nodes

5. The specimen labeled with the patients name and as "right level llB lymph nodes” consists of a piece of fibroadipose
tissue that measures 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. It contains two lymph nodes that measures 0.3 x 0.4 x 0.4 and 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm.
Representative sections are submitted.

5A two lymph nodes

6. The specimen labeled with the patients name and as "right level II, III and IV' consists of a piece of unoriented
ﬁbroadipose tissue that measures 6.8 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. it contains multiple lymph nodes that range from 0.2 x 0.3 x 0.2 to
1.2 x 0.9 x 0.9 cm. The lymph nodes are sequentially submitted after the specimen is trisected with the lymph nodes
submitted in as follows:

6A one lymph node bisected

63 multiple lymph nodes

BC one lymph node bisected

6D one lymph node bisected

6E multiple lymph nodes
