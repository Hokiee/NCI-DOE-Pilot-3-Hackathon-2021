CLINICAL DATA:

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A) Received in formalin designated bladder trigone are two pieces of
soft,

tan tissue measuring 0.2 and 1.0 x 0.1 cm. These are wrapped and
entirely

submitted in cassette A1.

B) Received in formalin designated cervical biopsy is a 0.8 x 0.4 x
0.3 cm

portion of soft, shiny, tan tissue, with one apparent mucosal surface.
The

tissue is bisected, wrapped, and entirely submitted in cassette B1.

C) Received in formalin designated right external iliac lymph node #2
is a

collection of soft yellow to tan fatty tissue measuring in aggregate 5 x
4 x 1.5

cm. One probable fatty lymph node measuring 1.2 cm in maximum dimension
is

identified, which appears to be grossly positive. No other definite
lymph nodes

are identified. The bisected, grossly positive node is submitted in
cassette

Cl, along with a bisected portion of probable fatty tissue. C2 through
C5

remaining fibrous tissue.

D) Received in formalin designated right obturator lymph node is a 3
X 3 x

0.8 cm portion of soft yellow fibroadipose tissue. No definite lymph
nodes are

identified grossly. The firm tissue is submitted in cassette D1, and a
lobule

of fatty tissue (? fatty lymph node) is bisected and submitted in
cassettes D2

and D3.

E) Received fresh for frozen section designated right external femoral
iliac

lymph node #1 is a 4.2 x 2.4 x 1.4 cm yellow fatty node, which grossly
is

approximately 70% replaced by firm, white tumor nodule. A representative

section is selected for frozen section, and subsequently submitted in
cassette

EFSl. An additional representative section is submitted in cassette E2.

F) No specimen received.

G) Received in formalin designated right common iliac lymph node is
an

aggregate of lymphoid and fatty tissue measuring 2.5 x 2.0 X 0.5 cm.
Possible

small lymph nodes are submitted in cassette G1, remaining tissue in
cassette G2.

H) Received in formalin designated para—aortic lymph node is a
collection of

soft yellow fatty tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm. Entirely
submitted in

cassette H1.

I) Received in formalin designated left external iliac lymph node is
a

collection of soft yellow to firm tan lymphoid and adipose tissue with
aggregate

dimensions of 7 x 5 X 1.0 cm. Within this tissue are multiple hard
nodules,

which have a firm, tan/white cut surface within yellow fatty lymph node
parenchyma, grossly consistent with carcinoma involving lymph nodes.
Many of

these are matted and confluent with one another, and it is difficult
grossly to

determine if this represents one fatty lymph node with multiple
metastatic tumor

nodules, or multiple discrete lymph nodes. I1 representative sections of
two

positive lymph nodes, and three apparently matted lymph nodes; 12 cross
section '
through single fatty node with multiple tumor nodules (versus multiple
lymph

nodes); I3 and I4 additional probable lymphoid tissue.

J) Received in formalin designated left common iliac lymph node is a
collection of soft to firm adipose tissue measuring 2 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm.
Within

this there are multiple small palpable nodules, suggestive of very small

possibly positive lymph nodes. This entire piece of tissue is wrapped
and

submitted intact in cassette J1.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
Lvmnh node positive for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

A) Bladder trigone, biopsy: Bladder mucosa with focal squamous
metaplasia; no

evidence of neoplasia.

B) Cervix, biopsy: Invasive squamous cell carcinoma, well to
moderately

differentiated, in a background of in situ cervical neoplasia.

C),D) E), I) and J), designated Right external iliac lymph nodes #2
Right

obturator lymph node , Right external femoral iliac nodes #1 , Left
external '

iliac lymph nodes , and Left common iliac lymph nodes , respectively.
dissections:

l. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma to:

a. Two of two right external iliac #2 lymph nodes (2/2).

b. .Extranodal blood vessels of one (1) right obturator lymph node
without

I

definite carcinoma in the nodal section. (O/l). (see slide D1)

c. One right external femoral/iliac #1 lymph node (1/1).

d. Three of three left external iliac lymph nodes (3/3).

e. Two left common iliac lymph nodes (2/2)

2. Multiple lymphatic and vascular spaces are distended by squamous
cell

carcinoma, with focal invasion of
carcinoma into adjacent adipose tissue.

G) Designated right common iliac lymph node , dissection:
1. Multiple lymphatic and vascular spaces are distended by squamous
cell

carcinoma with focal invasion in to surrounding stroma in specimen D.
2. No lymph nodes identified.

F) No specimen received. The letter was crossed out on the accompanying
requisition form.

H) Periaortic lymph node, biopsy: Adipose tissue, with no lymph nodes
identified; no evidence of carcinoma.
