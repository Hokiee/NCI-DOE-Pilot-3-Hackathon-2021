CASE SUMMARY FOR NEPHRECTOMY FOR RENAL CELL CARCINOMA:

Procedure: robotic-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy
Specimen laterality: right
Tumor site: lower pole
Tumor size:
#1 largest: 6.0 cm
#2-#6: 0.3 cm, 0.3 cm, 0.1 cm, 0.1 cm, <0.1 cm
Tumor focality: multifocal
Macroscopic extent of tumor: tumors limited to kidney
Histologic type: papillary renal cell carcinoma (largest is type 1)
Sarcomatoid features: not identified
Tumor necrosis: not identified
Histologic grade (Fuhrman Nuclear Grade): grade 2
Microscopic tumor extension: tumors limited to kidney
Margins: negative for invasive carcinoma:
_ Renal parenchymal margin: negative (closest 1mm tumor is 1 mm from margin)
__ Renal capsular margin: negative
_ Perinephric fat margin: negative
Lymphovascular invasion: not identified
Pathologic staging (pTNM):
TNM descriptors: m, mutliple primary tumors
Primary tumor: pT1b: Tumor more than 4 cm but not more than 7 cm in greatest dimension,
limited to the kidney
Regional lymph nodes: pNx: Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed (tissue in A submitted
as a lymph node has no lymph node)
Number examined: 0
Number involved: 0
Distant metastasis: pM not applicable
Pathologic findings in nonneoplastic kidney: hypercellular, enlarged glomeruli, globally sclerotic
glomeruli, arteriolonephrosclerosis, interstitial ﬁbrosis and chronic inflammation
Other tumors and/or tumor-like lesions: multiple smaller papillary renal cell carcinomas (as
described above)
