upper lobe of the lung measuring 16 x 10 x 3.5 cm. The bronchial
margin measures 1.1 cm and vascular margin measures 1 cm at the
hilum. The staple line measures 12 cm in length which is shaved and
the parenchyma around it is inked blue. The pleura is grey-pink,
glistening and received with a pre cut area at the lower aspect of

the lung. At the pre cut area there is a grey-tan ﬁrm nodular area
measuring 1.2 x 1 cm, located 3.2 cm from the hilum and 3.8 cm from
the stapled line margin. The remainder of the parenchyma is
pink-red, blotchy and crepitant. No other nodule grossly

identiﬁed. Representative sections are submitted.

2. Part two is labeled ' level 4 lymph node right'. It consists of
tlnee anthracotic lymph nodes measuring from 0.3 em up to 1.3 cm in
largest dimension. Entirely submitted in one cassette. -

3. Part three is labeled 'level 10 lymph node right '. It consists
of one anthracotic lymph node measuring 1 x 1 x 0.5 cm. Entirely
submitted in one cassette.

4. Part four is labeled ‘level 7 lymph node right '. It consists of
one anthracotic lymph node measuring 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm. Entirely
submitted in one cassette.

5. Part ﬁve is labeled 'level 11 lymph node right '. It consists
of one anthracotic lymph node measuring 1 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. Entirely
submitted in one cassette.

MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY
KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS

Referring Physician:

Body Site: Lung

Specimen Type: Slides

Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma

RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12C (c.34G>T) mutation in codon 12
of the KRAS gene.

INTERPRETATION:

Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to correlate with poor
prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in
patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.

COMMENT:
KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking
history.

This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of

the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected.

This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and
codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn
embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been
established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung
carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other
tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e. g. tumors of
pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).

METHOD/LIMITATIONS:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantiﬁed
and ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

EGFR Mutation Analysis

Referring Physician: .

Body Site: Lung

Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma

RESULTS: NO mutation detected.

INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identiﬁed in the sample provided
for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma

patients without identiﬁable mutations are reported to be
responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.

COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 80% tumor
cellularity upon pathologist review.

A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was
identiﬁed. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
signiﬁcance.

Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGF R) gene are reported to be associated with differential
responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a
sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.

This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell

lung carcinoma (N SCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change
during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this
result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation

in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.

This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical signiﬁcance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.

METHOD/LIMITATION:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantiﬁed
and ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGF R gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.
