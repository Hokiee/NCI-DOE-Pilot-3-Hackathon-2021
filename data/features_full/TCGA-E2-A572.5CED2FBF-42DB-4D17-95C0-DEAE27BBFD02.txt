SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS

Specimens Involved
Specimens: A: LEFT BREAST AND AXILLARY CONTENTS

Specimen: Surgical Excision
Block Number: A21 (lymph node)

 

ER: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3
PR: Positive Allred Score: 3 = Proportion Score 2 + Intensity Score 1

 

COMMENT:
The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the
proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-
30% of cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score
(1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of
staining), with a scoring range from 0 to 8.
ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is deﬁned as an Allred score
of less than or equal to 2.

METHODOLOGY:
Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER IDS, 1:100) and PR
(PGR 136, 1:100) provided by ' )llowing the manufacturer 5
instructions. This assay was not modiﬁed. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain
is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent
manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. LEFT BREAST AND AXILLARY CONTENTS

Received fresh with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "left breast and axillary
contents" is an oriented 1143 g, 19 x 19 x 3.6 cm mastectomy with 14 x 6 cm attached
tan-brown skin ellipse and a centrally located, non-retracted 1.2 x 1.4 cm nipple. Ink
code: posterior-black, anterior superior-blue, anterior inferior-orange. Serial sectioning
from medial to lateral into 14 slices reveals two lesions:

Lesion 1: 3.4 x 3 x 2 cm white-tan, ﬁrm, irregular mass at 12:00 in slices 5 and 6, 3 cm
from the deep margin.

Lesion 2: 8 x 7 x 3 cm ill-deﬁned nodular and cystic area, involving the LIQ, mid to LOQ
and central area in slices 4-9, 2 cm from the deep margin, and inferior and adjacent to
lesion 1.

In the axillary tail, there is a 4 x 3.2 x 2 cm mass consistent with tumor involving lymph
node(s) as well as several other grossly positive lymph nodes. Representatively submitted
as per the attached diagram:

Al-A2: lesion 1 (mass), slice 5, 12:00

A3-A5: lesion 1 (mass), slice 6, 12:00 (biopsy clip in cassette A3)

All: lesion 2, slice 8, LOQ

A12: lesion 2, slice 8, mid outer quadrant

B. ADDITIONAL AXILLARY CONTENTS

Received fresh labeled with patient identiﬁcation and designated "additional axillary
contents“ is a tan-pink to tan-red and hemorrhagic, ﬁbrofatty soﬁ tissue fragment, 3.5 x
2.5 x l 9 cm. Examination reveals 8-10, ﬁrm, tan-white to tan-pink possible lymph nodes

ranging in size from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm to 0.4 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely
submitted as follows:

B1: Possible lymph nodes

BZ-B3: The remaining soft tissue

C. LEFT BREAST SKIN AND TISSUE

Received fresh with patient‘s identiﬁcation and designated “left breast skin and tissue" are
1) an unoriented, tan-pink to tan-yellow, partially skin covered soft tissue fragment
measuring 9.5 x 6.5 x 1.8 cm, serial sectioning reveals no grossly visible/possible
masses/lesions. The deep surface of the specimen is inked in black and representatively
submitted in C1-C3.

2) A fragment of tan-brown skin (the central part is missing), 2-1.5 x 7.5 x 1 cm,
examination reveals no grossly visible lesions, representatively submitted in C4-C5.

D. RIGHT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION

Received fresh labeled with the patient’s identiﬁcation and “right breast needle
localization” is an oriented 31 g, 7 x 5 x 3cm needle localized lumpectomy with
radiograph. Ink code: retroareolar — purple, anterior-yellow, posterior-black, superior-
blue, inferior-orange, medial-green, lateral-red. Specimen is serially sectioned from
lateral to medial into 7 slices revealing a 1.4 x l x lcm tan white irregular mass, 0.1cm
from the anterior-retroareolar margin in slices 3-4. A 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.3cm tan white ﬁrm
area is also identiﬁed, at the anterior-lateral-inferior margin of slice 1. A biopsy clip is
identiﬁed in slice 2 adjacent to the ﬁrm area in slice 1. A portion of the 1.4 cm mass is
submitted for frozen section in FSD. Representatively submitted:

FSD: 1.4 cm mass slice 3

D2-D4: lateral margin with 0.5 cm ﬁrm area in D4

DS-DS: slice 2 with clip ID in D8

D9: superior margin slice 3

retroareolar tissue’ is an oriented 5g, 4.5 x 3.8 x 1.40m tan pink ﬁbrofatty tissue. Final

margin is inked blue. Serial sectioning reveals no discrete lesions. Entirely submitted in
