COMMENT: Original frozen section shows pleomorphic tumor cells in solid
growth pattern with significant frozen section artifact present. Although
originally interpreted as high grade adenocarcinoma FIGO grade 3,
retrospective review in conjundtive with permanent sections reveals poorly
differentiated leiomyosarcoma. This finding and final results phoned to Dr.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS, UTERINE MASS: ADENOCARCINOMA, HIGH GRADE, FAVOR
ENDOMETRIOID ADENOCARCINOMA, FIGO GRADE 3

Communicated to Dr.

Specimen 1, received fresh for intraoperative consultation in a container
labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and "uterine mass"
consists of pink—tan extremely friable soft tissue fragment (2.1 x 1.5 x
1.2 cm) with hemorrhage. Representative section was submitted for frozen
section (AlFS), and the remainder is submitted in cassettes A2 and A3.

WITH FUNDIC TUMOR: GROSS EXAM - EXTENSIVE TUMOR PRESENT, SHOWN TO SURGEON

Specimen 2, received fresh for intraoperative consultation in a container
with the patient's name, medical record number and “uterus, cervix,
bilateral tubes and ovaries", consists of total hysterectomy specimen that
weighs 1,403 gm with attached unremarkable bilateral ovaries (left 2.2 x
1.0 x 0.6 cm, right 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm) with attached unremarkable
fallopian tubes (left 9.0 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter, right 9.1 cm
in length and 0.3 cm in diameter with fimbriated end each). The uterus
measures 25.0 cm fundus to cervix, 16.0 cm left to right, and 8.1 cm
anterior to posterior. The cervix measures 3.0 cm x 2.9 cm and covered by
pink—tan unremarkable mucosa and 0.6 cm slit-like os. The endocervical
canal measures 2.5 cm in length and 1.0 cm in diameter and covered by
pink—tan trabeculated unremarkable mucosa.

There is irregular pink—tan friable mass (29.0 x 10.0 x 5.0) that occupies
the whole endometrial cavity and replaces most of myometrium and extending
to the serosa creating two serosal defects (approximately 3.0 x 1.0 cm, at
the posterior surface). The mass creates vaguely two nodules, one occupied
the uterine corpus (9.0 x 7.0 x 5.0 cm) and the other extending through the
serosa supra fudus (20.0 x 10.0 x 5.0 cm) with minute intervening normal
myometrium. The tumor extends into the lowar uterine segment. There is no
residual recognizable normal endometrium. The mass has friable tan
lobulated mottled cut surfaces with extensive hemorrhage and necrosis. The
tumor grossly invades more than half of the myometrial thickness and reach
to the serosa in multiple areas. Representative sections were submitted for
research studies as requested and photographs were taken.

Both ovaries and fallopian tubes are grossly unremarkable and uninvolved by
the tumor.

Also received in the same container. multiple irregular fragments of
tan-friable soft tissue with hemorrhage measuring 10.0 x 9.5 x 4.0 cm in
aggregate.

Specimen 3, received fresh in a container with the patient's name, medical
record number and “appendix", consists ofva vermiform appendix, which
measures 4.0 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter with attached mesoappendix
(4.0 x 2.2 x 0.6 cm} and attached blood clot measuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm.
The seroeal surface is pink~tan and unremarkable. The tip is Eibrotic.

Specimen 4, received fresh in a container with the patient's name, medical
record number and "adhesion of anterior abdominal wall peritoneum",
consists of an irregular fragment of tan-brown soft tissue, which measures
2.0 x 1.9 x 0.5 cm- Specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes 01 and D2.
Specimen 5, received in formalin in a container with the patient's name,
medical record number and "right aortic lymph node", consists of aggregates
of fibroadipose tissue, which measure 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm in aggregate.
Sectioning through the tissue reveals two possible lymph nodes measuring
1.5 and 0.6 cm in greatest dimensions. The specimen is entirely submitted
as labeled, El, one bisected lymph node; 82, one intact lymph node; EB,
remainder of the specimen.

The following special studies Were performed on this case and the
interpretation is incorporated in the diagnostic report above:

lxKERATIN PAN, leCTIN SMOOTH MUSCLE, lxDESMIN, lxIM-CALDESMON

The immunohistochemistry test was deveinned and its performance
characteristics determined by . Pathology
Laboratory. It has not been cleared or approved by the 0.8. Food and Drug
Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is
not necessary. The test is used for clinical purposes., It should not be
regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified
under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-SB) as
qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.
