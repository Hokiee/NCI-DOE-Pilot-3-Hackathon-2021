possible lymph node bisected; A5-A7, one possible lymph node serially sectioned; A8-A12, one possible lymph node serially
sectioned; A13-A15, remainder of the specimen submitted entirely.

(B) LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES - Received is a 5.0 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm aggregate of fibroadipose tissue. The specimen is
dissected to reveal nine possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.4 up to 3.5 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is submitted
entirely.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES — A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (6.0 x 4.2 x 3.7 cm, 53 grams, post fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the left
posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the right side. The prostate is diffusely firm, particularly
on the left side including the left seminal vesicle.

SECTION CODE: c1-03. right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; 04-08,
left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; CQ. C10. prostatic base, right border;
C11-C15, prostatic base, right posterior border; C16-023, prostatic base. central portion; C24, prostatic base, left border;
025-027, prostatic base. left posterior border; 028-C30, apex anterior; CS1, 032, apex left; C33-CS7, apex posterior; CBS-C40,
apex right; C41, C42, detached portions of margin of resection according to specimen radiograph; C43-C55, sections of the four
cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.

The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in
black. Orange ink (C45-C47, C50, C54 and 055) denotes surfaces that do not represent the true margin of resection.
