GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1, LEFT AXILLA
Received fresh for touch prep evaluation labeled with the patient name designated A. sentinel lymph
node #1 left axilla is a beige-tan lymph node measuring 0.8x0.5x0.4cm. The specimen is bisected,
touch preps are performed. The entire specimen is submitted in a cassette labeled A1.
B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODES #2 & #3. LEFT AXILLA
Received fresh for touch prep evaluation labeled with the patient name designated B. sentinel lymph
nodes #2 & #3 is a portion of ﬁrm red-tan ﬁbrcadipose tissue measuring 5.5x2.0x1.0cm. Two beige-tan
lymph nodes are identiﬁed. The specimen is serially sectioned. touch preps are performed. The
specimen is submitted in toto in blocks B1-B3.

TSS:

C. SENTINAL LYMPH NODES #4 & #5, LEFT AXILLA
Received fresh for touch prep evaluation labeled with the patient name designated C. sentinel nodes #4
& #5 are two beige-tan ﬁrm lymph nodes. The larger measuring 1.5x1.0x0.9cm. The smaller
measuring 0.4x0.3x0.3cm. The entire specimen is submitted for microscopic evaluation. Cassettes are
submitted as follows:

C1: the smaller lymph node

C2: the larger lymph node serially sectioned
D. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #6. LEFT AXILLA
Received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient name designated D. sentinel node #6 is a
ﬁrm beige-tan lymph node measuring 1.0x0.9x0.7cm. specimen is bisected and submitted entirely in
cassette D1.
E. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #7 & #8, LEFT AXILLA
Received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient name designated E. sentinel node is a group
of beige-tan, ﬁrm, matted lymph nodes, measuring in aggregate 2.2x1.9x0.7cm. The specimen is
bisected and submitted entirely in cassette E1-E2.
F. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #9. LEFT AXILLA
Received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient name designated F. sentinel node #9 leﬂ
axilla is a ﬁrm beige-tan lymph node with attached adipose tissue. The lymph node measures
0.4x0.4x0.3cm. The entire specimen is submitted in cassette F 1.

G. LEFI BREAST
Received in fresh state with patient's name and identiﬁcation number and labeled "left breast". The
specimen consists of a left mastectomy specimen weighing 797 grams and with total dimensions of
26.0 x 19.0 x 5.5 cm. There is an attached stitch indicating the left axillary tail area of the breast.
Overlying skin measures 18.0 x 12.0 cm. The nipple is erect and grossly not remarkable.and shows no
areas of ulceration. There is a ﬁrm palpable mass noted along the superc—central aspect of the
specimen,which on serial cut section shows an ill-deﬁned. ﬁrm, nodular mass with ill-deﬁned borders
measuring 3.2 x 2.2 and 2.0 cm with focal areas of hemorrhage. The remainder of the specimen
consists mostly of fatty breast tissue parenchyma with alternating strands of ﬁbrous stroma. The deep
margin is inked black..Grossly.the tumor is is seen 0.9 cm from the nearest supenor margin. There is
no other identiﬁable tumor focus and scant axillary fat shows predominantly adipose tissue with possible
tiny 0.1 cm lymph node. Multiple sections are submitted and labeled as follows:

G1-G2: bisected anterior margin adjacent to mass

G3: skin and mass

G4-GS: tissue inferior to mass, bisected

G6: deep margin

G7-G12: sections of mass

G13-G14: ﬁbrous tissue from superior inner quadrant

G15-G18: ﬁbrous and ﬁrm tissue from superior outer quadrant

GI 9-G20: ﬁbrous tissue from inferior outer quadrant

GZ1-G22: ﬁbrous tissue from lower inner quadrant

G23-GZ4: nipple and subjacent tissue perpendiculariy sectioned

625: 1 possible axillary lymph node
H. LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS
Received in formalin and labeled "left axillary contents" is an aggregate of pink-yellow soft tissue
measuring 9.0x5.5x1.8cm. 16 possible lymph nodes are found, ranging in size from 0.1 to 1.7cm.
Nodes are submitted in toto as follows:

H1: 6 possible lymph nodes

H2-H6: 2 bisected lymph nodes each

ADDENDUM:

Correction of typographical error on template regarding tumor site. Should read as follows:
