Specimen(s) Received

A:Right pelvic lymph nodes

B:Left pelvic lymph nodes
CzProstate & seminal vesicles (fresh)

Clinical History
The patient is a .year—old man with prostate cancer, grade 4-5.

Gross Description

The specimen is received in three parts, each labeled with the patient's name and unit number. Parts A
and B are received in formalin, and part C is received fresh.

Part A is additionally labeled "right pelvic LN,“ and consists of multiple soft, yellow-brown, fatty tissues
(3.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm in aggregate). The specimen is extensively searched for lymph nodes. Three
candidate lymph nodes are found and submitted in cassette A1. '

Part B is additionally labeled "left pelvic LN," and consists of one soft, tan-yellow, fatty tissue (4 x 1 x 1
cm). The specimen is extensively searched for lymph nodes. Multiple candidate lymph nodes are found
and submitted as follows:

Bl: Four intact nodes.

32: One large, intact node.

Part C is additionally labeled "prostate and seminal vesicles,“ and consists of a radical prostatectomy
specimen (52 gm; 4 cm from apex to base it 4.7 cm from lateral to medial x 4 cm from anterior to
posterior).

GROSS PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: There are two suspicious areas. The ﬁrst suspicious area is tan-yellow
(1.2 x 1 x 1 cm), located abutting into the margin inked black (less than 0.1 cm), also located in serial
slices 5, 6 and 7. The second suspicious area is tan-white (1.2 x 1 x 0.6 cm). located within 0.4 cm
from the right anterior inked green margin, and also located in serial slices 2 and 3. The remaining
prostate parenchyma is tan—light brown. The seminal vesicle/yes deferens bundles (right 2.5 x 1.5 x
0.5 cm; left 2 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm) are soft, lobulated. red-tan, without obvious lesions or mass. Some of
the prostate is taken by the . (serial slice 6 and anterior half of slice 7).
