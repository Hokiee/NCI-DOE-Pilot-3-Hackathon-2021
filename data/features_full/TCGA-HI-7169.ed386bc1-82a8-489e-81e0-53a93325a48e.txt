Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled # 2, ”prostate and seminal vesicles”

Gross Description: Received fresh in a container labeled ",

, prostate and seminal vesicles". It consists of a radical

prostate resection weighing 35—grams and measuring 3.5 x 4.0 x 3.4 cm.
The capsule is intact and a probe inserts easily through the prostatic
urethra. The right side is inked black and left side blue. Sections
disclose a yellowish tan periphery and centrally the parenchyma is firm
and white, suspicious for lesion. There is a smali amount of prostatic
concretions noted. The right seminal vesicle measures 2.0 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm
and left measures 3.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. Both are unremarkable. The right
and left vas deferens stumps measure 2.5 x 0.6 cm. Representative
sections are submitted in 2A-N.

Designation of Sections: 2A—2B— apex, 2C-2D— base, 2E-2H- right side of
prostate gland [E- anterior, F» mid, G&H— superior posterior], 21—2L-

left side of prostate gland [I— anterior, J — mid, K&L— superior

posterior], 2M- right vas deferens and seminal vesicle, 2N— left vas
deferens and seminal vesicle

Source of Tissue: 3. Labeled # 3, "right pelvic lymph nodes"

Gross Description: Received fresh in a container labeled,

, right pelvic lymph nodes”. It consists of multiple fragments

of fibroadipose tissue measuring collectively 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm. The
tissue is dissected to disclose two potentiai lymph nodes measuring
respectively 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.5 and 2.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. Both nodes are
fatty. All of the nodal tissue is submitted in 3A and the rest of the fat
in 3B.

Source of Tissue: 4. Labeled # 4, ”left pelvic lymph nodes"

Gross Description: Received fresh in a container labeled,
left pelvic lymph nodes". It consists of some fibroadipose
tissue measuring collectively 4.0 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm. The tissue is dissected

disciosing two firm tan lymph nodes measuring 1.0 and 1.4 cm respectively.

Final Diagnosis:

1. Left posterior lateral margin, excision:
- No tumor seen. No prostatic tissue seen.

2. Prostate and seminal vesicles, radical prostatectomy:

— Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason's score 7 (3+4), involving both right
and left lobes (right>left); extraprostatic extension is seen (the right

mid on slide 2F and the right apex on slide 213); see note.

— Tumor is present at the inked right apex margin.

— The base and other radial margins with no tumor seen.

— The seminal vesicles with no tumor seen.

Note: The tumor is seen on most of the sections of the right side of the
prostate (including the right apex).

3. Right pelvic lymph nodes, excision:
— N0 tumor seen in two lymph nodes (0/2).

4. Left pelvic lymph nodes, excision:
— No tumor seen in two lymph nodes (0/2).
