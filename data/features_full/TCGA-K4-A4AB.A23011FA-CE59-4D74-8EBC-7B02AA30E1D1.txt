Gross Description

A. Received in Eo:malin labeled with the patient’s name and
"left distal ureter with ureteral tumor F5" consists of a 0.6 cm
frozen section tiesue remnant. Wrapped and submitted in Al.

B. Received in fermalin Labeled with the patient's name and
“leﬁt distal ureter With ureteral tumor NFS" consists of a

tubular structu1.e of tan— pink sot: tissue consistent with ureter
measuring 4 cm with a maximal diameter of 0. 6 cm Centrally
Located is a bulging of the structure, and this area is firm

upon palpation. The margin has been previously inked by the
frozen section pathologist. The area of the bulge is inked

orange, and the cut surface reveals a narrowed lumen with the
wall having a smoc th indurated appearance and measuring 0.4 cm
in thickness. The entire specimen is submitted as follows:
inked resection marginzBl; opposite resection margin=B2;
remainder of the bodyzBS.
C. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"right distal ureter with ureteral tumor ~ margin inked . PS”
consists of a 0.5 cm frozen section tissue remnant. Wrapped and
tsubmitted in C1.
D. Received in formalin labeled with the patient' s name and
"right distal ureter ~ margin is inked - NFS" consists of a 0.6
cm fragment of ten, fatty tissue. Wrapped and submitted in 31.

E. Received in formalin labeled with the patient’s name and
"left ureterovesical junction“ consists of an irregular fragment
of tan, shaggy tissue measuring 1 x 1 x 0.8 cm. A suture is
noted on one edge of the specimen. However, no definitive
orientation to the suture is given on the container or the
requisition. The specimen is trisected and entirely Submitted
in El.
F. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"left pelvic lymph nodes" consists of a 1,5 cm nodule of tan,
fatty tissue consistent with lymphoid tissue. Excess fat is
trimmed and the nodules is submitted in F1, remaining trimmed
fatty tissue in F2.
G. Received .in formalin labeled with the patient‘s name and
"right pelvic lymph nodes" consistent of two nodu.1es of tan,
fatty tissue cons.lstent with lymphoid tissue, each measuring 1
cm. The excess fat is trimmed, and the two nodes are submitted
in CT G2, one lymph node each cassette.
H. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
”bladder and prostate" consists of a radical cystectomy specimen
with attached fatty tissue. Overall dimensions of the specimen
measure T} x 10 x 8 cm. The attached prostate measures 5 x 4 x
4 cm. ;t the area of the attached left seminal vesicals,
several sutures are identified and a 3.5 cm defect is noted on
the surface on the soft tissue. The left vas deferens measures
7 cm in length. The left seminal vesicle measures 4 x l x 1
cm. The right seminal vesicle measures 4.5 x 1 X 1 cm. The
right vas deferens measures 6.5 cm in length. The prostatic
urethral margin has a shaggy appearance. The specimen is inked
blue on the l.e£t, black on th e right. The leﬁt and right
ureters are embedded in the fat and have been previously taken

anteriorly, and in the left trigone and left lateral wall a 10
cm ulcerated mass is identified. The remainder of the bladder
mucosa has a congested cobblestoned appearance. Cross
sectioning into the mass, the cut surface has a very indurated
smooth appearance and grossly appears to invade into the fatty
tissue. Also, the mass grossly appears to invade into the
posterior wall. The posterior aspect of the prostate and cut
surface has a very indurated smooth, glistening appearance.
This area of the prostate on both left and right sides measures
3 cm. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as
ﬁollows‘ Hiuprostatic urethral margin; H2-H4=Eull thickness
cross sections of left posterior wall; HS-Hézleft trigone;
H7~HlOmleft lateral wall; Hlerl2uleft dome; H13~H15mright
