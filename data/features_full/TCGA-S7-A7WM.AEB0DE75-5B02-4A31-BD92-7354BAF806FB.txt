Gross

Right adrenal gland with a tumor weighing 48 g and with dimensions 69x50x30 mm. On cut,
ovoid encapsulated grey-pink tumor with soft consistency. Material was procured in 6 blocks.
Micro:

Solidly alveolarly shaped pheochromocytoma with focal ﬁbrotization and multiple cellular
atypias, in all examined excisions with ﬁbrous capsule and with remnants of the adrenocortical
structures on the periphery. In block 3D, penetration through adrenocortical structures and initial
invasion through the ﬁbrous adrenal capsule were found. No spread in to the surrounding
adipose tissue was found.

Staining for 8100 protein was variably positive, in less differentiated parts of the tumor in one
cut rarefaction or even vanishing.

MIBl < 1% (positive control in the cut with adrenal cortex remnants)
