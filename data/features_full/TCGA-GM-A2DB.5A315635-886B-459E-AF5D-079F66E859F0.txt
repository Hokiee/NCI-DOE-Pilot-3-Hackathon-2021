SUMMARY

Tissue section of the invasive carcinoma I D6 was evaluated for HER-2/neu gene
amplification by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization technique using the Patthsion
HER-2/neu DNA Probe Kit (LSI HER-2/neu i/CEP17 .

Slide adequacy is satisfactory. Sixty tumor nuclei were counted and showed an average of 1.67
copies of LSI HER-2/neu gene per nucleus and an average of 1.50 copies of CEP17 per nucleus.

Negative and positive controls (established by _.....,.. ) with this batch are
appropriate.

Two representative images have been archived.

iNTERPRETATION

The tumor cells demonstrated no amplification of the HER-2/neu gene copy levels (HER-2/neu:
CEP17 signal ratio: 1.11)

The following guideline has been established for HER‘2/neu testing:

Normal HER-2/neu levels: <1.80; Equivocal HER-2/neu levels: 1.80 — 2.20: Amplified HER-2/neu
levels: >220

(Ref: Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2007; 131:18-43)

NOTES

 

 

 

 

The LSI HER-2/neu probe is specific for the HER-2/neu gene Locus (17q 11.2-q12) and the CEP

17 DNA probe is specific for the alpha satellite DNA sequence at the centromeric region of
Chromosome 17 (17 p11.1 -q11.2).

This test has been cleared and approved for specific uses by the US. Food and Drug

Administration. Its system is operating within the performance specifications stated in the product
insert.
