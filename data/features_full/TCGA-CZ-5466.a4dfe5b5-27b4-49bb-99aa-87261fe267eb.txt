PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:

.TCGA-CZ—ﬁtlﬁﬁ
A) RIGHT KIDNEY, NEPHRECTOMY:

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, clear cell typ , F rman grade II (8.8 cm),
limited to the kidney.

Renal vein invasion is present.

Margins of soft tissue, renal vein, ureter, and renal artery are
negative for tumor.

AJCC Classification (6th edition): T3 Nx Mx.

The nonuneoplastic kidney will be evaluated by Renal Pathology, and the
findings will be reported in an addendum. 1 . __

B) SPECIMEN LABELED “RIGHT RETROPERITONEAL LYMPH NODES":
Adipose and vascular tissue with no tumor present.

CLINICAL DATA: ’//

History: None given.

Operation: Right radical nephrectomy
Operative.Findings: Not provided.
Clinical Diagnosis: Right renal mass.

TISSUE SUBMITTED:
A/l) Tumor and kidney (T.B.)
3/2) Right retroperitoneal lymph nodes.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh, in two parts, each labeled with the patient‘s

name and unit number.

Part A4 labeled “#1. Tumor and kidney (T.B.)", consists of a 183—gram right
radical nephrectomy specimen (18.5 x 16.0 x 13.5 cm) with Surrounding perirenal
fat (measuring in thickness from 1.5 to 3.5 cm): Extending from the renal
pelvis is a ureter (8.5 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter, renal artery (1.5 cm
in length x 0.6 cm in diameter) and renal vein (0.8 cm in length x 0.9 cm in
diameter). Ninety (90%) percent of the renal parenchyma is replaced by
multicystic mass composed of necrotic cyst with calcified rim, abutting but not
invading the capsule (up to 10.5 x 8.5 x 6.5 cm). Adjacent to the necrotic
cyst are viable tan/orange heterogeneous tumor masses with small areas of
necrosis (measuring 8.8 x 7.0 x 6.5 cm). This mass also abuts but does not
invade the capsule or perirenal fat. The tumor protrudes into the renal vein
. and is 0.6 cm from the vein.margin. The remainder of the renal cortex is
tan/brown. The pelvis is covered by smooth glistening mucosa. The perirenal
adipose tissue is thinly sectioned and no lymph nodes are found. No tissue
consistent with adrenal gland was identified. _Representative sections oﬁ tumor
have been submitted for tissue bank and cytogenetics. Representative sections

if normal renal parenchyma have been submitted for 1M and EM.

The kidney parenchyma was evaluated by Dr. — Renal Pathologist.

MICROSCOPIC . DESCRIPTION:
Sections of formalin»fixed, paraffin—embedded tissue (block A?) were evaluated

using HaE, PAS, Jones‘ silver methenamine, and AFOG (trichrome) stains.

The sample consists of cortex and medulla. Significant amount of tumor is
present in this sample, and the parenchyma sample is located very close to the
tumor. There are 200 glomeruli present, of which 22 (11.0%) are globally
sclerosed. The remaining glomeruli show no significant expansion of the
mesangial areas. There are no discernible craters or double contours of the
glomerular capillary wall basement membranes. The interstitium shows edema and
marked focal inflammatory infiltrates consisting mostly of mononuclear
inflammatory cells and occasional eosinophils and neutrophils. Tubules reveal
moderate invasion of the tubular epithelial cell layer by mononuclear
inflammatory cells (tubulitis). There are also several hyaline casts and
cellular debriS'within the tubular lumen. Approximately 50% of the cortical
parenchyma shows tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Arteries and
arterioles exhibit marked of the wall and of the subintima sclerosis.

PATIE:

     

KARYOTYPE: 45,X,—Y[4}/46,XY{11}
METAPHASES COUNTED: 15 ANALYZED: 6 SCORED: 9 BANDING: GTG
INTERPRETATION:

Four of 15 metaphases contained loss of the Y chromosome, but this is not
necessarily representative of a neoplastic population, as loss of the Y
chromosome is a common finding in older men.

COMMENTS:
Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the

standard methods employed. Chromosome analysis was performed at a level of 400
bands or greater.

INDICATION FOR TEST:
RCC
