GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT LATERAL KNEE MASS - A 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm punch of soft, white-pink tissue which is submitted in toto as A.

(B) RIGHT LATERAL KNEE MASS - A 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.6 punch of skin with attached soft tissue. The edge of the specimen is inked
blue and the specimen is bisected and submitted in toto as B.

(C) CLOQUET‘S NODE - A 1.5 x 1.4 x 0.7 cm lymph node with a scanty amount of attached adipose tissue. The lymph node is
unremarkable. The lymph node is sectioned and submitted in toto with the adjacent adipose tissue in one cassette labeled as C.

(D) LEFT INGUINAL NODE - Received is one fragment of ﬁbroadipose tissue (18 x 8 x 2.5 cm) with twelve possible lymph nodes,
the largest of which measures 4 cm in greatest dimension. The largest lymph node is positive for metastasis, 3 cm in greatest
dimension.

Tumor was submitted to tissue bank and for the TIL protocol.

SECTION CODE: D1, D2, representative section of largest positive lymph node; D3, D4, one lymph node, serially
sectioned; D5-D7, one lymph node, serially sectioned; DB, 09, one lymph node, serially sectioned; D10-D12, one lymph node,
serially sectioned; D13-D19, one lymph node, serially sectioned per cassette.

(E) LEFT COMMON lLlAC NODES - Two irregularly-shaped fragments of soft, yellow-red tissue ranging in size from the smallest
measuring 1.5 cm in greatest dimension to the largest measuring 4.5 cm in greatest dimension. Each fragment contains an
unremarkable lymph node.

SECTION CODE: E1, one Ivmoh node section; E2, one lymph node section; E3, E4, one lymph node section. The lymph
nodes have been submitted in toto.

(F) LEFT EXTERNAL lLlAC NODES - A 'I x 4 x :.2 cm piece of adipose tissue containing four lymph nodes ranging in size from
the largest measuring 4.5 cm to the smallest measuring 2 cm in greatest dimension.

SECTION CODE: F1, one lymph node section in multiple pieces; F2, F3, a single lymph node section; F4—F6, one lymph
node. serially sectioned; F7-F14, one lymph node, serially sectioned per cassette. Lymph nodes have been submitted in toto.

(G) OBTURATOR NODES - A 17 x 4 x 1.5 cm irregularly—shaped piece of adipose tissue. The specimen contains multiple lymph
nodes ranging in size from the smallest measuring 0.3 cm in greatest dimension to the largest measuring 5.4 cm in greatest
dimension.

SECTION CODE: G1, one lymph node, bisected; G2, one lymph node, bisected; G3, one lymph node, bisected; G4, two
lymph nodes, one bisected; G5, one apparent lymph node, bisected; G6-G8, a single lymph node section. All lymph nodes have
been submitted in toto.
