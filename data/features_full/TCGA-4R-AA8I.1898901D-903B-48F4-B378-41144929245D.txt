Clinical History Unknown
Liver mass

Gross Examination Unknown

A. "Partial left liver re ion" received fresh for frozen section and
placed in formalin on “is an 84 gm, 12 x 5.8 x 3 cm portion of
liver. The resection margin is in ed black. On sectioning there is a 2.8 x
2.6 x 2.4 cm firm, tanmgreen, focally hemorrhagic, well circumscribed nodule.
It is 0.8 cm from the resection margin and 0.1 cm from.the capsule.

The remaining parenchyma is tan and cirrhotic. The liver capsule is
multinodular with fibrous bands. A representative section was submitted as
frozen section AFl, transferred to block A7.

BLOCK SUMMARY:
AlmAswrepresentative nodule (50%)
Al—closest approach to capsule
AZ—closest approach to resection margin
Aéerepresentative of cirrhotic parenchyma.
A7-frozen section AFl remnant (please note submitted in block A7, not Al)

lntraoperative Consultation Unknown
A. "Partial left liver resection": AFl (representative of
nodulejehepatocellular lesion consistent

Hepatocellular carcinoma . (Dr .

Microscopic Examination Unknown
Special stains are performed on block A3. The reticulin stain confirms loss
of reticulin meshwork in the hepatocellular carcinoma. The tumor displays
focal pseudoglandular growth pattern. The mucicarmine stain is negative.

In the background uninvolved liver, the trichrome and the reticulin special
stains confirm the established cirrhosis. The portal tracts and the fibrous
septa contain mild to moderate mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate. There is
mild bile ductular proliferation, but the native bile ducts are intact. The
parenchyma within regenerative nodules exhibits occasional ballooned
hepatocytes with poorlwaormed Mallory bodies. Patchy pericellular sinusoidal
fibrosis is present within the regenerative nodules. The copper stain
highlights mild copper deposit in periportal/t eriseptal hepatocytes. The PASD
stain reveals PAS positive. diastase resistant, granules in
periportal/periseptal hegatocytes. The iron stain is negative.
Pathologic Stage Unknown

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 7th Edition): pTQ pNX pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution‘s Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate

past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

Diagnosis Unknown

A. "LIVER, LEFT LOBE" (PARTIAL LIVER RESECTION):
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA
Histologic type: HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA.
Histologic grade: MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED (GRADE 2).
Tumor Size: 2.8 X 2.6 x 2.4 CM.
Tumor Focality: SOLITARY (LEFT LIVER LUBE).
Tumor Extension: TUMOR CONFINED TO THE LIVER.

Margins: NEGATIVE.
Distance to closest margin: PARENCHYMAL MARGIN (0.8 CM).

Vascular invasion Major vascular invasion: ABSENT.

Miorovascular invasion: PRESENT
Perineural Invasion: NEGATIVE.
Lymphatic Invasion: NEGATIVE
Regional Lymph Nodes: NOT SAMPLED.
Additional findings: CIRRHOSIS.
SEE COMMENT.
COMMENT: The uninvolved liver shows established cirrhosis. The presence of

steatosis, occasional ballooned hepatocytes, and patchy pericellular
sinusoidal fibrosis suggests steatohepatitis. The result of PASS and copper
stains are not specific, however, the possibility of Wilson's disease and
alphawl~antitrypsin deficiency needs to be clinically excluded.

Dim-has reviewed case and confirms the presence of microvascular invasion.
