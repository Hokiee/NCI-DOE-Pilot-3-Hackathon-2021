Report : GROSS EXAMINATION.

The specimen is received in a container labeled with the
name of the patient and labeled as kidney, right and
adrenal. The specimen consists of a kidney and attached
perinephric fat. The kidney stripped of fat measures 13 x 8
x 5.5 cm and weighs 282 g. The ureter and vascular margins
of resection are submitted in block one. The capsule strips
with ease. The kidney is bivalved and shows an oval golden
yellow mass measuring 5.5 X 4.0 x 4.0 cm. This mass is in
the lower pole of the kidney. The mass does not grossly
involve the capsule. Sections of the capsule are submitted
in block two. Sections of the mass are submitted in blocks
3~6. The pelvis and calyces are not grossly dilated. The
cortex averages 0.7 cm. There is a cortical cyst measuring
4 cm. Sections of the cyst are submitted in block 7. A
random section of kidney is submitted in block 8.

Sectioning into the attached fat shows an adrenal gland
measuring 7.0 X 2.3 x 0.8 cm. Sections of the adrenal are
submitted in blocks nine and 10.

DIAGNOSIS BASED ON GROSS AND MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

SPECIMEN TYPE: Radical nephrectomy, right kidney.

TUMOR SITE: Lower pole.

FOCALITY: Unifocal.

TUMOR SIZE (LARGEST TUMOR IF MULTIPLE) Greatest dimension:
5.5 cm.

ADDITIONAL DIMENSIONS: 4.0 x 4.0 cm.

MACROSCOPIC EXTENT OF TUMOR: Tumor limited to kidney.
HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Clear cell (conventional) renal carcinoma.
HISTOLOGIC GRADE (FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE): Predominant grade
II with a focal area of grade IV (the grade IV component
occupies approximately 5% of the tumor examined.).
