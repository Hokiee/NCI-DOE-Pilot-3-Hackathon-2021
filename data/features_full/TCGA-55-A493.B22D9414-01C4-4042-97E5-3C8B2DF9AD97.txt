CLINICAL INFORMATION

Right upper lobe lung mass

SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPTION

A) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, #7 subcarinal

The specimen is received labeled "#7 subcarinal lymph node." It consists of
three focally gray-black apparent lymph nodes with a small amount of

focally attached adipose tissue. Lymph node #1 measures 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm.
Lymph node #2 measures 1 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm and tymph node #3 measgres 2.5 x

 

4&6 x u.5 un We! included'. Tissue IS submitted in

toto for frozen section diagnosis in one block.

B) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy, #4R right paratracheal

The specimen is received labeled "#4R right paratracheal lymph node." It
consists of a 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm portion of ﬁbrofatty tissue which contains

one gray-black possibly focally disrupted lymph node measuring 1.6 x 1 x
0.3 cm. The apparent lymph node is submitted in toto for frozen section
diagnosis on one block.

C) SOURCE: Lymph node biopsy. rt upper lobe #12. bronchus

The specimen is received labeled "Rt upper lobe bronchus lymph node #12."
It consists of two lymph nodes measuring 0.4 and 1 cm in greatest
dimension. The large lymph node is serially sectioned and both nodes are
entirely submitted in two cassettes.

D) SOURCE: Lung. right upper lobe

The specimen is received fresh from the OR labeled "right upper lobe," It
consists of a 147 gram spongy red-tan lung lobe measuring 15 x 8 x 4.5 cm.
The pleura is smooth, focally ﬁrm (inked blue). The medial aspect displays
two surgical staple lines measuring 4.8 and 5.5 cm in length. The sutures

are removed and underlying parenchyma inked black. The inked aspect of the
pleura is inciseqto displaya large rubbery tumor. A represe tatlve

section of the tumor and entire en face bronchial margin are rozen on two
blocks.

Mb

The tissue is serially cross-sectioned. On cut surface. the tumor is
approximately 2.7 cm from the bronchial margin and 2 cm from the superiorly
located surgical staple line. The tumor focally abuts inked pleural

surfaces. Extension through the pleura is not grossly seen.

On sectioning, the tumor measures 3.2 x 3 x 3 cm and hasten, glistening
focally gray-black cut surfaces. The tumor grossly obliterates small
apparent vessels and possible bronchioles.

The remaining cut Surfaces are mottled pink-red with scattered black patchy
discolored foci. No other lesions are seen. The cut surfaces display four
black lymph nodes measc’lring between 0.6 and 2.3 cm in greatest diameter.

Note: A portion of the tumor, paranormal and normal tissue are banked for
possible ancillary study.

in 10% neutral buffered formalin at Specimen ﬁxed in
formalin for a minimum of 6 hours, and not longer than 48 hours.

Representative sections are submitted in a total of 16 cassettes labeled:
DI. Frozen section residue, en face bronchial margin
2. Frozen section residue, tumor

f‘A-D) The microscopic appearance substantiates the diagnosis.
b) Block D4 was evaluated with immunostains in order to further
characterize this nonsmall cell carcinoma. Results are as follows:
TTF-I: Strongly positive, nuclear pattern
P63: negative
These results are compatible with adenocarcinoma of pulmonary origin.
