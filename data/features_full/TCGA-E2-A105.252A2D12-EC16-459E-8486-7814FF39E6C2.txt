GROSSDESCRIPTION:
A. Rw/DREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION LUMPECTOMY
The specimen received fresh' In a container labeled with patient name and designated as "right breast
needle localization right breast lumpectomy" is a segment of breast tissue weighing 729m and
measuring 9.0x8.0x3.50m. The specimen is oriented per Dr. as follows: single stitch-anterior, long
double stitch-lateral, short double stitch—superior. A metallic wire penetrates through the breast tissue
from medial to lateral direction. On serial section, a 1.1x1.1x1.0cm ﬁrm, stellate mass is identiﬁed. This
mass is 0.8cm from the anterior margin, 1.50m from lateral margin, 2.0cm from the posterior margin.
The exterior surface of the specimen is inked as follows: anterior-blue, inferior-orange, superior—red,
lateral-yellow, medial-green, posterior—black. Representative sections Of the specimen are submitted
from cassette A1 to cassette A26.
Block summary:

A1-A7: the mass and the anterior margin

B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 RIGHT AXILLA
The specimen, received fresh in a container labeled with patient name and designated as "sentinel
lymph node #1 right axilla" consists of 2 ﬁrm lymph node measuring 1.0x0.5x0.30m and 2.0x1.0x0.5cm.
The lymph node' Is submitted In toto in cassette B1 and 82.

LXI C ELEFTBREAST LUMPECTOMY NEEDLE LOCALIZATION
The specimen, received fresh' In a container labeled with patient name and designated as "left needle
localization lumpectomy" is a segment of breast tissue weighing 75 grams and measuring 8. 5 x 5. 5 x
3.4 cm. The specimen is oriented as follows: single stitch, anterior; double stitch, lateral; triple stitch,
superior. The specimen is inked as follows: superior, red; inferior, orange; medial, green; lateral,
yellow, anterior, blue, posterior, black. The specimen is serially sectioned and It reveals a Tim! white

 

the medial margin and 1 cm from the lateral margin. The reSt of the section of the specimen are
submitted in cassettes C1 — 027.
Block summary:

C1-C3: tumor and the anterior margin

04—08: tumor and the lateral margin

CQ-C12: tumor and the medial margin

C13-C20: posterior margin adjacent to the tumor

CZ1-C23: representative section from the inferior margin

024—027: representative section from the posterior lateral area of the breast
D. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 LEFT AXILLA
The specimen, received fresh in a container labeled with patient name and designated as "sentinel
lymph node #1 left axilla" consists of a ﬁbroadipose fragment of tissue measuring 6.0x3.0x1.0cm.
Within the tissue, 1 lymph node is identiﬁed measuring 1.3x1.2x1.0cm. Touch prep is prepared. The
specimen is submitted in toto in cassette D1-D3.

COMMENT: The invasive tumor present in thaﬁiﬁﬂ’east (specimen) shows a Ms
predominantly that oilobular carcinoma. In many areas, however, and particularly on Slide A5 the
tumor shows small tubular structures with angulated contours and apocrine snouting. This combined
morphology is that of tubulolobular carcinoma. This tumor was e-cadherin positive on the original
biopsy, a ﬁnding that normally favors ductal carcinoma. Tubulolobular carcinoma, however, has been
reported to be e-cadherin positive also. Since the WITI_Q9£LL$_QII.¥..IDQIHQ§§._.IEJbUIQQDHIQEEEIEIﬂgmﬁﬁ
a variantﬂg‘fklobularﬁcarcinomaKthat is how it is listeEI on the synoptic template since there is no option for
tuﬁu'TOI'o‘bular carcinoma in that template.
