Gross Description:

Specimen A is received in an appropriately labeled container,
additionally labeled "liver segment 2" and is a 6 x 5 x 5 mm
pink//tan soft tissue fragment, totally submitted as FSAl,

additionally labeled "liver segment 3" and is a 3 x 3 x 2 mm
pink//tan soft tissue fragment, totally submitted as FSBl,

Specimen C is received in an appropriately labeled container,
additionally labeled "liver segment 4" and is an 8 x 6 x 4 mm
pink//tan soft tissue fragment, totally submitted as FSCl,

Specimen D is received in an appropriately labeled container,
additionally labeled "liver segment 3 #2" and is a 6 x 4 x 4 mm
pink//tan soft tissue fragment, totally submitted as FSDl,

Specimen E is received in an appropriately labeled container,
additionally labeled "left liver" and is a 5 x 4 x 2 mm
pink//tan soft tissue fragment, totally submitted as FSEl,

Specimen F is received in an appropriately labeled container,
additionally labeled "pancreatic duct margin" is a 3 x 3 x 2 mm
pink/tan soft tissue fragment which is totally submitted as
FSFl,

Specimen G is received in an appropriately labeled container,
additionally labeled "bile duct margin" is a 1.0 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm
segment of pink/tan soft tissue which has an identifiable lumen.
This is totally submitted as FSGl,

 

Specimen H is labeled "gallbladder" and is an intact 11.5 x 5.4
x 4.2 cm gallbladder with attached stapled cystic duct. The
serosa is smooth green/tan and glistening. The lumen is
distended with dark green viscid bile and lined by a velvety
dark green mucosa. The wall has a uniform thickness of 0.1 cm.
Representative sections are submitted to include the cystic duct
margin in blocks Hl-HZ. No stones are identified within the
lumen.

Specimen I is labeled "portal node" and is a 2.4 x 1.3 x 0.6 cm
gray/tan lymph node candidate, serially sectioned and submitted
in 11.

Specimen J is labeled "pancreaticoduodenectomy."

Specimen fixation: formalin

Specimen type: standard Whipple

of pancreas (3.5 x 2.8 cm), common bile duct (2.4 cm long,
diameter ranges from 0.2 to 0.6 cm complete)

Orientation: Inking: common bile duct=yellow, pancreatic
body=blue, uncinate process=black, fatty pancreatic soft
tissue=green, vessels (1.0 x 0.5 cm, complete), adjacent to the

portal vein=red

Tumor location: head of the pancreas and possibly the common
bile duct

Tumor dimensions: 3.5 x 2.1 x 2.0 cm

hemorrhage are identified, potential tumor necrosis at the
center of the mass

Extent of invasion:

Confined / non-confined to the pancreas: non—confined

Involvement of the ampulla: possible (distal common bile duct is
stenosed) (J8, complete)

Involvement of the duodenum: present

 

Involvement of the bile duct: possible (distal common bile is
stenosed for the length of 1.2 cm and the proximal common bile
duct is dilated with velvety, erythematous mucosa)

Involvement of adjacent vessels: The portal vein groove is
smooth and intact, a 1.0 x 0.5 cm fragment of vessel is present
posterior to the head of pancreas (section J4, complete)
Spleen (if applicable): n/a

Gallbladder (if applicable): n/a

Stomach (if applicable): grossly not involved

Surgical margins:

Pancreatic body: 0.9 cm

Uncinate (Retroperitoneal): less than 0.1 cm

Common Bile duct: 3.0 cm

Proximal margin (stomach): 4 cm

Distal margin (duodenum): 11 cm

Peripancreatic soft tissues: abuts multiple green inked soft
tissue margins

Lymph nodes: submitted as per block summary

Other remarkable findings: There is a minimal amount of normal
pancreatic parenchyma in the neck region of the pancreas.

Digital photograph taken: no

Tissue submitted for special investigation: tumor and normal
