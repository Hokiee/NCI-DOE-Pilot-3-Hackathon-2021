GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification "left pelvic LN" is an aggregate of soft tissue, 5 x
2 x 1.5 cm containing multiple lymph nodes; lymph nodes are submitted entirely for frozen section
diagnosis:
FSA: frozen section of 1 lymph node sectioned
FSA2: frozen section of multiple lymph nodes
B. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "right pelvic LN" is an aggregate of soft
tissue, 5 x 4 x 1.5 cm containing multiple lymph nodes; lymph nodes are submitted entirely for frozen
section diagnosis:
FSB1: frozen section of 1 lymph node, sectioned
FSB2: frozen section of multiple lymph nodes
C. PROSTATE
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "prostate" is a 44 g resected prostate gland
measuring 5.1 cm from right lateral to left lateral, 4.2 cm from anterior to posterior, and 2.9 cm from
apex to base. Capsule is slightly nodular, red, and intact. Ink codes: base-blue, apex-red, anterior-
orange, right lateral-green, left lateral-yellow, and posterior-black. After removal of apex and base, the
prostate weighs 25 g and has a nodular tan parenchyma. The right seminal vesicle is 2.7 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm
and the left is 3.2 x 1.7 x 0.8 cm; they consist of cystic tan tissue. The right vas deferens is 3.7 x 0.7 cm
and the left is 2.9 x 0.6 cm; they consist of tubular tan tissue. Tissue is procured (13 g; the submitted
