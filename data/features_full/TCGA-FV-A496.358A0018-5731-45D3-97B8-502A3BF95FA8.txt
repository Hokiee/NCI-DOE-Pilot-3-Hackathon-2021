A) SOURCE: dartfgllliv‘r resection, secti h 5 and é, frozen for margin

The specimen is received fresh from the OR labeled "partial liver
resection, sections 5 and 6 — frozen for margin." It consists of a 520
gram, 14 x 9.8 x 7.5 cm partial liver resection. The smooth capsular
surface displays an 11.5 x 8 x 7 cm bosselated tan tumor bulging from its
external surface. The margin is inked blue and the tissue is serially cross
sectioned. -

INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION: "Tumor grossly 1 cm from cauterized
margin" is rendered by

The tumor has variegated, lobulated, yellow, tan, pink and brown cut

surfaces with predominantly well—defined edges. The tumor grossly abuts the
gallbladder bed. Extension through the capsule and into the gallbladder bed
is not seen. No other lesions are seen on the red-brown hepatic parenchyma.

The attached 8.7 cm in length and 3 cm in diameter intact distended
gallbladder has smooth glistening serosal surfaces which are mildly
edematous. Received within the gallbladder lumen are numerous 0.8 cm in
average diameter dark green, black multifaceted choleliths aggregating to
6.5 x 4.5 x 0.7 cm. On opening the mucosa displays two components. One
component extending to the cystic duct margin for a length of 2 cm is
red-tan and velvety. The remaining component of the mucosa is pink-tan,
flat to velvety with a slightly thickened wall up to 0.2—0.3 cm thick and
measuring approximately 1.3 cm in greatest dimension. The remaining mucosa
at the body and fundus is tan with thin trabeculations.

Representative sections are submitted in eight cassettes labeled:

1‘2. Liver tumor with closest blue inked margin

3 4. Tumor with adjacent hepatic parenchyma

5~6. Tumor with capsule

7 Gallbladder neck at the transition of thickened wall to relatively
normal»appearing wall at the cystic duct

8. En face cystic duct margin, and fundic wall

Note: The gross specimen was photographed. A portion of the tumor,
paranormal and normal parenchyma were banked for possible ancillary study.
