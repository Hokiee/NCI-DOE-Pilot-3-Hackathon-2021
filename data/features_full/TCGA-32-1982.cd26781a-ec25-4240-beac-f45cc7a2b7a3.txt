2. Right parietal tumor GBM —
CONTROL -

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS:

Brain tumor .TCGA-32‘1982

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1. Received fresh for frozen section labeled with the patient‘s name are two
tan— red soft tissues measuring 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm and 0. B x 0.7 x 0. 4 cm. The
lar or portion is bivalved Representative sections are submitted as follows:
i Smaller portion of soft tissue and half of the larger portion

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:
GLIAL NEOPLASM INTERMEDIATE TO HIGH GRADE. -

Tissue submitted for frozen is subsequently submitted for permanent. The
remainder of the tissue is submitted in cassettes 18.

2. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and llparietal tumor"
is a 4.0 x 2.5 x 2.4 cm tan-red soft tissue. The specimen surface is

shaggy. Also present in the container are multiple small portions of tan—red
shaggy soft tissue aggregating to 2.4 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm. The largest portion is
serially sectioned to reveal a tan—yellow homogenous cut surface. Entirely
submitted as follows:

A~F) Serial sections of largest portion of soft tissue

G) Unattached soft tissues also present in the container

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:

1, 2. Sections demonstrate a markedly hypercellular glial neoplasm, the cells
of which resemble moderately atypical fibrillary astrocytes. Numerous
scattered mitotic figures are seen. Microvascular proliferation is focally
prominent. Foci of confluent tumor necrosis are seen.

DIAGNOSIS:

1, 2. BRAIN TUMOR, BIOPSY AND RESECTION:

ADDENDUM DISCUSSION: '

Approximately 10— 25% of cells are immunoreactive for MGMT in a patchy
distribution. These include many definite tumor cells.

ADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS:

1, 2. BRAIN TUMOR, BIOPSY AND RESECTION:
GLIOBLASTOMA
— TUMOR CELLS POSITIVE FOR MGMT EXPRESSION.
