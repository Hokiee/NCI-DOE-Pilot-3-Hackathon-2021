FINAL DIAGNOSIS

A. GALLBLADDER-

MILD CHRONIC INFLAMMATION WITH FOCAL CHOLESTEROLOSIS.

B. CORE LIVER BIOPSY FS—

SEE PART "C".

C. CORE LIVER BIOPSY NES-

HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, WELL DIEFERENTIATED, ONE FRAGMENT.

CIRRHOSIS, ONE ERAGMENT.
MILD STAINABLE IRON IN KUPFFER CELLS.

NOTE: A CIRRHOTIC NODULE WITH FOCAL CYTOLOGIC ATYPIA IS SEEN ON
THE ORIGINAL FROZEN SECTION SLIDE. THE PERMANENT SECTION OF THE
FROZEN SECTION REMNANT AS WELL AS SPECIMEN "C" SHOW ONE FRAGMENT
OOMEOSED OE ATYPICAL HEPATOCYTES WITH DISRUPTED RETICULIN
KRAMEWORK WHIOH ARE POSITIVE FOR GLYPICAN-3 CEA POLYCLONAL IS
ALSO POSITIVE IN A CANALICULAR PATTERN. THESE FINDINGS SUPPORT
THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS.

Internal positive elements were examined and/or appropriate
positive controls were stained along side sections from this
case. The control tissue was examined and judged to be
technically acceptable.

D. SEGMENT 7 OF LIVER FS—

SEE PART "E".

E. SEGMENT 7 OF LIVER NFS“

SMALL CELL DYSPLASTIC MODULE WITH MINUTE SCATTERED FOCI WITH
IMMUNOPROFILE SUGGESTIVE OF EARLY EVOLVING HEPATOCELLULAR
CARCINOMA, see note.

CIRRHOSIS WITH MILD STEATOSIS CONSISTENT WITH CHRONIC HEPATITIS
C, GRADE 2/4, STAGE 4/4.

NO CARCINOMA SEEN AT SPECIMEN MARGINS.

N TE: THE RETICULIN STAIN HIGHLIGHTS A PRESERVED FRAMEWORK WITH
RARE FOCI OF THICKENED HEPATOCYTIC PLATES. THESE MINUTE FOCI ARE
WEAKLY POSITIVE FOR GLYPICAN—B. THE HISTOLOGY IN ADDITION TO
THESE FINDINGS SUPPORT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS.

Internal positive elements were examined and/or appropriate
pOsitive controls were stained along side sections from this
case. The control tissue was examined and judged to be
technically acceptable.

F. LEFT LOBE LIVER-BIOPSY—

CIRRHOSIS WITH MILD STEATOSIS CONSISTENT WITH CHRONIC HEPATITIS
C, GRADE 2/4, STAGE 4/4.

MILD STAINABLE [RON IN KUPEFER CELLS.

TRICHROME, RETICULIN AND IRON STAINS EXAMINED.

Internal positive elements were examined and/or appropriate
positive controls were stained along side sections from this
case. The control tissue was examined and judged to be
technically acceptable.

Case Clinical Information
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA

Gross Description

A. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"gallbladder" consists of a dilated cholecystectomy specimen
measuring in length 9.0 cm with a bile stained serosa. The
cystic duct measures 1. cm in length. The gallbladder mucosa
has a diffuse bile staining with a velvety appearance. The lumen
contains a large amount of Viscous bile material. No lesions or
polyps are identified. No stones are noted in the lumen or in
the container. A representative section of cystic duct margin
and body of the gallbladder submitted in Al.

B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
”core liver biopsy ES" consists of two 0.4 cm core tissue
remnants. Entirely submitted wrapped in Bl.

C. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"core liver biopsy NFS" consists of two fragments of tan tissue
each measuring 0.3 cm. Specimen is wrapped and submitted in C1.

D. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
”segment 7 of liver FS" consists of a 2.5 x 2 x 0.3 cm frozen
section tissue remnant with the surface revealing a hemorrhagic
circumscribed 0.4 cm area. Entirely submitted in D1.

E. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"segment 7 of liver NFS" consists of a 160 gram partial
hepatectomy specimen that has been previously serially
sectioned. When reconstructed overall dimensions of the specimen
measure 9.5 x 9.5 x 6.6 cm. The capsule is intact it is tan and
diffuse micro~nodularity consistent with cirrhosis. The margin
has a shaggy focally hemorrhagic appearance. Also the specimen
reveals a 3 x 3.0 cm area of sectioned tissue. These are

separate in the container. The cut surface reveals a single blue
nylon suture and may represent area of tumor. This area measures
2.0 mm to the resection margin. On the remaining sections in the
container one reveals a 1.8 cm circumscribed nodule. This nodule
measures to the capsule 0.2 cm and to the resection margin 1.0
cm. The remainder of the cut surface has a uniform nodular
consistency consistent with a cirrhotic liver parenchyma.
Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as
follows: El-E3=entire nodule from separate fragments:
E4eremainder of parenchyma at area of blue suture;
E5~E6=resection margin to the suture; E7~E81representative
sections away from the suture.

Additional sections from the marked sutured area in E9—E11.

F. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"left lobe liver biopsy" consists of a 1.5 cm core of tissue.
Wrapped and submitted in F1
