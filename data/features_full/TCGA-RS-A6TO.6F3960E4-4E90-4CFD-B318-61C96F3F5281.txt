consists of a 4.8 x 2.0 x 1.4 cm fragment of adipose tissue with attached
3.4 x 3.2 x 0.0 cm grossly unremarkable salivary gland. Sectioning the

permanent. The remaining lymph nodes are entirely submitted and the
remaining specimen is representatively submitted.

13) The specimen is received fresh labeled 'right anterior composite
resection of mandible, suture marks anterior" and consists of a resected
portion of mandible with attached soft tissue and a mucosal surface
measuring 7.2 x 3.5 x 3.2 cm in overall dimension. The mandible measures
7.2 x 2.2 x 1.9 cm. The soft tissue measures 6 x 3.5 3.1 cm with a mucosal
surface measuring 5.2 cm (anterior to posterior) x 3.5 cm (lateral/buccal to
medial/gingival). The mucosa is purple grey with a central ulcerated lesion
measuring 3 x1.B cm, grossly located from the mucosal margins as follows:
0.9 cm-antericr, 0.6 cm-lateral/buccal, 1.5 cm- posterior and 0.6 cm-medial.
The lesion is 1.1 cm from the anterior bone margin and 1.6 cm from the
posterior bone margin. The specimen is inked anterior-purple,
lateral/buccal-green, posterior-orange, medial—blue, deep-black. Upon
sectioning the lesion has underlying invasive component, grossly extending
to a depth of 1 cm, 0.2 cm from the nearest (lateral) margin. The lesion
grossly extends into the underlying bone. A representative section of the
lesion to the bone is submitted following decalcification. Perpendicular
sections of the anterior and posterior margins are submitted; the remaining
lesion is blocked out and submitted sequentially from anterior to posterior
in its entirety. The bone margins are shaved. Gross photographs are taken.
Tumor sampled for TPS. Representative sections are submitted.
