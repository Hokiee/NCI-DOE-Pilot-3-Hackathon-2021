Pathology Report for Subiect-

Discussion: Numerous scattered MIB-1 reactive cells are identified with a
labeling index of 6.6% calculated. Whereas this is relatively low for most
anaplastic astrocytomas, it is fairly typical of gemistocytic tumors.

Microscopic Description: Sections demonstrate a moderately hypercellular
glial neoplasm that is composed primarily of cells resembling atypical
gemistocytes. Atypia ranges from mild to moderate with a few scattered
highly atypical nuclei seen. There is no microvascular proliferation or
necrosis. Only up to 2 mitoses per 10 high power fields are seen but some
of the mitoses are atypical.

Diagnosis: Anaplastic Astrocytoma, gemistocytic.
MIB labeling index = 6.6%
