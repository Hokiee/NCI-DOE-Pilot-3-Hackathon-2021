GROSS DESCRIPTION ‘
The specimen Is received in seven separate containers labeled designated A

through 6‘.

A The container is received fresh unﬂxed labeled "right sentinel lymph node #1 for frozen section‘

and consists of an ovoid nodLIe of apparent fat which is 0.3 x 0 3 x 0.2 cm. Sectioning reveals a
Gig“ tan-gray nodule. Frozen section is deferred by Dr. . The entire specimen is
s itted in one block

B. T container is received fresh unflxed labeled “right sentinel lymph node #2 for frozen section'
and consists of an Irregular mass of apparent fat which is 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. in greatestioverall
dimension. Sectioning reveals a 0.6 cm. tan-gray nodule. Frozen section is deferred by Dr.

The entire specimen is submitted In one block

l
C. The container is received fresh unflxed labeled “right sentinel lymph node #3 for frozen section"
and consists of an ovoid mass of apparent fat which is 1 x 1 x 0.6 cm. in greatest dimension.
Sbctioning reveals a 0.3 cm. tan-gray area. Frozen section ls deferred by Dr.

D. The container ls received fresh unflxed labeled 'right sentinel lymph node #4 for frozen section'
and consists of an ovoid mass of tan-gray lirrn rubbery tissue which Is 1.5 x 1 x 1 cm inlgreatest
overall dimension. Touch prep and frozen section are obtained by Dr. . The entire
specimen including frozen section Is submitted in two blocks.

E, The continer is received fresh unflxed labeled “right sentinel lymph node #5 for frozen Section“
and consists of an irregular mass of apparent fat which is 1 x 0.4 x 0 3 cm. In greatest eyerall
dimension. Sectioning reveals a 0.3 cm. tan-gray area. Frozen section is deferred by Dr.

‘ ' The entire specimen is submitted in one block

F Tine container ls received fresh unflxed labeled “right sentinel lymph node #6 for frozen section"
and consists Of an Irregular mass of apparent fat which is 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm. Sectioning reveals
3:03 cm. tan-gray area. Frozen section is deferred by Dr. The entire specimen is
smeitted in one block.

G. T container is waived fresh unﬂxed labeled "right breast - suture on superior/lateral 'Lspeot"
and consists Of a 1.242 gm. apparent right breast which is 27 x 20 x 5.5 cm. in greatest overall
dimension and has an apparent axillary tall. There is an attached suture indicating '
superior/lateral aspect inked with red dye, lower lateral is inked black. upper medial is inked
gfeen, lower medial is Inked orange. The underlying deep is Inked with yellow. There is a

centrIcally placed nipple which Is slightly inverted. Sectioning through the breast stroma
r eals a gray—white irregular-bordered tumor mass which grossly appars to be 7.5 x SIX 3 cm.
i greatest overall dimension and grossly appears to be located in the mid superior/lateral region.
T tumor mass is 2.5 cm. from the underlying/yellow margin, 3.5 cm. from the

sirperior/medlal/green margin and 7 cm. from the infenor/rmcﬁal/orange margin. Sectioning
Ingrough the attached axillary fat reveals pink-tan noddes varying up to 1.5 cm in greatest
dimension The specimen is submitted in eighteen blocks.
