Pathology Report for Date of Surgery:

Diagnosis: 19': '0' 5 WE—
Right frontal lobe brain tumor WW
Anaplastic astrocytoma (grade ill) 946I/3

MlB-l Ll= 9.1%

IDH1— negative 51h” WW p03

P53: positive g” 0.7, ‘3
Qmjw M

Discussion: 07/1!
Sections demonstrate numerous scattered MlB-l reactive cells. In the most proliferative $09,371”
areas, a labeling index of 9.1% is calculated. The neoplastic cells are diffusely positive for

p%# but are negative for IDHl.

Microscopic Description:

Sections demonstrate a markedly hypercellular diffusely infiltrating glioma. The tumor
cells resemble fibrillary 5. wall the cystic astrocytes. Atypia is moderate. Scattered
