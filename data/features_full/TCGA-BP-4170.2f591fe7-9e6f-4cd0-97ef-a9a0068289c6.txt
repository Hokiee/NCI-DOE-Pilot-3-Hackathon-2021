1)

The specimen is received fresh, labeled. "Left kidney and adrenal". it consists of a nephrectomy specimen along with
adrenalectomy, with scant amount of perinephric adipose tissue. The kidney measures 11.5 x 7.5 x 5.0 cm. grossly
unremarkable. adrenal gland measures 5.0 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm and a slump of ureter measuring 11.0 cm in length and 0.6 cm in
average diameter. The kidney is blheived, revealing a 5.0 x 4.0 x 3. cm subcapsular, yellow-tan, circumscribed tumor at the
superior pole with minimal areas of hemorrhage and necrosis with a central scar. The tumor does not involve the pelvlcelyceal
system or vascular structures. The capsule is not easily peeledelf from the cortex. The rest of the renal parenchyma is
unremarkable. except for a" law cortical cysts (0.1-0.4 cm). At the hilum. grossly no lymph nodes are identiﬁed. Photographs are

taken. Tissue is submitted for TPS and EM. The external surface is inked black.

. Summary of Sections:

UM - ureteric margin

Vivi —- vascular margin with surrounding adipose tissue

A ~ adrenal gland
TA .. tumor with adrenal gland

TP —- tumor with renal pelvis

2) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left pen-aortic lymph node". it consists of two pieces of fatty tissue

measuring in aggregate 4.5 x 3.5 x 0.5 cm. Entirely submitted.
