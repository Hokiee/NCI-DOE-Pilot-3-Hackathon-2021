Main diagnosis/diagnoses:

Very extensive, pneumonia-like, imposing bronchopulmonary mixed adenocarcinoma with a
predominantly tubulopapillary and bronchioloalveolar pattern, as well as slight mucin
formation and formation of numerous, in parts very small foci within the parenchyma and
minimal pleural invasion and lymphogenous metastatic spread.

Comment/supplementary remark:

By definition, the foci of mixed adenocarcinoma detected not only in the immediate
environment of the tumor, but in some cases only at microscopic level, are to be classified
satellite nodes in the ipsilateral lobe, which - bearing in mind the location of the lymph node
micrometastases (samples 5.), 7.) and very probably also 1.)), as well as the absence of tumor
in the resection margins of the bronchus and the vessels - gives a tumor classification of pT4
le R0. But in view of the presentation of the tumor and the partial bronchioloalveolar
differentiation, the interpretation can be just as easily be supported or perhaps even favored
that this is a primary multifocal tumor manifestation. This would correspond to pT2(m). The
stage grouping IIIB thus competes with IIB. The main tumor mass lies in segments 6 and 9 of
the resected right lower lobe. The largest of the metastases found in the regional lymph nodes
is 1.2 mm. The coding is C 34.3; M 8255/3.
