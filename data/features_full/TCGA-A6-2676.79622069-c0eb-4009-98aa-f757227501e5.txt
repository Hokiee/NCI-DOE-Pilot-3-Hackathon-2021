SPECIMEN
Terminal ileum, right colon with attached small bowel and right
ovary

CLINICAL NOTES

PRE—O? DIAGNOSIS: Ascending colon mass.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

Received fresh for tissue procurement labeled "terminal

ileum, right colon with attached small bowel and right
ovary" is a previously unopened 35 cm. segment of proximal right
colon with attached 50 cm. of distal ileum, an additional 10 cm. of
adhesed small bowel and cerebriform 2.7 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. rubbery tan
gold ovary with associated 2.2 cm. fimbriated tubal segment. A
minimal amount of unremarkable omentum is present in addition to a
moderate amount of mesocolon and mesentery. The serosa is smooth to
scabrous tan pink—purple. The proximal and distal margins measure
3.7 and 6.2 cm. in circumference respectively. On opening there is
a necrotic 12.5 x 9.5 cm. circumferential white pink~red tumor mass
at the ileocecal valve involving both the distal ileum and proximal
cecum. A portion of tumor is procured as requested. On sectioning,
there is a maximal thickness of 3.5 cm. grossly descending through
the muscularis into the attached mesocolon and extending to within
less than 0.1 cm. of the inked free radial serosal surface (surface
of the attached mesocolon inked orange and surface of free serosal
surface inked black). In addition, the tumor extends through the
wall of the colon and that of the attached additional segment of
small bowel to within 0.15 cm. of the mucosal surface of the
additional segment. The uninvolved ileal and Colonic mucosa is
unremarkable glistening tan pink with regular folds and the walls
average 0.5 cm. in thickness. No additional mass lesion or
abnormality is identified. No appendix is present. The
aforementioned ovary and tubal segment is not involved by tumor,
associated with the specimen solely by adhesions. The ?? , is

GROSS DESCRIPTION

pale tan with identifiable corpora albicantia. Several soft to
slightly rubbery pale tan tissues in keeping with lymph nodes
measuring up to 1.4 cm. in greatest dimension are recovered from the
attached mesocolon and mesentery. Representative sections are
submitted in 15 blocks as labeled.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - Margin; 2 and 3 h tumor full thickness through
mesocolon to surface of mesocolon {inked orange; point of continuity
inked red); 4 and 5 — tumor full thickness to inked free radial
serosal surface; 6 — tumor full thickness to attached additional
small bowel segment; 7 — ICE; 8 — tumor to normal ileum and normal
colon; 9 H random ileum; l0 — random colon; 11 - adhesed ovary and
tube segment; 12 and 13 — eight whole lymph nodes per cassette; l4
and 15 — one bisected lymph per cassette.

 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma with focal mucinous
differentiation.

Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated.

Primary tumor {pT): Tumor has extended through the wall of the
colon into the wall of the adjacent small intestine (qu).

Proximal margin: Negative.

Distal margin: Negative.

Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative.

Vascular invasion: Negative.

Regional lymph nodes {pN): Fifteen mesenteric lymph nodes are free
of metastatic carcinoma (pNO).

Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: Absent.

Distant metastasis (pM): Cannot be assessed (pMX).

Other findings: Right ovary and fallopian tube adhesed to the colon
without evidence of involvement by tumor.

DIAGNOSIS

Terminal ileum right colon with attached small bowel and right ovary
and fallopian tube, en bloc resection:
Invasive poorly differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma with focal
mucinous differentiation extending through the wall of the colon
into the wall of the adhesed small bowel segment.
Tumor also extends across the ileocecal valve into the terminal
ileum” Proximal, distal and radial margins of resection are free
of tumor.
Fifteen mesenteric lymph nodes without evidence of metastatic
carcinoma (0/15).
Adhesed right fallopian tube and ovary without evidence of
involvement by tumor.
