Intraoperative Consultation: #2, section of umbilical hernia "nodule", resection — pick up
only

FSl — Left ovary mass
- "Adenocarcinoma" by

Microscopic Description and Comment: Histologic sections from the left ovarian mass show

a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The tumor is present predominantly in sheets of
cells with large vesicular nuclei and occasional tumor giant cells. In some areas the

tumor is present in thin single file cords invading a desmoplastic stroma. Other areas show
rhabdoid features with perinuclear eosinophilic cytoplasm. A significant minority of the
tumor forms well—defined endometrioid—type glands. These glands appear to be present in

an adenofibromatous stroma. Metastatic adenocarcinoma extensively involves the lymphatics
of the myometrium but no serosal implants are present. The endometrium has been entirely
submitted and exhibits a disordered proliferative pattern but no carcinoma is identified.
The right ovary (enitrely submitted) and both fallopian tubes are free of carcinoma.
Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in periappendiceal soft tissue. The appendix also
contains a focal mucocele but no carcinoma involving epithelium is present. Metastatic
adenocarcinoma is present in 2 of 2 right external iliac lymph nodes, 2 of 2 right obturator
lymph nodes, lof 2 left external iliac lymph nodes, 2 of 6 left obturator lymph nodes, 2 of
2 right peri-aortic lymph nodes, and l of I left peri—aortic lymph nodes. One right common
iliac lymph node is free of carcinoma. Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is present in

the specimen labeled "umbilical hernia and nodule. The single submitted section from the
specimen labeled "small bowel mesenteric mass" appears to represent near total replacement
of a large lymph node. The omentum is free of carcinoma.

Given the somewhat unusual morphologic features immunostains were performed. The tumor is
negative for gross cystic disease fluid protein an antibody that stains approximately 60 to
80% of breast carcinomas. The tumor is focally positive for 5—100 and is strongly positive
for CA—125 in the better differentiated endometrioid areas. Although the morphologic
features and tumor distribution are somewhat unusual, in the absence of another primary
tumor these features are consistent with a mullerian (ovarian) primary.

History: The patient is a year old woman with an abdominal mass. Operative procedure:
Hysterectomy, removal of abdominal mass, multiple node samplings.

Gross Description Thirteen formalin-filled containers are received, each labeled with the
patient's name. The first container is labeled "uterus, left ovary and tube." It contains a
white cassette labeled FSl. It contains a section of white—tan mass, measuring 1.5 x 1.8 x
0.2 cm. Labeled Al - FS. Also present in the container is a large irregularly shaped mass,
measuring 18 x 15 x 14 cm and weighing 1100 grams after fixation. The surface is covered
by a glistening membrane, is irregular, nodular and partially hemorrhagic. No tumor is
evident outside the capsule. There is a thin walled cyst present, measuring 4 x 3.5 x 6 cm.
A fragment of the left fallopian tube is present on the surface of the mass, measuring 4.5
cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. The fimbriae are not evident. On sectioning, the tumor
mass is mostly solid, firm, tan—brown with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. Only minute
cystic areas are present except the previously described cyst. No normal ovarian parenchyma
is identified. No uterus is present in the container. Labeled: A2 — left fallopian tube; A3
to All — sections of the tumor. Jar 5.

The second container is labeled "section of umbilical hernia and nodule." It contains
an elliptical excision of skin including the umbilicus, measuring 4.5 x 1.2 cm on the
skin surface and 5 cm from skin surface to deep resection margin. The skin surface

is unremarkable. The deep resection margin is inked black. Sections show a tan—pink,

circumscribed nodule, measuring 3 x 2 x 1.5 cm. The mass does not reach the inked margin.
Labeled Bl. Jar l.

The third container is labeled "uterus, cervix, right ovary, right tube." It contains
the uterus with attached right fallopian tube and ovary, weighing 86 grams and measuring 5

cm from cornu to cornu, 9.8 cm from cornu to cervix, and 3.0 cm anterior—posteriorly. The
cervix measures 3.5 x 2 cm, scant ectocervix is present. The endocervix measures 3.8 cm in
length and 1.5 cm in diameter, and is unremarkable. The endometrial cavity measures 5.5 x
3.0 cm. The endometrium is 0.1 cm thick, slightly nodular and hemorrhagic. There is a 0.8
x 0.5 cm endometrial polyp present in the left cornu. The myometrium is 1.5 cm thick and
unremarkable. The serosa is unremarkable. The right fallopian tube measures 5 cm in length
and 0.3 cm in diameter. The attached right ovary measures 2.8 x 1.8 x 0.6 cm. Sections are
unremarkable. Labeled: Cl - anterior cervix; C2 - anterior endomyometrium; C3 — anterior
endomyometrium with endometrial polyp; C4 — posterior cervix; C5 - posterior endomyometrium;
C6 — right fallopian tube; C7 — right ovary, C8 —remainder of the right ovary, EMS-EMZO -
remainder of endometrium. Jar 2.

tissue, measuring 1 x 0.8 x 0.3, and 1.8 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. No lymph node is grossly identified
in the fat. Labeled D1. Jar 0.

The fifth container is labeled "R external node." It contains multiple fragments of
