GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in four parts:

Part 1 is received fresh from identiﬁed with the patient's name with initials and labeled as "left buccai mucosa. left mandibular
periosteum. left submandibuiar gland and left level 1'. It measures overa 0.5 x ?.5 x 5.0 cm and consists of a resection of the
buccai mucosa with tumor (4.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm), soft tissue with 4.5 x 1.8 cm piece of mandibular periosteum and submandibular
soft tiesue with submandibuiar gland (2.5 x 2.8 x 1.8 cm), multiple lymph nodes.

The tumor (4.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm) has an ulcerated necrotic surface and on sectioning comes within Oat-cm from the superior buccai
mucosal resection margin. 0.3-cm from the inferior buccal mucosai resection margin. abuts to the deep tumorous section margin
and is 4.8 cm from the inferior ginQIVal mucosa! resection margin.

The periosteum is overlying and second ulcerated, spatially distinct mass (4.5 x 2.5 x 2.8»cm) which appears grossly extend into
the submandibular gland. The soft tissue from the ieveI 1 contains additional three lymph nodes, all replaced by tumor.

Gross photo raphs are taken._
Tissua from t e buccal tumor, normal mucosa and tissue from the positive lymph node are frozen {0-,

Part 2 is received fresh. identiﬁed with the patient’s name with initial and labeled as "left side levels 2 and 3“. It consists of a
piece of flbrofatiy tissue {5.5 x 3.5 x 1.0-cm) containing three lymph no as (0.6 to 2.6-cm). Two largest lymph nodes are grossly
involved by the timer.

Section code:
2A and 28 - one iyj‘nph node in each, bisected

Part 3 is received fresh, identiﬁed with the paiieni's name with inllials$and Ia elect as "left neck level 2". it cchslsls of a piece of
ﬂbrofatty tissue containing one 0.9-ch lymph node. The specimen is s mills in Ioto in Cassette 3A.

Part 4 is received fresh. identiﬁed with the patienl's name with initial U I labeled as "Ietl neck level 4", it consists of a piece of
llhrofatty tissue containing multiple lymph nodes (0.5 to Larcm). 'l‘he gest lymph node is grossly litvoived the tumor.
