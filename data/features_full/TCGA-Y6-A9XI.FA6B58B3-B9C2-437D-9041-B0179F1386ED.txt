Electronically Signed

Specimen(s) Received:

A: Posterior bladder neck margin
B: Prostate with seminal vesicles
C: Bilateral pelvic LN

Clinical History:
Prostate cancer.
(B) Tumor Bank.

Intraoperative Consultation:

Time Received:

Time Reported:

FSAl: Posterior bladder neck margin: Benign fibromuscular
tissue with three glands at one end (1 block).

Gross Description:

(A) (posterior bladder neck margin) Received fresh for
frozen

section analysis is a fragment of firm whiteetan tissue
measuring 0.3 x 0.2 cm submitted in cassette FSAl.

(B) (prostate with seminal vesicles) Received in formalin
following Tumor Bank sampling, inking and orientation is a
radical prostatectomy with the bilateral seminal vesicles
removed and weighs 40.1 gm and is 4.5 cm right to left, 3.6 cm
superior to inferior and 3.8 cm anterior to posterior. Right
half is inked red, the left half is inked green and the
posterior midline is inked black. The capsule appears intact.

Serial oblique sections are made and show focal tan solid
nodules within both the right and left halves of the specimen.

This nodularity comprises roughly 10% of the total volume of
the

specimen. There is a large nodule measuring 0.5 x 0.4 cm that
is abutting the capsule on the right side of the specimen at
approximately levels 5-7. The remaining volume consists of
pale

tan rubbery trabeculated tissue. The right seminal vesicle is
5.0 x 1.8 x 0.6 cm and the vas deferens is 4.6 cm long x 0.7
cm

in diameter. The left seminal vesicle is 3.9 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm
and

the left vas deferens is 4.5 cm long x 0.7 cm in diameter. A
diagram is provided to facilitate orientation. The entire
specimen is submitted as follows:

Bl—B7 — apex submitted right to left

BB-B39 - prostate submitted entirely

340—856 - bilateral seminal vesicles submitted entirely

(C) (bilateral pelvic lymph nodes) Received in formalin are
multiple fragments of lobular yellow adipose tissue with firm
lymph nodes measuring 5.5 x 4.0 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is
palpated for nodes and submitted as follows:

C1 — one lymph node, sectioned

C2 - one lymph node, sectioned

C3 - one node

Microscopic Description:
Complete microscopic evaluation has been performed.

 

Appropriately reacting controls have been performed and
evaluated for all stains on this case as required.

Histopathology has a list of IH antibodies that are regulated
as

analyte specific reagents (ASR's). These assays were
developed

and their performance characteristics determined by the
Histopathology Laboratory in the Department of Pathology at

They

have not been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration.
The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not
necessary for the ASR's. These tests are not investigational
and are used in standard clinical care. In cases where
Immunohistochemistry testing is performed, the following
antibodies and their respective clones may be used to
determine

therapy for the patient: EFGR(3CG), ER(SP1), PR(1E2),
Heaneu(4B5), CD117(Poly), CD20(L26) K167(30-9).

Unless otherwise stated in the report, all tissue tested for
ERPR by IHC, Her2 by IHC and/or HER2 by FISH have been fixed
as

per C.A.P. requirements for a minimum of 6 hours and a maximum
of 48 hours.

ER, PR, Ki-67, p53 are reported as a semi—quantitative
percentage of positively stained nuclei. Her-Z/neu and EGFR
are

scored as follows: No staining at all is scored as (0), weak,
incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of cells is
scored as (1+), less than strong but complete staining in any
proportion of cells or complete strong staining in less than

30%

of cells is scored as (2+), and strong complete staining in
more

that 30% of cells is scored as (3+). All studies are
