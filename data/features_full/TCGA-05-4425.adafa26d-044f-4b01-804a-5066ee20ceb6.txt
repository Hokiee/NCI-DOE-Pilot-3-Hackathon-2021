Main diagnosis/diagnoses:

Peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically mixed adenocarcinoma of the middle with
pleural invasion and a second small focus or satellite nodule of a tubular adenocarcinoma
with a small bronchiooalveolar growth component and likewise pleural infiltration (sample
2.)). TNM classification on the basis of this material pT2 pNO le (PUL) V1 RX, stage IV.
C342 M8255/3.

Comment/supplementary remark:

The tumor classification as adenocarcinoma of the lung showing a predominantly
tubulopapillary structural pattern still requires confirmation by appropriate
immunohistochemical analysis. The classification of the second small tumor focus as a
(hematogenous) metastasis that — despite a certain difference in histoarchitecture and cell
morphology in places — is based on the structure of the focus, which is lacking the fibrous
remodeling or cicatricial zone here that is characteristic of a primary peripheral
bronchopulmonary carcinoma. Vascular invasion can be seen in the intratumoral, thick-walled
pulmonary vessels of the larger tumor, where there is tumor spread with endobronchial
occlusion in a subsegmental branch of the bronchus. The R1 classification is explained by the
observation that the tumor glands invading the pleura extend as far as the outer surface of the
pleura in places and the tumor cells thus remain in the pleural space.

Result of immunohistochemical analysis (both tumor foci)

CK7 positive throughout, CK20 negative. TTF1.positive (in the smaller focus more than in
the larger one), only isolated tumor cells with delicate cell membrane staining for surfactant
protein B.

This not only confirms that it is an adenocarcinoma of the lung and, but also supports the
view that the smaller focus represents the metastasis of the larger focus
seen in 1.) and classified as primary tumor.
