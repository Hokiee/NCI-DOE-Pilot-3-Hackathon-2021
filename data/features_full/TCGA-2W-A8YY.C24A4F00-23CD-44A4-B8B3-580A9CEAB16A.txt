DIAGNOSIS:
A. UTERUS WITH CERVIX (260 GRAMS), BILATERAL OVARIES AND FALLOPIAN
TUBES;
HYSTERECTOMY/SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY:
- ADENOSQUAMOUS CARCINOMA, INVASIVE.

— HISTOLOGIC GRADE: G3 = HIGH GRADE.

- MACROSCOPIC TUMOR SIZE: \R\8 CM (CIRCUMFERENTIAL
INVOLVEMENT;
MEASUREMENT ESTIMATED FROM CONSECUTIVE TUMOR SECTIONS OF CERVIX).

- TUMOR SITE: TUMOR CIRCUMFERENTIALLY INVOLVES UPPER CERVIX.

- STROMAL INVASION
- DEPTH OF INVASION: 1.2 CM (12 mm).
- HORIZONTAL SPREAD: COMPLETE CIRCUMFERENTIAL SPREAD.

- EXTENSION TO CORPUS: YES, EXTENSIVE AND TRANSMURAL
INMULTIPLE SECTIONS WITH ERODED ENDOMETRIUM.

- ADDITIONAL STRUCTURES POSITIVE FOR INVASION: NONE.

- ADDITIONAL STRUCTURES WITHOUT INVASION: NOT APPLICABLE.

— LYMPH-VASCULAR INVASION: POSITIVE IN CERVICAL LYMPHATICS
AND PARAMETRIAL VEIN.

- MARGINS:

- SOFT TISSUE: POSTERIOR SEROSA OF UTERINE BODY POSITIVE FOR
TUMOR.

- DISTAL MUCOSA: NEGATIVE.
- REGIONAL LYMPH NODES:
- NODE SITES NEGATIVE FOR METASTASIS: SEE BELOW.
- NODES SITES POSITIVE FOR METASTASIS: O.
— TOTAL LYMPH NODE COUNT: 0/18 (POSITIVE/TOTAL)
- OTHER FINDINGS: NONE.

— PATHOLOGIC STAGE: T2a2/N0 FIGO IIA2 BY AJCC CANCER STAGNING
MANUAL, 7TH ED.

B. LYMPH NODE, RIGHT PELVIC; EXCISION:

— FIVE REACTIVE LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/5).
C. LYMPH NODE, LEFT PELVIC; EXCISION:

— TEN REACTIVE LYMPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (O/lO).
D. LYMPH NODES, RIGHT PERIAORTIC; EXCISION:

- THREE REACTIVE LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/3).
E. SOFT TISSUE, SIGMOID ADHESIONS; EXCISION:

- FIBROUS CONNECTIVE TISSUE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

COMMENT:
Immunohistochemical stains performed with appropriately reactive controls
for vimentin, p16, ER, and CEA are consistent with the above diagnosis.

Tumor cells patchily express p16 and CEA with no reactivity for ER or

vimentin.

INTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:

FSA: Uterus: Extensive necrotic tumor, uterus and cervix. Gross

examination only. (-)
CLINICAL INFORMATION: - stage I 132 adenosquamous

carcinoma of the cervix.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: Number of specimen containers: five, each labeled with

A. Container designation: "uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries"
—— Received unfixed is a radical hysterectomy specimen consisting of
uterus, cervix, attached bilateral adnexa and parametrial tissue weighing
260 gm, measuring 13.5 x 6.5 x 6.0 cm. The anterior serosa is smooth, the
posterior serosa demonstrates a firm subserosal yellow-gray mass in the
body measuring 4.5 x 2.9 x 1.0 cm. Surfacing the serosa and the mass is a
1.0 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm cystic structure occupied by clear watery fluid. The
posterior serosa and soft tissue margins are inked. The ectocervix is
pink-tan with purpuric changes surrounding the os 1.0 cm (tumor?) and an
anterior/posterior vaginal identified 1.0 and 0.8 cm in length,
respectively. Sectioning of the anterior cervix at the os is grossly
unremarkable, however, the tumor extends from within 0.9 cm of the
anterior cervical os to the fundus and appears full thickness in the lower
uterine segment and body. The posterior aspect is similar in appearance
to that of the anterior aspect. Sectioning of the tumor demonstrates a
yellow—gray purulent appearance with prominent necrosis. Representative
sections of tumor and normal are submitted to I. The right ovary
measures 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm and sectioning demonstrates a thickened cortex
and pink—tan mottled stroma. The pink—tan fallopian tube with fimbriated
end measures 5.5 cm in length, 0.6 cm in external diameter and sectioning
demonstrates a pink-tan mottled stroma. The left ovary measures 3.0 x 1.5
x 1.0 cm and sectioning demonstrates a pink—tan mottled stroma. The
corresponding pink—tan fallopian tube with fimbriated end measures 6.0 cm
in length, 0.5 cm in external diameter and sectioning demonstrates a
pinpoint lumen. Sections are submitted as follows: cassette Al-posterior
body, serosa with nodule extruding; cassette AZ-representative

anterior/posterior vaginal cuff (anterior inked red, posterior green); A3—

anterior cervix and ectocervix full thickness; cassette A4-anterior
endocervical canal full thickness; cassette AS-posterior cervix full
thickness with ectocervix; cassette A6-posterior endocervical canal;
cassette A7—anterior body; cassette

A8—posterior body full thickness; cassette A9—anterior fundus full
thickness; cassette AlO-posterior fundus full thickness; cassette All-
representative right ovary and fallopian tube; cassette AlZ-representative
left ovary and fallopian tube; cassette Al3—parametrial tissue right
lateral wall; cassette Al44—representative parametrial tissue left lateral
wall.

B. Container designation: "Right pelvic lymph node" — Received are
multiple portions of fat aggregating to 3.5 x 3 x 1.5 cm. Five possible
lymph nodes are identified upon sectioning, the largest measuring 1.7 cm.
The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows: Bl—B5—one bisected
lymph node in each.

C. Container designation: "Left pelvic lymph node" — Received are
multiple portions of fat aggregating to 4 x 3 x 1 cm. Eight possible
lymph nodes are identified upon sectioning, the largest measuring 1.5 cm.
The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows: Cl—four lymph nodes in
toto, C2—C4—one bisected lymph node in each, C5—four possible lymph nodes
in toto.

D. Container designation: "Right periaortic lymph node" — Received are
three lymph nodes, the largest measuring 2 x 0.7 x 0.2 cm. The lymph
nodes are entirely submitted from D1 to D3, each containing one bisected
lymph node.

E. Container designation: "Sigmoid adhesion" — Received is a portion of
gray—tan membranous tissue measuring 2 x 0.6 x 0.1 cm, bisected and

entirely submitted in El.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Histologic examination performed.

Any tests performed using Analytic Specific Reagents (ASR) were developed
and validated by —. The U.S. Food and Drug

Administration has not approved these tests but has determined that such

clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests should be regarded

as a clinical assay for standard medical care.

The was present during the formal review and
interpretation of all slides and ancillary studies, (if performed), with

the . Specimens with only gross examination

were reviewed and interpreted by the —.
