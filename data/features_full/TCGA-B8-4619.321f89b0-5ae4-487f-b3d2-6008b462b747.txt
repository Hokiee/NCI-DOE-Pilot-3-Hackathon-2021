lagnosis:
Kidney, left, left radical nephrectomy

Histologic tumor type/subtype: renal cell carcinoma, conventional type
Histologic grade (if applicable): grade 2 of 4
Tumor size (greatest dimension): 3.4 cm

Extent of tumor invasion:

Capsular invasion/perirenal adipose tissue: not involved
Gerota' a fascia: not involved

Renal vein: not involved

Ureter: not involved

Venous (large vessel}: not involved

Lymphatic (small vessel): not involved

Adjacent organs: not involved

Histologic asaessment of surgical margins:
Perirenal adipose tissue: not involved
Gerota' s fascia: not involved

Renal vein: not involved

Renal artery: not involved

Ureter: not involved

Adrenal gland: present and unremarkable
Lymph nodes: none present

Other significant findings:
- Patchy interstitial chronic inflammation.
H Incidental papillary adenoma, 0.2 cm (see comment).

.CC Staging:
pTla
pNx

This staging information is based on information available at the time of this
report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and additional information.

COMMENT:
Immunohistochemical stains were performed on blocks A3 and A4. The tumor cells in the dominant mass are negative

for CKV. CKZO and Hale' s colloidal iron. These findings exclude the possibility of chromophobe variant of renal
cell carcinoma. A second focus in block A3 shows a papillary neoplasm with psammoma bodies that is 0.2 cm in
greatest dimension. It is pOSitive for CK? and negative for CK20, TTF—l, and thyroglobulin. These findings
exclude the possibility of a micrometastasis from lung or thyroid. The findings are consistent with a papillary
microadenoma.

Clinical History:

with clinical diagnosis of renal mass.

Gross Description:

Specimen fixation: formalin

Type of specimen: per the specimen requisition, a laparoscopic radical nephrectomy

Side of specimen: left

Size and weight of specimen: 1,000 grams; 25 x 23 x 9 cm overall; The kidney is 14.0 X 7.0 X 6-5 cm.

Orientation: There is no orientation provided. The external surface is inked blue.

Presence/absence of adrenal gland: A markedly disrupted 1.0 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm area of golden brown tissue
qgestive of adrenal gland is identified at the superior pole of the nephrectomy specimen. This is the only

_entified adrenal gland.

Tumor description/site: The tumor is an upper pole, mainly anterior medial mass. The mass appears cortical and
has a mainly solid, but focally cystic pink/brown, focally hemorrhagic cut surface. The appearance is not
suggestive of classic renal cell.

 

Tumor size: 3.4 x 2.8 x 1.5 cm

Presence/absence of multicentricity: absent

fonfinementInch—confinement to the kidney: Grossly confined, however the perinephric adipose tissue is diSrUPted
verlying the tumor. At one portion, the kidney is inked blue.

Extent of invasion:

Perirenal adipose tissue: difficult to accurately determined, believad to be uninv01Ved
Gerota' s fascia: does not grossly involve

Renal vein: does not grossly involve

Ureter: does not grossly involve

other organs: tumor is distant from the small fragment of adrenal gland

Surgical margins:

Perirenal adipose tissue: believed negative
Renal vein: negative

Renal artery: negative

Ureter: negative

Description of kidney away from tumor: The remainder of the kidney parenchyma consists of pink/brown normal
parenchyma with a distant corticomedullary junction. The cortex is 9 mm and the medulla is 1.1 cm. The medulla

is 1.1 cm.

Lymph nodes (hilar): The hilar adipose tissue is palpated for lymph node candidate, no lymph node candidates are
identified.

Other significant findings: none

Tissue submitted for special investigations: Tumor and normal was taken by Tissue Procurement
Digital photograph taken: no
Block summary:

A1 - ureter and hilar vascular margins, en face

A2 - adrenal gland

A3 ~ normal kidney
4,A5 - one section of kidney and blue inked margin, slice bisected
5,h7 — additional kidney and blue inked margin, slice bisected

A8 ~ tumor and adjacent normal cortex

A9 — tumor towards renal pelvis

A10 ~ tumor in the area of the renal sinus

Light Microscopy:
Light microscopic examination is performed by I.

Appropriate internal and/or external positive and negative controls have been
evaluated. Some of the immunohistochemical reagents used in this case may be

classified as analyte specific reagents (ASK). These ware develo ed and have
performance characteristics determined 1) th#

cleared or approved y t e US Foo an Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are
used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or
for research. This laborator is certified under the Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments o_) as qualified to perform high complexity

clinical laboratory testing.
