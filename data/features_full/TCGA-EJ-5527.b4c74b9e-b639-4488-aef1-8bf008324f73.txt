his biopsy revealed prostalic adenocarcinome. Gleason score 4+4: 3 involving the right side of the
prostate iota Inear extent 1. 2 cm The patient also has a history of surgery to remove a cyst from his' law, bilateral inguinal hemla
repairs, amputation of two toes on his right foot. umbilical hernia repair, Ieﬁ rotator cuff surgery. hypertension and
hypercholesterolemia.

PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer.

POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: Same.

PROCEDURE: Radical prostatectomy and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection.

 

 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

PART 1: LYMPH NODES, RIGHT PELVIC, EXCISION -
NO EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASIA IN TWO LYMPH NODES (0I2).

.ICGA-EJ-5527

PART 3: PROSTATE BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES, AND BILATERAL DISTAL VASA DEFERENTIA. RADICAL
PROSTATECTOMY -
A. PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, ACINAR TYPE WITH FOCAL SIGNET RING FEATURES, GLEASON SCORE
4 + 3= 7 WITH TERTIARY GLEASON PATTERN 5 COMPONENT. GLEASON PATTERNS 41'5 COMPONENTS
COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY 60% OF THE SAMPLED TUMOR VOLUME (Seecomment).

 

PART 2: L‘I’MPH NODES, LEFT PELVIC. EXCISION —
NO EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASIA IN SEVEN LYMPH NODES (017}

B. CARCINOMA INVOLVES BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT LOBES AND HAS A GREATEST HISTOLOGIC MODULAR
DIAMETER OF 2.1 cm.

C. CARCINOMA INVOLVES 10-15% OF THE EXAMINED PROSTATE GLAND VOLUME.

D. FOCAL CARCINOMATOEJS EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IS PRESENT IN THE RIGHT POSTERIOR APEX AND
RIGHT POSTERIOR MID PROSTATE (Slides 3U, 3V}.

E. EXTENSIVE PERINEURAL INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

F. NO ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

G. BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES AND BILATERAL DISTAL VASA DEFERENTIA ARE BENIGN.

H. ALI. EXAMINED ASSESSABLE SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF NEOPLASIA {See comment}.

I. MULTIFOCAL HIGH-GRADE PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA IS IDENTIFIED.

J. TNM PATHOLOGIC STAGE: pT3a N0 NIX.

K. TNM HISTOLOGIC GRADE = G34.

L. BACKGROUND PROSTATE WITH NODULAR HYPERPLASIA AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATION {See synoptic).

COMMENT:

Part 3: lmmunohlstochemlcal stains and deeperlevels are obtained on slide 3R to evaluate the carcinoma which appears
close to one edge of the tissue representing the left anterior apex capsule. Additional levels are examined. and suggest
Ink diaplaced onto a cut surface of prostate tissue. rather than neoplastic glands present at the surgical resection margin.

A P|N4 immunostain (p63. cytokeratin 903, P5043}. p63, and racemase support the diagnosis of carcinoma by
demonstrating a lack of basal sails and positive cytoplasmic staining with P5048.

A section in slide 3M is suboptimally oriented in the tissue block precluding capsular and margin assessment in this
section.
