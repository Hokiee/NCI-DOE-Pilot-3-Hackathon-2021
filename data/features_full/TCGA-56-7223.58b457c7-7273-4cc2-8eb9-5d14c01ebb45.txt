Addendum Information:
This addendum is issued to add information about the additional portion of pericardial
tissue. The diagnosis remains unchanged.

A. -|.) LUNG, RIGHT, MIDDLE AND LOWER LOBES, HILAR (N10R), INTERLOBAR
(N11R X 2), SUBCARINAL (N7), PARAESOPHAGEAL (N8), AND LOWER
PARATRACHEAL (N4R) LYMPH NODES, BILOBECTOMY WITH REGIONAL
LYMPHADENECTOMY:

- POORLY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA.
- 14 cm in greatest dimension.
- Visceral pleural invasion: Not identiﬁed.
- MARGIN STATUS: NEGATIVE.
- Tumor is 0.5 cm from the bronchial margin.
- Vascular and parenchymal margins uninvolved by invasive
carcinoma.
- LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION: NOT IDENTIFIED.
- ONE (N10R) OF TWENTY-NINE TOTAL LYMPH NODES, POSITIVE
FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (1/29).
- PERICARDIAL TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

PATHOLOGIC STAGING SUMMARY:

Type and grade: Squamous cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated.

Primary tumor: pT3 (14 cm in maximum dimension).

Regional lymph nodes: pN1 (one peribronchial lymph node (N10R) out of
twenty-nine lymph nodes, positive for metastatic
carcinoma, 1/29).

Distant metastasis: pMX.
Pathologic stage: IIIA.
Lymphovascular invasion: Not identiﬁed.

Margin status: R0 (tumor is 0.5 cm from the bronchial margin).

COMMENT: Elastic stain, performed with adequate control conﬁrms the absence of
viceral pleura invasion.
