Final Surgical Pathology Report

Procedure:
Diagnosis
A. Sentinel lymph node #1, excision:
No evidence of metastasis in 3 lymph nodes (0/3).
E. Sentinel lymph node #2, excision:
No evidence of metastasis in 3 lymph nodes (0/3).
C. Right breast, mastectomy:

Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, grade 3, 4.3 cm greatest dimension,
surgical margins negative but close (0.4 cm, deep).

Microscopic Description:
Microscopic examination performed.

A. B. sections of sentinel lymph nodes 1 and 2 demonstrate no
evidence in 3 lymph nodes in each specimen. The lymph nodes were
examined by multilevel sectioning with H&E staining as well as by
histochemistry for pankeratin.

Gross Description

A.

Container a is labeled with the patient‘s name, medical record

number and "sentinel node". The specimen container holds 3 lymph nodes
ranging in size from 1.5 x l X 1.5 cm to 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. AFS l,
AFB 2 one lymph node bisected AFS 332 lymph nodes

B. Container B. is labeled with the patient's name, medical record
number and "palpable nodule right axilla". Per Dr. this should be
regarded as such libido for to. The specimen container holds 3

separate lymph nodes. Each lymph node is bisected and submitted in one
block,

C. Received fresh and subsequently placed in formalin at

labeled "right mastectomy" is a 27.0 cm (superior to inferior) by 26.0
cm (medial to lateral) by 6.5 cm (anterior to posterior) diffusely
cauterized soft, lobulated tan—white—gold portion of fibroadipose
tissue in keeping with breast. A 23.5 x 10.0 cm wrinkled brown skin
ellipse with a central, 1.1 x 1.1 x 0.7 cm nipple is present along the
anterior aspect. A palpable nodular mass corresponds to the lower
inner quadrant and the anteroinferior surface is inked orange. The
intact deep margin is inked blue and the specimen is sectioned. The
after mentioned palpable mass is well—circumscribed glistening
tan-white and rubbery, measuring 4.3 cm (medial to lateral) by 3.8 cm
(anterior to posterior) by 3.1 cm (superior to inferior). The tumor
extends to within 0.4 cm of the inked deep margin and 1 cm of the
anteroinferior inked surface. Several cylindrical firm tan-white
structures are associated with the lesion. A portion of the lesion and
a portion of normal parenchyma are submitted for tissue procurement as
requested. The remaining soft, lobulated tan gold adipose tissue with
a scant amount of interspersed delicate tan—white fibrous tissue. No
additional mass lesion or abnormality is identified grossly. RS 12
Summary: 1 through 3 — tumor to inked deep margin, 4 and 5 — tumor to
inked anteroinferior margin, 6 - tumor to normal parenchyma, 7 — random
upper outer quadrant, 8 — upper inner quadrant, 9 - lower inner
quadrant, 10 — lower outer quadrant, 11 - junction of the 4 quadrants,
12 - nipple
