SPECIMEN
A. Sigmoid colon
B. Liver lesion

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Sigmoid colon cancer.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS

B. Subcapsular nodule c/w colonic adenocarcinoma—

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. Received fresh in a container labeled "sigmoid colon"

is a 24 cm long segment of colon, which is received open at
one end, which is inked black black, and which is stapled at the
opposite end, which is inked blue. It is 5 cm in circumference at
the open end of the specimen, and 9 cm in circumference at the
stapled end of the specimen. The serosal surface is generally
tan—pink and glistening, with an area with tattoo pigmented 11 cm
from the open end of the specimen. There is a palpable mass within
the bowel in this area, although there is not gross tumor
penetration to the serosal surface. The specimen is opened,
revealing a near circumferential 7.5 x 6.5 x 1.5 cm mass lesion,
coming to within 4.5 cm of the open end of the specimen. On cut
suface, there is invasion of tumor through the full thickness of the
bowel wall and into the surrounding adipose tissue, but the tumor is
not near the radial margin. The mucosa away from this area is area
is tan—pink and glistening, with multiple polyps, ranging from 0.3
cm to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. There is no other worrisome
lesion in the bowel. The adipose tissue is dissected, and multiple
soft tan—pink lymph nodes are identified. RS-l6, according to the
accompanying block summary, following fixation.

BLOCK SUMMARY: Al — proximal and distal resection margins; A2—A6 —
polyps; A7 — radial margin; A8—A10 — tumor; All—A15 — lymph nodes,
h multiple lymph nodes per block; Al6 - one sectioned lymph node.

B. Received fresh in a container labeled "segment for

liver lesion" is a wedge-shaped portion of tissue, with a
generally tan glistening capsular surface, but with an area of
tan-white discoloration on the capsular surface, and with the
non-capsular surface of the biopsy irregulary roughened and
cauterized. The specimen spans an area 2 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm. On cut
surface there is a nodular area approximately 0.6 cm in greatest
extent in the subcapsular region, corresponding to the discoloraton
noted on the capsular surface. Two sections are submitted for
frozen section, with the apparent lesion in block BFSl, and the
remainder of the specimen is submitted for permanent sections one
additional block.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
The following template summarizes the findings in this case:

Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma of the colon

Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated

Primary tumor (pT): Adenocarcinoma invades through the full

thickness of the bowel wall into surrounding adipose tissue (pT3)

Proximal margin: Negative

Distal margin: Negative

Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative

Distance of tumor from closest margin: See gross description

Vascular invasion: Not definitively identified

Regional lymph nodes (pN): pN0. Twenty-two lymph nodes are

identified, and they are negative for malignancy.

Distant metastasis (pM): le. There is metastatic colonic

adenocarcinoma in part B.

Other findings: There are multiple hyperplastic polyps and an

adenomatous polyp in the colon away from the mass lesion. The liver
outside the metastasis is notable for steatosis with mild chronic
inflammation and a slight increase in fibrous tissue, though this
is difficult to assess given the supcapsular nature of the biopsy
and being adjacent to the metastasis. There no significant
stainable iron. Please note that in part B, in addition to
examining H&E stained sections, PAS, PAS-diastase, trichrome,
reticulin, and iron-stained sections are examined.

DIAGNOSIS
A. Colon, sigmoid, excision
- Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, invading through
the full thickness of the bowel wall and into surrounding
adipose tissue (see microscopic description).
— Margins negative for malignancy.
— Twenty—two lymph nodes negative for malignancy.
- Hyperplastic polyps and adenomatous polyp.

B. Liver, biopsy
- Metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma (see microscopic
description).
