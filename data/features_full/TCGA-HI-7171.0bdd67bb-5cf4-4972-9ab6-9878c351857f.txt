Source of Specimen(s):

1: Left pelvic Lymph Node

2: Right pelvic Lymph Node

3: Prostate and Seminal Vessicles

Gross Description:
Received in three parts.
Source of tissue: 1. Labeled #1, "left pelvic lymph nodes"

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled ", left

pelvic lymph nodes" consists of a 6 x 3 x 1.5 cm aggregate of yellow
lobulated, hemorrhagic fat. Multiple lymph nodes are dissected out of the
fat ranging from 2 x 2 x 0.4 em up to 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm. The lymph nodes
are entirely submitted in cassettes lA-lC for microscopic evaluation.

Source of tissue: 2. Labeled #2, "right pelvic lymph nodes”

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled ",

right pelvic lymph nodes" consists of a 4 x 3 x 1 cm aggregate of yellow
lobulated, hemorrhagic fat. Two lymph nodes are dissected out of the fat
measuring 1 x l x 0.3 cm and 2.5 x l x 0.4 cm. The lymph nodes are
entirely submitted in cassettes 2A for microscopic evaluation.

Source of tissue: 3. Labeled #3, ”prostate and seminal vesicles"

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled ",

prostate and seminal vesicles" consists of a 58 gram, 5 x 4.5 x 4 cm
red-brown, hemorrhagic prostate with intact capsule, patent urethra and
bilateral seminal vesicles and vas deferens. The right seminal vesicle
measures 2 x l x 0.7 cm, the right vas deferens measures 4 x 0.5 cm, the
left seminal vesicle measures 4 x 2 x 1 cm, and the left vas deferens
measures 5 x 0.5 cm. The right side is inked yellow and the left side is
inked black and the specimen is sectioned revealing tan—pink, rubbery to
firm cut surfaces with multiple brown, small to medium calculi.
Sectioning of the seminal vesicles and vas deferens reveals tan-red cut
surfaces and fluid—filled spaces. Representative sections are submitted
as designated for microscopic evaluation.

Designation of Sections: 3A right apex. 333 left apex. 3C right base.

3D left base. 3E—3F right anterior mid. 3G—3H right posterior

superior. 31—3J left anterior mid. 3K—3L left posterior superior. 3M

right seminal vesicle and vas deferens. 3N left seminal vesicle and vasdeferens.
Please note the specimens are placed in formalin at

Final Diagnosis:

1. Left pelvic lymph nodes:

— No tumor seen in five lymph nodes (0/5).

 

2. Right pelvic lymph nodes:
- N0 tumor seen in two lymph nodes (0/2).

3. Prostate and seminal vesicles, radical prostatectomy:

~ Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason's score 9 (5+4).

— Tumor involves both lobes.

— Tumor involves the apex on the right side, extending into the
surrounding muscles and nerves, but the inked margin is negative.
- Angiolymphatic invasion is not identified.

— Perineural invasion is identified.

— Extracapsular extension is identified.

— Tumor involves right posterior inked margin.

- Left and right seminal vesicles positive for tumor.

— Tumor involves 80% of tissue examined.
