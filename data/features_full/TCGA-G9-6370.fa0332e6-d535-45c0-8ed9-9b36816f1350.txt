GROSS DESCRIPTEON:
A. PROSTATE TISSUE
Received fresh labeled with the patient‘s identiﬁcation and "prostate" is a 60-9 resected prostate gland
measuring 5.1 cm from right lateral to left lateral, 4.3 cm from anterior to posterior, and 3.2 cm from
apex to base. Capsule is smooth, red, and intact. ink code: Anterior-orange, apex-red, base—blue,
right lateral-green, left lateral—yellow, posterior-black. After removal of apex and base, the prostate
weighs 38 g; it consists of a nodular tan parenohyma. The right seminal vesicle is 4.2 x 2 x 0,7 cm and
the left is 4.4 x 2.5 x 0.? cm; they consist of cystic tan tissue. The right vas deferens is 3.6 x 0.6 cm and
the left is detached and is 3.1 x 0.5 cm; they consist of tubular tan tissue. Tissue is procured (20 9).
