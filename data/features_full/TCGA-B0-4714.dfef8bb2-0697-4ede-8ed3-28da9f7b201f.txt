FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

PART 1' . RENAL VEIN MARGIN, BIOPSY _
PORTION OF VEIN, NO TUMOR SEEN.

 

PARTZ: KIDNEY, RIGHT, RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY—
A. RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR CELL) TYPE, 5. 0 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION, FUHRMAN
NUCLEAR GRADE IIIIIV.
CARCINOMA INVADES THE RENAL VEIN.
CARCINOMA FOCALLY INVOLVES RENAL SINUS FAT.
ALL SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR.
NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY SHOWS FOCAL GLOBAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS IN A BACKGROUND OF
MODERATELY SEVERE HYPERTENSIVE VASCULAR DISEASE.
ADRENAL GLAND WITH METASTATIC (NON-CONTIGUOUS) RENAL CELL CARCINOMA.

TNM STAGE: pT3b Nx M1 (see part 3 and comment).

9m neon

PART 3: LYMPH NODE, “HYALINE” (PRESUMABLY, HILAR), EXCISION —
A. NODULAR DEPOSIT OF RENAL CELL CARCINOMA.
B. RESIDUAL LYMPHOID TISSUE ISJNOT IDENTIFIED (See comment).

COMMENT.
Part 3 is composed of a nodule of renal cell carcinoma with surrounding ﬁbromuscular and adipose tissue There are no

lymphocytes and no suggestion of lymph node architecture. Lymph node involvement cannot therefore be confirmed
histologically and this nodule is favored to represent either a soft tissue deposit or an intravasoular nodule of tumor. The
deposit In the adrenal gland is separate form the main tumor mass and is therefore considered a metastatic‘deposit. The

pathologic stage is therefore rendered as pT3b Nx M1.
