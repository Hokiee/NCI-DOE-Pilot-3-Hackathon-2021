Gross Description:
Two appropriately labeled containers are received.

 

Container A is additionally labeled "right hepatic trisegment". The specimen was delivered to the gross
room by tissue procurement and subsequently placed in formalin. The specimen weighs 1280 gm, and
measures 19.5 x 17 x 12.5 cm. The surgical margin is inked green and demonstrates a rough irregular
surface. The liver capsule is red/brown, somewhat rubbery in architecture. A 6.7 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm somewhat
elliptical defect is present in the capsule of the liver from which a portion of the tumor has been removed.
Serial sectioning reveals 12 x 1 1 x 10 cm well circumscribed white soft friable tumor. Throughout the
tumor there are scattered areas of black char-like pigment and areas of questionable necrosis.

There are two foci of questionable extracapsular extension of the tumor. These areas are 1.0 cm in greatest
diameter and 0.5 cm in greatest diameter. Grossly the tumor appears to be less than 0.1 cm from the
surgical green inked margin and focally may extend to the margin. The remainder of the liver is tan/brown
with a somewhat micronodular pattern. Representative sections are submitted per block summary.

A1-A2 — representative sections of tumor with adjacent surgical green inked margin
A3-A5 - representative sections of tumor

A6 - tumor at site of extracapsular extension

A7-A10 - representative sections of tumor

A11 - normal appearing liver

Container B is additionally labeled "gallbladder".

Previously opened: Yes, there is one small foci in the distal portion of the gallbladder that is 0.3 cm in
greatest diameter.

Measurements: 9.2 x 3.1 x 1.4 cm

External surface: Yellow/green/tan one surface of which is smooth and glistening and the opposite surface
is somewhat ﬁbrotic which probably represents the hepatic attachment. There also are numerous fungating
yellow/tan nodules from the external surface at the distal portion of the gallbladder these nodules are 1.3 x

 

1.0 x 0.8 cm. These nodules are also located at the proximal portion of the gallbladder and range in size
from 0.5 x 0.5 to 0.7 x 0.7 cm.

Wall thickness: 0.2 cm

Mucosa: green velvety with cholesterolosis

Stones present: not identiﬁed

Other cements: none

Block B 1: Cystic duct margin and representative section of lymph node located at the cystic duct as well as
nodules at the proximal portion of the gallbladder.

B2: Representative sections of the body of the gallbladder and distal portion of gallbladder at site of
nodules.

 

Light Microscopy:
Light microscopic examination is performed.

Signature:
I have personally conducted the evaluation of the above specimens and have rendered the above
diagnosis(es).
