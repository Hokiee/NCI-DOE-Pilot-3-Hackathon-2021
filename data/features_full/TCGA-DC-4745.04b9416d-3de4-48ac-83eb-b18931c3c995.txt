1).The specimen is received ﬁresh and is labeled "sigmoid and upper rectum.
stitch marks proximal". It consists of a rectoeigmnid colon that measure
16.6 x 5.0 x 0.6 cm. The aerosol surface is tan’pink. Smooth and grossiy
unremarkable. The radial resection margin and scroaa are inked bleak.
Specimen is opened to reveal a tumor that is located 10.0 cm from the
proximal margin and 3.0cm item the distal margin. The tumor measures 3.0 cm
in length and 3.0 cm in width. Serial sectioning reveals tumor is 0.6 cm in
depth and is 3.00m from the closest radial margin. There is no muscular
invasion grossly. The remaining mucosa is tandpink and grossly unremarkable.
Perioolio and Dori-rectal adipose tissue is thoroughly examined tor lymph
nodes. and all possible nodes are submitted. Representative sections are
submitted. TPS is submitted.

Summary oE sections:

PM — proximal margin

DM - distal margin

RM - radial margin

T - tumor

0 - uninvolved mucosa

LN - lymph nodes .

2).The specimen is received in EOImalin. labeled "proximal anaatomotic
ring“ and consists of a silver metal ansstomotic pin measuring 7.5 x 2.8 X
1.5 Cm. At the Canter of the pin. a 1.50m long blue plastic piece is noted.
A ring of pink tan ooﬁt tissue is attached measuring i.8cm in diameter and
1.2cm in length. The muoosal ouriace is pink tan and focally hemorrhagic
and the serosal ourﬁace is pink tan and Smooth. Several sutures and atapIes
are noted. The sutures and staples are removed and the representative
section of soEt tissue is submitted.

Summary of sections:
U - undeoignated

3),Tho specimen is received in formalin, labeled "distal anestomotic donut"
and consists 0E a ring of pink tan soft tissue measuring 1.?x1.5x1.0 Cm.
Multiple sutures and stapleo are attached. The mucooal sur£BCB is pink tan
and focally hemorrhagic. The sutures and staples are removed and
representative section of soft tissue is submitted.

Summary of sections;

Conclusion:

— Immunohistochemical staining for the tented DNA miamatch repair proteins
is retained in the tumor.

Scme of the immunohistochemistry and ISH tesba were develnped ana their
performance characteristics were determined by the Department of 9athology.
They have not been cleared or approved by the US Eood and Drug
Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is
not neceeeary. These tests are used to: clinical purposes. They should not
be regeraed as investigational or for research This laborator is certified
under the Clinical Laboxatory Improvement F - i I - as

qualified to perform high complexity clinical 1 oratoxy beatlng.
