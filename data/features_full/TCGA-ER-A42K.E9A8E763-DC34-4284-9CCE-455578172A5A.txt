MICROSCOPIC:
The microscopic ﬁndings substantiate the diagnosis.

The following statement applies to all immunohletochemistry. Insitu hybridization (iSH & FISH), molecular anatomic pathology, and
immunoﬂuorescence testing:

The testing was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the as
required by the CLIA '88 regulations. The testing has not been cleared or approved for the speciﬁc use by the U. 8. Food and Drug

Administration, but the FDA has determined such approval is not necessary for clinical use. Tissue ﬁxation ranges from a minimum of
