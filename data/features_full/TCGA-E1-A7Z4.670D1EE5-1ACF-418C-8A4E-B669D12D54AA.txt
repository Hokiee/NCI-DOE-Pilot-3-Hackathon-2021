Brain tumor. WYS mNOQ C 7] ‘7

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Brain tumor (AF1)", received fresh for frozen section. A 2.0 X 2.0 x 1.0
cm aggregate of multiple fragments of soft tan tissue is received.
Representative fragment frozen as AFl and frozen section remnant is submitted

in A1. A representative fragment is retained in formalin. The remainder of
the tissue is submitted in A2.

B. "Brain tumor", received fresh and placed in formalin. A 4.0 x 3.8 x 2.0 cm

aggregate of multiple frag ts of pink/tan tissue is received. Representative
sections are submitted in % The remainder of the tissue is retained in
formalin.

MICROSCOI’IC EXAMINATION:

The specimen is brain tissue which is infiltrated by a glial neoplasm. There
is a prominent microcystic component, and readily found microcalcifications.
In general, the nuclei are round and regular, some of which exhibit
perinuclear haloes. Some cells contain a small quantity of eosinophilic
cytoplasm typical of mini gemistocytes. Focally, there are areas of increased
cellularity, in which the nuclei are more elongated and contain hyperchromatic
nuclei. Although there is no unequivocal vascular proliferation, in some areas
the blood vessels are thickened and appear to have prominent endothelium.
Necrosis is not identified, and mitotic figures are not definitively
encountered. Although some of this neoplasm exhibits features suggestive of an
oligodendroglioma, the hypercellular areas with hyperchromatic and elongated
nuclei are more suggestive of astrocytic differentiation.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL FINDINGS:
The KI-67 (proliferation antigen) labeling index focally approaches 5%.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. "BRAIN TUMOR":

WELL DIFFERENTIATED ASTROCYTOMA (WHO GRADE II). SEE COMMENT.

B. "BRAIN TUMOR":

WELL DIFFERENTIATED ASTROCYTOMA {WHO GRADE II). SEE COMMENT.

COMMENT: Although the majority of this neoplasm has features of a low grade
tumor, the foci of increased cellularity and mild elevation of the MIB—l
labeling index may portend more aggressive behavior.

Close clinical follow—up
is recommended.

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).
