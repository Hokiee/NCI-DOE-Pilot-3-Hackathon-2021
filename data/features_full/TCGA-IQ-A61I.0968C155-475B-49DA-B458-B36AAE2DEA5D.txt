F. LEFT RADICAL TONSILLECTOMY:

INVASIVE, POORLY DIFFERENTIATED, NON—KERRTINIZING SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA, 1.8 cm
in greatest dimension.

Margins are free of carcinoma.
No perineural invasion seen.
Lymphovascular invasion is identified.

See Tumor Summary
By immunohistochemistry, tumor cells are positive for keratin (strong
cytoplasmic), CKS/G, p63, and negative for HLA—DR. They are positive for diffuse
cytoplasmic and focal nuclear staining for p16] HPV testing by in situ
hybridization is underway.

G. LEFT NECK DISSECTION:

METASTATIC CARCINOMA to two of thirty-two lymph nodes (2/32).

Largest metastatic focus measures 4.5 cm and may represent metastatic carcinoma
to a conglomerate of matted lymph nodes.

Although metastatic carcinoma focally approaches lymph node capsule, no
definitive extranodal extension is identified.

Salivary gland with chronic sialodenitis.

H. LEVEL 28 LYMPH NODE:
METASTATIC CARCINOMA to one of five lymph nodes (1/5).
No extranodal extension seen.

CIJREtCAJaIIISdKDRY—
PRE—OP DX: Not provided
PROCEDURE: Left radical tonsillectomy and pharyngectomy
RELEVANT CLINICAL HX: The patient has history of left tonsil cancer.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh and labeled "Deep muscle margin inferior" is an irregular—shaped
red-tan soft tissue fragment, 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.2 cm. Submitted in toto in one cassette
for frozen section.

8. Received fresh and labeled "Left superior soft palate margin" is a red—tan soft tissue
fragment, 1.4 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm. Submitted in toto in one cassette for frozen section.

C. Received fresh and labeled "Retromolar mucosa margin" is a pink—tan soft tissue
fragment, 1.7 x 0.8 x 0.2 cm. Submitted in toto in one cassette for frozen section.

D. Received fresh and labeled ”Deep tongue margin" is a pink—tan soft tissue fragment,
1.8 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm. Submitted in toto in one cassette for frozen section.

E. Received fresh and labeled "Uvula" is a pink—tan soft tissue fragment, 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3
cm. Submitted in toto in one cassette for frozen section.

F. Received in formalin and labeled "Left radical tonsillectomy and left pharyngectomy"
is an irregular—shaped, pinketan soft tissue fragment with overlying mucosa, 4.5 x 3.8
x 1.5 cm. The specimen was oriented at the frozen section room, as follows: superior
surgical resection margin inked yellow, inferior surgical resection margin inked blue,
medial surgical resection margin inked red, lateral surgical resection margin inked
green and deep surgical resection margin inked black. The specimen is serially
sectioned and reveals an ill—circumscribed, white firm tumor arising from the tonsil,
which invades into the adjacent soft tissue, 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm. The tumor is 0.2 cm
within the deep surgical resection margin (nearest), 0.3 cm from the superior surgical
resection margin, 0.6 cm from the inferior surgical resection margin, 1.0 cm from the
medial surgical resection margin and 0.4 cm from the lateral surgical resection
margin. The specimen is submitted as follows:

Cassette #1: Perpendicular superior margin

Cassette #2: Perpendicular inferior margin ‘

Cassette #3: Perpendicular medial margin

Cassette #4a5: Composite section of the tumor in relation with lateral, deep
and inferior margin (cassette #4: lateral margin)

Cassette #6&7: Additional section of tumor in relation with deep surgical

margin

Note: There was a 0.4 cm portion of tumor sent fresh to Tissue Bank.

Received in formalin and labeled "Left neck dissection, level IB, IIA, III and IV" is
an unoriented irregular~shaped, yellow—tan fibroadipose tissue fragment, 15.0 x 8.0 x
3.5 cm. In the same container, there are four irregular—shaped, yellow-tan
fibroadipose tissue fragments, 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm in aggregate. A salivary gland is
identified, 4.5 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm. Attached to the salivary gland, there is a red—tan
lymph node, 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. There is an ovoid—shaped, white~tan solid
mass, 4.5 x 4.0 x 3.0 cm. The mass is located 3.0 cm distal to the salivary gland.
Thirty two lymph nodes are dissected, ranging from 0.2 cm to 2.0 cm in greatest
dimension. Sections made through the salivary gland reveal an unremarkable
yellow—gray, lobulated salivary gland parenchyma. The specimen is submitted in twenty
seven cassettes, as Eollows:

Cassette #1-3: Representative sections from the largest mass (level IIA, as
per surgeon)

Caseette #4: Lymph node adjacent to salivary gland, bisected and in toto

Cassette #5&6: One lymph node bisected

Cassette #768: one lymph node bisected

Cassette #9—22: One lymph node bisected per cassette

Cassette #23—25: Five lymph nodes in toto per cassette

Cassette #26&27: Representative sections from salivary gland

Received in formalin and labeled "Level IIB lymph node" is an irregular—shaped,
yellow—tan fibroadipose tissue fragment, 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm. Examination of the
specimen reveals six lymph nodes, ranging from 0.2 cm to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension.
Lymph nodes are submitted in toto as follows:

Cassette #1: One lymph node bisected
Cassette #2: Three possible lymph nodes in toto
Cassette #3&4: One lymph node bisected per cassette

Received in formalin and labeled "Level VB lymph nodes" are multiple and
irregular—shaped, yellow—tan fibroadipose tissue fragments, 3.5 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm. Four
lymph nodes are dissected, ranging from 0.2 cm to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. Lymph
nodes are submitted in toto as follows:

Cassette R1&2: one lymph node bisected, per cassette
Cassette #3: Two lymph nodes in toto
