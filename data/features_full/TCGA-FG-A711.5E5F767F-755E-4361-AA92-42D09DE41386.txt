A. Left frontal lobe, excision:
— Glial neoplasm, low grade. See comment.

Comment: The histolegical prefile and Kiv67 labelling index are consistent
with a low grade (WHO grade II) glial neoplasm. Though in many areas the

cells assume an eligedendroglial profile, in other areas more pleomorphic
elements with astrecytic appearance are present. More sections as well as

assaye for lp/lgq deletions are pending and an addendum will be issued
subsequently.

The immunohistochemical and/or in situ hybridization tests reported here,
except for those addressing HER~2Neu overexpreeeion, have been developed

RESULTS
Ratio of 0.67 Cell count of lp/lq: 118
Ratio of 0.48 Cell count of 19q/19p: 120
Interpretation of Results: A) 1p loss; B) l9q loss

Interpretation of findings:

A) (positive) The majority of tumors cells displayed 2 control
chromosome lq25 signals and l chromosome lp36 signals (locus of

interest). The ratio of lp36/lq25 is <O.8. The results are consistent
with the loss of lp36 locus of interest. B) (positive) The majority

of tumors cells displayed 2 control chromosome 19p13 signals and l
chromosome l9ql3 signals (locus of interest). The ratio of

19ql3/19p13 is <0.8. The results are consistent with the loss of lp36
locus of interest.

Comments

The resultant FISH section/slide is scanned by a trained licensed
medical technologist and analyzed using a FDA—approved, validated
semi-automated scanning imaging workstation and accompanying imaging

 

analysis software . The resultant FISH section/slide is then
presented to the interpreting Pathologist, who will reviews the FISH

results from and compares them to the results manually observed
under Fluorescence Microscope. Therefore the ratio is enumerated
by computer—aided counting as well as manual counting.

Interpretation of Test

The ratio for probe set 1 is derived by dividing the total number of

1p36 signals by the total number of lq25 signals in at least 20
interphase nuclei with

nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic glial cells. Cells with no
signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. The ratio for
probe set 2 is derived by dividing the total number of 19g13 signals by
the total number of 19pl3 signals in at least 2 sets of 20 interphase
nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic glial cells at two
different areas of the sample. Cells with no signals or with signals of
only one color are disregarded. References ranges for our laboratory for
allelic loss versus no allelic loss were established by evaluating both
probe sets in a series of 40 normal cases from 10 different organs. For
both probe set 1 and 2 a ratio of less than 0.80 taken from at least 2 sets
of 20 interphase nuclei at 2 different areas with nonoverlapping nuclei is
consistent with allelic loss.

Limitations
ANALYTE SPECIFIC REAGENT: The use of one or more reagents in the above
tests is regulated as an analyte specific reagent (ASR). These tests were

A: Left frontal lobe, excision.
— Oligodendroglioma (WHO grade II).

In—situ assays detect loss of both 1p and 19g loci.

The KI~67 stain was performed by manual immunohistochemistry method.

*****INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:*****

AF}. Left frontal tumor: (FROZEN SECTION PERFORMED)
— Infiltrating glial neoplasm.

Examining pathologist:—-—

*****MICROSCOPIC:*****

Sections show an infiltrating mild to moderately cellular neoplasm composed
of glial elements having round to ovoid nuclei and scant cytoplasm. In
areas, nuclear pleomorphism with more elongated form is identified.
Focally, clusters of minigemistocytes are present. Mitotic figures are
occasional. Immunostain for GFAP is positive in occasional cells and a
Ki—S? stain shows a proliferation index in the range of lm2%.

*****SPECIMEN(S) RECEIVED:*****

Neuropathology Brain, Reg

*****GROSS BESCRIPTION:*****

The specimen is received in one properly labeled container of which is
originally received in frozen section, with the patient' a name and
accession number.

A. The specimen is designated “left frontal tumor" and consists of
a 7.9 x 6.0 x 3.1 cm portion of tanegray brain tissue. Upon serially
sectioning a 5.8 x 5.7 x 3.4 cm tanmwhite homogeneous mass is identified.

A representative section is su ted for frozen section and is resubmitted
as received in cassette AFl.
