1) SOFT TISSUE MASS, SCAPULA, RIGHT POSTERIOR; RESECTION:

- PLEOMORPHIC SARCOMA, HIGH GRADE. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICALLY, THE TUMOR
CELLS ARE POSITIVE FOR DESMIN AND COMMON MUSCLE ACTIN (HHP- 35), AND NEGATIVE
FOR 5— 100 PROTEIN AND CD34. THE STAINING PATTERN INDICATES SMOOTH MUSCLE
DIFFERENTIATION AND IS CONSISTENT WITH LEIOMYOSARCOMA.

- THE TUMOR SIZE IS 17. 2 CM. APPROXIMATELY 30% OF THE TUMOR IS
NECROTIC.

- THE TUMOR IS FOCALLY COATED BY A FIBROUS CAPSULE. HOWEVER, FOCALLY,
THE TUMOR HAS AN INFILTRATIVE BORDER, WITH INFILTRATION INTO SURROUNDING
SOFT TISSUE AND SKELETAL MUSCLE.
