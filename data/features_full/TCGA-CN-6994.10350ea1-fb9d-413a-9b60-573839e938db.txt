B Patholo ist:

My s1gnature 1s attestation that I have personally reviewed the submitted
material(s) and the final diagnosis reﬂects that evaluation.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in six parts.

Part 1 is received ﬁxed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XX and
"medial margin". It consists of a tan connective tissue and mucosa measuring
1.5 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm. After frozen section analysis, the specimen is submitted
in cassette lAFS.

Part 2 is received ﬁxed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XX and
"posterior retromolar". It consists of a tan connective tissue and mucosa
measuring 2.0 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm. After frozen section analysis, the specimen is
submitted in cassette 2AFS.

Part 3 is received ﬁxed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XX and
"buccal (lateral)". It consist of tan connective tissue covered with mucosa
measuring 2.7 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm. After frozen section analysis, the specimen is
submitted in cassette 3AFS.

Part 4 is received ﬁxed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XX and

"left segmental mandibulectomy". It consists of a left mandibulectomy
measuring 9.3 x 5.3 x 4.0 cm including a molar tooth. Grossly, there is a 1.4

x 1.0 cm ulcerated tumor involving the alveolar bone/ramus of the mandible.
The tumor is serially cross sectioned revealing tan-white ﬁrm lesion invading
the underlying bone with a thickness of 2.8 cm. The tumor extends to the
lateral soft tissue edge; carcinoma is at least 0.7 cm from all other margins.
Digital image hoto aphs were taken. Normal tissue and tissue from tumor are
submitted forﬁﬂead and Neck Tissue Bank.

Ink Code: Blac ateral soft tissue; Red banked area.

Cassette Code:

4A lateral soft tissue edge, shave

4B-4C representative sections of tumor

4D representative sections of lateral soft tissue

4EDR anterior bone margin, shave

4FDR superior/ramus margin, shave

4GDR-4HDR representative of tumor relative to bone.

Part 5 is received ﬁxed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XX and

"left level 1". It consists of a tan-yellow lobular ﬁbroadipose tissue
measuring 13.0 x 4.5 x 2.4 cm with attached submandibular gland (4.5 x 3.5 x
2.0). Multiple possible lymph nodes are identified ranging in its greatest
dimension from 0.1 to 1.3 cm.

Cassette Code:

5A-5B four possible lymph nodes in each

5C three possible lymph nodes

5D possible lymph nodes

5E representative of submandibular gland.

Part 6 is received ﬁxed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XX and

"left neck, levels 2—4". It consists of a tan-yellow elongated lobular
ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 15.0 x 7.5 x 1.5 cm. The specimen is divided
into parts A, B and C. Multiple possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging
in greatest dimension from 0.1 to 3.5 cm in part A. Multiple possible lymph
nodes are identified ranging in greatest dimension from 0.1 to 1.5 cm in part
B. Multiple possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging in greatest dimension
from 0.1 to 0.7 cm in part C.

Cassette Code:

6A-6B one lymph node, serially cross sectioned, part A

6C - two possible lymph nodes, part A

6D seven possible lymph nodes, part A

6E-6F multiple possible lymph nodes, part A

6G one possible lymph node, part B

6H possible lymph nodes, part B

61 one lymph node, part C

6] possible 1 m h node, art C.

SCOPIC:

Microscopic examination substantiates the above diagnosis.

 

The following statement applies to all immunohistochemistry, Insitu
Hybridization Assays (ISH & FISH), Molecular Anatomic Pathology, and
Immunoﬂuorescent Testing:
The testin was develo ed and its performance characteristics determined by
the Department of Pathology, as required by the CLIA
I regu ations. T e testmg has not been cleared or approved for the
speciﬁc use by the US. Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA has
determined such approval is not necessary for clinical use. Tissue fixation
ranges from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 84 hours.
This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments of ("CLIA") as qualified to perform high-complexity clinical
testing. Pursuant to 6 requirements of CLIA, ASR's used in this laboratory
have been established and verified for accuracy and precision. Additional
information about this type of test is available upon request.
