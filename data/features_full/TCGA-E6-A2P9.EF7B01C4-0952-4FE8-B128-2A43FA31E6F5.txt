GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. UTERUS, TUBES AND OVARIES
Received fresh labeled with the patient’s identiﬁcation and "uterus. tubes and ovaries" is a 1179, TAH
with 380 specimen. The specimen is 9cm from fundus to ectocervix. 6.4cm from cornu to cornu and
4.8cm from anterior to posterior. The serosal surface is tan-pink, smooth and intact. The attached cervix
is 3cm in length and 2.8cm in diameter. The ectocervix is tan-white smooth, glistening and remarkable
for a slit-like os 0.5cm. The anterior surface is inked blue, the posterior surface is inked black. The
specimen is bivalved into anterior and posterior halved to reveal a patent endocervical canal 1.30m. The
endometrial cavity is remarkable for a 4.7 x 3.5 x 3cm tan-pink exophytic friable mass located
predominately in the anterior fundus of the specimen. The mass does not grossly appear to involve
cervix. The uninvolved endometrium is up to 0.2cm. The tan-pink trabeculated myometrium is 1.7cm.
The mass grossly appears to have a maximum depth of invasion of 0.5cm. A portion of the specimen is
submitted in FSA. The right cerebriforrn ovary is 1.7 x 1 x 0.70m, is bivalved to reveal unremarkable
parenchyma. The attached ﬁmbriated fallopian tube is 2.1 x 0.4cm. is serially sectioned to reveal a
patent lumen. The left cerebriforrn ovary is 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.80m, is bivalved to reveal unremarkable
parenchyma. The attached ﬁmbriated fallopian tube is 1.8 x 0.3cm, is serially sectioned to reveal a
patent lumen. Representatively submitted:
FSA: endomyometrium
A2: anterior cervix
A3: posterior cervix
A4-A17: anterior endomyometrium
A18-A22: posterior endomyometrium
A23: right ovary and fallopian tube
A24: left ovary and fallopian tube
B. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES
Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "left pelvic lymph node" are
multiple fragments of ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 8.8 x 5.3 x 1.4 cm in aggregate. 3 fatty lymph
nodes are identiﬁed ranging from 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm up to 8.5 x 2.1 x 0.8 cm. Cassettes are submitted
as follows:
81: One bisected lymph node
BZ—B4: One lymph node
B5—BQ: One lymph node
C. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES
Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "right pelvic lymph nodes"
are multiple fragments of adipose tissue measuring 7.5 x 5.5 x 1.2 cm in aggregate. Multiple possible
lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging from 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.3 up to 3.5 x 2 x 0.6 cm. Cassettes are submitted
as follows:
C1: One bisected lymph node

TSS -

02-03: One lymph node
C4-C5: One lymph node
06-08: One lymph node
D. PERIAORTIC LYMPH NODES

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "periaortic lymph nodes" are
2 fragments of adipose tissue measuring 1.6 x 0.9 x 0.3 cm in aggregate. Entirely submitted, D1.
