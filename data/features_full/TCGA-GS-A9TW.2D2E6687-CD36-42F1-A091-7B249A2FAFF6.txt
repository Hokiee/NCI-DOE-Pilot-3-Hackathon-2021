AXILLAR LYMPH NODE :

We receive three tissue fragments of pinky color, the biggest of 2,7x2x0,8
cm, and the smallest of 1,5x1x1 cm.

AXILLAR LYMPH NODE, EXCISION:
- PRIMARY MEDIASTINAL DIFFUSE LARGE B CELL LYMPHOMA

The architecture of the lymph node shows a large cell lymphoma with a
diffuse growth pattern, with cells of an anaplastic morphology and sclerosis.
The immunophenotypic study shows that the neoplastic cells are positive for
CD20, CD79a, BOBl, OCTZ, BCLZ and BCL6 with moderate and
hetereogeneous expression of CD30, and are negative for CD10, CD3, CD5
and CD15. In situ hybridization for the RNA of the Epstein- Barr virus
(EBER) is negative. The Ki-67 proliferative index is 90%.
