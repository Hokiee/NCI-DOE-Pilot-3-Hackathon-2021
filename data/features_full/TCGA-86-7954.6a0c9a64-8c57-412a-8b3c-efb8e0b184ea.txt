Gross Description

 

 

 

Labeled right lower lobe (bronchial margin).
Received fresh for

intraoperative consultation is a 162 g lower lobe of
lung measuring 14.5 x

11.5 x 3.5 cm. The pleural surface is tan to gray-
brown and lightly

wrinkled with 3 subpleural nodular structures ranging
from 0.4 to 0.6 cm

along the base. Along the posterolateral aspect near
the base is a 2.7 x

1.0 cm firm tan subpleural mass that comes to
within approximately 5 cm of

the bronchial margin, which is shaved and submitted
for frozen section. The

overlying pleura is puckering and is focally inked
blue. Sectioning through

the separate subpleural nodules reveals glistening
gray-tan cut surfaces.

The background lung is tan to red and spongy white
to white-tan hilar lymph

node measuring 0.5 and 0.6 cm.

 

 

 

 

Microscopic Description

 

The bronchial margin is negative for carcinoma. In the section from the
bronchial margin, a small lymph node is identified which is negative for
metastatic carcinoma. Also, there are two additional hilar lymph nodes
which are both negative for metastatic carcinoma. The lung mass is an
invasive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma merging with a peripheral
bronchioloalveolar type pattern. The invasive carcinoma focally involves

the visceral pleura surface. In this area, free floating tumor cells are

seen in blood clot external to the visceral pleura surface. The vascular
margins are negative for neoplasm. No angiolymphatic space involvement by
tumor is seen. The separate subpleural nodules are consistent with small
foci of metaplastic epithelial proliferations (honeycombing). These nodules
are composed of epithelial cells that have a mucinous as well as
nonmucinous appearance and many demonstrate cilia. There is a focus of
squamous metaplasia associated with one of these areas. There is no nuclear
atypia. Nonneoplastic lung shows emphysematous features.
lmmunohistochemical stains are performed for CK7, CK20, TTF-1, CDX 2 and
Napsin A. Control material for each individual stain demonstrates
appropriate staining. The malignant cells are positive for Napsin A, CK7

and TTF-1. There is focal positivity for CK20. The malignant cells are
negative for CDX 2. These findings support the interpretation of a primary
lung adenocarcinoma.
