==== MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: =e============

A/APC. One slide is examined. Seen are sections of one benign lymph node.
There is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma.

B/BPC. One slide is examined. Seen are sections of two benign lymph nodes.
There is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma

C/CPC Two slides are examined Seen are sections of a lymph node. A focus
of metastatic carcinoma is seen in slide C/CPC— l

D. One slide is examined. Seen are sections Of six lymph nodes. Metastatic
carcinoma is seen in two nodes.

E/EPC. Fourteen slides. including two EPC slides, are examined. Seen are
sections of lung demonstrating an infiltrating mucinous carcinoma. Abundant
extravasated mucin is present. Carcinoma extends to the visceral pleura. but‘
does not penetrate through it. Small vessel (lymphatic space) invasion is
present. Large vessel (venous) invasion is not evident. Also seen within the
non-neoplastic lung tissue are multifocal nodular areas of inflammation and
fibroblastic proliferation centered around bronchioles. These foci are
associated with prominent bronchiolar destruction. The bronchioles and

vascular rese ion margins are negative for tumor.

ADDENDUM #: The actual slides examined at the time of frozen section
are reviewe . ides A/APC. B/BPC and C/CPC, which represent smears of lymph
nodes examined at the time of frozen section, show no evidence of metastatic
tumor. Slides E/EPC show mucinous carcinoma of the lung with negative
bronchial resection margin.

==== “ﬁll! !TAINS:

A panel of immunostains including CK7 CKZO and TTF 1 were performed on
paraffin block E3. The neoplastic cells show positive staining for CK? and
TTF-1. CKZO stain is negative. This staining profile is compatible with
primary lung carcinoma. -

ides are reviewed and found to stain appropriately.
