T—lymphocytes, albeit plentiful, consistent with a <:Ea1;:) Siléka/CLES
brisk, reactive accompaniment, an impression
further supported by an excess of the CD8 over the
CD4 subset, the latter upon subtraction double
immunolabelling for CD163(+) histiocytes. The
overall cell proliferation fraction is 20—30% on
Ki~67 immunolabelling. Immunostaining for cyclin
01 is negative within the lymphoid population,
highlighting only physiological expression in
scattered histiocytic and activated endothelial
nuclei, ruling out mantle cell lymphoma and its
variants. CD138—positivity is restricted to mature
mature plasma cells with a kappa:lambda ratio
ranging between 3:2 to 2:1 on mRNA in situ
hybridisation (ISH), also consistent with a
reactive accompaniment, and negating plasmablastic
lymphoma in conjunction with negativity for both
CD30 (which is seen only as physiological
coexpression in a minor subset of plasma cells) as
well as for KEV-Encoded RNA (EBER) on ISH.
CDZl—immunorcactive follicular dendritic meshworks
are not identified, and CDlO positivity appears to
reflect only physiological expression in scattered
stromal cells and is negative in the lymphoid
population, while CDZO(+) large B~cells
demonstrably coexpress MUM.l on double
immunolabelling, consistent with an ”activated"
state congruous with that of diffuse large B~ce11
lymphoma iDLBCL).
