GROSS DESCRIPTION:

1. OMENTUM WITH TUMOR: Received fresh and labelled "omentum with
tumor" is an irregular shaped piece of red-tan, ﬁrm, nodular

tissue measuring 27.0xl 7.0x3.Scm. Multiple sections Show areas

of soft, mucoid material admixed with tan, ﬁrm tissue

inﬁltrating yellow adipose tissue. Touch preps are taken.

2. UTERUS, TUBES & OVARIES, BILATERAL OVARIAN TUMORS, UPPER HALF
OF VAGINA, PARAMETRIUM, CUL DE SAC WITH TUMOR: The specimen
consists of the uterus with bilaterally attached adnexae,

vagina,parametria and peritoneal tissue. The uterus measures

7.0x4.5x3.3cm; right and left ovarian tumors measure 7.5x6.0x3.5

cm and 6.0x5.0x3.0cm respectively; right and left tubes measure

6.0x0.4cm and 5.0x 0.40m respectively; upper vaginal cuff

width; and three fragments from the cul de sac measure

2.5Xl.5x0.8 cm in aggregate.

RT=representatives of right fallopian tube
LT=representatives of left fallopian tube
TROl~TR05=representatives of right ovarian tumor with cyst
material
TLO l -TLOS=representatives of left ovarian tumor
PM=representative of parametrium
TC=representative of tumor in cul de sac
