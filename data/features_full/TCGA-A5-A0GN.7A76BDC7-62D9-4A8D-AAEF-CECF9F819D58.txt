COMMENT: Although the tumor is of low architectural and moderate nuclear grade, there is
extensive myometrial invasion and at least focal angiolymphatic invasion; consequently, it may
behave in a rather aggressive fashion.

HISTORY: Endometrial cancer

A. PERITONEAL BIOPSY

Labeled with the patient's name, labeled "peritoneal biopsy", and received in formalin are two portions of soft tan-
pink tissue measuring 1.8 cm and 0.7 cm in maximum dimension, respectively and aggregating to 1.7 x 0.7 x 0.3
cm. Entirely submitted.

of soft tan-pink and yellow ﬁbroadipose tissue. There are multiple adhesions and hemorrhages on the surface. The

omentum appears grossly free of tumor. Sectioning reveals no masses or lesions identified. Representative sections
are submitted.

Labeled with the patient‘s name, labeled "left adnexa", and received in formalin is a salpingo-oophorectomy
specimen. The left ovary is 1.9 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm and has a tan-yellow smooth surface with minimal areas of
hemorrhage. Cut surfaces of the ovary reveal a yellow-tan cortical stroma. The fallopian tube is received attached
to the ovary and in one piece with one ﬁmbriated end. The fallopian tube measures 5.1 cm in length and ranges
from 0.6 to 1.2 cm in diameter. The serosa is tan-pink. There is one 0.2 cm strip on the serosa) surface of the mid
portion of the tube. Sectioning reveals a stellate, patent lumen up to 0.3 cm. Representative sections are submitted.
D1. Left ovary -1

D2. Fallopian tube — 4

E. UTERUS, CERVIX

Labeled with the patient's name, labeled "uterus, cervix", and received fresh in the Operating Room for
intraoperative consultation and subsequently ﬁxed in formalin is a 120 gram total hysterectomy specimen. The
uterus is symmetric. The uterus measures 8.6 cm from fundus to ectocervix, 5.4 cm from cornu to cornu and a
maximum of 4.5 cm from the anterior surface to the posterior cervix. The uterine serosa is tan-red and smooth with
minimal ﬁbrous adhesions and ﬁbroadipose tissue. The cervix is about 3.5 cm long and a maximum of 2.3 cm in
diameter in the ectocervical region. Attached to the cervix there is a short 0.9 cm cuff of grossly unremarkable
vaginal mucosa. The mucosa lining the ectocervix is tan-pink and unremarkable. The external cervix 05 is 0.6 cm
in diameter and slit-like. The uterus is incised from both sides. The anterior cervix is inked blue and the posterior
cervix is inked black. The cervical transformation zone is indistinct. The endocervical canal is 2.8 cm long and
lined by tan slightly rugose mucosa. Cut sections of the cervix reveal no gross evidence of tumor or other gross
pathologic lesions. The endometrial cavity is 6.7 cm long and up to 4.2 cm in width. Within the uterus there is a .
large friable tan-white, partially necrotic and hemorrhagic polypoid lesion projecting from the posterior uterine
corpus measuring approximately 5.2 x 4.4 x 4.0 cm. Sectioning reveals this lesion to partially invade the superﬁcial
half of the myometrium. Also located in the area underlying the tumor is an intramural leiomyoma measuring 1.2 x
0.6 x 0.6 cm. Cut surface of the leiomyoma is tan-white with a whorled surface with focal calciﬁcation and no
evidence of hemorrhage or necrosis. Also identiﬁed on the endometrial surface of the uterine corpus is an area of
friable, papillary projections covering approximately 40% of the endometrial cavity, but conﬁned to the uterine
cavity. There is no evidence of extension to the cervix. Sectioning of the papillary lesions reveal them to be
conﬁned to the superﬁcial half of the myometrium. The uninvolved uterine wall has a thickness of 2.0 cm, however
in the area of the tumor, the thickness of the uterine wall including tumor is up to 4.0 cm. The myometrium is tan-
pink and slightly trabeculated. A second intramural leiomyoma is identiﬁed in the anterior uterine corpus
measuring 1.6 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm. Cut sectioning of this leiomyoma reveals a tan-white, whorled surface with no
evidence of hemorrhage, necrosis or calciﬁcation. No other lesions are grossly identiﬁed. Representative sections
are submitted.
