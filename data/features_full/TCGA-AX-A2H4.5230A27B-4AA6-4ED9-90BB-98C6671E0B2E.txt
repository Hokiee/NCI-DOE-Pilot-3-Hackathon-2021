PATHOLOGY r: ' ' ‘

Part F received fresh labeledl , t, and "uterus, tubes, and ovaries” consists of a uterus with attached cervix and
left and right fallopian tube.

Theutemameasures 8 cmsuperiortoinferior, 7 cmlaterally, and2. S emanteriortoposteriorandweiglu 160
grams. The leﬁ anterior serosa has a 3 x 2. 5 x 0. 3 cm irregular tan~yellow irregular ulcerated mass attached to the leﬁ round
ligament and a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm nodule 0.8 cm inferior to mass.

The uterus is inked as follows: anterior - green, posterior - yellow, and the cervix is amputated and the uterus is
bisected into anterior and posterior halves revealing an irregular papillary mass primarily within the anterior endometrial
cavity measuring 2 x 2 cm. Alter inking. the cut sections oithe mass on the serosal surface are tan-yellow. Cut sections of
the srnallertannodule are well circumscribed and tan-white The myometrium measmea 1.3 eminmaximal thickness and the
tumor is seen to invade to a thickness of 1. 3 cm in the anterior endomyometrimn. The myometriurn in the posterior portion

The cervical margin is irregular, disrupmd and ﬁiable with multiple papillary areas. This area ureasures 5. 5 x

SUMMARY OF SECTIONS: F1 and F2 .-. tumor with anterior endomyomen-ium; F3 and F4- tumor with posterior
endomyometrium; F5 through F7. irregular area on serosal surface; F8- nodule on serosal surface; F9- right ovary and
fallopian tube; FlO- left ovary and fallopian tube; Fll- right side ot'cervix; F12- lea side of cervnt The cervix is entirely
submitted as follows. F13 and F14 ~ 1:00; PM and F16 - 2:00; F17 - 3:00; F18 - 4:00; F19 - 5:00; F20 - 6:00; F21 and F22

MICROSCOPIC: A poorly diﬂ'erentiated papillary serous adenocarcinoma of the endometrium is seen infiltrating
throughout the myometrium and out onto the serosal surface Tlrere' is extemive vascular invasion. The neoplasm is also
seen to involve cervix including endocervical glands and cervical stromal Invasion. The let! ovary and fallopian tube are
also inﬁltrated by tumor as well as the leﬁ and right sides of the cervix The tumor shows extensive necrosis, poorly formed
glands and extensive single cell infiltration. Lymphovascular space involvement is seen throughout the sections.
