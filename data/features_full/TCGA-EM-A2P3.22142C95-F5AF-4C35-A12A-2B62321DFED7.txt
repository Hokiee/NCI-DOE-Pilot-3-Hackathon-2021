Gross Description

The specimen labeled with the patient‘s name and as "right hemithyroid lobe-stitch marks
superior pole" consists of a right hemithyroidectomy specimen that is oriented with a suture and
weighs 6.6 g (fresh). The lobe measures 4.1 cm SI x 2.0 cm ML x 1.3 cm AP and the isthmus
measures 1.9 SI x 0.2 cm ML x 0.3 cm AP. The external surfaces have fibrous adhesions. No
parathyroid glands and/or lymph nodes are identified grossly. The external surface is painted with
Silver nitrate. The right superior lobe contains a well delineated nodule that measures 1.4 cm Sl
x1.0 cm ML x 0.9 cm AP. A smaller nodule measuring 0.6 cm Sl x 0.2 cm in ML x 0.2 cm AP is
also identified. The remainder of the thyroid tissue is grossly unremarkable. Sections of nodule
and normal tissue are stored frozen. The remainder of the specimen is submitted as follows:
1A- | lobe, superior to inferior

1J isthmus
