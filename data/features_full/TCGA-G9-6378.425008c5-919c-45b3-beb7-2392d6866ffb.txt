A. PROSTATE

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. PROSTATE
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "prostate" is a 44—9 resected prostate gland
measuring 4 cm from left lateral to right lateral. 4 cm from anterior to posterior, 8 cm from apex to base.
Capsule is red. smooth, and intact. Ink code: Anterior—orange. apex—red, base-blue, right lateral-green.
left lateral—yellow, posterior-black. After removal of at apex and base, the prostate weighs 25 g and has
a nodular pink-tan parenchyma. The right seminal vesicle is 4.2 x 1.9 x 0.4cm, the left is 5.8 x 2 x 0.6
cm; they consist of cystic tan tissue. The right vas deferens is 1 x 0.4 cm and the left is 1.7 x 0.4 cm;
they consist of a tubular tan tissue. Tissue is procured (13 9). Submitted entirely:
