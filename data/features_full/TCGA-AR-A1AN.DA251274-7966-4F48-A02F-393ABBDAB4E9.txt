Breas(right,’wide local excision: lnﬁltrating ductal carcinoma; Nottingham grade ll (of III)
[tubules 3/3, nuclei 3/3, mitoses 1/3; Nottingham score 7/9], forming a mass (2.2 x 1.6 x 1.6 cm)
[AJCC pTZ]. Ductal carcinoma in situ is absent. Angiolymphatic invasion is absent. The non-
neoplastic breast parenchyma shows nonproliferative ﬁbrocystic changes. Biopsy site changes
are present. All surgical resection margins, aﬂer a separately submitted re-excision of the inferior

margin, are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 0.5 cm, deep/superior margin).

Lymph nodes, right axillary sentinel, excision: Multiple (5) right axillary sentinel lymph nodes
are negative for metastatic carcinoma [AJCC pNO (i-) (311)]. Blue dye is identified in all ﬁve right
