Three specimens received.

in subcutis measuring 100 x 100 x 90mm. 0n serial sectioning the surface of tumour is pale grey with cystic
and solid areas and areas of haemorrhage. Tumour is 1mm away from closest surgical margin.

l A-l E. Representative section of tumour showing relationship with surgical margin.
1F. Representative section of skin.

2. "RIGHT AXILLARY CONTENTS". Specimen consists of a piece of ﬁbrofatty tissue, measuring 150mm
x 130 x 30mm. There is a stitch present atone side, which is labelled as stitch at apex of axillary according
to the request form. Specimen sequentially bisected starting from stitch side. 15 lymph nodes were
identiﬁed.

2A. Contains lymph node at the site of stitch. Further lymph nodes are embedded serially from
proximal to distal.

28. Four lymph nodes.

2C. One lymph node.

2D. One lymph node.

2E. Two lymph nodes.

2F. One lymph node.

ZG. Three lymph nodes.

2H. One lymph node.

2.1. One lymph node. Lymph nodes in Block 2D & 2] are bisected.

 

3. "FROM BEHIND CHORACOBRACHIALIS". Specimen consists ofa piece of ﬁbrofatty tissue,
containing a lymph node, measuring 20mm across. All embedded in Block 3A.

L HISTOPATHOLOVQ‘Y REPORT

MICROSCOPIC REPORT

1. "AXILLARY LUMP (RIGHT)". Sections show an expansible mass composed of pleomorphic
malignant cells with prominent nucleoli and central necrosis. lmmunohistochemistry for 8100, HMB45 and
Melan A is positive consistent with metastatic malignant melanoma. A thin rim of lymphoid cells is
apparent at the edge in some sections, consistent with origin from a lymph node. No unequivocal extranodal
spread is seen in the sections examined.

The tumour is less than 0.2mm from the inked resection margin.

The overlying skin lesion sampled (1F) is a seborrhoecic keratosis.

 

2. "RIGHT AXILLARY CONTENTS". None of 14 lymph nodes show evidence of metastatic melanoma.
Increased numbers of pigmented histiocytes are noted in sinuses and an incidental hemangioma is noted in
one node (2D).

3. "FROM BEHIND CHORACOBRACHIALIS". Sections of lymph node show numerous pigmented sinus

histiocytes. No diagnostic tumour cells are identiﬁed on H&E or immunohistochemistry for S l 00, HMB45
and MelanA.

SUMMARY

1. Right axillary mass
- metastatic melanoma.

/

2. Right axillary contents
— no evidence of malignancy in 14 nodes.

/

3. Lymph node from behind right choracobrachialis
- no evidence of malignancy.
