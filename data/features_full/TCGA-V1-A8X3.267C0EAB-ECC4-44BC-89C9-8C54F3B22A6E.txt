Intraoperative Diagnosis

F51 (A) Anterior urethral margin, biopsy: Smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, fibroadipose tissue and
nerve. No epithelium, no tumor. (Dr.

Clinical History
The patient is 2 -year-old man with history of prostate cancer, Gleason grade 3+3.

Gross Description
The specimen is received fresh and in formalin in four parts, each labeled with the patient's name and
unit number. Parts A and 3 are received fresh, and Parts C and D are received in formalin.

Part A is additionally labeled "anterior urethral margin.“ It consists of two soft, irregular pieces of

red-black tissue measuring 1.4 x 1 x 0.3 cm in aggregate. The specimen is submitted for frozen section
diagnosis #1, and the frozen section remnant is submitted in cassette A1.

Part B is additionally labeled "prostate + seminal vesicles." It consists of a prostate gland with attached
seminal vesicles weighing 36 gm and measuring 3.5 cm anterior-posterior, 5 cm apex-base, and 4 cm
medial-lateral. The left seminal vesicle bundle measures 4 x 0.75 x 0.5 cm : the right measures 3.75 x
0.75 x 0.5 cm. The posterior is inked black, left anterior blue, right anterior green, the apex and base
margins removed and the prostate serially sectioned from apex to base across the urethra Into six serial
slices revealing prominent nodular hyperplasia around the urethra and ﬁrm, pink-tan peripheral zone
throughout. Tissue is removed from the left and right slices 2, 3, and 4 and frozen for research
purposes. The remaining tissue is then entirely submitted as follows:

Apex

Cassette 31: Left.
Cassette 32: Right.

Slice 1

Cassette 33: Left.
Cassette 34: Right.

Slice 2

Cassette 35: Left.
Cassette 36: Right.

Slice 3

Cassette 38: Right.

Slice 4

Cassette 39: Left anterior.
Cassette 310: Left posterior.

Cassette 316: RIgnt.
Seminal vesicles

Cassette 317: Left.
Cassette 318: Right.
Bladder resection margin
Cassette 319: Left.
Cassette 320: Right.

Part C is additionally labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes." It consists of multiple irregular fragments of
soft-to-ﬁrm, yellow—tan to light-brown fibrofatty tissue, measuring 5 x 4 x 1 cm in aggregate. Multiple
lymph node candidates are identiﬁed. The specimen is entirely submitted as follows:

Cassettes C1-C2: One lymph node candidate, quartered.

Cassettes C3-C4: Two small lymph node candidates each, intact.

Cassettes C5-C6: The entire fibrofatty remnant.

Part D is additionally labeled I'right pelvic lymph nodes.” It consists of three segments of soft-to-vﬂrm,
rubbery, yellow-tan ﬁbrofatty tissue, measuring 5.3 x 2 x 1 cm in aggregate. Multiple lymph node
candidates are identified. The specimen is entirely submitted as follows:

Cassettes D1-DZ: One lymph node candidate each, bisected.

Cassettes D3-D5: Two small iymph node candidates each, submitted intact.

Cassette as: The entire fibrofatty remnant.

Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. Final diagnosis made by attending pathologist
following review of all pathology slides.
