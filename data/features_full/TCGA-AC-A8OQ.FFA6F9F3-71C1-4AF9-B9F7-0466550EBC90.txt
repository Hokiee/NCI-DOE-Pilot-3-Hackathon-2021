A.-C ) RIGHT BREAST AND AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH MODES, LiUMPECTOMY WITH
SENTINEL LYMPH NODE BIOPSIES (X2):
- Invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 3.

- Tumor size: 3. 8 cm in diameter.

- Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), high nuclear grade, soIid type, Iivith
comedo necrosis and calcifications.

- DCIS Is present in association with invasive carcinOIIIa, at th periphery of the
main tumor mass, does not extend significantly beyond the a ea of invasion,
and comprises less than 10% bfltumor volume. ~

- Lumpectomy margins are free of tumor. *

- Carcinoma is located 0.3 cm from deep margin, and‘ Is at least 0.5 cm from

all other margins
« Metastatic carcinoma identified' In one of two sentinel lymph nodes (the involved
lymph node' Is sentinel lymph node with count 414). '- I

- The metastatic focus measures 1.2 cm in diameter; no extranpdal extension

is identified.

- Metastatic carcinoma comprises approximately 40% of the involved
lymph node volume.

A. Specimen is labeled right breast lumpectomy. initially received in fresh state for possIble tumor hank
studies is a 74 gram portion of yellow-tan ﬁbroteily soil tissue, 4.5 cm aniorio‘g-posteriorﬁSﬁ cm
superior-interior. 6.5 cm medial-lateral. Three sets or sutures are present designated asgtoiiows: a double
long designated interior. a single long designated medial, a double short designated anterior. The
margins are new differentially inked. The specimen is serially sectioned perpendicularly through the
medial-lateral long axis to reveal a partially well demarcated dense gray-tan tumor mass; measuring
upwards of 3.8 x 2.8 x21 cm. The mass approaches within 0.3 cm or the posterior. 0.6_ pm of the medial.
0.6 cm of the superior. 0.6 cm at the anterior. 1.0 cm of the lateral and 1.2 "oi the integer surgical
margins. The cut surfaces surrounding the tumor mass are iobuiar. admixed allow-tan ‘ ithcut additional
discrete nodularity. Representative sections are submitted in a sequential ta 9 ion, latent lowards medtet.
