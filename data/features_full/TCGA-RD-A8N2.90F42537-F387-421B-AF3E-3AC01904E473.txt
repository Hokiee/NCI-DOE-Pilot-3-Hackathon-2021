Japanese styie partial gastrectomy including entire iesser sac. Antrai cancer.

MACROSCOPY

Specimen labelled stomach. Received is a gastrectomy specimen including the
antrum lesser sac and the portion of greater omentum, 140mm along lesser curvature.
185mm along greater curvature with maximum circumference of mucosal surface
130mm. in the antrum of the specimen is a lesion comprising an ulcerated ﬁrm white
sessile mass 25mm maximum dimension on mucosai surface and macroscopically
seen to extend well into the stomach wail. There is no obvious involvement of
overlying serosa. Surrounding mimosa is of macroscopically normal appearance. On
the cut. surface the lesion has maximum dimension of 50mm. At proximal margin of
stomach, A2 distal stomach margin. A3 lesion at distal edge. A4, A5 further sections of
tumour, A6 - tumour at proximal edge, A7 mucosa from macroscopically normal looking
body of stomach, A8 mucosa from normal looking proximal body, A9, A10 single
sections of node from greater omentum, At 1, A12 single sections of node from lesser
cmentum, A13 nodes andomentum from proximal pedicle.

DIAGNOSIS

Partial gastrectomy - gastric antral ulcerated diffuse inﬁltrative poorly differentiated
Signet ring ceil carcinoma with inﬁitraticn of the full thicknessof muscularis propria.
Carcinoma is not seen at serosal surfaces of the stomach. There is no demonstrable
lymphovascular or perineural space invasion. Sections from the gastric proximal and i

 

distal surgical resection margins are freed tumour. All 6 of 6 greater omentai lymph
nodes sampled are normal. All 17 of 17 lesser omental lymph nodes sampled are
normal. Tissues sampled from the proximal pedicle consist of adipose connective
tissue only and. are without lymph nodes... / ICC) 013
