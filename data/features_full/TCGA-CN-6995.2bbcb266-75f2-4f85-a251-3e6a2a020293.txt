My Slgnature 1s attestation that I have personally reviewed the submitted
materia1(s) and the final diagnosis reﬂects that evaluation.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in twelve parts.

Part 1 is received ﬁxed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
"level lA". It consists of a tan-yellow fibroadipose specimen measuring 4.3 x
3.2 x 1.2 cm. Multiple possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging in
greatest dimension from 0.3 cm to 1.2 cm and are submitted as follows:

1A one lymph node, bisected

1B possible lymph nodes.

Part 2 is received ﬁxed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
"deep margin". It consists of four fragments of tan-yellow adipose tissue and
tan connective tissue measuring in aggregate 4.0 x 2.7 x 0.8 cm. The specimen
is entirely submitted in cassettes 2A—2C.

Part 3 is received ﬁxed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
"right composite resection". It consists of a right hemimandibulectomy
measuring 110 x 7.5 x 6.0 cm with attached skin measuring 4.5 x 4.0 cm and
submandibular gland measuring 4.5 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. Grossly there is a 6.5 x
5.0 x 4.0 cm tan-white ulcerated tumor involving the soft tissue and
underlying mandible. The lesion is serially cross sectioned revealing an
involvement of the overlying skin. The tumor lies within 0.5 cm from the
posterior skin margin, 10 cm from the inferior skin margin, 1.3 cm from the
anterior skin margin, and 1.2 cm from the superior skin margin.

The submandibular gland is serially cross sectioned revealing tan, homogenous
lobular unremarkable parenchyma. One lymph node is identiﬁed measuring 1.2 x
1.0 x 0.5 cm.

Part 4 is received ﬁxed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
"right ﬂoor of mouth margin". It consists of tan connective tissue covered
with gray-white mucosa. A clip marks anterior margin which is inked black.
After frozen section analysis the specimen is submitted in cassette 4AFS.
Part 5 is received ﬁxed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
"left ﬂoor of mouth margin". It consists of tan connective tissue covered
with gray-white mucosa. A clip marks anterior margin which is inked black.
After frozen section analysis the specimen is submitted in cassettes 5AFS.
Part 6 is received ﬁxed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
"right retromolar trigone margin". It consists of tan connective tissue
covered with gray-white mucosa. A clip marks superior margin which is inked
black. After frozen section analysis the specimen is submitted in cassette
6AFS.

Part 7 is received ﬁxed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
"right buccal margin". It consists of tan connective tissue with no mucosa. A

clip marks anterior margin which is inked black. After frozen section analysis
the specimen is submitted in cassette 7AFS.

Part 8 is received ﬁxed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
"sublabial margin". It consists of tan connective tissue covered with
gray-white mucosa. A clip marks anterior margin which is inked black. After
frozen section analysis the specimen is submitted in cassette 8AFS.

Part 9 is received ﬁxed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
"anterior mandibular marrow". It consists of tan connective tissue fragments.
After frozen section analysis the specimen is submitted in cassette 9AF S.
Part 10 is received fixed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
"posterior mandibular marrow". It consists of a tan connective tissue
fragments. After frozen section analysis the specimen is submitted in
cassettes 10AFS.

Part 11 is received fixed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
"right neck levels 2—4". It consists of a tan-yellow elongated ﬁbroadipose
tissue measuring 17.0 x 6.8 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is divided into three
parts A, B, and C. Multiple possible lymph nodes are identified ranging in
greatest dimension from 0.2 to 2.6 cm in part A. The largest lymph node is
serially cross sectioned revealing possible metastasis. Multiple possible
lymph nodes are identified in greatest dimension from 0.2 to 1.5 cm in part B.
Multiple possible lymph nodes are identified in greatest dimension from 0.1
to 0.7 cm in part C.

Part 12 is received ﬁxed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
"left levels 1, 2, 3, and 4". It consists of tan-yellow, elongated

ﬁbroadipose specimen measuring 15.0 x 7.0 x 2.0 cm. A submandibular gland
measuring 4.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm in identiﬁed. Multiple possible lymph nodes are
identiﬁed ranging in greatest dimension from 1.0 to 1.6 cm in level A.

Multiple possible lymph nodes are identified ranging in greatest dimension

from 0.2 to 1.3 cm in level 3. Multiple possible lymph nodes are identified
