FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS

A. Gallbladder, cholecystectomy:
l. Gallbladder with no significant pathologic abnormalities.
2. No tumor identified.

B. Liver, left lobe, partial hepatectomy:

l. Hepatocellular carcinoma, moderately to poorly
differentiated, present as three discrete foci (4.9, 3.0, and 0.8 cm in
greatest dimension) in resected lobe of liver; see comment.

2. No tumor identified at surgical resection margins.

3. Non—neoplastic hepatic parenchyma showing minimal

macrovesicular steatosis.

COMMENT:

The three hepatic tumors generally resemble hepatocellular carcinoma,
but because of focal poorly differentiated areas (most notable in block
B5 of the 0.8 cm nodule), immunoperoxidase stains for Arqinase-l and
CKl9 were performed on block BS in order to exclude the possibility of a
combined hepatocellular and cholangiolar carcinoma. These stains Show
the tumor cells to be diffusely positive for Arginase-l and entirely
negative for CKl9. A mucicarmine stain performed on block B5 is
negative in the tumor cells. A reticulin stain performed on block BS
confirms lack of normal hepatocellular architecture among the tumor

cells. Together, these findings support the diagnosis of hepatocellular
carcinoma. Dr. has reviewed selected slides from this case,
including the immunoperoxidase stains, and agrees with the diagnosis of
moderately to poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.

Liver Tumor Synoptic Comment:
— Tumor type: Hepatocellular carcinoma (see above discussion).

— Histologic grade: Moderate to poorly differentiated (grade
2-3/3; see above discussion).
- Tumor size (maximum diameter of largest lesion): 4.9 cm.
— Tumor necrosis: None identified.

- Multifocality (more than one tumor separated by nontumorous liver
parenchyma): Present.
~ Estimated total tumor diameter of all HCC foci: 8.7 cm.

- Vascular invasion: Focal lymphatic invasion present (slide Bl);
no blood vessel invasion identified.
- Hepatic capsule: Tumor focally abuts but does not penetrate through
overlying liver capsule.
— Local extension of tumor: Confined to liver.
~ Hepatic surgical margins: Negative for tumor; tumor is 0.7 cm from
nearest margin.

— Non-neoplastic liver: Minimal steatosis, no significant fibrosis
(confirmed by trichrome stain performed on block B7.
— Hepatocellular nodules (in cirrhotic liver): Not applicable (no
cirrhosis present). '
— Lymph node status: Not applicable (no lymph nodes sample by surgical
procedure).
- AJCC Stage: pTZbNX.

.Clinical History

The patient is a -year‘old man. Review of the patient's electronic
medical record . reveals that he has a longstanding history of
Crohn's disease, and was recently found to have multiple liver lesions
on imaging studies, the largest measuring 6 cm. A prior needle core
biopsy demonstrated hepatocellular carcinoma ). The patient
now undergoes left hepatic lobectomy.

Gross Description
The case was received in two parts, each labeled with the patient's name
and medical record number.

Part A is received fresh and additionally labeled "gallbladder," and
consists of an intact gallbladder (7.5 x 3 x 2.5 cm). No calculi are
identified. The lumen contains thick yellowntan bile. The mucosa is
tan and velvety with diffuse pinpoint yellow speckling present. The
wall is flaccid and averages 0.3 cm in thickness. The serosa is
grey-pink and glistening. The hepatic bed is tan-yellow and roughened.
The cystic duct margin (0.3 cm in diameter; inked black) is patent. No
lymph nodes are identified. No tumor is identified. Representative
sections of the cystic duct, body and fundus are submitted in cassette
Al.

Part B is received fresh and additionally labeled "left hepatic lobe."

SPECIMEN TYPE: Partial hepatectomy.

SIZE: 974 gm; 16.5 cm from right to left x 23.2 cm from anterior to
posterior x 5.1 cm from anterior to inferior.

GROSS ABNORMALITIES: Three well—circumscribed, soft, white-tan lesions
are noted within the liver parenchyma. Nodule #1 (4.7 x 4.5 x 4.9 cm)
is noted in segment 48, abutting the overlying capsule and approximately
2 cm from the cauterized resection margin. Module #2 (3 x 2.5 x 1 cm)
is present in segment 4A, 1.7 cm from the overlying capsule and 0.7 cm
from the cauterized resection margin. Nodule #3 (0.8 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm) is
present in segment 3, 0.3 cm from the overlying capsule and
approximately 12 cm from the cauterized resection margin. The
uninvolved liver parenchyma is tan-brown and homogenous.

ORIENTED BY: Anatomic landmarks.

INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: Gross only.

INKING:

- Liver capsule overlying mass: Black.

— Cauterized surgical margin: Blue.

- Area of tissue banking performed by surgeon: Green.

CASSETTES: Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Bl: Nodule #1 with overlying capsule.
B2: Nodule #l with adjacent uninvolved liver parenchyma.
B3: Nodule #2 with closest approach to resection margin.
B4: Module #2 with adjacent uninvolved liver parenchyma
and overlying capsule.
B5: Nodule #3 with adjacent uninvolved liver parenchyma and
overlying capsule.
BE: Uninvolved liver parenchyma, peripheral.
B7: Uninvolved liver parenchyma, central.
BB: Vascular and bile duct resection margins, en face.

They have not been cleared or approved by the
U. 5. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such
clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for
clinical purposes, and were necessary to reach a final diagnosis in this
case. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. Final diagnosis
made by attending pathologist following review of all pathology slides.
The attending pathologist has reviewed all dictations and preliminary
interpretations performed by any resident involved in the case and
performed all necessary edits before signing the final report.
