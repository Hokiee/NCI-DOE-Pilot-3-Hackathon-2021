The specimen is submitted fresh as "right partial nephrectomy" and
consists of a 16 gram, 5 x 3.5 x 3 cm excised partial nephrectomy specimen
received with a 5 x 3.2 cm.surgical resection margin which is inked black.
The capsular surface shows a well circumscribed, firm bulging mass. The
capsule is inked blue. Sectioning reveals a 3.1 x 2.5 x 1.7 cm well
circumscribed orange to yellow focally cystic, focally hemorrhagic mass
which grossly appears to abut the blue inked capsular surface measuring
0.4 cm from the Closest black ink surgical resection margin. The
remainder of the cut surface consists of tan brown glistening smooth
grossly unremarkable parenchyma with a 0.7 cm in thickness cortex and well
defined corticomedullary junction. No other discreet masses or
nodularities are grossly identified. Representative sections are
submitted, 3 (3).

Please note: a portion of the tumor mass is submitted for _
