PROCEDURE: Pneumonectomy

SPECIMEN INTEGRITY: Intact

TUMOR SITE: Upper lobe

TUMOR SIZE: 8.5 cm

TUMOR FOCALITY: Unifocal

HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Squamous cell carcinoma

HISTOLOGIC GRADE: G3

VISCERAL PLEURA INVASION: Present

TUMOR EXTENSION: Not applicable

MARGINS: All margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma

Distance of invasive carcinoma from closest margin:

LYMPH—VASCULAR INVASION: Not identified
PATHOLOGIC STAGING: Primary tumor: pT3
Regional lymph nodes: le
Number of lymph nodes examined: 21

Number of lymph nodes involved: 4

ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: Focally purulent chronic organizing pneumonia

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received fresh and labeled "level 4R” is firm. pale—tan tissue measuring 5 X 5 x 2 mm.
It is entirely submitted for frozen section block A1.

B. Received fresh and labeled "level 2R" are multiple fragments of red—tan, soft tissue
measuring 10 x 10 x 2 mm in aggregate and are entirely submitted for frozen section block
131.

C. Received fresh and labeled “level 5 lymph node" consists of two pieces of blackened,
soft tissue compatible with an anthracotic node‘ They measure together 3 x 1 x 1 cm. Serial
sections demonstrate homogenous. black. soft tissue and pale, yellow adipose tissue. No
focal. suspicious lesion is identified. One air—dried imprint smear is made. A portion of
the node is submitted for frozen section in block C1. The remaining node is submitted for
permanent sections in block C2—C3.

Received are two additional parts.

D. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and “level 5 lymph node" is a 2.7
x 2.0 x 1.3 cm aggregate of anthracotic. nodular gray-black lymph nodes with focal adherent
yellow adipose. The nodes are bisected and individually submitted as labeled with single
nodes inked blue to be submitted with bisected nodes:

D1 ~ one whole lymph node and one bisected lymph node
02 — one whole lymph node and one bisected lymph node
D3 - one bisected lymph node
D4 — one bisected lymph node

GROSS DESCRIPTION. (Continued)

E. Labeled "left lung“ and received fresh for tumor banking is a 741 gram. 21.0 x 14.0 x
6.0 cm lung. This is the left lung with the expected two lobes The pleural surface is
mildly congested and pink—tan with diffuse anthracotic marbling. The upper lobe is
centrally indurated and is sectioned to have an 8.5 x 8.0 x 5.5 cm central cavitated and
necrotic tumor mass. There is focal peripheral calcification. Further sectioning shows
the mass to be 3.7 cm from the bronchial margin. The parenchyma of the superior upper lobe
is mildly congested and spongy. The tumor is in the mid upper lobe. superior to the hilar
structures. The parenchyma surrounding the tumor is somewhat consolidated and tan. The
tumor does not cross to the lower lobe. however appears to abut the lower lobe. The tumor
appears to distort and locally involve the vessels and bronchi of the upper lobe. The
bronchi adjacent to the tumor contain opaque, purulent mucus. There are multiple large
anthracotic hilar lymph nodes surrounding the bronchus and bronchioles. The lymph nodes
appear to be focally positive for tumor. The parenchyma of the lower lobe has similar
spongy, mildly congested appearance. There is mild pale parenchyma with focal
consolidation in the inferior aspect of the lower lobe. This area may represent mild
post—obstructive pneumonia. No additional tumor—like masses are identified.
Representative sections are sampled as labeled:

El — bronchial margin and adjacent lymph node

E2 u vascular margin

E3—ES - sections of tumor to pleura in an area of roughened pleura consistent
with adhesion

E6 - sections showing tumor between upper and lower lobes

E7 - tumor to surrounding bronchials and vessels

E8 — perpendicular section down bronchus showing positive bronchial lymph
node

E9—E11 - sections of upper lobe superior (E9), mid (E10) mid and inferior (Ell)

ElZ—Ei3 - large peribronchial lymph node

E14 - one lymph node

E15 - one lymph node

E16 — one lymph node

E17 — three lymph nodes

E18 - three hilar/peribronchial lymph nodes

E19~E21 — sections of lower lobe superior (E19). mid (320) and inferior (E21)
