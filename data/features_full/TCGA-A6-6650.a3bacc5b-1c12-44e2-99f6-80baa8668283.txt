hemicolectomy and consists of a right hemicolectomy
specimen. The right colon measures 14.5 cm in length and up to 6 cm
in diameter. There is an attached segment of ileum measuring 16 cm
in length and 2.3 cm in diameter. There is a dilated attached
vermiform appendix measuring 6.5 cm in length and up to 1.2 cm in
diameter. There also are small bubble like structures on the
serosal surface of the cecum resembling pneumatosis. There is a
fungating mass that appears to originate in the area of the orifice

Tumor grade: 2
Tumor size: 4.3 cm
Distance to nearest margin: 11 cm
Level of penetration: Carcinoma invades through the
muscularis
propria into pericolonic soft
tissue.
Margins of resection: Negative for malignancy
Vascular invasion: No definite vascular invasion seen
Host response: Moderate acute and chronic inflammation
Attached lymph nodes: There is no evidence of malignancy
in
any of 19 lymph nodes.
Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: Absent
pTNM Stage: T3 NO
Other findings: Benign serosal mesothlelial cysts.
Fibrous obliteration of the distal appendiceal lumen.
