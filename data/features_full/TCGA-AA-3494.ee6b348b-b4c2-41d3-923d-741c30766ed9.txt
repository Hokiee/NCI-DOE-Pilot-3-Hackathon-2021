Diagnosis / Diagnoses:

22-cm-long resection of the colon under inclusion of a moderately differentiated,
centrally ulcerated adenocarcinoma, of a maximum of 3.5 cm in diameter and of the
colorectal type, with a recent onset of infiltration of the pericolic fatty tissue (pT3; G2),
as well as a further poorly differentiated, centrally ulcerated colorectal adenocarcinoma,
of a maximum of 1 cm in diameter and with infiltration of the tunica submucosa (pTl;
G3). Low-grade, also focal high-grade dysplasia (synonym: high-grade intra-epithelial
neoplasia) in the remainder. Tumor-free resection margins of the colon.

A follow-up report will be made on the lymph node status.

 

Follow-up report:
A total of 39 histologically carcinoma-free lymph nodes of a maximum of 0.8 cm in
diameter were determined after acetone fixation.

Final tumor stage: pT3 (2) pNX (0/39) pMX; G2-3
