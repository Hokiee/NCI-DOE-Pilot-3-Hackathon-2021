SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

 

Gross Descrigtion:

1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled "urethral margin" and consists of tissue measuring 1.3 x
1.0 x 0.3 cm. Entirely submitted for frozen section.

Summary of sections:
FSC1-1 -— frozen section contro|1

2) The specimen is received fresh, labeled, “Right distal pelvic lymph nodes", and consists of a piece of tan-yellow fatty tissue

measuring 7.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm. Sectioning reveals multiple tan-yellow fatty lymph nodes ranging from 0.4 to 2.2 cm in greatest
dimension. The specimen is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:

BLN1-6- bisected lymph nodes
MLN - multiple lymph nodes
RT -— remaining tissue

3) The specimen is received fresh, labeled, “Left distal pelvic lymph nodes”, and consists of a piece of tan-yellow fatty tissue

measuring 7.0 x 5.0 x 2.0 cm. Sectioning reveals multiple tan-yellow fatty lymph nodes ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 cm in greatest
dimension. The specimen is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:

BLN1-4- bisected lymph nodes
MLN — multiple lymph nodes
RT - remaining tissue

4) The specimen is received fresh labeled. "Bladder, prostate. seminal vesicles, and peri-vesicle lymph nodes ". It consists of a
bladder with attached bladder and adnexa measuring 16.5 cm from superior to inferior, 12.3 cm laterally and 4.3 cm from anterior
to posterior. The anterior aspect of the bladder is inked black and the posterior blue. The prostatic urethral margin is shaved and
submitted. The bladder is opened along the anterior midline to reveal a pink—tan papillary mass measuring 4.7 x 3.4 x 2.0 cm
predominately on the left posterior wall. The lesion lies 0.5 cm from the left ureteral oriﬁce and 1.5 from the right. Adjacent to the
papillary mass is a 1.6 x 1.6 cm pink-tan scar lesion. which measures 0.1 cm from the left ureteral oriﬁce, and 3.5 cm from the
right. There is a 0.4 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm papillary area adjacent to the right ureteral oriﬁce which measures 2.0 cm from the tumor. Both
ureters are probe patent, measuring up to 0.2 cm in maximum diameter. Sectioning of the scar lesion reveals a tan cut which does
not extend to the inked fat. The mass is sectioned to reveal a white- tan slightly Irregular cut surface. Extension to the inked fat Is
grossly not identiﬁed. The remaining bladder mucosa is tan-pink with the normal folds. A perivesical lymph nods is identiﬁed. The
prostate is serially sectioned to reveal white-tan prostatic parenchyma. Representative sections are submitted including sections
from each prostatic quadrant and transition zone. TPS is submitted. Gross photograph is taken.

Summary of sections:

UM - urethral margin

RUM - right ureter margin

LUM - left ureter margin

M--mass

SL—scar lesion (entirely submitted)

RUO - right ureter oriﬁce (with papillary area)
LUO - left ureter oriﬁce (with scar lesion)
LPW - left posterior wall

LAW - left anterior wall

RPW - right posterior wall

RAW — right anterior wall

TRI - trigone

DOM - dome

F - perivesical fat

5) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled “Left distal ureter, unclipped end in the margin" and consists of a tan-white tubular
tissue fragment measuring 3.3 cm in length and 1.2 cm in diameter, with attached adipose tissue measuring 1.1 cm in thickness.
There is a clip at one end of the specimen. On cut section, the mucosa appears is tan—pink and unremarkable. The specimen is
sequentially sectioned from the clipped and to the non-clipped end and submitted entirely.

Summary of sections:

CE - clipped end

NCE - non-clipped end

SS - sequential sections from clipped to non—clipped end

6) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Right distal ureter. unclipped ended margin" and consists of a tan-white tubular
tissue fragment measuring 5.0 cm in length and 1.0 cm in diameter, with attached adipose tissue measuring 1.3 cm in thickness.
There is a clip at one end of the specimen. On cut section, the mucosa appears tan-pink and unremarkable. The specimen is
sequentially sectioned from the clipped and to the non-clipped end and submitted entirely.
