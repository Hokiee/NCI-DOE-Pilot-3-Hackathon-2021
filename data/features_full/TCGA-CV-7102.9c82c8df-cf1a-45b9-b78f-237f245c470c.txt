(C) BILATERAL NECK DISSECTION, RIGHT AND LEFT MANDIBULECTOMY, SUBTOTAL
GLOSSECTOMY — Specimen overaii dimension is 13.0 x 10.0 x 7.0 cm and inciudes
the ri ht rims of the mandibie (9.0 x 3.0 x 0.9 cm), the ieft rim of the
mandib e (4.0 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm), most of the right mediai haif of the tongue
(8.0 x 5.0 x 2.7 cm), a ieft right neck dissection (9.0 x 5.0 x 2.0 cm), and a
ieft neck dissection (8.0 x 6.0 x 1.5 cm).

A tumor (4.7 x 2.7 cm) is present in the right aspect of the fioor of the
mouth. This tumor is uicerated and mostiy fiiied by necrotic materiai; it
penetrates 0.7 cm into the underiKing soft tissue. This tumor is 0.8 cm from
the posterior mucosa] mar in of t e ioor of the mouth, 0.8 cm from the ieft
anterior mucosai margin 0 the fioor of the mouth, and 1.9 cm from the ieft
