2. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "radical resection 0! right
retroperitoneal sarcoma, right colectomy, right nephrectomy, right
adrenalectomy'. and consists of a 39.5 x 24.5 x 13.0 cm soft tissue mass
which consists o! a 31.0 x 21.0 x 13.0 on firm yellow-white lobulated tumor
which is continuous with a 24.5 x 22.5 x 6.2 cm lobulated sott yellow tumor.
