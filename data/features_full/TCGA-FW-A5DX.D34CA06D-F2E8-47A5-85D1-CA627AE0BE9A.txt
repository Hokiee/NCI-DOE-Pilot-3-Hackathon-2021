Gross Description: i

(A) (left anterior chest wall melanoma) Received in formalin
is an oriented elliptical excision of redgray smooth skin that

is 9.6 x 5.3 cm up to 2.5 cm deep. There is a suture placed at
one pointed and designated lateral hereafter 12:00. There is,
one the central epidermis a retracted gray-white scar that is
1.8 cm long x 0.4 cm wide with brown nodularity upon one end
measuring 0.7 x 0.4 cm, The brown nodularity is within 1.9 cm
of the 2:30 margin. The 12:00-3:00 margin is inked green. the
3:00-6:00 margin blue, the 6:00-9:00 margin orange. the
9:00-12:00 margin red and the deep margin is inked black.
Circumferential on face margins are taken and submitted
sequentially in clockwise fashion beginning at 12:00 in
cassettes At-AQ. The remaining specimen is serially sectioned
perpendicularly to its long axis and the entire soar site is
submitted and surrounding deep tissue to the deep margin with:
10-11 full—thickness step section divided.

A10 - representing the 9:00 hall and

A11 - the 3:00 half

A12-A13 — full-thickness step sections divided

A14—A1 5 - full-thickness step sections divided

A16—A17 — full-thickness step sections divided

A1 8-A19 - full-thickness step sections divided .

(B) (left axillary lymph node contents) Received fresh for
Tumor Bank sampling and subsequently placed in formalin is a 380
gm 13.8 x 12.5 x 7.0 cm portion of tan-yellow lobulated
ﬁbroadipose tissue. Dissection and palpation yield 15 dark

gray to pale tan-pink rubbery lymph nodes ranging in size from
0.3 to 4.5 cm. some focally replaced by fat. one lymph node is
submitted sectioned entirely in Bi and 32. One lymph node is
sectioned, submitted entirely in B3. One lymph node is serially
sectioned and submitted entirely in 84. One lymph node serially
sectioned and submitted entirely in BS. One lymph node serially
sectioned and submitted entirely in 56. Four lymph nodes are
submitted intact in cassette 37. Two lymph nodes are submitted
intact in cassette BB. One lymph node is serially sectioned and
submitted entirely in cassettes 89-311. One lymph node is
serially sectioned submitted entirely in cassettes 312-813. A
representative section of one of the larger lymph nodes is
submitted in cassette B14 and a representative section of the
largest lymph node previously sampled for Tumor Bank is
submitted in cassette Bi 5.

(C) (level three left axillary lymph node) Received in

formalin are two tan-pink rubbery lymph nodes that are 0.7 and
1.5 cm in greatest dimension. The smaller is submitted entirely
intact in Ci. the larger is bisected submitted entirety in

cassette CZ. —

Microscopic Description:

Complete microscopic evaluation has been performed.

 

 

 

 

Appropriately reacting controls have been performed and
evaluated for all stains on this case as required.

Histopathology has a list of IH antibodies that are regulated as
analyte speciﬁc reagents (ASR’s). These assays were developed
and their performance characteristics determined by the

' o athol Laborato in the De rtment of Pathol at The

WWW
have not been cleared by the cod and mg Inlstration.
The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not
necessary for the ASR’s. These tests are not investigaﬁonai

and are used in standard clinical care. in cases where
immunohlstochemistry testing is performed. the following
antibodies and their respective clones may be used to determine
therapy for the patient: EFGR(31G?), ER(SP1), PR(1E2),
Heaneu(4B$), CD117(POlY). cozo(L26).

Unless otherwise stated in the report, all tissue tested for

ERPR by HG. Her2 by ll-lC and/or HER2 by FiSH have been ﬁxed as
per ANP.22998 for a minimum of 6 hours and a maximum of 48
hours

ER, PR, Ki-67, p53 are reported as a semi~quantitatlve
percentage of positively stained nuclei. Her-Zineu and EGFR are

incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of cells is
scored as (1+). less than strong but complete staining in any
proportion of cells or complete strong staining in less than 30%
of cells is scored as (2+), and strong complete staining in more

on tissue ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in
paraffin unless otherwise stated in the report
