GROSS:
The specimen is received fresh in five parts.

Part A consists of an intact uterus and cervix with bilaterally attached
adnexa weighing 470 grams. The uterus measures 13 X 10 X 10 cm. The right
fallopian tube appears previously ligated and measures 2.5 X l X 1 cm. The
attached ovary measures 2 X 1 X 1 cm. On sectioning is has a solid pink
tan parenchyma Wthh 13 not grossly remarkable. The left fallopian tube is
