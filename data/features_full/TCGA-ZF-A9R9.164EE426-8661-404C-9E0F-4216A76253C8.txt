SPECIMEN I mwbovmb W aﬂQMO

1 - Right iliac lymph node. gage/o5

2 - Left ureteric resection margin. 54/& W ”OZ; 7 a

3 - Bladder & prostate.

CLINICAL DETAILS 9, )97 '
Invasive bladder cancer. 92/} (I)
Left ureter ? is there evidence of tumour in distal part (clinically it appears

so) and does this extend to proximal part.

MACROSCOPY

1 - Enlarged node measuring 27 x 20 x 12 mm.

2 - An orientated tubular structure 20 mm in length and up to 6 mm in dia. with
surrounding fatty tissue.

3 - Specimen consists of bladder (measuring 65 x 40 x 40 mm), prostate

(measuring 55 mm medic-lateral x 35 mm supero-inferiorly x 35 mm anterior-
posterior) and perivesical fat. The bladder contains an ulcerated lesion

measuring 25 x 20 mm involving the posterior and left lateral walls. On section

the tumour appears to extend through the wall to reach the perivesical fat and

reach the circumferential surgical resection margin posteriorly. No lymph nodes

are identiﬁed in the perivesical fat.

1 - Right iliac lymph node;

FROZEN SECTION REPORT
1 - Frozen section report; metastatic carcinoma. Verbal report given to
anaesthetics at on the ' - Dr and Dr

PARAFFIN SECTION REPORT

Parafﬁn sections conﬁrm frozen section report of metastatic carcinoma. There
is extension into extracapsular tissue.

2 - Leﬁ ureteric resection margin;

FROZEN SECTION REPORT

2 - Frozen section report; both proximal and distal ureteric resection margins

are normal with no carcinoma in situ. Report to surgeon at
on - Dr

PARAFFIN SECTION REPORT

Parafﬁn sections conﬁrm the frozen section diagnosis of morphologically normal
ureteric tissue.

3 - Bladder and prostate; Sections from the macroscopically identiﬁed lesion
conﬁrm a poorly differentiated transitional cell carcinoma arising from surface
epithelium and extending as tumour aggregates through the bladder wall to reach
the extravesical tissue. There is tumour within 1 mm of the circumferential
surgical resection margin.

There is extensive necrosis within the tumour and perineural and lymphovascular
invasion. There is no lymphocytic inﬁltrate at the tumour host interface.

Tumour is seen extending into the muscle wall of the ductus deferens.
Background urothelium is morphologically normal with no evidence of dysplasia or
carcinoma-in-situ.

Sections taken from the right ureteric resection margin show small tumour foci
within the soft tissue and may represent lymphovascular invasion.

The urethral resection margin of this specimen is morphologically normal with no
evidence of dysplasia or carcinoma-in~situ.

The sections from the right lobe of the prostate show foci of high grade PIN.

Sections from the left lobe are morphologically normal. There is no evidence of
microacinar adenocarcinoma.

Please note the urethral resection margin and left external iliac nodes have
been processed as

SUMMARY

Cystoprostatectomy and lymph node dissection; the appearances are those of a
poorly differentiated (G3) transitional cell carcinoma ‘of the bladder invading
perivesical soﬁ tissue. There is tumour within 1 mm of the circumferential
surgical resection margin. No metastases are noted. G3 TCC pT3b pN2 pr.
