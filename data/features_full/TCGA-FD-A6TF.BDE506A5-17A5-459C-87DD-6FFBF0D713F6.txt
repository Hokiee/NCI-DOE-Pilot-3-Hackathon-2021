Clinical History:
Patient is a year-old female with bladder cancer, undergoing cystectomy, ileo
conduit.

Specimens Received:
A: Peritoneal nodule
B: Right ovary

C: Leﬁ ovary .
D: Bladder and urethra

E: Left pelvic lymph nodes
F: Left pelvic lymph nodes
G: Right pelvic lymph nodes
H: Left distal ureter

1: Right distal ureter

Gross Description:
The specimens are received in nine containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.

A. The ﬁrst container is additionally identiﬁed as, "peritoneal nodule".
Received fresh for intraoperative diagnosis is a 2.74g, 2.3 x 1.7 x 1.3 cm
fragment of white rubbery tissue that is bisected to reveal a multicystic cut
surface consistent with ovary. One half of the specimen is frozen and read as
"ovarian tissue, with benign cys ". The frozen section remnant is submitted in
cassette A1 PS. The remainder of the specimen is entirely submitted in cassette
A2.

B. The second container is additionally identiﬁed as, "right ovary". Received
fresh and placed in formalin is a 4.8 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm tan-brown heavily
cauterized rubbery tissue fragment. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal
fatty ﬁbrous tissue with no gross Ovary identiﬁed. Specimen is entirely
submitted in cassettes B1-B4.

C. The third container is additionally identiﬁed as, "left ovary". Received
fresh and placed in formalin is a 7.56 g, 3.5 x 3 x 1.2 cm ﬁrm white-tan nodule
with adjacent ﬁbrofatty tissue. The specimen is bivalved to reveal a uniform
yellow-tan nodule within a 0.1 cm thick white-tan cyst wall. No gross ovarian
tissue is identiﬁed. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette C1—C4.

D. The fourth container is additionally identiﬁed as, "bladder and urethra".
Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 249.06g, 15 x 13 x 4.2 cm cystectomy
specimen with attached mesenten'c fat and tubing in bladder. The bladder
measures 7 x 6.5 x 3 cm. The urethral stump measures 3 cm in length by 1.1 cm
diameter and is probe patent. The right ureteral stump measures 4 cm in length
by 0.6 cm in diameter which is discontinuous and disrupted by cautery midway
through the length of the ureter. The right ureter probes patent but the oriﬁce

is involved by shaggy indurated mucosa. The left ureteral stump is discontinuous
to suture and cautery at one segment measuring 1 cm in length by 0.6 cm in
diameter. The left ureteral oriﬁce can't be identiﬁed at the trigone.

Additionally the bladder is remarkable for a 6 x 4.5 cm portion of mucosa
attached to the posterior aspect of the urethra to the lower posterior aspect of

the bladder. The urethral margin is inked black.

, The right half of the bladder is inked blue and the left half is inked black.
The bladder is opened along the right lateral aspect through the dome.

The bladder demonstrates an intimated, ulcerated lesion in the lower
anterior-left wall, left lateral wall and posterior wall at trigone. There is an
ill-deﬁned 4.5 x 4 cm indurated area which contains a 3.5 x 3 cm ulceration
surrounded by a hemorrhagic rim of mucosa. Serial sectioning reveals that the
tumor grossly inﬁltrates into the urethra located 2.8 cm from the urethral
margin and 0.8 cm from the mucosal surface. On cut section the tumor is
white—tan ﬁrm, ill-deﬁned extending a maximum depth of 1.8 cm (tumor max
dimensions 4.5 x 4 x 1.8 cm) invading into adipose tissue which abuts the inked
surface (black). The remainder of the mucosa is tan-brown, edematous, and
glistening with a uniform 0.8-1.3 cm wall thickness. Representative sections are
submitted as follows:

Dl: Urethral margin

D2: Left ureteral margin

D3: Right ureteral margin

D4: Tumor relationship to urethra

D5: Anterior wall tumor

D6: Uninvolved anterior wall

D7: Dome

D8: Trigone with tumor (closest approach to inked margin)
D9-D10: Posterior wall with tumor, hemorrhage and extension to ink
D1 1: Right wall uninvolved with tumor -

D12: Left wall with tumor

D13: Uninvolved left wall

Dl4-D15: Additional representative sections of tumor
D16: Additional section of urethra

E. The ﬁfth container is additionally identiﬁed as, "left pelvic lymph

nodes". Received fresh for intraoperative consultation is a ﬁrm tan-pink lymph
node measuring 3.2 x 2.3 x 0.8 cm. One half of the specimen was frozen and read
as "positive for carcinoma" by Dr. [] The frozen section remnant is

submitted in cassette El F8. The remainder of the specimen is submitted in
cassette E2.

F. The sixth container is additionally identiﬁed as, "left pelvic lymph

nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 15.92 g, 6.2 x 4 x 1.2 cm
aggregate of ﬁbrofatty tissue. The specimen is difﬁcult to dissect secondary

to extremely matted lymph nodes. Dissection reveals 5 candidate lymph nodes
ranging from 1.1 x 0.4 x 0.2-5.5 x 2 x 0.8 cm. The specimen is entirely
submitted as follows:

F1-F4: One lymph node candidate

F5-F6: One lymph node candidate

F7: Three lymph node candidates

F8: Remaining fatty tissue

G. The seventh container is additionally identiﬁed as, "right pelvic lymph
nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 19.1 g, 7.8 x 3.6 x 1.2 cm
aggregate of tan-brown lobulated fatty tissue that is heavily matted and
dissected to reveal 8 candidate lymph nodes ranging from 1.4 x 0.6 x 02-5 x 2 x
1.1 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted as follows:

G1: Three lymph node candidates

G2-G3: One lymph node candidate

G4-G5: One lymph node candidate bisected, per cassette

G6-G7: One lymph node candidate

G8-G14: One lymph node

H. The eighth container is additionally identiﬁed as, "left distal ureter".
Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 5.8 cm long by 0.4 cm in diameter
tan-white tubular structure that is oriented with a stitch on the non-margin
side. The non-margin side is inked blue and the margin side is inked black.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

H1: Margin side en face (black)

H2: Non-margin side en face (blue)

H3: Middle sections

1. The ninth container is additionally identiﬁed as, "right distal ureter".
Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 2.3 cm long by 0.4 cm in diameter
tan-brown, tubular structure that is oriented with a stitch on the non-margin
side. The mild non-margin side is inked blue. The margin side is inked black.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

11: Margin side en face (black)

12: Non-margin side en face (blue)

13: Middle sections
