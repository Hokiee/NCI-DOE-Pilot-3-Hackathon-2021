PATHOLOGIC STAGING:

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received fresh for tissue banking and gross evaluation labeled with the patient's name
and designated “right breast lumpectomy” is a 162 gram. 10.5 x 9.5 x 4.5 cm fibrofatty

breast tissue biopsy.

The biopsy has an overlying 8.5

The ellipse is oriented as anterior. There is a short

lateral. The margins will be inked per orientation as

x 2.0 cm black—brown skin ellipse.
suture superior and a long suture
labeled: blue superior. black

inferior, yellow lateral, red medial and green deep or posterior. The biopsy is serially
sectioned from lateral to medial to have a 2.4 x 1.8 x 1:5 cm tumor mass. The mass is
centrally located within the specimen and is 1.3 cm from the nearest superior margin. is
1.5 cm from interior, is at least 2.5 cm from deep as well as superficial and is more than
3 cm from medial or lateral. The tumor has adjacent minor hemorrhage and fat necrosis
consistent with a previous biopsy. A section of tumor is sampled for tissue banking.

There is diffuse dense white fibrous tissue surrounding the tumor mass, The white fibrous
tissue has focal fibrocystic changes. and the white fibrous tissue makes up approximately
50% of the biopsy parenchyma. Representative sections are sampled from across the specimen
to include tumor to the nearest margins as labeled:

 

A1 — nearest perpendicular sections of lateral margin sampled

A2—A3 — sections showing lateral dense white fibrous tissue with fibrocystic
change

A4 - section of tumor with adjacent petechial hemorrhage

A5 — nearest deep margin

A6 ~ nearest superficial skin margin

A7 — tumor to nearest inferior margin

A8«A9 — tumor to nearest superior margin

A10 — tumor with adjacent fat necrosis and petechial biopsy hemorrhage

All ~ near full cross section of tumor
A12 — perpendicular sections of medial

sampled
margin sampled

GROSS DESCRIPTION: (Continued)

8. Labeled ”sentinel lymph node #1” is a nodular. fatty 2.4 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm lymph node.
There is scant yellow adipose on the surface of the node. The node is serially sectioned
perpendicular to the long axis to be entirely submitted per sentinel lymph node protocol in
cassettes 31—84.

C. Labeled ”sentinel lymph node #2“ is a nodular. fatty 2.0 x 1.7 x 1.4 cm lymph node.
The fat is trimmed from the node. and the node is 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm. The node is
sectioned perpendicular to the long axis to be entirely submitted per sentinel lymph node
protocol in cassettes C1—C2.

D. Labeled ”sentinel lymph node #3" is a 3.5 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm aggregate of yellow adipose.
The adipose is sectioned to have three nodular lymph nodes. The nodes are 0.3 cm. 0.7 x
0.5 x 0.2 cm and 0.8 x 0.? X 0.4 cm. The larger nodes are sectioned perpendicular to the
long axis. and the nodes are entirely submitted for sentinel lymph node protocol separately
from smallest to largest in cassettes D1—D3.
