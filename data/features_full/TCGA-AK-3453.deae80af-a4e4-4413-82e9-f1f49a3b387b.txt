SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
Clinical History/Diagnosis: Right Renal Mass

Source of Specimen(s):
1: Right kidney, portion of right ureter (with stent) and para caval nodes

2: right ureteral Stent

Gross Description:
Received in two parts.
Source of Tissue: I. Labeled #1, "right kidney, portion of right ureter

and paracaval nodes”

Frozen Section Diagnosis: lFSF ONCOCYTIC NEOPLASM PER

Gross Description: Received fresh for frozen section evaluation labeled
, light kidney, portion of right ureter and

paracaval nodes" is a 333 gram right nephrectomy having a minimal amount
of attached perinephric fat. There is a 9.5 x 0.3 cm fragment of attached
ureter having a lumen, 0.2 cm containing a stent. The kidney itself is
distorted, 9.0 x 8.5 X 4.5 cm in greatest dimension. It is bisected to
reveal a 8.5 X 6.0 x 5.0 cm mass protruding from the kidney having
yellow—tan to brown to red—puiple focally hemorrhagic cut surfaces.
Representative sections of the mass are submitted for frozen section
evaluation and the frozen section residue is submitted in one block. The
remaining renal parenchyma is tanubrown having a wellndefined
cortico—medullary junction. There are no palpable lymph nodes in the
attached paracaval soft tissue. Representative sections are submitted in

six blocks.

Designation of Sections: lFS~ frozen section renal mass, lA— ureter and
vascular margins, lB—ID— tumor, lE— random kidney section, 1F—

Summary of Sections: multiple

Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled it 2, "right ureteral stent"

Gross Desc1iption: Received fresh in a container iabeled ", right ureteral stent". It

consists of a single lumen segment
of light green stent measuring 54.2 x 0.4 cm. In the same container is a

similar segment of stent measuring 2.9 cm. No blood or tissue present,

 

gross only.

Final Diagnosis:

1. Right kidney, portion of right ureter (with stent), pair-"satiarr mph
nodes, resection: Low grade renal cell carcinoma, 8. 5 cm, sag estive of
oncocytoma with transition to chromophobe tu or." ‘

— Extracapsular extension is not seen.

- Lymphovascular invasion is not seen.

— The vascular and ureteral margins are negative, see note.

2. Right ureteral stent:
— Gross description Only.

Note: The tumor is focally positive for CD10, CK7 and AEl/AEB, and
negative for-colloidal iron, vimentin, CD117, E—cadherin and RCC
antigen. Positive and negative control slides are satisfactory.

Background biotin staining cannot be eliminated. These results support a
diagnosis of oncocytoma, but appearance shows chr‘omophobe features.
