COMMENT

Although the tumor has central sclerosis, this comprises less than 30% of the tumor (so the
tumor does not qualify as the subtype of invasive carcinomas with a “large central acellular zone").

Although tumor approached the anterior margin in the initial segmental mastectomy specimen.
this tissue was re-excised and found to be tree of tumor, so tumor does not approach the final
surgical margins. Tumor is 5 mm from nearest deep margin.

Tumor marker studies were reported previously (see

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) RIGHT SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY - An oriented segmental mastectomy Specimen (5.5 x
5.1 x 3.3 cm). Nine slices are cut from superior to inferior, and a specimen radiograph is obtained.
There is a well-circumcised tan-pink mass (1.8 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm) located less than 0.1 cm
% from the anterior margin and 0.4 cm from the deep margin. On the medial side of the mass there
‘ 7 Is a tibrotic area measuring 2.0 x 2.0 x 3.5 cm. The entire mass and entire tibrotic area is
submitted.
INK CODE: Green - interior; blue - superior; black - deep; yellow - superficial; red -
medial and lateral.
