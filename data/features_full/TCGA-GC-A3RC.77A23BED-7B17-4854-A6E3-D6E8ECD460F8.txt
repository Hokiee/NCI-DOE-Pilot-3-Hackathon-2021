Gross Description

"A. FSA. Left ureter.“ Received is frozen section control tissue. "FSA." all.

"B. NFSB." Received after frozen section is a 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm yellow-tan to gray-tan tissue fragment. A portion of the
specimen has been submitted for frozen section in cassette "FSB." "B." all.

"C, Appendix." Received Is a 4.2 x 0.5 cm appendix with attached periappendiceal fat. The proximal margin will be inked black,
shaved and submitted. No masses or lesions are grossly identiﬁed on the serosa. No masses or lesions are grossly identiﬁed
in the appendix. "C' representative.

"D. Bladder." Received is a bladder with attached prostate gland and bilateral vasa deferentia and seminal vesicles, which has
an overall measurement of 12.6 x 7.2 x 4.7 cm. The prostate gland and bladder have been previously opened on their anterior
aspect. The prostatlc apex will be inked yellow. shaved and submitted. The remainder of the prostate gland will be inked
orange. There is a 5.7 x 4.4 cm firm. friable mass on the mucosa of the anterior aspect of the bladder. The mass grossly
appears to come to within 4.7 cm of the prostatlc apex. The mass invades the wall of the bladder and grossly appears to come
to within 0.3 cm of the overlying perivesicular tissue. which has been previously inked black. The mass involves the mucosa in
the region of both the left and right ureteral oriﬁces but does not grossly appear to involve the lumen of either oriﬁce. The
remaining bladder mucosa ls edematous. No masses or lesions are grossly identiﬁed in the prostate gland.

Free in the container is a smaller container labeled "ﬁxed specimen", which has a 2.1 x 1.5 cm yellow-tan soft tissue fragment
and a 3.5 x 0.3 cm linear tissue fragment. The linear tissue fragment will be bisected and of these tissue fragments will be
submitted In toto. ”D1," apex; "DZ-D4." mass; "05." left ureteral orifice with mass; "D8." right ureteral oriﬁce with mass; "D7.”
trigone; "DB." posterior bladder wall; "D9," dome of bladder; "D10." left vas deferens and seminal vesicle; "D11." right vas

labeled "ﬁxed specimen“. See attached drawing.

"E. Right pelvic lymph nodes." Received is a 6.2 x 3.8 x 2.1 cm aggregate of yellow-tan. tabulated tissue. 0n sectioning. there
are 11 possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 to 4.2 cm in greatest dimension. All lymph nodes will be sampled. "E1-E3."
representative.

"F. Left pelvic lymph nodes." Received is a 7.2 x 4.1 x 1.8 cm aggregate of yellow-tan. Iobulated tissue fragments. On
sectioning. there are 7 possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.8 to 2.7 cm. All lymph nodes will be sampled. "F1-F2."
