MICROSCOPIC: A. Portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white
matter

infiltrated by neoplastic glial proliferation made up of round and

elongated nuclei.

B. Portions of cerebral and subjacent white matter extensively
infiltrated by glial neoplasm with predominantly round, but also
elongated nuclei in a fine fibrillary background.

C. Portions of white matter infiltrated by predominantly naked,
elongated neoplastic nuclei.

D. Portions of a moderate—to-highly cellular glial neoplasm with
prominent nuclear pleomorphism and made up of cells with gemistocytic
features in a prominent fibrillary background. Interspersed between
the gemistocytics, there are numerous anaplastic looking naked nuclei.
Mitotic figures and occasional individual cells necrosis are observed.
There are no areas of necrosis or vascular endothelial proliferation.

E. Portions of glial neoplasm with cellular features similar to those
described for part D. However, in focal areas, there is a fine
capillary network in the background, and focally these cells exhibit
perinuclear halos resembling anaplastic oligodendrocytes. There are
no areas of necrosis and vascular endothelial microcellular
proliferation are not observed. E

SPECIAL STAINS: Immunoperoxidase stain for GFAP and MIB—l antigens
were performed on block #5. The GFAP demonstrates the macro and mini
gemistocytic phenotype of the tumor cells. With the NIB—la labelling
index of about 2% is determined.

COMMENT: The neoplasm is a glioma with features of anaplasia. There
are focal areas of anaplastic gemistocytic astrocytoma; in other
smaller focal areas, the neoplasm has features of anaplastic
oligodendroglioma interspersed with neoplastic astrocytes (hybrid
tumor). Although the MIB—l labelling index is about 2%, the
cellularity, degree of anaplasia, and mitoses justify the grade III/IV
classification.
