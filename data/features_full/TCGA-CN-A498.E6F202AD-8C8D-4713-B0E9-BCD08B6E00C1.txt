GROSS DESCRIPTION:

Specimen is received unfixed in nine parts.

Part 1 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and "right
medial

tongue". It consists of a 1.8 x 1.4 x 0.8 cm tan—gray, focally
cauterized

soft tissue trisected and evaluated intraoperatively. The remainder Of
the

specimen is submitted labeled lAFS.

Part 2 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and "left

glossectomy, stitch is posterior". It consists of an oriented 6.0 x
2.5 x 2.4 '

cm partial glossectomy with a roughened red—brown focally cauterized
soft

tissue margin. Stitch marks posterior.

There is a 4.2 x 1.8 x 2.0 cm in depth firm, gray—white and focally
hemorrhagic ulcerated lesion surrounded by pink—gray nodular mucosa.
The

lesion abuts the medial surgical resection margin and comes to within
0.3 cm

of the lateral resection margin, 0.3 cm of the anterior resection
margin, 1.4

cm of the posterior resection margin and 0.7 cm of the deep surgical
resection

margin. A representative section of the lesion is evaluated
intraoperatively.

Digital image is taken. Representative tumor and normal is procured
for the

head and neck spore tissue bank.

Ink Code:

Red— area of bank tissue

Section code:

2AFS- frozen section, lesion

ZB-C— full thickness sections of lesion

Part 3 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and "left
lateral

pharyngeal wall". It consists of a 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm tan-gray to red
focally

cauterized soft tissue evaluated intraoperatively. The remainder of
the

specimen is labeled BAFS.

Part 4 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and "left
lateral floor

of mouth margin". It consists of a 1.1 x 0.4 x 0.5 cm strip of tan-
gray

focally cauterized soft tissue evaluated intraoperatively. The
remainder of

the specimen is submitted labeled 4AFS.

Part 5 is labeled with the patient‘s name, initials XX and "deep
margin". It

consists of a 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm red— gray, focally cauterized soft
tissue

evaluated intraoperatively. The remainder of the specimen is labeled
SAPS.

Part 6 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and "anterior
margin".

It consists of a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm tan-gray, focally cauterized soft
tissue

evaluated intraoperatively. The remainder of the specimen is submitted
labeled 6AFS.

Part 7 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and "additional
medial

tissue". It consists of an unoriented 3.2 x 3.1 x 1.0 cm roughened
tan-red

hemorrhagic soft tissue bisected and entirely submitted in cassettes
labeled

7A & 7B.

Part 8 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and “final
medial

margin, right". It consists of a 1.9 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm tan—gray, finely
granular, soft tissue evaluated intraoperatively. The remainder of the
specimen is submitted labeled BAFS.

Part 9 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and "left neck
dissection levels II thru IV". It consists of a 12.0 x 2.5 x 0.7 cm
portion

of soft, yellow~red, focally hemorrhagic and lobular fibroadipose
tissue with

minimal muscle. The specimen is arbitrarily divided into three portions
and on

dissection multiple ovoid, soft to moderately firm, tan—pink to red
lymph

nodes ranging 0.1 cm and 2.5 cm are identified.

Section code:

9A“ lymph nodes from 1/3 of specimen at one pole

9B—C— lymph nodes from l/3 Of the specimen, mid aspect

QD—E- lymph nodes from 1/3 Of specimen, Opposing pole (cassette labeled
"9D"

contain one bisected lymph node)

MICROSCOPIC:

Microscopic examination substantiates the above diagnosis.

The following statement applies to all immunohistochemistry, Insitu

Hybridization Assays (ISH & FISH), Molecular Anatomic Pathology, and
Immunofluorescent Testing:
The testing was developed and its performance characteristics
determined by
the Department of Pathology, as required by
the CLIA
'88 regulations. The testing has not been cleared or approved for the
specific use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA has
determined such approval is not necessary for clinical use. Tissue
fixation
ranges from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 84 hours.
This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments of 1988 ("CLIA") as qualified to perform high-complexity
clinical
testing. Pursuant to the requirements Of CLIA, ASR's used in this
laboratory
have been established and verified for accuracy and precision.
