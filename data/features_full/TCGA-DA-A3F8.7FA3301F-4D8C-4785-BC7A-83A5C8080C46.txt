skin ellipse excised to a depth of 0.9 cm. The specimen is oriented with a stitch designating superior.The epidermis
displays a centrally located. 0.9 x 0.7 cm pink, ill—deﬁned area. 0.7 cm in nearest margin. The specimen is inked as follows:
Anterior-blue, posterior-green. The specimen Is seriellv sectioned from superior to interior and sequentially submitted in 12
cassettes with cassettes 2-9 to include the pink area. .

3. Received fresh labeled with the petient's name and 'ievel llB lymph node," is a 7.5 x 6.0 x 1.3 cm aggregate ofiibrofatty
