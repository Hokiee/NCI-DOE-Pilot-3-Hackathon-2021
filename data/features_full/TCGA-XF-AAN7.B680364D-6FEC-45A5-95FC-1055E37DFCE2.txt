COMMENT:

The case was discussed with Dr. on .
Immunohistochemical Stains for Synaptophysin, chromogranin and pancytokeratin on D9
show the neoplastic cell in the bladder are positive for pancytokeratin and
vimentin, and negative for synaptophysin and chromogranin, which support the
diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma with sarcomatoid features. Immunostains for CK

903 and racemase on 19 and D22 support the diagnoses of prostatic adenocarcinoma.

CLINICAL INFORMATION.
Pre- op Dx: Bladder cancer
Post-op Dx: Same as pre—op

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Right distal ureter".
It consists of a segment of soft tubular gray tissue measuring 0.2 cm in length x
0.3 cm in diameter. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in AFS.

B: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Left distal ureter".
It consists of a segment of soft tubular gray tissue measuring 0.2 cm in length x
0.4 cm in diameter. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in BFS.

C: -The specimen is received fresh from the 0.R. and labeled “Apical urethral
margin—f/s". It consists of a piece of soft pink tissue measuring 1.5 x 0.3 x 0.2
cm. The specimen is entirely submitted by for frozen section diagnosis in CFS.

D: The specimen is received fresh from the o.R. and labeled "Bladder, prostate“.
The specimen overall measures 32 x 16.5 x 5.5 cm and is partially covered in a
shiny, fatty, yellow—pink peritoneum measures 26.5 x 15.5 k less than 0.1 cm. The
specimen consists of a bladder (15 x 9 x 5.5 cm) and attached prostate (5 x 4.2 x
3.3 cm). The right attached seminal vesicle measures 3.7 x 1. a x 0.6 cm and the
left attached seminal vesicle measures 3. 3 x 1 5 x 0. 8 cm. The surgical margin of
the entire specimen is inked black, with the right side inked with superimposed
red. The specimen is opened along the anterior urethra revealing a prostatic
urethra measuring 3 cm in length x 3 cm in circumference. The verumontanum
measures 1.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The urethral mucosa is pink-tan, smooth, and does«not
appear to be excavated. The bladder is almost entirely filled by huge, necrotic,
bloody, friable, soft, exophytic mass which measures 14.5 x 8 r 5 cm. The mass
appears to arise from the left lateral wall. Upon sectioning through the mass, the
cut surfaces are coagulative, solid, soft and ranges in color from red to yellowish
in a marbled pattern. Upon sectioning through the mass's relationship to the left
lateral wall, it appears to arise from the solid, firm, light tan mass at the base
and to extend into the bladder wall but not involve the underlying perivesical fat.
The tumor appears to be 1 cm from the inked black margin. Bilateral attached
ureters are opened. The right ureter measures 6 cm in length x 1. 2 cm in
circumference and the left ureter measures 7. 3 cm in length x i 1 cm in
circumference. The ureteral mucosa are both grossly unremarkable The remaining
bladder mucosa is gray, congested, and grossly unremarkable elsewhere, except for
the trigone where there is a firm nodularity. The specimen is taken to the O.R. in
a gross consultation. The urothelium is fixed in BS fixative for an hour and the
specimen is subsequently entirely fixed in formalin. The prostate is serially
sectioned from distal to proximal, revealing smooth, solid, grossly unremarkable,

'perivesical lymph nodes are palpated. Representative sections are submitted in 24
cassettes.

I: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right LN of Cloquet". It
consists of a lymph node measuring 2 x 1.8 x 0.7 cm. Serially sectioned and
entirely submitted in two cassettes.

J: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right external iliac LN"- It

consists of multiple fragments of fatty and lymphoid tissue measuring in aggregate
S x 2.5 x 1 cm. Entirely submitted in three cassettes.

K: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled I'Right obturator hypogastric
LN“. It consists of multiple fragments of fatty and lymphoid tissue measuring in
aggregate 7 x S x 1.5 cm. Entirely submitted in seven cassettes.

L: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled “Left LN of Cloquet". It
consists of a single lymph node measuring 1.4 x 0.9 x 0.9 cm, with a small amount
of attached fat. Serially sectioned and entirely submitted in one cassette.

M: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Left external iliac LN'. It
consists of multiple fragments of fatty and lymphoid tissue measuring in aggregate
4.2 x 2 x 0.5 cm. Entirely submitted in two cassettes.

N: The specimen is received in formalin'and labeled "Left obturator hypogastric
LN". It consists of multiple fragments of fatty and lymphoid tissue measuring in
aggregate 7.2 x 4 x 0.8 cm. Entirely submitted in seven cassettes.

O: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right pre sciatic LN“. It
consists of multiple fragments of fatty tissue measuring in aggregate 2 x 2 x 0.3
cm. Entirely submitted in one cassette.
