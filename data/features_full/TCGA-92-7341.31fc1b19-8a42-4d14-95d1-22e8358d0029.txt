Intraooerative Consultation:

:ntraoperative non-microscopic consunation was obtained and interpreted as: ”Brought to frozen is 'right upper lobe‘
consisting of a 188 gram. 12.5 x 8.0 x 3.5 cm lobe of lung with two masses palpated‘ The first has an overtying pleural
pucker (Inked) and is sectioned to show a 4.3 x 3.5 x 13 cm Ioouiated white-gray necroiic mass extending from the
main airway (not at the margin) to the pieura. The second mass is entimiy Entrapmenchymai. measuring 10 x 0‘9 x

cm. Labeled D. Jar O.

The ﬁfth container is labeled "right upper lobe - F84" and it holds a previously sectioned and inked lobe of lung
weighing 168 grams and measuring l2.5 x 8.0 x 3.5 cm. The sections show a 4.5 x 4.3 x 3.5 cm multinodular tan.
necrotic ill-deﬁned mass extending from the main airway to the overlying pleura. The overlying pleura is inked blue,
and the staple line is inked black. Also out sections Show the presence of a second mass measuring 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.8
cm located 2.0 cm from the larger mass and is calmﬁod. The larger mass is 1.5 cm from the nearest stapled margin.
The remainderof the lung parenohyma is spongy, brown, and unremarkable. Also in the container is a cassette
labeled “F84" holding bronchial margins and measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. Labeled El - F 34: £2 — mass with closest
overlying pleural surface: E3 - additional section of the tumor". E4 - mass in relation to the bronchial margin; E5 -
