DIAGNOSIS

(A) LEFT KiDNEY AND ADRENAL:

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR CELL TYPE), FUHRMAN' S NUCLEAR GRADE 3.
TUMOR CONFINED TO THE KIDNEY.

TUMOR MEASURES 5.0 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION.

Vascular, ureteral and soft tissue margins of resection free of tumor.

Adrenal gland, no tumor present.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
(A) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL - A nephrectomy specimen (19.0 x 10.0 x 5.7 cm) including the left kidney (12.0 x 7.5 x 5.0 cm), a

segment of renal artery, the renal vein, ureter (8.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter) and the adrenal gland (8.0 x 1.7 x 0.5 cm).

There is a 5.0 x 3.7 x 3.2 cm well-circumscribed tumor in the upper pole of the kidney. The tumor is bright yellow-tan with extensive
central, gray-tan myxoid change. The tumor is confined to the kidney and does not invade into the perinephrlc adipose tissue, renal
sinus or renai vein. The tumor does not extend to the Gerota's fascia.

The adjacent kidney parenchyme is unremarkable. The pelvic calyceal system is smooth and devoid of any lesions. No lymph nodes
are identified in the hilum of the kidney. Serial cross sections of the left adrenal gland show unremarkable cortex and meduiia. Portions
of the tumor are submitted for possible electron microscopy and to the Tumor Bank.

SECTION CODE: A1, ureter, renal artery and renai vein margin; A2, A3, tumor in relationship with adrenal gland: A4, A5, tumor with
kidney capsule; A6, A7, gelatinous tumor with capsule; A8, A9, tumor with relationship with renal sinus; A10, A11, tumor with renal
parenchyma; A12, representative section of adrenal; A13, representative section of uninvolved kidney.

CLINICAL HISTORY
Left renal mass.
