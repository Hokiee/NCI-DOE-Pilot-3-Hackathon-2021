PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:

A. BRAIN, PARIETAL TEMPORAL, MAIN, EXCISIONAL BIOPSIES: FIBRILLARY
ASTROCYTOMA, DIFFUSELY INFILTRATING. MIB-l LABELLING INDEX 2%.

B. BRAIN, PARIETAL TEMPORAL, DEEP, EXCISIONAL BIOPSY: ANAPLASTIC
ASTROCYTOMA. MIB-l LABELLING INDEX 8%.

C. BRAIN, PARIETAL TEMPORAL, DEEP MARGIN, EXCISIONAL BIOPSY:
FIBRILLARY ASTROCYTOMA, INFILTRATING.

D. BRAIN, PARIETAL TEMPORAL, EXCISIONAL BIOPSIES: GLIOMA WITH
ATYPICAL FEATURES.

SEE MICROSCOPIC AND COMMENT.

Operation/Specimen: Brain, parietal temporal lobe.

Clinical History and Pre—Op Dx: year old man with recent onset
seizure, and large diffuse tumor with small focal area of enhancement.
GROSS PATHOLOGY: Three parts.

A. Received fresh, two fragments, 1.3 and 0.9 cm across each. Firm,
tannish—white, non~necrotic. In total #1—4.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, parietal temporal: Glioma,

low grade.

B. Received fresh, one fragment, discoid, 0.9 cm.across in greatest
dimension. Soft, granular, yellowish—red. In total #5.
INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, parietotemporal: Intermediate
glioma.

C.

SPECIMEN: 3, deep margin permanent.

FIXATIVE: Saline.

GENERAL: A 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm. soft, red«tan tissue fragment.
SECTIONS: 6, all.

D.

SPECIMEN: 4, permanent tumor.

FIXATIVE: Saline.

GENERAL: A 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm., 1.9 gm. aggregate of several
fragments of red to gray»tan brain tissue.

SECTIONS: 7,8 — all.

MICROSCOPIC: A. Portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter
diffusely infiltrated by a glial neoplastic proliferation. The
neoplastic cells have moderate nuclear pleomorphism with rounded and
elongated shapes. The neuropil is rarefied and contains numerous
reactive astrocytes. There are no areas of necrosis, microvascular
cellular proliferation, or mitoses.

B. Solid portion of tumor made of cells frequently exhibiting a
gemistocytic phenotype, with prominent nuclear pleomorphism, and

nuclear features of anaplasia. Karyorrhexis is focally prominent, and
mitotic figures are rather frequent. The neoplastic nuclei have a
tendency for a round outline, and the vasculature is capillary—type
with interanastomosing vessels.

C. Portions of gray and white matter with diffuse infiltration by a
glial neoplasm with rarefaction of the neuropil. The neoplastic

cells are small and irregular with a moderate degree of pleomorphism.
Mitoses, microvascular cellular proliferation, and necrosis are absent.
D. Portions of cerebral cortex and white matter diffusely infiltrated
by a glial neoplastic proliferation of moderate cellularity and nuclear
atypia. The nuclei are round and elongated. Focally, the tumor is

more cellular, and the tumor cells are surrounded by perinuclear halos;
the background is finely fibrillary and has fine capillary type
vessels, minigemistocytes and true gemistocytes. However, areas of
necrosis, mitotic figures or necrosis are absent.

SPECIAL STAINS: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP and MIB~1 were
performed on blocks #1 and 5, and for CD34 (a vascular marker) on block
#1. The GFAP brings up the astrocytic nature of the tumor cells. The
CD34 highlights the microvasculature. with the MIB—l labelling indices
of 2% in specimen A and 8% in specimen B are determined.

COMMENT: The lesion is a neoplastic proliferation of glial cells that
in the superficial specimen (A) has the appearance of an astrocytoma
(grade II) with a MIB-l labelling index of less than 1%. In the deeper
specimen (B), the tumor has features of anaplasia (grade III) with a
gemistocytic phenotype and a MIB—l index of 8%. The tumor is present
in the deep margin (C). In the fourth specimen (D) the histology is
intermediate between A and B, and there is suggestion of an
oligodendroglial component.
