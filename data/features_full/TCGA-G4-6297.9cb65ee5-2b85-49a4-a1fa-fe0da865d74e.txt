A. RIGHT COLON

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. RIGHT COLON TERMINAL ILEUM:
Received fresh labeled with the patient's name, unit number and “right colon terminal ileum” is a
28.5x8.5x4 cm. right hemicolectomy specimen. The ileum is 8 cm. long and 7 cm. in circumference, the
colon is 20.5 cm. long, 8.5 cm. in circumference and the attached appendix is 5.8 cm. long and 0.9 cm.
in diameter. The serosal surface of the specimen is tan, smooth and multiple firm lymph nodes are
palpated throughout the adherent pericolonic fat at the cecum. The specimen when opened shows a
circumferential exophytic centrally ulcerated tumor with raised indurated peripheral borders occupying
proximal ascending colon,cecum, and extending to involved the iliocecal valve,measuring 8x4x1.0 cm.

Tumor 14.5 cm from distal,and 5.5cm from proximal margin.Cut sections show tan white granular
surface.and tumor seen infiltrating muscle wall and grossly appears to extend to subjacent subserosal
fat. The rest of colonic mucosa shows a flattened appearance .with a small polyp along hepatic flexure
measuring 1.2x1.1 cm. Dissection of the adherent pericolonic fat shows multiple lymph nodes,the
largest measuring 2x1 .1x0.9 cm. Appendix is grossly free of tumor. Multiple sections submitted as
follows in 30 cassettes labeled A1 -A1 7. Block summary:

A1 : margin
