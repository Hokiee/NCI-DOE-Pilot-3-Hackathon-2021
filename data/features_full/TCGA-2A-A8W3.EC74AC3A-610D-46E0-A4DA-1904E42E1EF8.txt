Gross Description:

1). The specimen is received fresh, labeled “Prostate and seminal vesicles”.

It consists of a prostate and seminal vesicles.

The total weight is 63.0 grams.

The prostate measures 4.5cm from apex to base, 4.50m transversely, and 4.0cm from anterior to posterior.
The right and left seminal vesicles measure 6.0 x 2.0 and 6.0 x 2.0 cm, respectively.

The external surface of the prostate is smooth.

The prostate is inked (right=green, leit=blue) and ﬁxed in formalin overnight.

The prostate is serially cut from apex to base at approximately 3-4 mm intervals.

The prostate is entirety submitted.

BN—bladder neck margin

RSV-right seminal vesicle

LSV-left seminal vesicle

A~H -serial sections of prostate (apex to base)

2). Received in formalin labeled "left peivic node" is a 4.2 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm fragment of yellow-ten adipose tissue containing a 3.1 x

1.0 x 0.5 cm pink-tan lymph node and a 0.3 cm yellow-tan possible lymph node. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted with the
large lymph node been serially sectioned and submitted in cassettes.
