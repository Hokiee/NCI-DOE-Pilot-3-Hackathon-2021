Gross Description

Specimen A is received fresh for intraoperative consultation, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number as "level Vl
lymph node" and consists of two lymph nodes measuring 1.6 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively. Each lymph
node is bisected and submitted for frozen section diagnosis. Dictated bﬂ

Specimen B is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and medical record number submitted as "left pleural clot."
The specimen consists of a fragment of soft tissue compatible with clotted blood measuri The specimen is
grossly unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted in one cassette. M

Specimen C is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and medical record number submitted as "level 11 lymph

node." The specimen consists of multiple fragments of lymph node tissue that measures 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. The
specimen is submitted in its entirety in one cassette.

Specimen D is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and medic ' "left level 5 lymph
node." The specimen consists of fragments of lymphoid tissue that measures

Specimen E is received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number submitted as "left upper lobe with en bloc
chest wall resection of ribs." The specimen consists of a lobe of lung with adherent chest wall containing three ribs. The
specimen is oriented per requisition with short stitch indicating superior aspect and the long stitch indicating the lateral aspect of
the chest wall. The bronchial margin is identified. A shave section of the margin is taken for frozen section diagnosis. The
remainder of the cryoblock is transferred to cassette "E1FS." The staple margin is inked black. The tumor mass does not
