Gross Description

Received are six formalin-ﬁlled containers. each labeled with the patient‘s name. The ﬁrst container is labeled "left
exterior iliac." it contains multiple fragments of lobulated, yellow tan adipose tissue, measuring in aggregate 4 x 2.5 x 1
cm. Multiple lymph nodes are dissected from the fat, ranging from 0.4 and 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. Cut sections
are light tan and unremarkable. Labeled A1,A2. Jar 1.

FWDOW)

The second container is labeled "left obturator." It contains a white cassette labeled "F81“ which holds multiple
fragments of yellow—tan soft tissue. measming 2 x 1,7 x 0.3 cm. Labeled Bl (F81). Also present in the container are
multiple fragments of Iobulated yellow-tan adipose tissue, measuring in aggregate 3 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm. Three putative
lymph nodes are dissected, ranging from 0.3 and 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. Labeled B2. Jar 1.

The third container is labeled "right pelvic lymph node." It contains multiple fragments of lobulated yellow-tan adipose
tissue, measuring in aggregate 4,5 x 4.5 x 1.5 cm. Several lymph nodes are dissected from the fat, ranging from 0.5
and 3.5 cm in greatest dimension. They appear unremarkable. Labeled C1-C3. Jar 1.

The fourth container is labeled "left common periaortic lymph node." it contains multiple fragments of lobulated
yellow-tan adipose tissue, measuring in aggregate 2.5 x 1 x 0.5 cm. Two putative lymph nodes are identiﬁed. They
measure 0.5 and 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. They appear unremarkable. Labeled D1. Jar 1.

The ﬁfth container is labeled "right common periaortic lymph node." It contains one fragment of lobulated yellow-tan
adipose tissue, measuring in aggregate 2.5 x 1 x 0.3 cm. Two putative lymph nodes are dissected, measuring 0.2 and
0.5 cm in greatest dimension. Labeled E1. Jar 1.

The sixth container is labeled "uterus and cervix." It contains a uterus with attached cervix weighing 83.4 gram and
measuring 8 x 5 x 3.5 cm. The external 05 measures 2 cm in diameter. The serosal surface is tan pink and
unremarkable. On opening, the cervical canal is ulcerated in an area measuring 1.9 x 1.5 x 1 cm. This area is
surrounded by a tan firm area measuring 2.5 x 1 x 1 cm. The endometrial cavity measures 2.5 x 1.2 cm and the
endometrium measures 0.1 cm in thickness. The myometrium measures up to 1.2 cm in maximal thickness. Labeled
F1 ,F2 - serial left cervix with parametrium; F 3,F4 - anterior right cervix with parametrium soft tissue; F5, F6 - anterior
cervix with ectocervix; F7,F8 - cervix with lower uterine segment of the anterior uterus; F9 - anterior endometrium;
F10,F11 - right posterior cervix with parametrium; F12,F13 - left cervix with parametrium; F14,F15 - posterior cervix
with ectocervix; F16 - posterior cervix with lower uterine segment. Jar 2.
