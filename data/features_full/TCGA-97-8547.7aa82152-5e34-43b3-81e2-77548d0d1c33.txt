CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Lung cancer

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in seven parts, each labeled with the
patient's name.

1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'right lower lobe'. It
consists of two irregular portions of grey and tan-yellow rubbery to

firm tissue measurin 1 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm and 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.6 cm.
Etttttty submitted S—

2. Part two is received in saline, labeled 'right level 11 lymph
node'. It consists of a 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm aggregate of black soft
rubbery anthracotic lymphoid tissue. Entirely submitted in one
cassette.

3. Part three is received fresh, labeled 'right lower lobe'. It

consists of a 174 gram, 14.5 x 10 x 3 cm right lower lobe of the
lung. At the hilum, a 2.5 cm diameter, 0.3 cm long portion of
bronchus and large vessels are noted. The lung is previously
incised through its Visceral pleural surface revealing a 4 x 3.5 x

2.5 cm poorly-circumscribed, firm, tan tumor with central tan-white
necrosis deep to the overlying puckered pleura. The overlying
pleura is inked black and the specimen is serially sectioned along
the long axis of the lobe. The tumor abuts the pleural surface and

is approximately 0.2 cm from the vascular margin and 0.6 cm from the
bronchial margin. There is also an ill-defined, patchy tan-yellow

area that extends from the tumor to the superior portion of the lobe

and terminates in two firm tan-yellow nodules measuring 1.0 cm and
0.8 cm in greatest dimension. The uninvolved pleural surface is
smooth, glistening and tan-red. The uninvolved pulmonary parenchyma
is homogeneous, tan-pink and aerated. Representative sections of

the specimen are submitted.

4. Part four is received in saline, labeled 'level 11 lymph node
near right upper lobe'. It consists of a 2.4 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm
irregular portion of black soft rubbery anthracotic lymph node.
Entirely submitted in one cassette.

5. Part five is received in saline, labeled 'level 7 lymph node'.
It consists of a 3.8 x 3.5 x 1 cm aggregate of black soft rubbery
anthracotic lymphoid tissue. Entirely submitted in three cassettes.

6. Part six is received in saline, labeled 'right level 4 lymph

node'. It consists of a 2 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm aggregate of black soft
rubbery anthracotic lymphoid tissue admixed with pink soft tissue.
Entirely submitted in one cassette.

7. Part seven is received in formalin, labeled 'rib'. It consists

of a 1.5 cm in length x 1.3 cm in width and 0.7 cm in thickness
portion of rib. The surface is tan-brown and smooth. The marrow
cavity is red and porous. There are no abnormalities identified.
Representative sections are submitted in one cassette following
decalcification.

ADDENDUM #1:

INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY

MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY
KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS

Body Site: Lung
Specimen Type: Slides
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma

RESULTS: Wild-type gene.

INTERPRETATION:
No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.

COMMENT:

Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor
prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor

therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS
mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking
history.

This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of

the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for
use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh,
frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular

the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal
cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these
mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor
KRAS mutations (e. g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,
etc.).

Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide
additional information regarding this patient's probability of
response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if

clinically indicated. See references.

METHOD/LIMITAT IONS:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY

EGFR Mutation Anal sis

Body Site: Lung

Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma

RESULTS: Positive for the E746_A750de15 mutation in Exon 19.

INTERPRETATION: Deletion mutations in exon 19, mostly involving the
LREA motif, are reported to correlate with responsiveness to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small-cell

lung carcinoma.

COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 30% tumor
cellularity upon pathologist review.

E746_A750de115 corresponds to 2235_2249de115.

A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was
identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
significance.

Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential
responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (T KI)
therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a
sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.

This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell

lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change
during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this
result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation

in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.

This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.

METHOD/LIMITATION:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.
