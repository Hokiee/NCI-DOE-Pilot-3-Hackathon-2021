intraogerative ConsultatiOn:

“Called to pick Up ‘cervix, utems, bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy, vagina' consisting Of a 137 gm uterus with cervix.
attached bilateral adnexae. perimetriai soft tissue, and a 2 cm vaginal cuff. The uterus and cervix mea5ures 9 x 6 x 3
cm. Located on the cervix is an exophytic nodular, iriabie 2.5 x 2.5 x 1 cm mass, most oi which is on the ectocervicai
portions of the cervix and part of it extends Into the endocervical canal. Resection margins are inked and the uterus is
bivalved to show an unremarkable endometrial cavity. The ovaries show benign aooearino cvsts. The rest of the
examination is unremarkable. Part of the tumor and normal tissue is submitted . Rest for
pennanents.‘ by* MD.

' Microscopic Description and Comment:

.Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (grade ii) with a mixed pattern including papillary and
glandular loci. There are areas where the glandular pattern is lost and shows a solid appearance. The nuclei are of
intermediate to high grade. and there is abundant mitotic activity. The tumor advances with pushing margins, and has a
prominent iniiammatory infiltrate. The entire thickness of the tumor is 3 mm out of 14 mm, the latter representing the full
thickness of the section. NO lymph-vascular, or venous invasion is noted. The tumor does not extend to the corpus of
the uterus so that it is clearly arising trgmgthgﬂendgc‘erng. The vaginal cuff is negative for tumor. The present case is
compared to [and is similar. Sections of the uterus show a secretory-type endometrium. The ovaries and
tubes are unremarkable. . .

Microscopic examination substantiates the above cited diagnosis tor all the lymph nodes;

no.
Histog:

The patient is a 7 year old woman with a history of cervical adenocarcinoma. Operative procedure: Radical
