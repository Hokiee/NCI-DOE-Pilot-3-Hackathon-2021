Specimems) Received

A: Radical resection sarcoma, right buttock, short stitch - superior; long stitch - lateral

Gross Description

The specimen is received fresh. labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and designated "radical resection
sarcoma, right buttocks." It consists of an elliptical excision of skin with attached underlying soft tissue and weighing 1119.5
grams. There is a long stitch at one of the elliptical tips designating the lateral margin and a short stitch at the mid point between
the two elliptical tips designating the superior margin. The skin ellipse measures as follows: superior to interior. 5.4 cm; lateral to
medial. 16.0 cm. The underlying soft tissue measures superior to inferior 13.0 cm, medial to lateral 20.0 cm and is excised to a
maximum depth of 11.0 cm. The deep margin is partially covered with unremarkable muscle.

Sectioning demonstrates a well-circumscribed. heterogenous, lobulated. solid mass, 30 cm below the epidermal surface and
measuring 10.0 x 9.1 x 8.3 cm. The mass is tan—white, focally hemorrhagic with approximately 5% tumor necrosis. The mass is

1.4 cm from the deep margin. 5.5 cm from the medial tip, 6.2 cm from the lateral tip. 33 cm from the superior margin and 1.9 cm
from the inferior margin. No other lesions are identiﬁed.
