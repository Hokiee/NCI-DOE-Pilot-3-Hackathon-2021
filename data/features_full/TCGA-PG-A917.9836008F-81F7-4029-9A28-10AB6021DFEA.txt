COMMENT: The original biopsy material showing F160 3 cndometrioid cancer
(architecture 2, nuclei 3) was reviewed. when looking at both the tumor
from the biopsy and the hysterectomy together, however‘ the amount of high
grade nuclear features is insufficient to warrant raising the P160 score
above a 2. The majority of the nuclei are of intermediate grade with a
small focus of high grade nuclei composing <5} of the tumor nuclei. These
higher grade nuclei were more concentrated in the biopsy material than the
final hysterectomy material. In sum, the final F160 score ie FIGO 2.

This case has been reviewed by one or more pathologists within the

CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Endometrial Carcinoma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

1. The specimen is received fresh and labeled "uterus cervix tubes and
ovaries" and consists at a total hysterectomy specimen weighing 212 g and
having the ﬁollowing measurements: 4.0 cm from cornu to cornu, 6.5 cm from
the anterior to posterior uterine fundus and 11.0 cm from the base of the
uterine tundue to the cervical os‘ Bilateral adnexa are attached and
consists of grossly unremarkable fallopian tubes which measure up to 2.0 x
0.8 x 0.8 cm in greatest dimensions and bilateral grossly unremarkable
ovaries measuring up to 2.0 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm. The uterine fundus is
distorted by multiple subserosal and transmural well—circumscribed ﬁibroids
measuring from 1.0 cm up to 2.5 cm in diameter. 0n opening the endometrial
cavity mcaeuxee 7.0 x 3.0 cm and shows a thickened hyperemic soft friable
mass predominantly at the base of the anterior endometrial lining measuring
4.0 x 2.0 x 1.9 cm in overall dimensions. on sectioning, the mass grossly
extends into the suhjacent tissue for approximately 0.2 cm. the remaining
endometrium is focally hemorrhagic and measures up to 0.2 cm in thickness.
The myometrium measures 3 .0 cm in thickness. The myometrium shows
multiple well-circumscribed tan~gray nodules along with focal pinpoint
