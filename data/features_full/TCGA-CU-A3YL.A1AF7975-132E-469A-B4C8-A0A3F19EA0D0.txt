Addenda Present

 

Accession #:

Diagnosis:
A: Urethra, proximal margin, biopsy
— No in situ or invasive carcinoma identified

B: Lymph nodes, right pelvic, dissection
Five lymph nodes with no malignancy identified (0/5)

C: Lymph nodes, left pelvic, dissection
Two lymph nodes with no malignancy identified (0/2)

D: Bladder and prostate, cystoprostatectomy

Tumor histologic type: papillary urothelial carcinoma

Tumor histologic grade (WHO classification): high grade
Macroscopic tumor size (greatest dimension): 8.5 cm

Microscopic extent of invasion: tumor invades the lamina propria
of the

bladder, prostatic ducts and prostatic stroma

Tumor site/focality of tumor: solitary; tumor involves bladder
and

prostate

Angiolymphatic space invasion: not identified

Associated epithelial lesions: urothelial carcinoma in situ
involves the bladder and

prostatic ducts bilaterally IC£>023

AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT4a pNO

NOTE: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information
available at the

time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical
review and

additional information.

Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis:
An intraoperative consultation is requested by Dr. in at

FSAl: Urethral margin, biopsy

— Focal urothelial atypia, favor reactive, cannot completely
exclude low grade

dysplasia

- Dr. concurs

Drs. ' a
Frozen Section Pathologist: , MD

Clinical History:

-year—old with a history of invasive high grade
urothelial carcinoma with
focal micropapillary features and urothelial carcinoma in situ
of the prostate.

Gross Description:
Received are four appropriately labeled containers.

Container A holds a 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm partially cauterized
red/tan soft tissue
fragment, FSAl,

Container B is additionally labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes."
It holds

multiple brown/tan, fatty, lobulated soft tissue fragments which
measure 7.2 x

4.5 x 1.7 cm in aggregate. Dissection reveals multiple lymph
node candidates,

the largest of which is 1.6 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm.

Block summary:

Bl — largest lymph node candidate, bisected
B2 — one lymph node candidate, bisected

B3 — two lymph node candidates

B4 — one lymph node candidate, bisected
Tissue remains in formalin.

Container C is additionally labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes."
It holds multiple

tan lobulated fatty soft tissue fragments which measure 5.2 x
4.0 x 1.8 cm in

aggregate. Dissection reveals two lymph node candidates which
measure 1.8 x 1.4

x 0.6 cm and 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm, respectively.

Block Summary:

C1,C2 - serial sections of largest lymph node candidate

C3 - one lymph node candidate, bisected

Fat remains in formalin.

Container D is additionally labeled "bladder and prostate."
Specimen fixation: formalin

Type of specimen(s) received: radical cystoprostatectomy
Size of overall specimen: 15 cm superior to inferior, 13 cm
right to left, 8 cm

anterior to posterior

Size of urinary bladder: 8 x 8 x 5 cm

Size of additional organs: The prostate is 4.2 x 3.2 x 3.0 cm

Orientation: Right=blue, left=black, and distal urethral
margin=yellow

Tumor size: 8.5 x 7.5 x 3.5 cm

Tumor description: exophytic, papillary friable nodule;
Sectioning through the

tumor reveals a friable cut surface which appears to

be superficial. The underlying muscle wall appears intact as
does the

perivesicular fat.

Tumor location: The tumor occupies the majority of the
urothelium sparring a

small portion of the posterior and left wall. The tumor
ends inferiorly at the prostatic urethra orifice.

Distance of tumor to margins: Gross tumor is 2.2 cm from the
distal prosthetic
urethral margin.

Other mucosal lesions: none

Description of other organs or structures: Sectioning through
the prostate

reveals minimal periurethral nodularity and ill—defined white
indurated discoloration in the right posterior/lateral lobe.

Digital photograph taken: not taken

Tissue submitted for special investigation: Tumor is given to

Immunohistochemical stains for PIN4 show an
intact basal cell layer, supporting the interpretation of benign
prostatic glands.
