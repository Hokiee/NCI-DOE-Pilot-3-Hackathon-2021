IIIIIGWROSS DESCRIPTION:

 

 

 

 

A. The ﬁrst containerA is receive in formalin labeled right lateral margin. The specimen consists of a piece of brown tan soft tissue
measuring 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in a single cassette labeled

B. The second container 8 is received in formalin labeled iical margin. The specimen consists of a piece oi brown tan soft tissue
measuring 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in a single cassette labels

C. The third container C is received in formalin labeler" left apical margin. The enprimnn consists of a piece of yellow tan soft tissue
measuring 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in a single cassette labels ,

D. The specimen consists of a prostate gland with attached bilateral seminal vesicles and vas deferens. The prostate measures 5.0 x 4.5 x 4.5 cm and
weighs 38 grams. The right seminal vesicle measures 3.5 cm in length and 1.0 cm in diameter and the left seminal vesicle measuring 2.0 cm in length
and 1.5 cm in diameter. Both are grossly unremarkable. The right was deferens measures 6.5 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter and the right was
deferens measures 6.6 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. Both are grossly unremarkable The surface of the prostate is gray tan to brown tan with
adhesions, The right half has been inked red and the left half has been inked blue. The prostate is serially sectioned from apex to base. On sectioning
the cut surface is yellow to gray tan ﬁbrous with yellow ran gritty areas that involve both the right and left posterior lobes invnluim nrimarily apex and
base areas. No other lesions are identiﬁed. Received with the specimen are two cassettes. one yellow. one green, labeled

Representative sections are summed in cassettes labeled ' as follows: right seminal vesicle and vac—1; left seminal tissue and vas—
2; perpendicular section: taken from the margins from apex-.3; case—4; cruciate submitted from apex to base as follows: level 1 left anterior-5‘, left
posteriowb‘; n‘ght posterior—7; right anterior—8; level 2 left anteriorue; left posterior—10: right posterior—i 1; right anterior—1 2; level 3 left anterior~13; left
posterior-14; right posterior—15; right enterior«16. _ _ _ . .. . . .
