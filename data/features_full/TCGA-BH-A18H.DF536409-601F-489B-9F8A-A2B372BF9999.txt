PART 4: LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS, EXCISION -
A. METASTATIC CARCINOMA INVOLVES TWO OF TWENTY-FOUR LYMPH NODES (2124).
B. THE LARGEST METASTATIC FOCUS MEASURES 4.0 CM.
C. NO EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IDENTIFIED.

COMMENT:

Part 1: The gross examination demonstrated an Ill-deﬁned ﬁrm nodule with surroundlng ﬁbrous ﬁssue measuiing 2.0 x
1.1 x 0.7 cm. This area was entirely submitted for histologic evaluation and shows Invasive carcinoma in only two
sections of 0.4 cm thickness and therefore. the invasive tumor Size to estimated to be 0.8 cm in largest dimension. The
majority of this gross lesion is composed of ductal carcinoma in sltu (DCIS).

Part a: The invasive tumor demonstrates scattered cells with intro-cytoplasmic lumlna or slgnet ring cell morphology.
