GROSS DESCRIPTIONS

Received are two formalin-ﬁlled containers each labeled with the patient's

name and MR#.

Container #1 holds a fresh liver resection specimen. The specimen was received by the frozen section team
and a portion of tumor was given to tissue procurement and a portion of uninvolved liver was also
submitted for research. The specimen weighs 630 grams and measures 16 x 13.5 x 5.5 cm. It is includes
the left lobe and a portion of the right lobe. The tumor measures 10 x 9 x 7 cm. In the region of the tumor,
the capsule of the '

liver is white and ﬁrm with central puckering. The tumor extends 2 cm to the left of the calciform ligament
and 8 cm to the right. It approaches the resection margin in multiple areas superiorly and the right end of
the specimen. On cut section the tumor is ﬁrm with a fairly homogenous yellow-tan appearance. The
tumor is well circumscribed. The uninvolved liver parenchyma and capsule are grossly unremarkable.
Sections are

submitted as per block summary.

Container #2 is additionally labeled "gallbladder". It holds a gallbladder measuring 7 x 2.5 x 2 cm. The
external surface shows a few scattered petechiae. The lumen is ﬁlled with dark green bile. The mucosa is
