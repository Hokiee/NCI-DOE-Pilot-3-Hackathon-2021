Microscopic. Description

. Multiple sections reveal a large neoplasm involving the adrenal- medulla. The neoplasm' Is surrounded by a thin ﬁbrous - .
capsule with remnants of hemorrhagic adrenal cortex present. The neoplasm Is comprised of polygonal Cells * -
demonstrating a nested and focally solid pattern of growth. The cells demonstrate rounded vesicular nuclei with single
prominent nudeoli and abundant eosinophilic to amphophili'o grantilar cytoplasm Moderate nuclear variation Is present
Mitos‘es are not readily identiﬁed and no areas of necrosis are present. lntranuolear inclusibns are present as well as

1 scattered eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions. An Iimrnunostain proﬁle reveals the tumor to stain as follows.

' . Synaptophysin Positive
Chromogranin ~ ' ‘ Positive
CK AE1/AE3 Negative _

The overall features are compatible with pheochromchtoma.Hi1stologic features of pheochromocytoma are poor
predictors of biologic behavior In fact, distant metastasis“ Is the only reliable indicator of a malignant pheochromOcytor‘na.
