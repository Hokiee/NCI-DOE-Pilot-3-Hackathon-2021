Comment: The lobular differentiation is supported by negative E- cadherin
cytoplasmic staining and strongly positive 34betaE12 ( ) perinuclear
cytoplasmic staining. There are microscopic foci of infiltrating lobular
carcinoma and LCIS in a random representative section of the lower outer
quadrant (slide A10). The morphology is identical to the main tumor

true multifocal carcinoma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled with the patient’s name ‘ and
designated "LEFT BREAST" is a 413 gram simple mastectomy specimen oriented
with sutures (long lateral, short superior) measuring 22 cm medial to
lateral, 16 cm superior to inferior, and 4.8 cm anterior to posterior. An
ellipse of unremarkable nipple bearing skin measuring 5.5 x 3 cm is
present. The specimen is inked as follows: blue superior superficial,
green inferior superficial, black deep. Sectioning reveals a 3.5 x 3.5 X 3
cm firm poorly defined mass at the 2-3:OO position, 0.2 cm from the inked
deep margin. The cut surface of théﬂtﬁmofwiswyellow tan and gritty. The
remaining tissue is mostly fatty with admixed patches of white fibrous
tissue located centrally. Two sections of tumor, a single section of

skin, and a single section of grossly normal breast are collected for CBCP
protocol with matched paraffin sections in A2, A3, A1, and A4
respectively. The specimen was in formalin for 76 hours and 5 minutes.

Summary of cassettes:

A1: skin

A2: tumor lateral

A3: tumor medial

A4: grossly normal breast central

A5-A7: random additional sections of tumor
A8: left upper outer quadrant

A9: left upper inner quadrant

A10: left lower outer quadrant

All: left lower inner quadrant

A12: nipple. ‘
