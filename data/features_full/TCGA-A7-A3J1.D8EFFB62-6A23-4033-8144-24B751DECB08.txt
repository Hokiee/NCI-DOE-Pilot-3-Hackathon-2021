Final Surgical Pathology Report

/CA 0- .3 _
(MA/WM m {bf/97 0W5 “05 3513/3
5:41 W was 050- ’7 11“)

Procedure: [ﬁﬂgﬂl

Diagnosis
A. Sentinel lymph node, left axilla, biopsy: A single lymph node is
negative for malignancy

B. Breast, left, excisional biopsy: Invasive lobular carcinoma,
Nottingham grade 2

Note: The margins are negative for malignancy

C. Breast, posterior lateral margin, biopsy: Focal lobular carcinoma
in situ, negative for invasive carcinoma

Microscopic Description:
A. A single lymph node is negative for malignancy.

[At the request of some staff oncologists and in keeping with the
opinion of some experts in breast pathology, immunohistochemical stains
for keratin were not used on the sentinel lymph node sections in this
case. These stains can be obtained if desired. Our paraffin blocks
are retained for 10 years. (Weaver DL et al. New Engl J Med 364:412,
2011. Schwartz GF et al. Cancer 94(10):2542, 2002)].

B.
Invasive carcinoma:
Histologic type: Invasive lobular carcinoma
Nottingham grade: 2
Architectural score: 3
Nuclear score: 2
Mitotic score: 1
Mitotic index: 0 mitoses/ 10 HPFs (l HPF = 1.96 sq. mm)
Tumor size: 1.7 cm
Specimen margins: Negative for malignancy. Carcinoma is 1.2 mm
from the red (anterior) inked margin in block B15.
Vessel invasion: Absent
Calcification: Absent

Non—tumorous breast: Fat necrosis, compatible with prior biopsy site
pTNM stage: Tlc N0

Prognostic markers: No previous biopsy here. Markers are available if
needed.

CK5/6 ...Positive
E—cadherin ...Positive

C. Lobular carcinoma in situ is present.

Antibody...Results...Comment

Paraffin sections; 10% neutral buffered formalin; Controls stain
appropriately.

[A few of the antibodies used in our laboratory may be classified as
analyte specific reagents.
These antibodies are monitored and controlled in our laboratory and
their performance for
in vitro diagnosis is well described in the medical literature.
They have not been cleared
or approved by the FDA.]
