DIAGNOSIS

(A) LEFT KIDNEY:
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR), CELL TYPE, FUHRMAN'S NUCLEAR GRADE 4 (5.8 CM).
TUMOR INVADING FOCALLY RENAL SINUS FAT.

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, PAPILLARY TYPE, FUHRMAN'S NUCLEAR GRADE 2 (1.0 CM, UPPER POLE).
Vascular and urethral margin of resection free of tumor.

Renal cortical adenoma.

COMMENT

The kidney contains two separate tumors. The largest tumor (5.8 cm) is located In the middle of the kidney. This tumor invades focally
the adipOse tissue of the renal sinus. The second tumor focus {1.1 cm} is located in the upper pole. This tumor is histologically different
from the main tumor and has the histologic features of a papillary renal cell carcinoma.

Additional deeper sections from multiple blocks were examined.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
(A) LEFT KiDNEY - A radical nephrectomy product (17.0 x 16.0 x 6.0 cm overall) with the attached ureter (10.0 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm}.

An ill-defined tumor (5.8 x 5.0 x 5.0 cm) with a variegated yellow-tan appearance with focal hemorrhage and coliagenous changes is
present in the middle pole of the kidney, 0.5 cm from the closest pelvis. The tumor focally infiltrates into the perirenal adipose tissue.
The tumor spreads through the renal parenchyma into adjacent cortex and forms multiple separate nodules (0.3 to 1.5 cm in greatest
dimension). The main tumor focally goes Into the sinus.

A second tumor (1.1 x1.1 x 1.0 cm) is present in the upper pole (3.5 cm superior to the first tumor) which has a yellow and homogeneous
consistency. It is located In the cortex, 1.3 cm away from the closest sinuslcalyces.

The remaining renal parenchyma and renal pelvis is grossly unremarkable. The tumor is not present in the renal vein.

tNK CODE: The surface of the specimen near the tumor is inked in black.

SECTION CODE: A1, ureter margin, renal artery margin, renal vein margin, on face; A2-A5, the larger tumor with possible sinus
involvement; AE-A‘l'l, the larger tumor with adjacent nodules; A1 Z-A‘i 8, tumor with adjacent perirenal fat and cortex; A19-20, the larger
tumor wlth the closest hilum; A21, A22, A24, the smaller tumor with cortex, entirely submitted; A25, unremarkable renal parenchyma.
Representative sections of two tumors are submitted for EM on hold and tumor bank. —

CLINICAL HISTORY
Left renal mass.
