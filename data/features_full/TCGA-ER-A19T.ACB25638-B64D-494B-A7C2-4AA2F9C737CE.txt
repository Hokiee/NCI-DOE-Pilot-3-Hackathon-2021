COMMENT:

Part 1: The soft tissue metastatic melanomas in fatty tissue show circumscription but since no lymphoid tissue
consistent with lymph node structure is identiﬁed around. these are considered as soft tissue metastasis. The separately
submitted 8.5 cm melanoma shows pseudo encapsulation close to the margin and ﬁbrous septae same as other larger
fool but definite evaluation is difﬁcult as of the nodal origin of this metastasis.

Part 2: The, morphology ls of acral lentigﬁtgygmelaggma with nodular growth. SIPE°JIE 9313911139 specimenbasheen
