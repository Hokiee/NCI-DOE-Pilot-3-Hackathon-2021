Gross Description

Received is a single specimen container. The requisition and specimen container are
labelled with the patient‘s name, The cassette and identifiers are
labelled with the Surgical Number -

The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The container
is designated "Liver segment 2, 3“. Specimen consists of a liver segment that weights
169.3 g and measures 15.0 x 7.5 x 4.0 cm. Serial sections through the liver reveals a
well circumscribed yellow mass beneath the liver capsule, that measures 2.7 x 2.3 x 2.1
cm. The mass is solid, with focal areas of necrosis and punctate hemorrhage. The mass
lies just beneath the liver capsule. The remainder of the liver is deep yellow in color
and grossly nodular. The surgical resection margin has been painted blue and the liver
capsule adjacent to the mass has been painted green. There is a defect in the capsule of
the liver 2.0 cm away from the mass that has been painted yellow. The mass lies more
than 1.0 cm from the surgical resection margin. Sections are submitted as follows:

A1 to 10. the liver mass in toto '

All. the closest surgical resection margin
A12. uninvolved liver parenchyma

A13. sample of the previously described defect

Microscopic Description

Sections show a well circumscribed moderately differentiated hepatocellular
carcinoma with pushing borders. The carcinoma has a trabecular pattern >4 cells thick
with notable areas of pseudoglandular architecture with pleomorphic hyperchromatic foci.
The morphology suggests a mixed hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma with stem cell
features. However. the immunoprofile failed to support this diagnosis.

The tumor is diffusely and strongly positive for glypican-3 indicating
hepatocellular origin. It shows patchy moderate positivity alpha—1 antitrypsin, very
focal mild HepParl. other markers of hepatocellular differentiation (alpha fetoprotein,
polyclonal CEA, cytoplasmic TTF~1, BHCG and OCT3/4) are largely negative.

Markers of cholangiocytic differentiation (0K7, CK19 and polyclonal CEA). There
is however, patchy strong staining for EMA.

Stem cell features are only supported by focal positivity for CD56 while CD19 and

C—KIT are negative. This does not support the presence of any stem cell component.
CD30 is negative.

Tumor block = A9; Non tumor block = A12
