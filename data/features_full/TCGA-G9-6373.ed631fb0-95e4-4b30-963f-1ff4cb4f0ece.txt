GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. PROSTATE
Received fresh labeled with the patient‘s identiﬁcation and designated "prostate" is a resected prostate

gland weighing 46 g and measuring 5.5 cm from right to left, 4.2-cm from anterior to posterior, and 3.7—
cm from apex to base. The capsule is smooth and intact. A fragment of detached seminal vesicle
measures 2.7 x 2.1 x 0.3 cm and detached vas deferens, 3.7—cm in length by 0.3-cm in diameter. lnk
code: Apex-red, anterior-orange, posterior-black, basew blue, right-green, leﬁ—yeilow. The apex and
base are removed from the specimen yielding a new weight of 21 g. The specimen is serially sectioned
from apex to base revealing beige tan ﬁbrous parenchyma. The left attached seminal vesicle, 3.? x 1.9
x 0.4 cm. and detached fragment of seminal vesicle, are bisected to show beige tan cystic tissue. A
portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement, the remainder entirely submitted:

A1 ~A2: Right apex

A3-A4: Left Apex

A5: Level 1 right anterior

A6: Levei 1 right posterior

A7: Level 1 left anterior

A8: Level 1 left posterior

AS: Level 2 capsule right side

A1 0: Level 2 capsule left side

A11“A12: Right lateral base

A13-A15: Right base

A18: Right base with proximat urethral margin

A1 7: Left base with proximal urethral margin

A18-A2‘i : Left base

A22—A23: Left lateral base

A24: Representative section, left seminal vesicle

A25: Representative sections detached seminal vesicle and detached vas

DIAGNOSIS:
