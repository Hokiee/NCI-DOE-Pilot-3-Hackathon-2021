DIAGNOSIS:

Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes; abdominal
hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy:

Invasive high

grade papillary serous carcinoma forming a main exophytic
mass (2.9‘amwwwm~mﬁm‘"“”“*"_“"“"

x 2.1 x 1.1 cm) involving the left lateral wall of lower
uterine

segment. A separate non—invasive, high grade papillary
serous

carcinoma forming a mass (1.3 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm) arising
within in an _

endometrial polyp is also identified. The invasive tumor
extends 0.8

cm into the myometrium (1.2 cm total myometrial thickness)
within

the lower uterine segment. Multiple (2) benign leiomyomata
(4

intramural, 1.2 to 3.4 cm) are identified. The left tube
and

bilateral ovaries are uninvolved. The right tube shows a
paratubal

cyst. Multiple (2) calcified nodules are identified
within the left

and right adnexa.

 

Omentum, omentectomy: Mature adipose tissue, negative for
tumor.

Lymph nodes, bilateral para—aortic above and below the
inferior

mesenteric artery, excisions: Multiple bilateral para-
aortic lymph

nodes (11 above and 11 below the inferior mesenteric
artery) are

negative for tumor.

Lymph nodes, laparoscopic right pelvic, excision:
Multiple (10)
right pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

Lymph nodes, laparoscopic left pelvic, excision: Multiple
(19) left
pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

 

This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic

examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of
the

specimen(s).
