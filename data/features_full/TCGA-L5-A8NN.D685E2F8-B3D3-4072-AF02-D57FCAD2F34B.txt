PROCEDURE:

OPEN DATE: REG DOC:
VERIFIED BY:

year-old with long history of right chest pain and dysphagia. Esophageal
cancer. Operative Procedure: Transhiatal esophagectomy.

VERIFIED BY:

1. ”Esophagus and proximal stomach" An 11 cm long specimen or section of
esophagus and stomach; located 1.8 cm from proximal margin and abutting and/or
obliterating gastroesophageal junction is a circumferential 4.5 cm wide x 10.5
circumference and 0.8 cm fungating ulcerated mass which abuts serosal/external
surface. Just distal to this mass in the stomach is a 3.6 x 2.0 ulcer with
raised, rolled borders, overlying a 5.5 x 5.0 x 5.0 cm cystic mass filled with
necrotic material, surrounded by tan-white parenchyma that is contiguous with
the fungating mass in the esophagus. This mass comes to within 1.0 cm of the
distal staple lines. Mass abuts free surface of specimen in both the esophagus
and stomach. Sampled.

1A-H. One full longitudinal section from proximal to distal.

1l—J. Additional samples of mass in relation to distal margin and external
gastric surface.

1K-M. Paraeaophagaal lynph nodes (K22 nodes, L-M=samplea of one node each)
1N-o. Paragastric lymph nodes. (N=lo nodes, 0-salrples of one node)

2. ”Cervical esophageal margin" A 0.5 cm long segment of esophagus, up to 1.0
cm in diameter open at one end and stapled at the other. Open and sanpled.

PROCEDURE: VERIFIED BY:
1. Esophagus and proximal stomach, transhiatal esophagogastrectomy: Invasive
adenocarcinoma arising at GE junction not otherwise specified, invading to
adventitia. Surgical resection margins negative. Four lyirph nodes positive for
metastatic sdenocarcinona, with external extension. see template for details.

2. Cervical esophageal margin: Negative for neoplasm.
