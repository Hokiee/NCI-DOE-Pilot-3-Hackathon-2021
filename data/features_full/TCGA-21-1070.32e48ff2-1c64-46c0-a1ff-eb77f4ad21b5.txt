FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: TFS - NEGATIVE BRONCHIAL MARGIN.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received fresh for frozen section evaluation is a 330
gram, 18.0 x 9.5 x 4.50m left upper lobectcmy of lung. It is covered by a
red—purple, focally anthracotic—stained pleura having a 10.5 x 8.0 X 1.0cm
portion of overlying chest wall and ribs. There is up to 0.80m of attached
bronchus. The bronchial resection margin is submitted for frozen section
evaluation and the frozen section residue is submitted in one block. On
sectioning through the apical segment, there is an 8.0 X 4.5 X 4.00m ﬁrm
mass, having gray—tan cut surfaces. This grossly appears to involve the
overlying ribs. The remaining cut surfaces of lung are gray-tan to pink and
focally anthracotic stained. There are several palpable hilar lymph nodes,
1.00m in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted in
fourteen blocks.

DESIGNATION OF SECTIONS: 7FS — ﬁ‘ozen section, bronchial resection margin,
7A - vascular margins, 7B-7D — tumor with inked pleural margin, 7E-7F -

random lung sections, 7G-7I - rib margins, following decalciﬁcation, 7J-7L

— tumor with overlying rib, following decalciﬁcation, 7M—7N - hilar lymph

nodes.
