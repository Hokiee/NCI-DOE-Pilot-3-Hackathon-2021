COLLECTED: RECEIVED: at“ <94.) 12/12/15
GROSS DESCRIPTION: A) Received in formalin designated right tonsil is an irregular,
unoriented, 2.5 x 2 x up to 1.4 cm in thickness partially mucosa covered portion of multinodular
tan white focally ﬁrm soft tissue. One side of the specimen is white-tan, somewhat granular and
ﬁrm. It is probably covered by mucosa. The specimen is serially sectioned perpendicular to the
mucosal surface. On cut surface there is an ill-deﬁned, pale tan-white, ﬁrm nodule 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.5
cm in greatest dimension. It grossly approaches the deep, inked margin. The specimen is entirely
submitted in cassettes A1 -A3. B) Received unﬁxed designated right modiﬁed radical neck
dissection, double long = level II, double short = level IV is an 18 x 8 x 3 cm in greatest
dimensions right neck dissection specimen with surgical sutures designating levels 11 and IV.
The specimen is multinodular with multiple grossly positive lymph nodes in levels II and 111
including a complex of matted nodes that involves both levels; one node is received cut across. A
10 x 3 x 1.5 cm portion of sternocleidomastoid muscle is identiﬁed on the anterior aspect of the
specimen. On the medial aspect of the muscle there is a suture-tied on both ends, 7 cm long x 0.5
cm in outer diameter vessel (internal jugular vein). Additional portion of a vessel 3 cm long is
present in level I lateral to the salivary gland tissue. The salivary gland in level I measures 5 x 3
x 1 cm and has a smooth tan-pink, lobulated, soﬁ cut surface. The skeletal muscle adjacent to
grossly positive lymph nodes in the middle of the specimen, is not involved. The main complex
of positive nodes measures 7 cm in greatest dimension and as previously described crosses both
levels 11 and III. Cassette index: Bl - representative section of salivary gland; B2 - level I four
probable nodes; B3 - level I one node bisected; B4 - level I one node bisected; B5 - level II
section of grossly positive node (2 cm) and three probable nodes; B6 - level 11 three nodes; B7 -
level II one probable node; B8 - representative cross section of matted nodes; B9 - level III
representative section of grossly involved necrotic node (2.2 cm); B10 - level III three nodes;
B11 - level 111 three probable nodes; B12 - level III one node bisected; Bl3 - level IV two nodes

one inked blue and bisected; B14 - three probable nodes, level IV; BIS - level IV three probable
nodes.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

A) Tonsil, right, tonsillectomy: Moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, at
least 2.2cm in greatest dimension (slide A2), extending to inked margin.

B) Lymph nodes, right neck, radical dissection:

1. Level I i. Submandibular gland with no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. ii. Six lymph nodes
with no evidence of metastatic carcinoma (0/6).

2. Levels II—III i. Matted lymph nodes positive for metastatic carcinoma spanning both levels. ii.
One (20m) of eight level II nodes positive for metastatic (1/8). iii. One (2.20m) of eight level III
nodes positive for metastatic carcinoma (1/8).

3. Level [V i. Eight llymph nodes with no evidence of metastatic carcinoma (0/ 8).
