GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Left tube and ovary", received fresh and placed in formalin. The specimen
is a 9.9 gram, 3.0 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm previously incised ovary, a 3.2 x 0.4 cm
fimbriated fallopian tube, and attached soft tissue. Representative sections
of ovary and fallopian tube in block Al.

B. "Right tube and ovary", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 10.4
gram, 2.8 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm previously incised ovary, a 1.0 x 0.4 cm fimbriated
fallopian tube, with attached soft tissue and ligament. No nodules or masses
are seen and representative sections are submitted in block Bl.

C. "Uterus, cervix", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 130 gram, 9.8
x 7.0 x 5.5 cm uterus previously opened by the surgeon. The serosa is smooth

Sectioning of the posterior uterus exhibits a focally ill defined 2 cm thick
endometrium. There is a 1.4 cm diameter firm, white well circumscribed
submucosal nodule with a hemorrhagic center located in the fundus. The viable

dimension.

accreditation purposes by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology staging is based
solely upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not
incorporate information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology
section, past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Anatomic pathology staging is only a component to be considered in
determining the clinical stage, but should not be confused with nor
substituted for it. The exact operative procedure is available in the
surgeon's operative report.
