Clinical History
man experiences dizziness and iightheadedness for about nine months. On imaging, there
is a focal
expansion of the cerebral cortex with extension into the white matter in the right frontal lobe. The lesion
has few
punctate areas of enhancement.
Operative Diagnoses
Brain lesion
Operation I Specimen
A: Brain tumor, biopsy
Pathologic Diagnosis
A, B. Brain, site not speciﬁed, excision: Oligodendroglioma (WHO 2).
1p,19q LOH (codeietion): Positive.
MlB-1: 3.5%
Se Microscopy Description and Comment.
Comment
The sections contain portions of a glial neopiastic proliferation that has an oligodendroglial phenotype.
The
neoplasm diffusely inﬁltrates the brain. There are very sparse mitotic ﬁgures, and the MiB-1 proliferation
index is low
at about 3.5% in the more active areas. There is not microvascuiar cellular proliferation or tumor necrosis.
The
tumor has LOH (codeletion) of 1p, 19q.
The features are those of a low histological grade oligcdendroglioma (WH) 2).
The results of MGMT testing will be reported in an addendum.

Interpretation

POSlTlVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1p and chromosome arm 19g is detected.

informative ioci are: 0131592, 013552, 0198412, PLAZG4C

Results-Comments

Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor parafﬁn block (A2). DNA extracted from
a

corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.

H and E slide was examined and tumor DNA was enriched by microdissection

TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)! Tumor DNA
pairs using 3

markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1p are 018548, 0181592, and 018552 (with 013468,
0181612, and
018496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are 0198219, 0198412. and PLAZG40 (with
0198606 and
01981182 as backup). All markers are microsateliites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLAZG4C which is a
minisatellite (26
nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and
ease of
interpretation. The backup markers are used if the ﬁrst line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninfomiative or
othenrvise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical ﬁnding in oligodendrogiiomas with 1p and 19q deletion.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand-alone diagnostic
test. This test
was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLIA ' 88 regulations. it has not been cleared or approved for speciﬁc uses by the US. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in the context of established
procedures
and/or diagnostic criteria.
TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in the sample may preclude the
detection of
allelic loss.

MGMT Promoter Methylation
Date Ordered: Date Reported:
Interpretation
POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected.
Results-Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor parafﬁn block (A2)
H and E slide was examined and tumor DNA was enriched by microdissection
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
beneﬁt
from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulﬁte
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR ampliﬁcation of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA. and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.
