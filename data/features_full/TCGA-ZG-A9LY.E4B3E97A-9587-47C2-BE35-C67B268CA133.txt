Gross description:

1. (Prostate gland): Prostate gland: Weight: 24 9. Volume: 19 ml, Size: 2.4 x 4.5 x 3.6 cm. Adherent
seminal vesicles and deferent duct: right side: 2.6 cm, left side: 2.4 cm. The surface is marked with
green ink on the right side, blue ink on the left side. On the right recto-lateral surface a 3.7 x 2.6 cm
measuring tissue defect marked with yellow ink. Apical peri—urethral a funnel shaped 1.2 x 1 cm tissue
defect marked with red ink. Total of the cross sections: 1.2 cm.

2. (Lymph nodes, right side): 4.5 x 3.5 x 1.2 cm measuringadipose tissue containing 9 nodes
measuring up to 3.1 cm.

3. (Lymph nodes, left side): 4.5 x 5 x 1.2 cm measuring adipose tissue containing 5 nodes measuring
up 3.5 cm.

Microscopy:

1. Apex right and left: Right 7 tissue blocks, left 6 tissue blocks (total 13 tissue blocks). 3 cross
sections: Right 10 tissue blocks, left 12 tissue blocks (total 22 tissue blocks). Basis right and left: Right
6 tissue blocks. left 6 tissue blocks (total 12 tissue blocks). Seminal vesicles right and left: Right 4
tissue blocks, left 4 tissue blocks (total 8 tissue blocks). Deferent ducts right and left: Right 1 tissue
block, left 1 tissue block (total 2 tissue blocks). I043 ‘0 :3

2. Frozen lymph nodes right: 12 tissue blocks. WW HOS 9/4013
3. Frozen lymph nodes left: 8tissue blocks. 5311/ (p 2 E [was (140/ ‘7
Diagnosis: 9“) ”ﬁg/[4

1. (Prostate gland): Poorly differentiated prostatic adenocarclnoma, Gleason 4+5=9, (Gleason 4: 60%,
Gleason 5: 35%, Gleason 3: 5%). Tumor involves both lobes with the main focus on the left side.
Maximum tumor diameter: 22 mm. Perineural invasion. Tumor inﬁltration into peri-prostatic adipose
tissue in 2 tissue blocks with the main focus around the seminal vesicles (maximum invasion length
0.3 mm, maximal invasion depth 0.2 mm). Tumor inﬁltration into both seminal vesicles. Positive
surgical margin in 2 blocks (contact length 0.7 mm basal left and 0.4 mm basal right side; Gleason 4).

Remaining prostatic tissue with small fool of prostatic lntraepithelial neoplasla (high grade PIN) and
signs of myoglandular hyperplasla of the prostate. Urothelium of the prostatlc urethra without
dysplasia. Tumor-free deferent ducts.

2. (Lymph nodes, right side): Eight tumor-free lymph nodes (0/8).
3. (Lymph nodes, left side): One lymph node metastasis (4.2 mm) in three lymph nodes (113).

Tumor classiﬁcation

(in consideration of the intraoperative frozen—section and immunohistochemical analyses):

pT3b, Gleason 4+5=9 (Gleason 4: 60%, Gleason 5: 35%, Gleason 3: 5%), maximum tumor diameter:
22 mm, tumor volume approx. 17.2 ml (Gleason 4: 10.3 ml, Gleason 5: 6.0 ml, Gleason 3: 0.9 ml),
pN1 (1/11), L1. V0, R1

Comments:

Positive surgical margin in tissue blocks BR2A and BL1A.
Tumor infiltration into peri—prostatic adipose tissue in blocks SBR1 and SBL3.

The preceding intraoperative frozen section revealed more adenocarcinoma on the right side with
positive surgical margin. The left side was not examined in the intraoperative frozen section.

The resected right neurovascular bundle showed minor tumor inﬁltration. It is not clear whether the
resected neurovascular bundle c0vers the positive surgical margin on the right side. However, the
tumor has to be staged as R1 due to the positive surgical margin on the left side.

Furthermore, immunohistochemical analyses (DZ-40, C031) on tissue blocks SBL1 and SBL1
revealed distinctive lymphatic invasion. No venous invasion found.
