SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPTION

A) SOURCE: Liver segment 3 .

The specimen is received fresh from the OR labeled “Iiver segment 3" and
consists of a 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.1 cm discoid tan-brown tissue which is bisected
and entirely frozen on one block.

INTRAOPERATIVE PATHBBGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: -"No evidence of
malignancy“ i

. ,1.

B) SOURCE: Gallbladder

Labeled “gallbladder" is a pink-purple, 7 x 2.5 x 2 cm gallbladder. The
serosal surface is smooth and glistening. The cystic duct is identified
with a 0.2 cm luminal diameter. The specimen is opened revealing a
tan-green, velvety mucosa with multiple yellow flecks consistent with
cholesterolosis. The average wall thickness is 0.1 cm. No calculi are
grossly identified. Multiple representative sections of gallbladder wall
and on face cystic duct margin are submitted in a single cassette.

C) SOURCE: Liver, right lobe

Labeled "right lobe liver“ and received lresh from the OR is a 1198 g. 19 x
14 x 9 cm Iiver lobe. The liver capsule is red-brown with a 12 x 6 cm
white-pink protruding area present. The resection margin is inked black.

The specimen is serially sectioned revealing multiple (approximately 12-15)
white-tan firm tumor nodules ranging from 0.5-12 cm in greatest dimension.
The nearest tumor nodule measures 2 cm to the bile duct margin and 2 cm to
the resection margin. The remaining liver parenchyma is red-brown and

unremarkable.

A re resentative section of the bile duct margin designated by surgeon, .
éis submitted on a single chuck for frozen section diagnosis.

INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSUL ITH FROZEN SECTION: "Margin
identified by surgeon benign" is render

Representative sections are submitted in 11 cassettes labeled:
CF81. Frozen section bile duct margin

24. Representative largest tumor to capsule

5. Tumor nearest resection margin (black)

6. Remainder of bile duct margin

7. Tumor to adjacent normal liver parenchyma

8-9. Representative smaller tumors

10—1 1. Random Iiver

Photographs are taken of the specimen.
Representative tissue is taken for further possible studies.
