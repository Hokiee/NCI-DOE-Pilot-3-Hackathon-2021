SPECIMEN INFORMATION

1. Axillary contents.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

"Right axillary contents". An irregular mass of fat and muscle, 180 x 170 x
80mm. Also included within the specimen bucket are four separate small jars
and these will be described separately.

Onejar is labelled specimen 1 and contains a grossly enlarged ﬁrm lymph

node, 50 x 35 x 35mm. The cut surface of the node contains a pale and
haemorrhagic tumour mass completely replacing normal node tissue. There is a
small amount of fat attached and within the fat is a separate 7tumour nodule
which may represent a second node or extranodal spread. The second focus of
?extranodal spread was identiﬁed 15 x 10 x 5mm.

A. Main mass and second focus of ?extranodal spread.
B. ?second node.

Second red top jar is labelled "specimen ll" and contains a single ﬁrm pale / (l A , 0 /3
lymph node and a small amount of attached fat, 30 x 20 x 15mm. The node cut
surface is tan and focally haemorrhagic. No macroscopic extranodal spread W N05 9024/3

MICROSCOPIC REPORT

"Right axillary contents". Metastatic malignant melanoma is present in eleven
of the 16 lymph nodes identiﬁed. There is extranodal spread (A) and focal
