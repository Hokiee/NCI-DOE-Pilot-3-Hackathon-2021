J. LEFT UPPER LOBE

Received fresh is 3 266g, 18 x 11 x 4.5 cm left upper lobectomy specimen. The pleural surface is
red-purple, intact and remarkable for a palpable mass. This area is inked black. The bronchial
margin is shaved and submitted in F8]. Nine periubronchial lymph nodes are grossly identiﬁed
ranging from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm to 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The Specimen is serially sectioned to
reveal a 3.5 x 2.8 x 2.5 cm tan white ﬁlm mass with central necrosis, 2.2 cm from the bronchial
margin and 0.1 cm from the pleural surface. The remaining lung parenchyma is grossly

unremarkable. Representatively submitted:
FSJ: bronchial margin

12-15: mass with pleural surface

J6: 5 lymph nodes

I7: 4 lymph nodes

“wok/ed parcnchyma

DIAGNOSIS:
A. LYMPH NODE, 4R, EXCISION:
— NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED IN ONE LYMPH NODE (0! l).

B. LYMPH NODE, 4L, EXCISION:
- NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED 1N ONE LYMPH NODE (0/1).

C. LYMPH NODE, LEVEL 7, EXCISION:
- NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED IN ONE LYMPH NODE (0/ 1).

D. LYMPH NODE, 2R, EXCISION:
— NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED IN ONE LYMPH NODE (0/1).

E. LYMPH NODE, 2L, EXCISION:
~ NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED IN ONE LYMPH NODE (0/1).

F. LYMPH NODE, LEVEL 5, EXCISION:
— NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED IN ONE LYMPH NODE (0/1).

G. LYMPH NODE, LEVEL 5, EXCISION:
— NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED IN ONE LYMPH NODE (OH).

H. LYMPH NODE, LEVEL 6, EXCISION:
— NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED IN ONE LYMPH NODE (0/ 1).

I. LYMPH NODE, LEVEL 6, EXCISION:
- NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED IN ONE LYMPH NODE (0/ 1).

I. LUNG, LEFT UPPER LOBE, LOBECTOMY:

— ADENOCARCINOMA, POORLY DIFFERENTIATED.
~ 3.5 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION.
- 2.8 X 2.5 CM IN ADDITIONAL DIMENSIONS.
- THE PLEURAL SURFACE IS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
- THE BRONCHIAL MARGIN IS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
- NO DEFINITE ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IDENTIFIED.
— THE NON-NEOPLASTIC LUNG CONTAINS EMPHYSEMATOUS CHANGES.
— NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED IN SIX PERIBRONCHIAL LYMPH NODES (0/6).

COMMENT: The tumor in this case is 11101 hologieally similar to the patient's previously
diagnosed brain metastasis—
