‘ Intervally increased in size enhancing left
temporoparietal lesion, with maximal transaxial dimensions of approximately
2.3 x 2.2 cm, previously 1.4 X 1.4 cm. New central necrosis versus hemorrhage.
Stable or slightly increased secondary rim of cloudlike enhancement about'the
primary enhancing lesion. Stable local mass effect but no significant midline
shift.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Brain tissue (AE1)". Received fresh for frozen section is a 2.6 x 1.7 x 1
cm portion of soft pinkutan tissue with diffuse erythema. The specimen is
partially frozen as representative AFI and frozen section remnant submitted in
block Al. Additional representative sections submitted in blocks A2—3
(approximately 75% specimen submitted).

INTRA OE'ERAT IVE CONSULTATION:

A. "Brain tissue":AFlu glioblastoma —

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

Microscopic examination shows brain infiltrated by a malignant astrocytic
neoplasm characterized by cytologic pleomorphism, mitotic figures,
microvascular changes and pseudopalisading necrosis.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. "BRAIN TISSUE" (CRANIOTOMY):
GLIOBLASTOMA (WHO GRADE IV) .

FISH INTERPRETATION SUMMARY:
CHROMOSOME 7 CENTROMERE - POLYSOMY (82% OF TUMOR CELLS EXHIBIT POLYSOMY)
EGFR — AMPLIFICATION {93% OF TUMOR CELLS EXHIBIT AMPLIFICATION)

CHROMOSOME 10 CENTROMERE — CENTROMERE LOSS (61% OF TUMOR CELLS EXHIBIT LOSS)

PTEN — ALLELIC LOSS {71% OF TUMOR CELLS EXHIBIT LOSS)

9p2l e LOSS (80% OF TUMOR CELLS EXHIBIT LOSS)

CHROMOSOME 9 CENTROMERE — CENTROMERE LOSS (54% OF TUMOR CELLS EXHIBIT LOSS)

4 OF 4 ABNORMAL MARKERS AND 9P21 EXHIBITS LOSS.

COMMENT: A MULTIVARIATE SURVIVAL ANALYSIS OP - PATIENTS WITH GLIOBLASTOMAS
REVEALS THAT THE HAZARD OF SHORT SURVIVAL AMONG PATIENTS WITH 0—2 ABNORMAL
MARKERS (OUT OF 4) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THAT FOUND WITH PATIENTS WITH
4 ABNORMAL MARKERS EVEN AFTER ADJUSTMENT FOR AGE EFFECT.

BOTH FISH AND IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY FOR PTEN REVEAL SIMILAR FINDINGS INDICATIVE
OF LOSS OF PTEN STATUS.
