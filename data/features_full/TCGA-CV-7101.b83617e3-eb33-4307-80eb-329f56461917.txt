SUPPLEMENTALREPORT
COMMENT:

This suppiementai report is issued to provide resuits foliowing
decalcification of additional sections.

Sections of the ossified thyroid cartila e adjacent to the tumor show the
tumor to invade compietely through the t yroid cartiiage into the anterior
soft tissue, where there is perineurai invasion in proximity to the right Tobe
of the thyroid. ‘

COMMENT
Sections of thyroid cartilage will be examined following decalcification,
and a supplemental report w1ll follow.

GROSSDESCNPNON
(A) ANTERIOR COMMISSURE — A fragmented portion of pink—tan soft tissu x
0.3 x 0.2 cm). Submitted entire y in one cassette for frozen section.

(B) POSTERIOR WALL CF E5 — A minute pink—tan mucosal lined soft tissue

fragment measuring 0 0.2 cm. Bisected and submitted in toto for
frozen section as B.

(C) TOTAL LARYNGECTOMY AND NEAR TOTAL THYROIDECTOMY - A larynx, hyoi ,
and anterior 53ft tissue (9.2 x 6.5 x 6.0 cm) with subtotal thyroidectomy (4.5
x 3.5 x 1.5 cm

There is a flat, ulcerated tumor of the mucosa of the right true cord (2.4
x 1. 5 x 1.2 cm). The tumor extends 1.7 cm below the right ventricle. There
is ulceration which crosses the anterior commissure (to an extent of 0.4 cm
across the midline). There is necrotic tumor in the paraglottic space on the
right. The tumor is 2. 7 cm away from the inferior (tracheal) margin of
resection. Margins are grossly free of tumor. Thyroid gland and soft tissue
are unremarkable. Representative portions of tumor are submitted for flow
cytometry and investigational studies.

SECTION CODE. C1— C4, mucosal margin submitted from right piriform sinus
around epiglottis to left piriform sinus (frozen section); C5, inferior
tracheal margin; C6, thyroid; C7, posterior commissure; C8, anterior
commissure; C9, right aryepiglottic fold nearest tumor; C10, epiglottis; C11,
right posterior glottis and paraglottic space; C12, right mid glottis and
paraglottic space; C13, right anterior glottis; C14, left anterior glottis;
C15, left mid glottis and periglottic_ space; C16, left posterior lottis,
para- glottic space; C17, pre— epi ; C18, one possible Iymph node
from pre- epiglottic soft tissue.
