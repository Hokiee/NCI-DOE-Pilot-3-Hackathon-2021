ADDENDUM
MOLECULAR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY TESTING:

Part 2:
Mutations in BRAF, NRA561, HRASB1, KRAS12/13, and RET/PTC1, RE T/PTC3 and PAXE/PPARg rearrangements
NOT Identified.

NOTE:
Nucleic acids were extracted In the amount sufficient for testing. Ampliﬁcation of GAPDH and KRT7 controls was
acceptable.

BACKGROUND.
Mutations In either BRAF or RAS genes or RET/PTC rearrangements are found In more than 70% of papillary thyroid carCInOmas
(1) BRAF VGODEt mutation has been associated with more aggressive behavior of papillary carcinoma (2) and may be

used for preoperative risk stratiﬁcation of patients with papillary thyroid cancer (3). Mutations in the RAS genes or PAX8/PPARg
rearrangement occur in ~70% of follicular thyroid carcinomas and with lower frequency in oncocytic (Hiirthle cell) carcinomas (4).
Based on a recent prospective study of FNA samples (5) and our experience at UPMC, detection of BRAF mutations and

RE T/PTC and PAX8/PPARg rearrangements in. thyroid FNA samples correlated with ~1DO% probabIIity of cancer, whereas
detection of RAS mutation correlated with malignancy in 83-87% of cases and with benign follicular adenoma or hyperplastic
nodule in 13-17%. However. single casas of false-positive BRAF mutation detection in thyroid FNA samples have been reported In
the literature (6) and therefore the re5uits of molecular testing should be interpreted in combination with clinical information
imaging. and cytology.
