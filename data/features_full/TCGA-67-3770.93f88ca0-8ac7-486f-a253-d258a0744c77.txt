-n.,ur'GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. The specimen is submitted fresh for frozen section as ”level BR“ and
consists of a red black lymph node measuring 2 cm in greatest dimension
which is submitted in toto, l {1) labeled ”FSP".

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: Node, negative for metastatic tumor. -

B. The specimen is submitted fresh but not for frozen section as "right
upper lobe" and consists of a 121 gram (formalin fixed), 13 x 9 X 2.2 Cm
lung lobe received multiple stapled margins measuring 4 to 8.5 cm in
length, a 2.5 cm in length stapled bronchial margin and adjacent stapled
vasculature margin measuring 0.6 to 1.2 cm in diameter. The pleural
surface is red purple to gray and focally dull and dusky with an
underlying palpable firm area. The pleural surface overlying this area is
inked blue. The stapled resection margins are removed and the underlying
parenchyma inked black. Shave sections of the bronchial and vasculature
margins are taken. The lobe is serially sectioned to reveal a 2.8 x 1.5 x
1 cm ill defined white tan to gray firm mass which grossly appears to abut
the blue inked pleural surface, measuring 2.2 cm from the closest black
inked parenchyma underlying the stapled margin and 2 cm from the hilum.
The remaining parenchyma consists of pink tan to brown spongy homogenous
grossly unremarkable parenchyma. No other discrete masses or nodularities
are grossly identified. Also identified at the hilum is a 1 cm in
greatest dimension gray black possible lymph node which is submitted
entirely intact. Representative sections are submitted, multiple {8) as

follows:

1: Vasculature and bronchial margins

2: Greatest dimension of mass

3: Masa with closest blue inked pleural surface

4: Additional section of mass with pleural surface and
uninvolved parenchyma

5: Perpendicular section of the closest stapled resection
margin

6: Dull dusky pleura and underlying parenchyma

7: Grossly unremarkable pleura and parenchyma away from
mass

8: One possible intact lymph node

C. The specimen is submitted fresh as "anterior hilar node" and consists
of a soft to moderately firm red brown node measuring 2 x l x 0.3 cm. The
specimen is bisected and submitted in toto, 2 (l).

D. The specimen is submitted fresh as "lobar node" and consists of
multiple soft red black nodes measuring 2.5 x 2 x 0.5 cm in aggregate.

The specimen is wrapped in tissue paper and submitted in toto, multiple
(2) labeled "1" and “2".

E. The specimen is submitted fresh as “level 7" and consists of a soft
red black node measuring 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is
wrapped in tissue paper and submitted in toto, 1 (l).
