1. The specimen container is labeled with the patients name and as "Uterus, cervix. right tube. and ovarY'. The
specimen consists of a total hysterectomy and right salpingooophorectomy received fresh. The entire specimen weighs
818.5 g in the fresh state. The uterus and cenrlx measure 16 cm SI x 9.6 cm ML 9 cm AP. The cervix has a maximum
diameter of 3.5 cm. The right fallopian tube measures 6.5 x 0.4 cm. The right ovary measures 3.6.x 3.5.x 2.5 cm.

The ectocervix (3.8 X 4.1) cm is covered by smooth glistening mucosa. The external os is 0.9 cm and is slit-shaped. The
endocervicel canal is 2.5 cm in length. The endometrial Ilvity (12.5 cm SI x 5.7 cm comu to comu) has a pink tan
endometrium 0.1- 0.2 cm in maximum thickness. The endometrium is not easily identiﬁed as it is obliterated by the
tumor. There is a 10.5 x 8.5 cm exophytic tumor in the anterior and posterior endo—myometrium. The tumor appears to
be extending into the outer serosal surface which shows multiple iii-deﬁned nodules that are hard In consistency. Cut
sections through the tumor show tan—white to yellow, ﬁrm, mass lesion with focal areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. The
tumor also appears to invade the full thickness of the myometrium anterioriy and posterioriy and extend into the lower
uterine segment. The tumor comes to within 0.9 cm from the junction of the lower uterine segment and endocervical
canal posterioriy and 0.7cm anterioriy. The mass does not involve the cervix grossly.

The myometrium measures 3.8 cm In thickness. The serosa demonstrates multiple ﬁbrous adhesions and tumor nodules
which are mostly located on the anterior, and to a lesser extent on the posterior surface.

The fallopian tube has a ﬁmbriated end. There is a serosal tumor deposit adjacent to the tube. The right ovary is partly
cystic with light yellowish ﬂuid. Tissue is stored frozen. Representative sections:

1A-1C longitudinal section through the anterior cervix, endocervicei canal, lower uterine segment with relation to tumor
10-1 F longitudinal section through the posterior cervix. endocenrlwl Canal, lower uterine segment with relation to tUmor
16-1 H anterior full thickness section of tumor

2. The specimen is labeled with the patients name and as ”left obturator node“. it consists of a portion of nodular tissue
measuring 6.1 by 4.7 x 2.4 cm. Cut surface through the lymph node show a tan-white to yellow ﬁrm mass with focal
hemonhage and necrosis and ﬁrmer white areas at the edge. Representative sections are submitted in ZA-E

3. The specimen is labeled with the patients name and as "right pelvic node". it consists of a portion of ﬁbroadlpose
tissue measuring 2.2 by 1.8 x 0.3 cm. One lymph node is identiﬁed which measures 2.2 x 1.8 x 0.3 cm and submitted in
toto.

ISA-33 one lymph node bisected

4. The specimen is labeled with the patients name and as "left pelvic node“. It consists of a portion of fibroadipose tissue
measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm. One lymph node is identiﬁed which measures 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm, submitted in toto.
4A-B one lymph node bisected

5. The specimen is labeled with the patients name and as "right para-aortic node“. It consists of two portions of
ﬁbroadlpose tissue measuring 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.2 and 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm. Two lymph nodes ranging from 0.8 to 1 cm are
identiﬁed. submitted in toto.

5A-8 one lymph node each bisected

6. The specimen is labeled with the patients name and as ”right obturator node". it consists of a portion of ﬁbroadipose
tissue measuring 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm. One lymph node is identiﬁed and measures 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm, submitted in toto.
' 6A one lymph node bisected

7. The specimen is labeled with the patients name and as "para—aortic node”. it consists of a multlnoduiar ﬁbroadipose
tissue measuring 8.8 x 6.9 cm x 2.8 cm. Multiple nodes ranging from 2.5 to 3.5 cm are identiﬁed. Cut sections through
these nodes show tan-white to yellow ﬁrm nodules with areas of hemorrhage and fat necrosis. it seems that these nodes
are fused together, the largest of which measures 3.5 cm on cut surface. More serial cuts show two more lymph nodes
measuring 1 cm and 1.4 cm. Representative sections are submitted.

8. The specimen is labeled with the patients name and as "lett common lilac node“. it consists 013 separate tissue
specimens measuring 4 x 2.5 x 1.8. 2.5 x 0.9 x 0.4, and 1.8 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm. Three lymph nodes are identified and measure
4 x 2.5 x 1.8, 2.5 x 0.9 x 0.4. 1.6 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm. Representative sections are submitted

8A—B one lymph node serially sectioned

9. The specimen is labeled with the patients name and as 'Omentum '. lt cbnsiste of ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 10.5

Representative sections are submitted.
