GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in seven parts.

Part 1 is tabeled with the patients name lnttlals’and “left zone #1". received fresh. It consists of a portion of yellow, tabulated
adipose tissue measuring 9.0 x 3.8 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. The submandlbular salivary gland is identified, measuring 4.2
x 2.2 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. It is unremarkable. Several tymph nodes are identified, ranging In size from 0.2 up to 0.8 cm
in greatest diameter. The specimen is represented in three cassettes:

1A — submandlbular gland

18 and 1C H lymph nodes.

Part 2 is labeled with the pailent's name, initials ‘and ”right neck tevet 1"m received fresh. It consists of an irregular portion of
yellow, iobulated adipose tissue and rubbery to firm submandibutar salivary gland. The specimen measures 5.8 x 4.8 x 1.8 cm in
greatest dimension. The submandibutar gland measures 3.8 x 1.8 x 1.8 cm i greatest dlmenston. On section, cut surface Is
yellow to white and ﬁrm upon palpation. Several lymph nodes (four) are idenlltlect, ranging In size from 0.3 up to 0.8 cm in
diameter. The specimen is represented in Me cassettes:

2A — submahdibutar gtand

25 L lymph nodes.

Part 3 is labeled with the patient's name initials . and "ieti neck zones 2. 3 and 4“, received fresh. It consists of an irregular
portion of tan-brown. yellow, Iobulated adi Jose tissue, partially covered by tanrbrown fascia. measuring 10.0 x 7.2 x ‘i .8 cm In
greatest dimension. No parotld gtand Is irlentttled. Serial secttons reveal muttipla lymph nodes, ranging In size from 0.2 up to 2.2
cm in diameter. The largest tymph node Is identified in level 3. The specimen is represented in eight cassettes:

3A and 3B — level 2

BC lI‘lt‘Lt SE a ievel 3. cassette 3E contains the largest lymph node

3F thru 3H — level 4 lymph nodes.

Part 4 is labeled with the patients name initials ’ and "ti ht neck zones 2. 3 and 4", received fresh. it consists of an Irregular
portion of tan-brown, yellow. iobulatect atltpose tissue, part ally covered by tan—brown fascia, Measuring l'l.0 x 9.8 x LEI Cm in

greatest dimension. No parotid gland is identiﬁed. On sectioning, several lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging in size from 0.3 up
to 1.1 cm in main diameter. The largest lymph node is identiﬁed in tevei 3. The specimen is represented in seven cassettes:
4A-4B -— lymph nodes, ievel 2

40—45 — lymph nodes, levet 3

4Fu4G u lymph nodes, level 4. .

Part 5 is labeled with the patient’s name, inttials.and “left lingual nerve" for lntraoperative consultation. It consists of two
fragments of ten brown soft tissue, measuring in aggregate 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm in dimension. The specimen is submitted in total in
one cassette labeled 5A.

Part 6 is labeted with the patient’s name, inliiais'and “right lingual nerve" for inlraoperallve Consultation. it consists of an
irregular portion of tissue measuring 0.? x 0.5 x 0.1 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen issubmllted in total in one cassette
labeted 6A.

Part 7 is labeled with the patient's name. initials 'and “anterior composite resection" and is received fresh for intraoperative
consultation. it consists of mandibulectomy measuring 7.5 cm in width by 5.2 cm (anterior to posterior) by 3.2 cm (superior to
interior). A portion of mandibular bone measures 9.5 cm in length by2.4 cm in diameter (left side) and 2.1 cm in diameter (right
side). A multinodular tumor is identiﬁed. 3.? x 3.5 x 3.5 cm in greatest dimension. The lesion grossly appears to involve the
mucosa and is identiﬁed 0.5 cm from the left gingival buccat margin. it is also identiﬁed at more than 1.0 cm from other mucosa!
margins. A deep soft edge as Well as the posterior edge consist of portion of tan-brown serrated muscle and appear unremarkable
(no tumor identiﬁed). The posterior soft margin is inked black and the inferior soft tissue edge is inked blue. The specimen is
seriatty cross sectioned and reveals tumor close to the posterior soft tissue margin (0.2 cm). Also tumor grossly permeates and
invades the mandibular bone (cassette 7H). The specimen is represented in fourteen cassettes:

7A — left posterior margin

78 -» left anterior glngtvai buccal margin

TC — right anterior glngival buccal margin

YD — right posterior

7E w left posterior

7F H right bone margin

76 ~ left bone margin

7H — tumor permeatingllnvadlng bone
