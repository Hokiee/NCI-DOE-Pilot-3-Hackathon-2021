Report : GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. The specimen is received in a container labeled with the
name of the patient and labeled as kidney, left. The
specimen consists of a kidney and attached perinephric fat
which measures en bloc 21 x 15 x 8 cm and weighs 930 g.‘ The
ureter and vascular margins of resection are submitted in
block 1. The kidney stripped of fat measures 11 x 7 x 5 cm
and weighs 184 g. Sectioning into the kidney shows a.few
large cortical cysts measuring up to 4.5 cm and an oval‘
golden yellow focally hemorrhagic mass measuring 6.0 x 3.0 x
2.5 cm. The mass bulges against the capsule but is not
grossly adherent to the capsule. A section of the capsule
overlying the mass is submitted in block 2. SectiOns'of the
mass are submitted in blocks 3—7. The pelvis and calices
are not grossly dilated. The cortex averages 0.8 cm. ”A
random section of kidney is submitted in block 8. Sections
from the cortical cysts are submitted in block 9.

Sectioning through the attached fat shows a portion of
adrenal gland which measures 6.0 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm. Sectioning
through the adrenal shows no discrete masses.

Representative sections are submitted in blocks 10—12.

B. The specimen is received in a container labeled with the
name of the patient and labeled as adrenal gland, left. The
specimen consists of an irregular piece of yellow fibrofatty
tissue measuring 4.2 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm. Sectioning through the
specimen shows a portion of adrenal gland measuring 2.0

cm. Representative sections are submitted.

C. The specimen is received in a container labeled with the
name of the patient and labeled as spleen. The specimen
conSists of a 209 g spleen which measures 10.0 x 7.0 x 5.5
