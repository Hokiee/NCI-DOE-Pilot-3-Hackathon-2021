biopsy.

Gross Description:
Received are five apprOpriately labeled containers.

Container A:

Adnexa: present and attached

Weight: 235 grams

Shape: pear-shaped

Dimensions:

height: 12.2 cm

anterior to posterior width: 5.4 cm

breadth at fundus: 7.5 cm

Serosa: smooth, pink/tan, and glistening

Cervix:

ectocervix: white/pink, firm, and smooth

endocervix: tan/red and trabeculated, with a 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.5 mm
endocervical polyp noted on the anterior side, and cystic
distention of the posterior endocervix

length of endocervical canal: 2.7 cm

-Endomyometrium:

length of endometrial cavity: 7.0 cm

width of endometrial cavity at fundus: 6.5 cm

tumor findings:

dimensions: 12.5 cm along the anterior wall, extending over the
fundus and down the posterior by 6.5 cm wide x 3.0 cm in depth

appearance: white/tan, soft, polypoid, and fungating; there are
areas of hemorrhage within the mass

location and extent: The mass involves the anterior, fundal, and
posterior walls of the endometrium. It fills and distends the
endometrial cavity. A few areas of endometrium appeared sparred,
especially the posterior lower uterine segment.

myometrial invasion: The tumor appears to invade into the inner
one-half of the myometrium.

thickness of myometrial wall at deepest gross invasion: 1.2 cm
other findings or comments: Multiple intramural nodules ranging
from 0.3 X 0.3 x 0.2 cm to 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm are noted. All are
rubbery, white, and whorled.
