PERTINENT CLINICAL HISTORX: HEP B (+).

 

A. The specimen is submitted fresh as "right trisegment of liver" and
consists of a lobe of liver weighing 1,840 grams and measuring 23 x 15 x
10 cm. The capsule is purple tan, focally hemorrhagic and exhibits a
large lobulated area comprising approximately 50% of the surface.
Sectioning reveals a large well circumscribed pink yellow tumor measuring
15 x 13.5 x 9 cm which abuts the capsule and approaches to within 1 cm.of
the inked (green) surgical margin. The uninvolved parenchyma is yellow
tan to pink red in color. Representative sections are submitted, 8 (8)
labeled "1" to "8":

Cassettes l and 2: Uninvolved parenchyma including surgical margin
Cassette 3: Tumor surgical margin
Cassettes 4-8: Representative tumor (capsule black) 3

Please note: A portion of tissue is submitted for TCGA research. Gross
photographs have been taken.

B. The specimen is submitted fresh as "portal lymph node" and consists of
a firm pink nodule measuring 1.5 x 1 x 1 cm. The specimen is sectioned
and submitted in toto, 3 (l).

C. The specimen is submitted in formalin as "gallbladder" and consists of
a gallbladder measuring 7 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm.‘ The serosa is gray green and
smooth. The lumen contains dark green thick bile. Calculi are not
grossly identified. The wall measures 0.2 cm in thickness. The mucosa is
dark green and granular. The cystic duct appears dilated but does not
contain calculi and measures 0.7 cm in diameter. There is an adjacent 0.6
cm gray tan node. Representative sections are submitted, 3 (l).

D. The specimen is submitted fresh as "left adrenal gland" and consists
of a moderately firm.circumscribed.mass weighing 68 grams and measuring
7 x 5 x 4 cm. There is a small amount of attached adipose tissue.
Sectioning reveals a soft pink white lobulated circumscribed mass with a
thin rim of apparent adrenal measuring up to 0.4 cm in thickness.
Representative sections are submitted, 3 (2). The surgical margins are
marked with black dye. Please note: Gross photographs have been taken.
