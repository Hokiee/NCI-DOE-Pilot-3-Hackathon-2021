6: SP: Right common iliac node:

7: SP: Left common iliac nodes

8: SP: Left para—aortic lymph nodes I

9: SP: Right para-aortic lymph nodes

DIAGNOSIS:

1) UTERUS, CERVIX, BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES; TOTAL
HYSTERECTOMY AND BILATERAL SALPINGO— —OOPHORECTOMY:
- ADENOCARCINOMA OF ENDOMETRIUM, PAPILLARY SEROUS TYPE.
THE TUMOR INVADES TO > HALF OF MYOMETRIUM. THE MAXIMAL
THICKNESS OF MYOMETRIAL INVASION IS 20 MM. THE THICKNESS OF
THE MYOMETRIUM IN THE AREA OF MAXIMAL TUMOR INVASION IS 23
MM. VASCULAR INVASION IS PRESENT. THE ENDOMETRIUM SHOWS
THE FOLLOWING ABNORMALITY(IES): ENDOMETRIAL POLYP INVOLVED
BY CARCINOMA. THE MYOMETRIUM SHOWS THE FOLLOWING
ABNORMALITY(IES): LEIOMYOMA (1 CM). LEIOMYOMA (7 CM)
INVOLVED BY ENDOMETRIAL CARCINOMA. ALL ADNEXAE ARE
UNREMARKABLE.

NOTE: In: ORIGINAL BIOPSY — IS REVIEWED. THE CARCINOMA

PRESENT IN IS SIMILAR TO THAT SEEN IN THE HYSTERECTOMY

SPECIMEN. MARKED CRUSH ARTIPACT PRESENT IN THE ORIGINAL BIOPSY
IMPAIRS ADEQUATE EVALUATION OF TUMOR TYPE.

6) LYMPH NODES. RIGHT COMMON ILIAC; DISSECTION:
- BENIGN LYMPH NODE (0/1). NO TUMOR SEEN.

- BENIGN LYMPH NODE (0/1). NO TUMOR SEEN.

8) LYMPH NODES, LEFT PARA-AORTIC; DISSECTION:
— BENIGN LYMPH NODE (0/1). NO TUMOR SEEN.

9) LYMPH NODES, RIGHT PARA-AORTIC; DISSECTION:
- METASTATIC CARCINOMA IN THE FORM OF RARE SUBCAPSULAR
CLUSTERS OF TUMOR CELLS EVIDENT ON HE SECTIONS IS
IDENTIFIED IN ONE OF FIVE LYMPH NODES (1/5).
IMMUNOPEROXIDASE STAINS SHOW THAT TUMOR CELLS ARE POSITIVE
FOR KERATIN (CAMS-2) AND NEGATIVE FOR LCA (CD45). STAINS FOR
KERATIN AE1:AE3 ARE NOT CONTRIBUTORY. THESE FINDINGS AND THE
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES OF THE EPITHELIAL CLUSTERS SUPPORT THE
DIAGNOSIS OF METASTATIC CARCINOMA.
