B. Omental lymph node
C. Transverse and descending colon includes site of (procurement)
colostomy

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Cancer splenic flexure.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. [The] Specimen is received unfixed labeled "transverse

colostomy" and consists of a colostomy takedown specimen
measuring 6 x 4.5 x 3 cm. On cut section, the mucosal surface is
tan with some focal red disc 0 ation near the skin margin.
Sections after fixation.

B. Specimen is re d in formalin labeled "omental lymph

node" and con s s of a yellow piece of tissue measuring
0.9 x 0.4 x 0.5 cm.

C. The speci is received unfixed labeled "transverse

and descending colon" and consists of two separate segments
of large bowel. One segment has stapled margins and measures 11.5 x
approximately 4 cm in diameter. This segment has a central area of
induration and narrowing on the serosal surface. The abnormal area
is 3 cm from the nearest stapled margin. There is abundant
pericolonic fat and the entire specimen is up to 15 cm in diameter.
The other segment of bowel has stapled margins and measures 10 cm in
length and 3.5 cm in diameter. It has adjacent pericolonic fat and
omentum and this portion of the specimen is up to 21 cm in diameter.
There is a firm area that appears to be an omental fat that measures
3 cm in greatest dimension. On cut section, the omental lesion is
tan-green and measures 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. Segments of
bowel are open with single incisions on the antimesenteric surface.
There is a fungating tumor in the descending colon that has a
polypoid appearance and appears to be circumferential. It measures
6.5 x 5.5 x approximately 1 cm. Portions of the specimen are taken
for research purposes. Sections after fixation and clearing.

Block summary: 1,2 transverse colon margins of resection; 3
transverse colon; 4 omentum; 5-8 transverse colon lymph nodes; 9.10
descending colon margins; 11 cobblestone mucosa; 12-15 tumor; 16-26
pericolonic lymph nodes.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

A. Benign reactive changes are seen.

B. A single lymph node is negative for malignancy.

C.
Tumor type: Colonic adenocarcinoma
Tumor grade: 1 of 3
Tumor size: 6.5
Distance to nearest margin: 3
Level of penetration: Carcinoma penetrates into
pericolonic soft tissue
Margins of resection: Negative for malignancy

Vascular invasion: Absent
Host response: Mild chronic inflammation, focally Crohn's
like
Attached lymph nodes: There is no evidence of malignancy
in any of
34 lymph nodes in the descending
colon or
12 lymph nodes in the transverse
colon.
Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: Absent
pTNM Stage: T3 NO
Other findings: Omental fat necrosis. Transverse colon
unremarkable. Cobblestone mucosa in the
descending colon is lymphoid hyperplasia.
2,3,5

DIAGNOSIS
A. Transverse colon colostomy, takedown: Benign reactive changes
B. Omental lymph node, biopsy: A single lymph node is negative for
malignancy

C. Colon, transverse and descending, resection:
Well—differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma of the descending
colon.

Note: The margins of resection are negative for malignancy.
There is no evidence of malignancy in any of 12 transverse
colon lymph nodes or 34 descending colon lymph nodes.
