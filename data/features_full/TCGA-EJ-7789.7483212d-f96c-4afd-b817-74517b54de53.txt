A. PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA. ACINAR TYPE, MULTIFOCAL:

a. DOMINANT MODULE LOCATED IN THE RIGHT AND LEFT MID .... BASE PROSTATE (WITH A PROMINENT
ANTERIOR COMPONENT) IS APROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA. GLEASON SCORE 4+3=?, WITH A
PROMINENT TERTIARY GLEASON PATTERN 5 COMPONENT. GLEASON PATTERNS 415
COMPONENTS COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY ?0% OF THE DOMINANT TUMOR VOLUME (8ee comment).

b. ADDITIONAL SEPARATE SMALL PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMAS RANGING FROM GLEASON SCORE
3+3=6 TO 41-337.

CARCINOMA (DOMINANT NODULE) HAS A GREATEST NODULAR DIAMETER OF 1.9 CM IN ONE HISTOLOGIC
SECTION (SLIDE 3FF).

CARCINOMA INVOLVES APPROXIMATELY 15% OF THE EXAMINED PROSTATE VOLUME.

E8TABLISHED EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IS PRESENT IN THE RIGHT ANTERIOR BASE (SLIDE 3P] AND FOCAL
EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION ls PRESENT IN THE LEFT ANTERIOR BASE (SLIDE 35).

RARE PERINEURAL INVASION IS IDENTIFIED (SLIDE 3P).

NO ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.
