LYMPH-VASCULAR INVASION: Not identified

PATHOLOGIC STAGING: Primary tumor: pT3

Number of lymph nodes examined: 13
Number of lymph nodes involved: 7
Distance metastasis: Not applicable

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh for frozen section labeled with the patient's name and ”retroperitoneal
node“ is a 1.7 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm ovoid tan lymph node. On cross section. the node has a pale
grayish—tan color and focally contains an area suspicious for a metastasis. A
representative section is submitted in block A1 for frozen section. A cytologic touch prep
is prepared for Diff—Quik stain. The remainder of the tissue is submitted in block A2.

8. Received fresh for tissue banking and labeled with the patient's name and “transverse
colon”. Received is a 12.5 cm segment of large bowel. The large bowel is received with a
22.0 x 12.0 x 1.7 cm portion of yellow. lobulated, omental adipose. The attached omentum
makes the specimen consistent with transverse colon. The segment of bowel is received
unoriented betwaen proximal and distal. There is a focal area of serosal puckering with
"creeping fat”. The area is inked blue and the bowel is opened to have a centrally
ulcerated. 4.5 x 4.0 cm tumor mass. The tumor mass is nearly circumferential and has
raised. rolled borders. The tumor comes to within 5 cm of one margin and 2.5 cm of the
opposite margin. The tumor diffusely involves the bowel wall and focally extends through
the bowel wall to superficially invade the underlying yellow adipose. The tumor focally
appears to abut the inked serosa. There is 2.5 cm of yellow adipose between the tumor and
the mesenteric fat resection margin. The surrounding mucosa is unremarkable with normal,
tan folds. The fat is sectioned and scant. possible lymph nodes are identified.
Representative sections are sampled as labeled:

Bl—BZ — margins

B3 — perpendicular sections of nearest radial fat margin

B4 — representative sections of omental adipose

BS~B7 - representative sections of tumor to include areas of deepest
invasion and tumor to serosa

88-89 — whole lymph nodes

BIO — one lymph node bisected

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The slides are examined and evaluated.
