 

Clinical Dia nosis & Histo :
‘Ithmetastaticrenalcellcarcinoma. — Cyloreductive right nephrectomy.

Specimens Submitted:
1: SP: Portion of right adrenal F
2: SP: Right kidney and adrena gland I

3: SP: Hilar lymph nodes. right -

 

 

DIAGNOSIS:

1) PORTION OF RIGHT ADRENAL GLAND; EXCISION:
- FRAGMENTS OF BENIGN ADRENAL TISSUE.

2) KEDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND. REGHT; RADICAL NEPI—IRECTOMY:
— RENAL CELL CARCINOMA. CLEAR CELL TYPE, NUCLEAR GRADE IIIIV.
- THE PATTERN OF GROWTH IS SOLEDAND ACINAR.
— THE TUMOR'S GREATEST DIAMETER IS 9.0 CM.
- THE TUMOR IS CONFINED WITHIN THE RENAL CAPSULE.
- THE TUMOR EXTENDS INTO THE RENAL PELVIS AND INVOLVES SINUS ADIPOSE TISSUE.
— NO INVASION OF THE RENAL VEIN IS IDENTIFIED. HOWEVER, TUMOR CELL CLUSTERS IN SMALL VEINS ARE
IDENTIFIED.
- THE NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY SHOWS INTERSTITIAL CHRONIC INFLAMMATION.
— THE ADRENAL GLAND IS UNREMARKABLE.

3) LYMPH NODES, RIGHT HILAR; EXCISION:
— TWO BENIGN LYMPH NODES (0f2).

 

Gross Descriition:

1) The specimen is received fresh, iabeled "Podion of Right Adrenal". It consists of a small segment of adrenal tissue with a
small amount of adipose tissue attached measuring 2.0 x 2.0 x 0.8 cm In total. A staple line is attached to the specimen. The

specimen is sectioned and entirely submitted.

Summary of Seclions:

A—adrenal gland

2) The specimen is received fresh, labeled “Right Kidney and Adrenal Gland". It consists of a radical nephrectomy
specimen weighing in total 820 grams and it has a large amount of perinephric adipose tissue attached. A portion of adrenal
gland is identiﬁed measuring 3.0 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. A segment of proximal ureter Is also identiﬁed measuring 5.0 cm in length and
0,3 cm in diameter. Grossly. the ureteral resection margin and the renal hilar vessel margin are free of tumor. The specimen is
bivalved from lateral to medial aspect to reveal a kidney measuring 12.0 x 10.0 x 8.0 cm in which a large tumor mass measuring
9.0 x 8.0 x 7.0 cm is identiﬁed, and is replacing almost the entire kidney with a small portion of uninvolved renal parenchyma In the
inferior pole of the kidney. The tumor mass has a variegated cut surface ranging from tan-white. focally hemorrhagic area to
gelatinOUs and multilocuiated cystic area. The tumor mass grossly extends to but not through the renal capsule. Grossly. tumor
mass extensively replaces the renal parenchyma and renal pelvis with focal evidence of invading into the renal pelvis. No gross
evidence of renal vein invasion is identiﬁed; A portion of tumor is submitted for TPS. Gross photograph taken. Representative

sections are submitted.

Summary of Sections:

A — adrenal gland

UM _ urethral margin

VM~ hilar vessel margin

TP — tumor invading renal pelvis

T — tumor mass and adjacent renal capsule and renal parenchyma-

K -— uninvolved renal parenchyma ' .'

3) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled ”Hilar Lymph Nodes, Right". it consists of multiple fragments of tan-yellow
adipose tissue aggregating to 3.5 cm. in the adipose tissue. multiple presumptive lymph nodes are identified. The largest lymph
node measures 0.6 cm. Lymph nodes are submitted.
