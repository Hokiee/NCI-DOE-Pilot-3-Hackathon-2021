Gross Description: Cervical Tumor is ill - margins ocuppying cervix and invasion of uterus, with
10x8x8cm in size, solid and ﬁrm and white-gray surface.

Bladder wall and rectal wall are inﬁltrated by tumor to form masses with 6x4x4 and 4x3x3cm,
prospectively.Cervical Tumor is ill - margins ocuppying cervix and invasion of uterus, with 10x8x8cm in
size, solid and firm and white-gray surface.

Bladder wall and rectal wall are infiltrated by tumor to form masses with 6x4x4 and 4x3x3cm,
prospectively.

Microscopic Description: Tumor tissue arranges in the form of group or sheets or trabecular of tumor
cells conecting each other. The malignant cells have relatively moderate, light eosinophilic or keratinized
cytoplasm. The nuclei are enlarged, variability in size and shape, containing coarse clumped chromatin
with prominent nucleoli. Mitotic ﬁgures are common. Tumor is invasion of completely cervical thickness
and invading bladder or lymph nodes. Tumor is necrotic and invasion of lymphocytes. Transitional cell
are begnin.

Diagnosis Details: Squamous cell carcinoma, large cell, non-keratinizing, invading stromal tissue of cervix
