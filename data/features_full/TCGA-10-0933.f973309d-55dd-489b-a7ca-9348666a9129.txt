COMMENT

The ovarian tumor measures 130 cm in maximum dimension. It has various patterns including serous, undifferentiated,
endometrioid, mucinous, and sarcomatoid. Keratin immunohistochemicai stains are positive in the sarcomatoid areas.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

 

(A) RIGHT TUBE AND OVARY - An ovary (13.0 x 13.0 x 7.0 cm) and attached unremarkable fallopian tube (5.0 cm in length and
0.2 cm in circumference). The ovary is completely replaced by a variegated solid tumor containing areas of necrosis (90%)
admixed with a smait portion of solid tan-white firm area (5%) and soft tan—pink tissue (5%). Normal ovarian parenchyma is not
identified. Representative sections of the tumor are submitted for frozen section diagnosis. Additional sections are submitted for

permanent.

SECTEON CODE: A1-A5, tumor; (FS diagnosis); A6-A26, tumor reiresentative sections (firmer white area and pink); A27,

A28 fallopian tube; A29, tumor, representative section of the ne ' rea

*FSIDX: OVARY WITH HiGH GRADE CARCINOMA.
(8) LEFT TUBE AND OVARY - An unremarkable ovary (1.9 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm) and attached faltopian tube (7.0 cm in length and 0.2
cm in circumference). A 2.0 x 2.0 cm solid tan-white tumor is present in the fallopian tube. The tumor appears to arise within the

fallopian tube.
SECTION CODE: 81, representative section from fattopian tube tumor for frozen section; 82-85, sequential sections of

fatlo ian tube from fimbriated end to more normat and near the attachment with ovary; I36, grossly normai ovary in its entirety.

(C) UTERUS, CERVIX - A uterus inclu' the cervix, 10.5 x 6.5 x 3.5 cm. The serd. tan and gtistening. The

endometriurn is pink-tan. 0.3 to 0.4 cm in thickness and is diffusety studded with cysts 0.1 _. .2 cm in diameter and filled with

clear fluid. In the posterior endometrium, the endometrium is polypoid, measuring 0.7 cm in thickness. A 1.0 cm nodule with

gray—tan, firm consistency and whorled cut surface is present in the lower part of uterus. The myometrium is otherwise devoid of

any lesion. The cervix has multipie Nabothian cysts.

(E) LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE - A single lymph node measuring 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is bisected and entirely

submitted in E.

(F) OMENTAL Mm irregular fragment of adipose tissue measuring 30.0 x 8.0 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is serially

sectioned. One possible lymph node is identified measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. However, no lesions grossly identified.
