Gross Description:
Received in five parts.
Source of Tissue: 1. Labeled #1, "right 11th rib"

Gross Description: Received fresh with patient name and medical record
number labeled "right 11th rib" is a 3.5 X 1.0 cm tan fragment of rib
having a minimal amount of attached soft tissue. A representative section
is submitted in one block, following decalcification.

Designation of Sections: Block 1

Summary of Sections: undesignated—l

Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled # 2, "right lower pole of kidney cyst"

Frozen Section Diagnosis: 21:3- CONSISTENT WITH BENIGN CYST PER-

Gross Description: Received fresh in a container with patient's name and
medical record number labeled "right lower pole of kidney cyst". It
consists of a portion of tan fibromembranous tissue measuring 9.0 x 5.0 x
0.2 cm with some attached associated adipose tissue measuring up to 0.2
cm. No markedly thickened areas or suspicious lesions are found.
Representative sections are submitted for frozen section and the residue
is in BPS, Additional representative sections are submitted in 2A.

Source of Tissue: 3. Labeled #3, "right perinephric fat"

Gross Deseliption: Received fresh with patient name and medical record
number labeled "right perinephric fat" are 322 grams of yellow—tan
perinephric fat. The fragments are sectioned to reveal yellow—tan
glistening lobulated cut surfaCes. Representative sections are submitted

Source of Tissue: 4. Labeled # 4, "lower pole renal mass-right"

 

Frozen Section Diagnosis: 4FS— RENAL CELL CARClNOMA, FAVOR PAPILLARY
Gross Description: Received fresh in a container with patient's name and
medical record number labeled "lower pole renal mass— right”. It consists
of a 210 gram ovoid soft mass measuring 8.0 x 8.0 x 6.7 cm. There is some
associated fibroadipose tissue measuring up to 1.0 cm and the mass is
predominantly covered with grayish~tan smooth capsule. At the margin,
there is some normal appearing kidney parenchyma which is inked with
black. Approximately 10% of the resection margin contains white
urothelium consistent with calyceal system. The specimen is sectioned
disclosing a soft orangish—yellbvv to reddish—brown tumor. The tumor is
approximately 0.2 cm from the nearest margin and does not grossly invade
into capsule. One representative section from the tumor closest to the
margin is submitted for frozen section and the residue is in 4FS.
Representative tissue is procured for Cytogenetics. Representative

sections are submitted in 4A~G.

Designation of Sections: 4A—4C— additional sections of tumor in
relationship to parenchyma margin, 4D—4G— tumor in relationship to

capsule.

Source of Tissue: 5. Labeled # 5, ”deep margin» right renal mass”
Frozen Section Diagnosis: 5FS- NO TUMOR SEEN .

Gross Description: Received fresh in a container with patient's name and
medical record number labeled “deep margin— right renal mass“. It
consists of two fragments of brownishntan tissue measuring 0.4 and 0.6 cm
respectively. Both fragments were submitted for frozen section
consultation and the residue is in SFS.

Final Diagnosis:

1. Right llth rib:

Hypercellular trilinear marrow with left»shifted myeloid maturation
consistent with history of chronic myelogenous leukemia.

 

2. Right lower pole of kidney cyst:
Benign cyst.

3. Right perinephric fat:
Fibroadipose tissue; no tumor seen.

4. Lower pole renal mass- right:
Renal cell carcinoma, papillary subtype.— The 8.0 cm carcinoma is confined

to renal parenchyma.
— Angiolymphatic invasion is not identified.
— The deep margin is free of tumor.

5. Deep margin— right renal mass:
No tumor seen.

pTNM: T2 NX Mx.

Procedures/Addenda

Addendum Diagnosis

At the request of the primary clinician, additional information is
reported.

The diagnoses are unchanged.

The right lower pole renal cell carcinoma (part 4) is a type I papillary

carcinoma.

CYTOGENETIC ANALYSIS REPORTS
DIAGNOSIS: Renal Mass

KARYOTYPE: Abnormal karyotype:
52,X,~Y,+3,+7,+7,+10,+12,+16,+17,+20,—21 [20]

RESULTS: The renal mass was harvested after seven and eight days in
culture. The chromosomes from twenty metaphases were counted and
analyzed, and three of these metaphases were karyotyped by G—banding. The
modal chromosome number was 52, and all of the cells had an abnormal
karyotype. Abnormalities wereall numerical and included an extra copy
each of chrornosomes 3, 10, 12, 16, 17, and 20, two extra copies of
chromosome 7, and a missing chromosome 21 - chromosome. Papillary
renal adenomas and carcinomas have been reported to contain a unique

 

combination of autosomal trisomies along with loss of- chromosome.
The constellation of trisomies includes chromosomes 7, 12, 16, 17, and 20,
all of which are found in this patient' 3 karyotype. The literature

suggests that tumors with tri— or tetrasomy 7 and 1'? correspond to

papillary adenomas and that tumors with more complex karyotypic changes
are papillary carcinomas.
