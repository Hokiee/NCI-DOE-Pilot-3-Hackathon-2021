GROSS DESCRIPTION:

' Al. The specimen consists of a 143 g, 13.2 x 9.8 x 4.2 cm lobe of lung
displaying a 9.8 cm in length, tortuous staple resection margin. The
staple resection margins (inked black) no changes are adjacent to the
bronchial resection margin. The bronchial resection margin is removed
en face and submitted for frozen section diagnosis and subsequent
routine histology in cassette FsA.

The pleural surface is tan~pink to brown, smooth to scabrous with a
0.8 x 0.8 cm, indurated central area of puckering along the lateral
aspect. The area of pleural puckering is inked blue.

The specimen is sectioned to reveal a 2.6 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm, tan—yellow
to white, granular, poorly demarcated mass along the lateral aspect
that grossly extends to the aforementioned area of pleural puckering.
The mass is 2.8 cm from the bronchial resection margin, 2.3 cm from
the closest vascular resection margin, and 1.7 cm from the closest
staple line resection margin.

111%." ”'34th ’Lﬂﬂ‘ :M’PS

The remaining lung parenchyma is tan—pink to red and unremarkable. No
subsequent lesions are identified. No areas of congestion,
consolidation or emphysematous change are appreciated. Sectioning
through the peribronchial region does not reveal any obvious lymph
nodes.

Representative sections are submitted as follows: Al- vascular
resection margin, en face; A2-A3— staple line resection margin closest
to mass, en face; A4—A7— mass to include overlying pleura and adjacent
uninvolved parenchyma; A8- uninvolved parenchyma.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:

FsA. Lung, right upper lobe, lobectomy?
- BRONCHIAL MARGIN, NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY L

B. The specimen consists of a 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm, tan—pink to black,
rubbery anthracotic lymph node which is submitted in toto in cassette
B.

C. The specimen consists of a 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm aggregate of
tan~pink to black, rubbery anthracotic lymph nodes which are submitted
in toto in cassette CvaZ.

D. The specimen consists of four tan—pink to black, rubbery,
anthracotic lymph nodes ranging from 0.4 to 2.5 cm in greatest
dimension. The largest lymph node is serially sectioned to reveal a
tan—pink to black, rubbery cut surface. The lymph nodes are submitted
in their entirety as follows: 01— four whole lymph nodes; D2— one
serially sectioned lymph node.

E. The specimen consists of a 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm, tan—pink to red,
irregular rubbery lymph node which is submitted in toto in cassette E.

F. The specimen consists of a 2.3 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm aggregate of
tan‘yellow, fatty soft tissue that is sectioned and palpated to reveal
four tan~pink to yellow, rubbery lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 to 1.3
cm in greatest dimension. The larger lymph node is bisected to reveal
a tan-yellow, fatty replaced cut surface. The lymph nodes are
submitted in their entirety as follows: Fl— one bisected lymph node;
F2— three whole lymph nodes.

G. The specimen consists of a 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm, tan—pink to yellow,

irregular soft tissue which is submitted in toto in cassette G.
