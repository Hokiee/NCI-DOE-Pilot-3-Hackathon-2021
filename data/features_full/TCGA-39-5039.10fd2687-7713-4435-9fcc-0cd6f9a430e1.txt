”Right level 4 lymph node number tWO" and consists of a 5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm
piece of fibroadipose tissue, which is sectioned to reveal one partly fatty
and anthracotio lymph node measuring 5 x 2.3 x 1.4 cm. The lymph node is
representetively sampled for frozen section consultation. Further
sectioning through the remaining tissue in the container reveals several
additional whole pink—tan lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.2 to 0.5 cm in
greatest dimension, which srejentirely submitted separately. The remaining
lymphoid tissue is entirely submitted for permanent section.

up to 3.5 cm. The largest lymph node is sectioned. The entire lymph nodes

are submitted.

10). The specimen is received in a fresh state. labeled as "right upper
lobe of lung", and consists of a right lung upper lohectomy specimen
measuring 11.5 x 13 x 5.4 cm weighing 212 g. The portion of middle lobe (
4.? x 2.2 x 0.2 cm, marked by a short stitch) and the portion of the lower
lobe (3.5 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm, marked by a long stitch) are adhered to the
inferoposterior aspect of the specimen. A 10 cm staple line is identified
in the inferior aspect. The Specimen is inked in black on the pleura, in
blue on the middle lobe margin, in green on the lower lobe margin (after the

removal of the staples), and in red on the staple line {after the removal of
the staples). Sectioning reveals a 5.5 x 4.3 x 4.0 cm relatively
well-circumscribed firm tan mass in the posterior aspect of the specimen.
The adjacent pleura shows fibrous adhesion. The tumor approaches 1.4 cm
from the bronchial resection margin, 0.5 cm from the middle lobe margin, 0.7
cm from the lower lobe margin, and 0.3 cm from the staple line. The tumor
does not involve the middle lobe or lower lobe parenchyma. The tumor
penetrates the anthracotic visceral pleura to invade into the adherent chest
wall soft tissue (3.5 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm). Background lung parenohyma shows
varying degree of emphysematoua change. multiple peribronchial lymph nodes
are identified. The specimen is photographed. TPS is taken.

Representative sections are submitted.

BM -— bronchial margin

VIII —— vascular margin ,

LL —- lower lobe, perpendicular green margin
