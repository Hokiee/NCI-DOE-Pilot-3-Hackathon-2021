specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis.

Summary of sections: 2AFSC, frozen section control, 2/1.

3) SOURCE: Floor of Mouth Margin

Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis in a container labeled "ﬂoor
of mout " is 1 fragment of soft tissue that measures 3.5 X 0.2 X 0.3 cm.
The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis.

margin" is 1 fragment of soft tissue that measures 8.3 X 0.2 X 0.3 cm. The
specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis.

Summary of sections: 4AFSC, frozen section control, 3/1.

5) SOURCE: Right Neck Level 2 and 3

Received fresh in a container labeled "right neck level 2, 3" are multiple
fragments of fibrofatty tissue that in aggregate measure 9.0 X 6.0 X 2.3

cm. The specimen is searched for lymph nodes and 12 possible lymph nodes
are identified. Two possible lymph nodes are submitted entirely in cassette
5A. Two possible lymph nodes are submitted entirely in cassette 5B. One
possible lymph node is bisected and submitted in cassette 5C. One possible
lymph node is bisected and submitted in cassette 5D. One possible lymph
node is bisected and submitted in cassette 5E. One possible lymph node is
bisected and half in submitted in cassette 5F and half is submitted in
cassette 5G. One possible lymph node is bisected and half is submitted in
cassette 5A and half is submitted in cassette 5H. One possible lymph node
is bisected and submitted in cassette 5]. One possible lymph node is
bisected and submitted in cassette 5K and one possible lymph node is
bisected and submitted in cassette 5L.

Summary of sections: 5A-5E, 2/1 each; 5F-51, l/l each; 5J-5L, 2/1 each.

6) SOURCE: Right Neck Level 1B

Received fresh in a container labeled "right neck level 1B," is one

fragment of fibrofatty tissue that measure 6.3 cm X 3.5 X 0.8 cm. The
specimen is searched for lymph nodes and 2 possible lymph nodes are
identified. One possible lymph node is bisected and submitted in cassette
6A. A second possible lymph node is bisected and submitted in cassette 6B.
Summary of sections: 6A, 2/1 each.

7) SOURCE: Teeth

Received fresh in a container labeled "teeth for gross only" are 6 incisors
that in aggregate measure 5.0 X 4.0 X 0.7 cm. There do not grossly appear
to be any cavities or fillings. A photograph is taken and the specimen is
submitted for gross only pathologic diagnosis.

8) SOURCE: Right Tongue Cancer Level 1B

Received in formalin in a container labeled "right tongue cancer level 1B"
is a portion of right tongue with attached mandible and soft tissue that
measures 11 X 10 X 7.5 cm. The tongue measures 10 cm from anterior to
posterior, 4.5 cm from right to left, and 3.3 cm from superior to inferior.
The attached mandible measures 5.6 cm from anterior to posterior, 0.6 cm
from right to left, and 3.2 cm from superior to inferior. The specimen is
inked as follows: anterior orange, lateral read, medial yellow, posterior
black and inferior green. There is an ulcerated tumor at the right ﬂoor of
the mouth that measures 5.0 X 4.8 cm. A portion of the tumor is given to
research is placed in glutaraldehyde and also submitted in -80 degree. The

medial soft tissue margin closest to the tumor is submitted in cassette 8A
and 8B. This margin appears grossly to be 1.8 cm away from the tumor. The
inferior margin to tumor is submitted in cassette 8C. This margin appears

to be 0.3 cm from tumor. There is a submandibular gland inferior to the
specimen that measures 4.3 X 2.5 X 2.3 cm. The tumor does not appear
grossly to eXtend into this gland. Representative sections of the gland are
submitted in cassette 8D and 8E. Posterior soft tissue margins to tumor is
submitted in cassette 8F. This margin grossly appears to be 0.4 cm away
from tumor. The anterior tongue margin is submitted in cassette 8G. The
anterior soft tissue margin is submitted in cassette 8H and this margin
appears grossly to be 1.5 cm away from tumor. Another posterior soft tissue
margin that appears grossly to the 0.4 cm away from tumor is submitted in
cassette 81. A representative section of superior tongue tumor is submitted
in cassette 8]. The superior portion of the tongue appears to be grossly
involved by tumor. The lateral margin is composed of the mandible. The
anterior mandibular margin is submitted in cassette 8K. The posterior
mandible margin is submitted in cassette 8L. The lateral mandibular margin
to tumor is submitted in cassette 8M. Grossly, the mandible does not appear
to be involved by tumor. Representative sections of tumor are submitted in
cassette 8N-8R.

Summary of sections: 8A-8Q, 1/1 each; 8R, 2/ 1; cassettes 8K, 8L and 8M are
submitted following decalcification.

9) SOURCE: Prehyoid Lymph Node

Received fresh in a container labeled "prehyoid lymph node" is one fragment
of fibrofatty tissue that measures 1.0 X 1.0 cm X 0.4 cm. The fragment is
entirely submitted in cassette 9A.

Summary of sections: 9A, 1/ 1.
