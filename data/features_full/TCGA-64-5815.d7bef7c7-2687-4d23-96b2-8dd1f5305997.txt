Clinical History/Diagnosis: Lung cancer

 

Source of Specimen(s):

1: Cytology ~no fee code

2: Level nine lymph nodes

3: 10R lymph nodes

4: Level seven lymph nodes

5: Level 11 lymph node

6: Level 11 lymph node at bifurcation of middle and lower lobe
7 : Right upper and middle lobe

Final Diagnosis:
1. Cytology

2. Level nine lymph nodes, excision:
~ No tumor seen in one lymph node (0/ 1).

3. 10R lymph nodes, excision:
— Metastatic carcinoma in two of two lymph nodes (2/2).

4. Level seven lymph nodes, excision:
— No tumor seen in seven lymph nodes (0/7).

5. Level 11 lymph node, excision:
— No tumor seen in one lymph node (0/1).

6. Level 11 lymph node at bifurcation of middle and lower lobe, excision:
— No tumor seen in one lymph node (011).

7. Right upper and middle lobe, resection:

— Invasive poorly differentiated adenosquamous carcinoma, 6.5 cm of the
upper lobe.

- Carcinoma invades through visceral pleura.

- Angiolymphatic invasion is not identified.

— Bronchial and vascular margins are free of carcinoma.

— No tumor seen in five parabronchiallymph nodes (0/5).

Source of Tissue: ’7. Labeled #7, "right upper and middle lobe"

Intraoperative Consultation: UPPER LOBE BRONCHIAL MARGﬂl— NO TUMOR

SEWER—

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled ",

right upper and middle lobe". It consists of two lobes of lung weighing a
total of 292 grams. The upper lobe measures 13.5 x 11.5 x 5 cm in greatest t
dimension. The pleura is gray—tan, smooth except for a 1.2 cm puckered

area located approximately 6 cm from the closest upper lobe margin and
approximately 4.5 cm from the middle lobe bronchial margin. The middle
lobe measures 10.5 x 10.5 x 4.5 cm. The pleura is gray-tan and smooth.
Both the bronchial margin and vascular margin from both upper and middle
lobes are unremarkable. The upper lobe is sectioned to reveal a 6.5 x 4.5

x 4.5 cm ill—defined firm brown mass located approximately 3.5 cm from the
closest upper lobe bronchial and vascular margins. The mass corresponds to
the previously described pleural puckering of the upper lobe. The middle
lobe is sectioned to reveal a congested soft tan-pink cut surface with no
masses present. The horizontal fissure appears grossly unremarkable. The
upper lobe bronchial margin is entirely frozen in 7FS. Additional random

 

sections of the remainder of the specimen are submitted in ”EA-7].
