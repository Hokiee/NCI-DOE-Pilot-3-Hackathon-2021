Gross Description

The specimens are received in five formalin-filled containers, each labeled

"' ." The first container is labeled "cervix, uterus, bilateral
fallopian tubes, and ovary." It contains a previously bisected uterus and

attac ed bilateral adnexa. The uterus measures 7 x 6 x 2.5 cm. The cervix is
unremarkable with a slit-shaped os measuring 1 cm in diameter. The endometrial
canal is lined by tan—white. unremarkable mucosa. measuring 2 cm in length with
an average diameter of 0.3 cm. There is a large, polypoid mass arising from the
anterior endometrial wall measuring 3.5 cm in greatest dimension. The mass does
not appear to involve the lower uterine segment. Sectioning of the mass reveals
invaSTon into the superficial myometrium. The average myometrial thickness
measures 1.5 cm. The serosa appears intact and smooth. The left ovary is
unremarkable and measures 3 x 1.2 x 1 cm. Sections show ellow—tan parenchyma
without cysts. The left fallopian tube measures 5 cm in ength with an avera e
diameter of 0.3 cm. It is grossl unremarkable. The right ovary measures 3.? x
1 x 0.8 cm and is grossly unremar able. The right fallopian tube measures 4 cm
in length with an average diameter of 0.3 cm. Sections show unremarkable cross
sections. Labeled A1, anterior cervix and lower uterine segment; A2 to A5,
sections of the tumor' A6, posterior cervix and lower uterine segment; A7,
posterior uterine wali; A8, left Ovary and fallopian tube; A9. right ovary and
fallopian tube. Jar ..

The second container is labeled "left pelvic lymph node." It contains multi le
fragments of fibrofatt tissue measuring 6 x 2 x 1 cm in aggregate from which
multiple pOSSible lymp nodes, the largest measuring 2 x 1 x 0.4 cm, are
dissected. Labeled 81. largest lymph node: 82 to B7, possible lymph nodes. Dar

The third container is labeled "right pelvic lymph node." It contains multiple
fragments of fibroadipose tissue measuring 7 x 3 x 1 cm in aggregate from which
two lymph nodes measuring 2 x l x 0.4 cm and 3 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm, are dissected.
Labeled C1 to C4. Jar l.

The fourth container is labeled "periaortic, right." It contains a piece of
fibroadipose tissue measuring 2.5 x l x 0.4 cm. No lymph nodes are identified.
Labeled 01. Jar 0.
