Gross Description: . . . . I I
The speCimens are received in seven containers each labeled With the patient 5
name and medical record number.

A. The first container is additionally identified as, "right ureter distal
margin". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a unoriented 0.9 cm length of
ureter with a diameter of 0.4 cm and a lumen of less than 0.1 cm. Specimen is
serially sectioned and submitted between sponges in cassette A1.

B. The second container is additionally identified as, "left distal ureter".
Received fresh and placed in formalin is a unoriented 0.1 cm length of probable
ureter with a diameter of 0.4 cm and a lumen of less than 0.1 cm. Specimen is
submitted between sponges in cassette Bl.

C. The third container is additionally identified as, "left pelvic lymph
nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm ag regate
of fibrofatty tissue which is dissected to reveal multiple types of lymp nodes
ranging in Size from 0.5-2.2 cm. Specimen is entirely submitted as fo lows

C1 one lymph node bisected

C2 one lymph node bisected

C3 one lymph node bisected

C4 one lymph node bisected

' C5 4 nodes

C6 adjacent fibrous tissue

D. The fourth container is additionally identified as, "right pelvic lymph
nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 5 x 4 x 3 cm a gre ate of
fibrofatty tissue which is dissected to reveal multiple types of ymp nodes
ranging in Size from 0.5-3 cm. Specimen is entirely submitted as fol ows
D1—2 one lymph node bisected

D3—4 one lymph node bisected

D5 4 nodes

06 3 nodes

E. The fifth container is additionally identified as, "left ureter". Received

fresh and placed in formalin is 2.4 cm length of ureter with a diameter of 0.4

cm and a lumen of less than 0.1 cm with a small amount of attached fibrous

tissue. There is a glastic clip and stitch at one end. This end is inked black.
The ureter is seria ly sectioned and submitted between sponges in cassette E1-2.

F. The sixth container is additionally identified as, "bladder, prostate and
seminal vesicles". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 403 g, 14 x 11 x 3
cm cystoprostatectomy specimen consisting of a bladder which measures 12x11x3.5
cm. The right ureteral stump measures 2 cm and the left 2.4 cm, and both
demonstrate patent lumina. The prostate measures 4.8 x 4 x 4 cm. The right
seminal vesicle measures 3.5 x 1.5 cm and the right vas deferens 6 cm. The left
seminal vesicle measures 3 x 1.5 cm and the left vas deferens 8 cm. The ri ht
half of the prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left half is inked lack.
The prostate is opened anteriorly along the urethra and continued superiorly
through the bladder in a Y—shaped incision. The prostate is serially sectioned
from apex to base to reveal unremarkable parenchyma.The bladder demonstrates an
exo hytic hemorrhagic yellow—tan 6 x 5.5 cm mass involving the anterior and

rig t wall. Serial sectioning reveals tumor invasion to a depth of 1.8 cm,
extending to 0.2 cm of the inked margin. There is a 4.5 x 4 cm diverticulum
whith shaggy red mucosa involving the posterior left aspect of the bladder. The
remainder of the mucosa is tan-brown, edematous, and glistening with a uniform
0.4 cm wall thickness. The bilateral ureteral orifices are identified and probe
patent. The tumor extends to within 0.1 cm of the right ureteral orifice

Gross photographs are taken.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:
F1: Distal urethral margin

F2: Prostatic apical margin

F3: Right ureteral margin

F4: Le t ureteral margin

F5—8: Representative prostate through verumontanum
F9—12: Representative prostate above verumontanum
F13: Seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia

F14: Ri ht ureteral orifice

F15: Le t ureteral orifice

F16—22: Multiple tumor sections

F23—24: Diverticulum

F25: Uninvolved dome

F26: Uninvolved anterior wall

F27: Uninvolved posterior wall

F28: Uninvolved ri ht wall

F29: Uninvolved le t wall

F30: Uninvolved trigone

G. The seventh container is additionally identified as, "right ureter".
Received fresh and placed in formalin is 2.4 cm length of ureter with a diameter
of 0.4 cm and a lumen of less than 0.1 cm with a small amount of attached
fibrous tissue. There is a glastic clip and stitch at one end. This end is inked
black. The ureter is serial y sectioned and submitted between sponges in
cassette Gl—2.
