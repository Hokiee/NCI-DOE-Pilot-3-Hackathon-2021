7 ll Diagnosis:
Brain, left frontal tumor, excision: Grade 3 (of 4) oiigoastrocytoma, in progression from a grade 2
oligodendroglioma, (see comment).

 

The tumor forms a rim of a "solid highly cellular" tumor, 0.4 cm in thickness as well as infiltrates surrounding
parenchyma in a single cell fashion.

ADDENDA:

1 p and 19q FISH studies were performed on cells within parafﬁn sections from tumor. Two hybridizations were
performed: one with a l9q probe/control 19p pair and one with a 1p probe/control lq pair. The l9q and 1p probes
mapped to the regions that are commonly deleted in gliomas. The l9q to 19p probe ratio was 1.01. The 1p to lq.

probe ratio was 1.03. For both probes, the normal ratio is approximately 1. Any ratio less than 0.80 is consistent
with deletion of the chromosomal region of interest.

There was no evidence of deletion of 113 and 19q. However, approximately 60% of the cells had 3—4 copies of the
1p, lq, 19p, and 19q probes. Similar results have been observed in other glioma specimens with gain of
chromosomes 1 and 19. The results may also be consistent with tumor tetraploidy or aneuploidy.

adjunct to existing clinical and pathological information. This test does not rule out other chromosome anomalies.

   

Preliminary Frozen Section Consultation:
Brain, left frontal mass, biopsy: Residual glioma, hold to evaluate recurrence versus progression.

Brain, left frontal tumor posterior margin, biopsy: Rule out involvement by tumor.

Gross Description:
Tissue from the brain (left frontal—~50 x 2.5 x 2 cm, left frontal posterior margin—~15 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm)
