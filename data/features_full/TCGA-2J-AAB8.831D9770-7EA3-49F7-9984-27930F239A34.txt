Surgery date: . Surgical Pathology

 

DIAGNOSIS:

A. Liver, right lobe, biopsy: Bile duct harnartoma. Negative for
malignancy.

B. Lymph nodes, hepatic hilar, biopsy: Multiple (2) lymph nodes are
negative for tumor.

C. Common hepatic duct, margin, excision: Negative for malignancy.

D. Pancreas, neck margin, excision: Negative for malignancy.

E. Head of pancreas, common bile duct, duodenum, jejunum, and
gallbladder; Whipple resection: Invasive moderately differentiated
grade 3 (of 4) ductal adenocarcinoma is identiﬁed forming a solid
3.5 x 2.8 x 2.4 cm mass located in the pancreatic head. The tumor
extends beyond the pancreas to involve pancreatic soft tissue and
distal common bile duct. Angiolymphatic invasion is identiﬁed.
Perineural invasion is present. Tumor necrosis is absent. The
portal vein groove margin is focally positive for invasive
carcinoma. The portion of superior mesenteric vein is negative for
tumor. The adjacent non-neoplastic pancreatic parenchyma shows
chronic pancreatitis. Multiple (3 of 25) regional lymph nodes are
positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.

Frozen section histologic interpretation of right lobe of liver
performed by:

This ﬁnal pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic
examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the
specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are
reviewed to conﬁrm these ﬁndings. Any substantive changes
identiﬁed on permanent section review will be reﬂected in a
revised report.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received fresh labeled "lesion, right lobe liver biopsy" is a 1.2

x 0.6 X 0.6 cm fragment of liver with a 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm tan ﬁrm
nodule. All submitted. Grossed by

C. Received fresh labeled "common hepatic duct margin" is a 0.8 x

Margin submitted. Grossed by

D. Received fresh labeled "pancreatic neck margin" is a 3.1 x 1.1 x
0.4 cm portion of tan lobulated pancreas without orientation.
Margin submitted. Grossed by

E. Received fresh labeled "head of pancreas, portion of common
bilateral duct, portion of jejunum, portion of supramesenteric vein,
gallbladder" is a Whipple specimen consisting of 30.3 cm in length
portion of duodenum, 7.0 x 6.3 x 2.8 cm portion of pancreas, a 10.9
x 4.7 x 3.0 cm gallbladder and a 1.4 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm portion of
superior mesenteric vein. The pancreatic uncinate margin is inked
yellow and shaved. The portal vein groove is inked black and
submitted perpendicularly. There is a 3.5 x 2.8 x 2.4 cm
inﬁltrative mass within the head of the pancreas, less than 0.1 cm
from the portal vein groove margin. The mass extends to
peripancreatic soft tissue. A stent is present within the common
bile duct measuring 9.5 cm. The gallbladder contains no choleliths.
Peripancreatic lymph nodes and periduodenal lymph nodes are
identiﬁed. Representative sections are submitted. Grossed by
