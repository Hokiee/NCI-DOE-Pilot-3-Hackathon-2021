Page 2 at 3

1.) The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "Right thyroid lobe and isthmus, long stitch -- superior, short stitch pyramidal
lobe“. it consists of an oriented, 7.0 g. 3.8 x 2.3 x 1.6 cm right thyroid lobe, with attached 1.9 x1.1 x 0.8 cm Isthmus and 1.5 x 1.1 x
0.4 cm pyramidal lobe. A long stitch designates the superior aspect of the right thyroid lobe and a short stitch designates the
pyramidal lobe. The surface is shaggy and pink-purple. The lobe is inked black posterior and blue anterior. Serial sectioning
reveals two abutting. poorly deﬁned. soft, tan~white to tan-yellow circumscribed nodules, ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 cm in greatest
dimension. Both nodules are located within the midto lower right lobe and are located 0.1 cm from both the anterior and posterior
intact thyroid capsule. A capsule is not identiﬁed grossly surrounding either nodule. The remaining thyroid parenchyma is meaty
and tan-red. Entirely submitted. '

Summary of sections: ‘

NS - abutting nodules

RRL - remaining right lobe, superior to inferior

Pl -- pyramidal with attached isthmus. superior to inferior

2.The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "left thyorid lobe, stitch left superior pole". It consists of a thyroid lobe measuring 4
x 3.5 x 1.0 cm and weighing 8 g with a suture marking the superior pole. The surface shows few nodules one closer to superior
pole measures 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm with slightly granular cut surface and the second one closer to inferior end measures 1.2 x 1.0 x
1.0 cm. The lobe is inked black posterior and blue anterior. TPS submitted from both nodules. Entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:

N1 - nodule 1 near superior pole
N2- nodule2 near the lower end
RS - remaining sections
