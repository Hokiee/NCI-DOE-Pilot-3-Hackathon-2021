PATHOLOGY REPORT:

PRIMARY SITE: Hypopharynx

l - “Right hypopharynx biopsy”:
— Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.

2 - “Left-interior parathyroid site”:
- Fragment of ﬁbroadipose tissue uninvolved by neoplasia.

3 - “Left recorrential dissection specimen”:
- Two of nine lymph nodes involved by metastatic carcinoma (2/9), without capsular
involvement.

5 - “Total pharyngolaryngectomy, partial esophagectomy, leﬁ neck dissection and right
radical neck dissection with total thyroidectomy”:
- Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx.

~ Epiglottis: uninvolved by neoplasia.

- Left vocal cord: uninvolved by neoplasia.

- Right vocal cord: involved by neoplasia.

- Thyroid, cricoid and arytenoid cartilages uninvolved by neoplasia.

- Hyoid bone uninvolved by neoplasia.
- Surgical margins uninvolved by neoplasia, but right-posterior and right-lateral are
exiguous (measured 1.0 mm).

- Esophagus involved by neoplasia with uninvolved surgical margins.

- Thyroid gland with follicular papillary carcinoma, histological grade 2, with
uninvolved margins.

- Tumor size: 1.2 cm

- Lymphovascular invasion: not identiﬁed.

- Right neck dissection:
- Three of ﬁfteen lymph nodes involved by metastatic carcinoma (3/15), without
capsular involvement.
