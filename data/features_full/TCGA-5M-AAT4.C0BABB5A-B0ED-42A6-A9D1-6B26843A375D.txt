SPECIMEN: terminal ileum. cecum, right colon, appendix and transverse colon.
PROCEDURE: Right hemicolectomy with distal ileostomy

MACROSCOPY

- Segment of right and transverse colons, opened along its longitudinal axis, with cecum,
appendix, and terminal ileum.

- Appendix shows 4.0 cm of length and 0.7 cm of diameter.

- The right and transverse colons measure 22.0 cm of length and 1.5 cm of mean diameter.

- A vegetating tumor with elevated infiltrative borders and central ulceration, measuring 5.0 x 4.0
cm is found in the colonic mucosa 6.5 cm from the nearest surgical margin.

- Three lymph nodes are grossly identified in the 12.0 x 11.5 cm area of pericolic fat tissue.

- The adjacent mucosa is pale and shows three 0.9 cm polyps each near the ileocecal valve.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION

- Moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma of the right colon.
- Microscopic tumor extension: tumor invades until the fat subserosa.
- Lymph-vascular invasion: present.

- Surgical margins free of neoplasia.

- Moderate peritumoral lymphocytic infiltrate.

- Moderate stromal desmoplasia.

- Extensive areas of necrosis in the tumor.

- Number of lymph nodes examined: 3.

- Number of lymph nodes positive for neoplasia: 0.

- Adjacent intestinal mucosa with one villous adenoma with high grade epithelial dysplasia. and
two polyps with low grade epithelial dysplasia.

- Appendix displays no pathologic features. 7518 ”O '6
