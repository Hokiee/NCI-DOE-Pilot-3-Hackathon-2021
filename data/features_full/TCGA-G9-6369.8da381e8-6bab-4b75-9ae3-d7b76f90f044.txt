GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. PROSTATE
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and “prostate" is a 36-g resected prostate gtand
measuring 8.6 cm from left lateral to right lateral, 2.8 cm from anterior to posterior, and 2.7 cm from
apex to base. The capsule is smooth, red, and intact. ink code: anterior~orange, apex-red, base-blue,
right lateral-green, left lateral-yellow, posterior-black. After removal of the apex and base, the prostate
weighs 22 g. The parenchyma has a nodular tan appearance. Alternating sections are submitted for
tissue procurement (9 g). The right seminal vesicle is torn and 4.3 x 1.6 x 0.6 cm, the left is 3.7 x 1.4 x
0.6 cm. They consist of cystic tan tissue. The vas deferens are detached from the prostate and
measure 1.6 x 0.6 cm and 2.2 x 0.8 cm; they are made up of tubular tan tissue. Submitted entirely:
A1: right apex, perpendicular sections

B. RIGHT PELVlC LYMPl—l NODES
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "right pelvic lymph nodes" are pieces of
yellow-tan soft tissue in aggregate, 5.4 x 3.7 x 1.5 cm; multiple lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging from
0.1 to 1.7 cm. Lymph nodes are submitted entirely as follows:
B1: 6 lymph nodes
82: 2 lymph nodes
BS: 5 lymph nodes
84: 1 lymph node
B5: 1 lymph node
C. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and “left pelvic lymph nodes" are pieces of
yellow—tan soft tissue in aggregate, 5.7 x 4.6 x 1-cm containing multiple lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 to
2.4 cm. Lymph nodes are submitted entirely as follows:
C1: 6 lymph nodes
02-05: 1 lymph node in each cassette
