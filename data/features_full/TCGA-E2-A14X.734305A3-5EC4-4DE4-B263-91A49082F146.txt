The interpretation of the above immunohistochemistry stain or stains is guided by published results in the medical
literature. provided package information from the manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance and
assay validation within the lmmunohistochemistry Laboratory. The use of one or more reagents in the above tests is
regulated as an analyte speciﬁc reagent (ASR). These tests were developed and their performance characteristic
determined by the Department of Pathology Laboratory. They have not been cleared or approved by the US. Food
and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.

Special stains and/or immunohistochemical stains were performed with appropriately stained positive and negative
controls.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. BREAST. RIGHT. NEEDLE LOCALIZATION WIDE LOCAL EXCISION:
- INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 3. WITH MICROPAPILLARY
FEATURE .
- INVASIVE CARCINOMA MEASURES 2.5 CM.
- INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS PRESENT AT THE ANTERIOR MARGIN
AND IS 0.3 CM FROM THE POSTERIOR MARGIN.
- EXTENSIVE LYMPHVASCULAR INVASION IS PRESENT.
- DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), SOLID TYPE. NUCLEAR GRADE 3.
WITH NECROSIS, MINOR COMPONENT.
- DCIS IS FOCALLY WITHIN 0.4 CM OF THE MEDIAL MARGIN.
- PREVIOUS BIOPSY SITE CHANGES PRESENT.

NOTE: The additional anterior inferior margin (specimen B) is free of invasive carcinoma. Surgical correlation is
recommended. CD31 stains show positive staining around tumor foci near
superior and posterior margins consistent with tumor in lymphvascular channels.

ER: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0
PR: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0
COMMENT:

The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the proportion score
(0 = no staining. = <1% of cells staining. 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining. 3 = 11-30% of cells staining. 4 = 31-60% of
cells staining. 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining. 2 = intermediate
intensity of staining. 3 = strong intensity of staining). with a scoring range from 0 to 8.

ER/PR positive is deﬁned as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is deﬁned as an Allred score of less than
or equal to 2.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
Immunohistochemistrv was narfnrmnd using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5. 1:100) and PR (PGR 136. 1:100)
provided by Dako .) following the manufacturer s instructions. This assay was not modiﬁed.

METHODOLOGY:
Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no lonoer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis
was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit using rabbit anti-

human HER2. This assay was not modiﬁed. External kit-slides provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high,
low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-house known HER2 ampliﬁed control tissue were evaluated along
with the test tissue. Adequate. well preserved. clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identiﬁed for HER2 evaluation.
Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature.
information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.

This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from A800 and CAP
and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology Department takes full responsibility
for this test's performance.
