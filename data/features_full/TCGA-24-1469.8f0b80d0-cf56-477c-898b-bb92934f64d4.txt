with an iriégu'réi‘bdr‘déi is'identlfied. The remaining omentum is comprised oi unremarkable yeilow-tan fibrofatty tissue.
Labeled A1 - largest nodule. Jar2.

The second container is labeled “omentum tumor, FS1/X." it contains a cassette labeled 1‘FSt" that holds a 2.4 x 1.7 x
0.2 cm piece of white-yellow tissue. Labeled B1 {F81} Also in the container is a previously incised 4.4 x 3.8 x 2.? cm
piece oi yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue. largely replaced by a 4.4 x 2.9 x 2.9 cm white nodule with irregular borders.
Labeled B2.

The third container is labeled “right fallopian tube and ovary.“ It contains a 10.0 x 7.8 x 5.4 cm tan-purple mass. The
surface shows hemorrhage, multiple adhesions, and adherent fat. Also on the surface is a 10.0 x 4.7 cm area covered
by an exophyilc white—yellow tumor. No deliniiive fallopian tube is identified. Sections show an 8 cm long dilated
tube-like structure. with a lumen diameter that ranges from 0.6 to 3.0 cm. No fimbriated end is identified. The tube is
lined by smooth white-pink tissue with adherent clot. The mass is otherwise comprised of solid and cystic tissue, with
the largest solid component measuring 10.0 x 3.5 x 3.4 cm. The cystic component is lined by tan—white tissue. with
multiple small tan-brown excrescences. Sections oi the cyst wall show a 3.6 x 2.1 x 0.5 cm area with firm white tissue
that may represent compressed ovarian stroma. Labeled Ct to CB - solid portion ot tumor, with surface involvement;
04 - cyst wall. with putative corn ressed ovarian parenchyma; CS and CB - cystic and solid portion of tumor; 07 and
CB - putative faliopian tube. i

The fourth container is labeled ”left fallopian tube. ovary. cervix, and uterus.“ it contains a 96 gram, 8.5 (superior to
interior) x 4.7 (cornu to come) x 4.0 cm (anterior to posterior) tan-pink uterus and cervix. with attached left ovary and
fallopian tube. The 2.9 x 2.8 cm ectocervix shows multiple Nabothian cysts, and hemorrhage. but is otherwise covered
by shiny white mucosa. There is an adjacent 0.2 - 1.2 cm wide rim of vagina! mucosa. The 0.3 cm external os is
unremarkable. The across and myometrium have been incised at the posterior fundus, for a length of 2.9 cm. The
peritoneum over the anterior uterine lundus and lower uterine segment show a 2.7 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm area of papillary tan
tissue consistent with tumor implant. Similar tan tissue is seen at the serosa over the right cornu. Several small
serosal implants are seen posteriorly. The uterus and cervix are opened to show a 3.0 cm long x 0.4 cm diameter
endocervical canal, lined by white-tan mucosa. The 3.1 cm long x 1.5 cm wide endometriai cavity is lined by thin tan
and hemorrhagic endomelrium. Sections of the cervix show multiple Nabothian cysts. Sections of the
endomyometrium show an endometriai thickness of 0.1 cm. There is a well circumscribed t.1 cm diameter firm.
calcified nodule in the myometrium anteriorly, consistent with an intramural fibroid. The 3.9 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm while-tan
ovary has a smooth surface. The adjacent 5.7 cm long x 0.7 cm diameter purple-tan fallopian tube has a smooth
surface and an unremarkable fimbriated end. Sections of the ovary show unremarkable white-tan tissue. Sections of
the fallopian tube show an unremarkable pinpoint |umen,and a 0.7 cm diameter thin walled paratubal cyst. Labeled
Dt- anterior cervix; D2- anterior lower uterine segment and fundus, with intramural fibroid and anterior serosal tumor
implant (acid decaicificalion); D3 - posterior cervix; Dtt - posterior tower uterine segment with serosal tumor implant; DB
- posterior tundus; Dd - anterior myometrlum and serosa. with serosal tumor implant; D7 - left ovary; D8 — left fallopian
tube.

The iilth container is labeled “rectosigrnoidf it contains a 21.5 cm long x 3.7 cm diameter segment of sigmoid and
rectum. A staple line is present at each margin. The perfcolic fat is thickened. with adherent tan-brown tissue
consistent with tumor implants. measuring up to 3.3 cm in greatest dimension. The staple lines are excised, and the
colon opened to show tight tan mucosa. without lesions. There is a 2.5 cm long narrowed segment in the mid portion
of the specimen, with a luminal diameter of 1.4 cm, compared to a luminal diameter of 2.0 cm surrounding the stricture.
Sections of the sigmoid show a 0.7 cm intact diverticuium. There is no gross involvement by the tumor of the
muscularis or the colonic mucosa. Sections of the pericolonic fat show multiple white-tan tumor nodules, measuring up
to 5.5 cm in greatest dimension. Three small white nodules are identified within the fat that may represent lymph node
metastasis. ranging from 0.3 to 0.4 cm. Also identified are several pink-tan benign-appearing lymph nodes. measuring
up to 0.5 cm in diameter. Labeled E1 - proximal margin; E2 - distal margin; E3 — stricture; E4 — diverticulum; E5 -
largest tumor nodule; E6 - small tumor nodules within pericolic fat; E? to E9 - lymph nodes. Jar 3.

The sixth container is labeled 're-anastomotic donut." it contains two pieces of fan mucosa and attached soil tissue,
measuring 0.9 cm in length x 1.7 cm in diameter and 0.8 cm in length x 1.9 cm in diameter, respectively. Both contain
surgical staples. The mucosa shows hemorrhage, but not lesions. Labeled F1 and F2.

HISTOPATHOLOGlC TYPE
The histologic diagnosis is serous adenocarcinoma

TUMOR LOCATION
The location oi the primary tumor is the right ovary only

HISTOLOGIC GRADE
The histologic grade is poorly differentiated (Gs)

TUMOR tNVASiON
Tumor is identified on the ovarian surface and invades the adjacent fallopian tube/peritubai soil tissue

TUMOR iNVOLVEMENT
Tumor involvement of the pelvic peritoneum/soft tissue is present. and metastatic involvement oi the omentum is
present

TUMOR SIZE
The maximum dimension oi tumor implants outside the true pelvis is greater than or equal to 2 cm

PRIMARY TUMOR m
Based on the above information, the primary tumor is classified as macroscopic peritoneal metastasis beyond pelvis
more than 2 cm in greatest dimension or regional lymph node metastasis (T 3c/liiC)

FtEGlONAL LYMPH NODES (N)
The regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed (Ni-t)

DISTANT METASTASJS (M)
NO distant metastases reportedly present (MO)

STAGE GROUPING
The Final AJCCIUlCC/FIGO stage is TSCINXIMO

The pathologic stage assigned here should be regarded as provisional, and may change after integration of clinical
data not provided with this specimen.
