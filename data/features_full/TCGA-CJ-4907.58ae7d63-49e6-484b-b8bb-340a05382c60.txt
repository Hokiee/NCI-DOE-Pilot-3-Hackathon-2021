DIAGNOSIS

(A) RIGHT KIDNEY, ADRENAL, AND NO THROMBUS:

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (6.0 CM MAXIMUM DIMENSION), CONVENTIONAL TYPE (90% CLEAR CELLS, 10%
EOSINOPHILIC CELLS), FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3, INVASIVE INTO RENAL VEIN AND RENAL

SINUS ADIPOSE TISSUE. (SEE COMMENT)

Renomedullary interstitial cell tumor (0.4 cm).

Margins of resection free of tumor.

Adrenal gland, no tumor present.

COMMENT

The renal cell carcinoma extensively Involves the renal sinus adipose tissue, including vascular-lymphatic invasion. The perinephrio
adipose tissue is free of tumor. The tumor invades into the renal vein and inferior vena cava. The tumor thrombus protrudes beyond the
renal vein margin; however, the wall of the renal vein at the margin is free of tumor.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) RIGHT KIDNEY, ADRENAL GLAND, AND INFERIOR VENA CAVA THROMBUS - An 18.0 x 9.0 x 7.5 cm radical nephrectomy specimen
with a 6.0 x1.8 x 0.9 cm adrenal gland.

There is a 8.0 x 5.0 x 4.5 cm poorly circumscribed yellow-tan, hemorrhagic tumor within the lower pole of the kidney. The tumor grossly
involves the renal hilum, invades into the renal vein, and protrudes beyond the renal vein margin. The perinephric adipose tissue
appears to be free of tumor. The renal artery and ureter are not involved by tumor.

Within the kidney parenchyma there is a 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm tan—white well-circumscribed nodule, located within the medulla. This nodule
is greater than 4 cm from the main tumor.

The adrenal gland is grossly unremarkable.

SECTION CODE: A‘l, renal vein margin; A2, renal artery and renal ureter margins; A3-A6, tumor in relationship to renal hilum; A7, A3,
tumor and normal kidney; A9, tumor in renal vein; A10, additional sections of tumor at renal hilum; A11. tan-white nodule submitted
entirely; A12, normal kidney; A13, normal adrenal gland.

Portions of tumor and normal parenchyma are submitted to the tissue bank. Tumor is also submitted for the Vaccine protocol. -'
