Final Diagnosis
LUNG LEFT UPPER LOBE, FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATJON BIOPSY:

- METASTATIC RENAL CELL CARCINOMA. SEE COMMENT.

Comment:

The aspirates are pauci-cellular and reveal rare small clusters of malignant epithelial coils in a background of blood. Only rare
reactive bronchial cells and sparse inflammatory cells are present. The tumor cells are large with abundant granular cytoplasm and
weil deﬁned cell borders. The nuclei are enlarged and mildly pleomorphic with moderately Irregular contours. coarse chromatin
and prominent central nucleoli. The morphologic ﬁndings are consistent with a renal cell carcinoma. To conﬁrm the diagnosis and
help exclude a primary lung tumor, we performed a panel of immunohistochemicai stains on the cell block material with the
iottowing results:

 

Antibody Usual reactivitv Resuit
CD10 Renal cell marker, Positive
Pan-keratin Epithelial marker Positive
CK T Epithelial marker Positive
OK 20 Epithelial marker Negative
RCC Renal ceil marker Negative
CD 68 Histiocyte marker Negative
TTF-‘l Pulmonary cell marker Negative

The immunohistochemical staining pattern supports the morphologic diagnosis. Positive staining for CD10 and pan keratin with
negative staining for CK 20 is consistent with renal cell carcinoma. Although CK? is often negative in most renai celi carcinomas.
positive staining can be seen in up to 113 of cases. Similarly, negative staining for R00 is seen in approximately 13% of cases.
Negative staining for CDGS indicated the tumor cells are not reactive pulmonary macrophages which can have similar morphology
in rare cases. Negative staining for TTF-l also rules against a diagnosis of a primary lung carcinoma. Overall, based on
‘ ' ‘ ' gs the ﬁnal diagnosis is that of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

ave reviewed this case and concur with the diagnosis.

Comment: . . . . _
Because of the minute size of the lesion and technical difficulty of this biopsy, a limited sampling was obtained. No

definitive evidence of malignancy identiﬁed. lmmunohistochemical stains for CD10, RCC and C063 are non-contributory.
Additional studies should be considered if clinically indicated.
