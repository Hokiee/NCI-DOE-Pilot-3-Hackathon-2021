CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
VI ex-smoker (40 pack-years) with a 2.9 cm RML adenocarcinoma.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in four parts, each labeled with the
patient's name.

1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'wedge superior segment right
lower lobe, stitch at nodule, freeze nodule, at 09:28‘. It consists

of a wedge biopsy of the lung measuring 10.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm. The
staple line measures 11 cm which is shaved and the parenchyma around
is inked blue. The pleura are gray pink glistening and reveal a pre

out which is marked with a stitch. The precut area of the pleura is
puckered and reveals a gray white ground glass nodule, measuring 0.8
x 0.8 cm located 2 cm from the staple line margin. The remainder of
the parenchyma is pink red blotchy and crepitant. No other nodule is
grossly identiﬁed. A frozen section is performed on the nodule
marked with a stitch and resubmitted for permanent section.
Representative sections are submitted.

2. Part two is received in saline, labeled 'right middle lobe'. It
consists of right middle lobe of the lung, measuring 16 x 9.5 x 3.2
cm. The bronchial margin measures 1.8 cm and the vascular margin
measures 1 cm at the hilum. The pleura is gray pink glistening and
moderately mottled with ﬁne black streaks. Also noted a precut and
puckered area on the pleura. Beneath the puckered area there is a
gray white subpleural ﬁrm nodule measuring 2.5 x 2 x l.5 cm,
located 1 cm from the staple line margin and 2 cm from the hilar
stricture. Cut surface of the nodule is gray tan and reveals some
necrotic are_a.wT_he_ remainder of the parenchymais pinkredblotchy ._ , .
and emphysematous. Multiple anthracotic lymph nodes measuring from
0.3 cm up to 0.6 cm in largest dimension are identiﬁed from the

hilar area. 80% of the nodule and representative section of the
specimen are submitted.

3. Part three is received in saline, labeled 'level 4 lymph node’.
It consists of ﬁve anthracotic lymph nodes measuring from 0.2 up to
0.8 cm. Entire lymph node is submitted in one cassette.

4. Part four is received in saline, labeled 'level 7 lymph node'.

It consists of two anthracotic lymph nodes measuring 0.5 and 0.8 cm
in greatest dimension. Entire two lymph nodes are submitted in one
cassette.

KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS

Referring Physician: ’

Body Site: Right lower lobe of lung
Specimen Type: Slides

Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma

RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12C (c.34G>T) mutation in codon 12
of the KRAS gene.

INTERPRETATION:

Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to correlate with poor
prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in
patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.

COMMENT:

KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking
history.

This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of

the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected.

This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and
codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn
embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been
established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung
carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other
tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of
pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.).

METHOD/LIMITATIONS:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is

selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantiﬁed
and ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS

Referring Physician;

Body Site: Right middle lobe of lung
Specimen Type: Slides

Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma

RESULTS: Wild-type gene.

INTERPRETATION:
No mutations were identiﬁed at codons l2 and 13 of the KRAS gene.

COMMENT:

Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor
prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
therapies in patients with non-small—cell lung cancer (N SCLC). KRAS

KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,

Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene ampliﬁcation status may provide
additional information regarding this patient's probability of
response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if

clinically indicated. See references.

EGFR Mutation Analysis

Referring Physician

Body Site: Right lower lobe of lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: No mutation detected.

INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identiﬁed in the sample provided
for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma

patients without identiﬁable mutations are reported to be

responsive to EGF R tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.

COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 90% tumor
cellularity upon pathologist review.

A frequently occurring sequence change 236lG>A (Q787Q) was
identiﬁed. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
signiﬁcance.

Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential
responsiveness or resistance to EGF R tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a
sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.

This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGF R tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell

,. (lung carcinoma(NSCLC) areexpected to. occur in these exons. , ,
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change

during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this
result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation
in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.

This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical signiﬁcance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.

METHOD/LIMITATION:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantiﬁed
and ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.
