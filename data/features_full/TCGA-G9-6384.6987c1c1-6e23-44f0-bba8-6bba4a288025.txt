GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES
Received fresh for frozen section tabeled with the patient‘s identiﬁcation and “right pelvic lymph nodes'
are multiple tan pink fragments of soft tissue aggregating to 5.5 x 3.5 x 1cm. The specimen is probed for
lymph nodes. Entirely submitted in FSAi-FSAZ.
B. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES
Received fresh for frozen section labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and 'left pelvic tymph nodes'
are muitipie tan pink fragments of soft tissue aggregating to 2.5 x 2 x 0.8cm. The specimen is probed for
tymph nodes. Entirely submitted in FSB.
C. PROSTATE
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "prostate" is an intact
prostateotomy specimen with white plastic catheter weighing 29 g and measuring 3.6 CM from right to
left, 3.5 CM from anterior to posterior, and 2.9 CM from apex to base. The capsule is smooth and red.
Ink code: Apex-red, anterior-orange, posterior—black, base-blue, right lateral—green, left Iaterai—yeiiow.
The apex and base are removed from the specimen to yieid a new weight of 12 g. The specimen is
serially sectioned from apex to base to Show a red inﬂamed area in the mid portion surrounding the
urethra measuring 2.5 x 1.8 x 0.8 CM. The remainder of the prostate parenchyma shows ﬁbrous tan
tissue. The right and left seminal vesicles, 3.2 x1.5 x 0.7, and 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.4 CM, respectively, are
bisected to show beige tan cystic tissue. The right and left vas deferens, 2.6 x 0.5, and 1.5 x 0.5 CM,
respectively, are serially sectioned to Show ﬁrm tan tube structure. A portion of the specimen is
submitted for tissue procurement, the remainder entirety submitted:

DIAGNOSIS:
A. LYMPH NODES, RIGHT PELVIS, BIOPSY:
~ELEVEN LYMPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (0/11)

B. LYMPH NODES, LEFT PELVIS, BIOPSY:
-THREE LYIVIPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (013)

C. PROSTATE, PROSTATECTOMY:
- PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA GLEASON SCORE 3+4 = 7,
iNVOLVING APPROXIMATELY 14% OF THE EXAMINED PROSTATIC TISSUE.
- CARCINOMA IS PRESENT FOCALLY AT THE LEFT APEX AND THE LEFT
LATERAL BASE WiTH EXTENSION INTO THE PERIPROSTATIC ADIPOSE
TISSUE (SEE NOTE)
- PERINEURAL INVASION IS IDENTiFIED
- NO SEMINAL VESICLE INVOLVEMENT IS PRESENT
- SURGICAL MARGIN NEGATIVE

 

- SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT.

NOTE: There is carcinoma present in the left apex measuring less than 1 mm from the inked
anterior/posterior margin, and carcinoma present in the left lateral base with extension into the
periprostatic adipose tissue 1.5 mm from the inked anterior and posterior margins. Clinical and
radiographio correlation and is warranted.
