SPECIMEN
A. KIDNEY - 1. Left kidney - Not in formalin

CLINICAL INFORMATION
Mass — left kidney

GROSS DESCRIPTION
The specimen is received fresh labeled eft kidney” and consists of a 560 gm, 15.7 x

11.6 x 5.8 cm kidney encased in perirenal fat. The specimen is bivalved to reveal a 13.1 x 7.6 cm tan—red
kidney with a 5.9 x 4.7 x 4.6 cm bright yellow, partially hemorrhagic and cystic, well-circumscribed mass
occupying the upper pole. Representative sections of tumor and benign kidney are submitted for the
TCGA genome project. The remainder of the kidney is placed into formalin and fixed overnight. The hilar
structures are identified and opened and reveal no gross involvement by tumor. A shave margin of the
ureter and hilar vessels are removed. A search for hilar lymph nodes does not show any recognizable
lymph node structures. The perirenal fat overlying the tumor is inked black. Serial sectioning through the
tumor demonstrates the tumor to be grossly confined to the renal cortex and within the renal capsule. No
involvement or invasion through the renal capsule is identified. However, the tumor does extend to the
renal capsule and abuts the capsule grossly. Sectioning shows no involvement of the tumor into the renal
pelvis or renal vasculature. The tumor lies 0.3 cm from the nearest renal pelvis, 1.4 cm from the closest
renal vein, and 0.6 cm from the nearest renal artery. The cut surface of the tumor demonstrates a bright
yellow, partially cystic and hemorrhagic surface with focal areas of calcification. The remainder of the
kidney uninvolved by tumor demonstrates an unremarkable tan—red cut surface with well-defined
corticomedullaryjunctions, with an average cortical thickness of 0.8 cm.

 

SLIDE KEY:

A1 — hilar vessels and ureter

A2 — hilar fat

A3-A6 — tumor in areas closest to renal capsule

A7 —— tumor closest to renal pelvis

A8 — tumor adjacent to benign kidney with closest renal artery

A9 — beniin uninvolved kidney

 

 

 

 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Representative H&E-stained tissue sections were examined that show a neoplastic proliferation of clear
cells with moderate to large amounts of lightly eosinophilic to clear cytoplasm and nuclei that are small to
slightly increased in size. Many of the nuclei are round and regular with smooth nuclear membranes and
indistinct nucleoli (Fuhrman nuclear grade 1). Other nuclei are slightly enlarged, have slightly irregular
nuclear membranes, and discernible nucleoli at 400x (Fuhrman nuclear grade 2). Please see the
following Cancer Case Summary for specific details.
