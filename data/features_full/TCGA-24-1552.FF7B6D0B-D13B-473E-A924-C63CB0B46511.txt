. . ESURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

 

 

By this signature. I attest that the above diagnosis is based upon my personal
examination of the slides(and/or other material indicated in the diagnosis).

”Report Electronically Reviewed and Signed Out By

Intraoperatye Consultation:

ES - Soft tissue, cul-de-sac - "Adenocarcinoma,"

Microscopiipescririion and Comment:

A poorly differentiated papillary serous adenocarcinoma is seen
arising from the left ovary. The tumor subtotally replaces the
left ovary with prominent lymphovascular space involvement.
Metastatic serous adenocarcinoma is seen in the omentum with the
largest implant measuring 17 cm in greatest dimension. Tumor
implants are identified on the uterine serosa, pelvic soft tissue
and peritoneum as well. Tumor is identified on the serosal surface
of the right fallopian tube. The right ovary, endometrium,
cervix, and left fallopian tube are free of tumor. The nodule
noted grossly on the right ovary proved to represent corpora
albicans histologically. The right fallopian tube demonstrates
scarring with dystrophic calcification as evidence of chronic
inflammation. Exuberant squamous metaplasia is seen in the
cervix. Benign leiomyomas are identified within the myometrium.
The endometrium is atrophic. The additionally submitted appendix
is unremarkable and free of tumor.

History:

The patient is a year old woman with a pelvic mass. Operative
procedure: Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo—
oophorectomy, appendectomy and omentectomy.

An intraoperative nonvmicr0scopic consultation was obtained and
interpreted as: Called to open a uterus with attached ovaries and
tubes. The serosal surface and parametrial soft tissue show
involvement with tumor implants. The uterus is bivalved in the OR
to show a scant endometrial surface. A flat surface lesion
consistent with being polyps is present, by

Gross Description;

The specimens are received in six containers of formalin, labeled
with the patient's name. The first container is labeled
"cul—de—sac biopsy, F51." It contains a 1.1 x 0.3 cm, tan-White
to yellow tissue fragment. Labeled FSl. Jar O.

The second container is additionally labeled "uterus, cervix and
BSO." It contains an 8 cm superior to inferior, 5.2 cm
cornu-to—cornu and 4.5 cm anterior to posterior 137 gm uterus with
attached right and left ovaries and fallopian tubes. There is a
2.7 cm subserosal myoma with an adherent 7.5 x 4 cm fragment of
omentum replaced by tumor. The serosa contains other small 0.2 to
0.4 cm tumor implants and a second fragment of attached 2.5 x 2.2
cm omentum replaced by tumor adherent to the serosal surface. The
cervix is tan, smooth and unremarkable. The endocervical canal is
roughened, tan, and lush. The endometrial cavity measures 3.2 x
2.5 and the endometrium measures up to 0.2 cm with the
aforementioned flat polyp measuring 2 cm present in the anterior
endometrial cavity. The myometrium measures up to 3.2 cm with
multiple tan—white, whorled, well—demarcated nodules measuring up
to 1.5 cm. The right ovary measures 1.2 cm in diameter and
contains a 0.2 cm firm, white, serosal nodule. The right
fallopian tube measures 4.2 x 0.5 cm and is unremarkable. Cut
section of the ovary is solid, tan—yellow-white. The left ovary
measures 2.8 x 1.6 X 0.9 cm. Cut section is solid, tan—white with
focal areas of papillations and surface tumor implants. The left
fallopian tube measures 4.2 x 0.5 cm and is unremarkable. Labeled:
C1, C2 - anterior cervix and endocervix; C3, C4 « posterior
cervix, endocervix; El - lower uterine segment; E2 and E3 —
anterior endometrium/myometrium; E4, E5 - posterior
endometrium/myometrium (ES contains serosal tumor implant); M —
myoma; RO — right ovary; RT — right fallopian tube; L01 through
L03 - left ovary; LT ~ left fallopian tube.

The third container is labeled "omentum." It contains two tumor
implants measuring 17 x 10 x 4 and 11 x 6 x 3 cm. Labeled: A1
through A3. Jar 5.

 

The fourth container is labeled "tumor." It contains a 10 x 5 x 3

) .;|cAL PATHOLOGY REPORT -‘ 7

cm aggregate of omentum replaced by tumor implants. Labeled B.

The fifth container is labeled "appendix." It contains an 8.5 x
0.7 cm vermiform appendix with attached fat. The serosa is tan
and smooth without tumor implants. Cut section is unremarkable.
No tumor identified. The lumen contains what appears to be
barium. Labeled DI and D2. Jar l.

 

The sixth container is labeled "peritoneal implant." It contains
a 6.5 x 4.8 x 0.5 cm fattv. serosal specimen, subtotally replaced
by tumor. Labeled G.
