Patient with large mass upper Central breast, core biopsy positive
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Left breast cancer

POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: Same

TYPE OF PROCEDURE: Left mass and axillary node dissection

Gross Description

The specimen is labeled "LEFT BREAST AND AXILLARY NODES " and is received in formalin. It consist
of mastectomy specimen with lymph nodes weighing 1330 grams and measuring 27 x 19 x 11 cm with brown
skin ellipse measuring 24 x 13 cm, containing grossly unremarkable 1.8 cm in diameter nipple. The posterior
margin is composed of smooth fascia which is inked black. Superior non-deep margin is inked with red ink and
the inferior non-deep margin is inked with blue ink. The breast is slices in sagittal planes revealing a large well
deﬁned pink-tan lobulated mass measuring 9 x 7 x 6 cm and is located central portion of the breast and
extending upper inner and lower inner quadrant. This mass is 1.5 cm away from the deep fascial margin of
resection, 1.5 cm from the superior non-deep fascial margin and 2 cm from the inferior nonvdeep fascia margin
of resection. The remaining portions reveal unremarkable yellow mammary fat with streaks of white-gray
mammary parenchyma. The axillary fat pad measuring 10 x 10 x 5 cm. On sectioning multiple lymph nodes are
identiﬁed. The largest lymph node is consists of a 2 matted lymph nodes measuring 4 x 3 x 3 cm and is pink tan
and ﬁrm in consistency for 3.5 cm. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

A1 = nipple

A2—A5 a mass

A 6 == mass closest deep fascial margin of resection

A7 = representative sections upper outer quadrant

A8 ~ representative sections lower outer quadrant

A 9 == mass with closest skin surface

A 10 == six lymph. nodes

A 11 = bisection of a single lymph node

A 12 == bisection of a single lymph node

A 13 = bisection of a single lymph node

A 14»: bisection of a single lymph node

A 15 a bisection ofa single lymph node -

A 16 = bisection of a single lymph node

A 17 a bisection of a single lymph node

A 18 = bisection of a single lymph node

A lQ-A 20 = representative sections of 2 matted lymph nodes

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL EVALUATION OF ESTROGEN RECEPTORS, PROCESTERONE,
RECEPTORS, AN D HER-ZNEU IN INVASIVE MAMMARY CARCINOMA .

   
  
  

ESTROGEN RECEPTORS: 99 %, positive, moderate staining intensity.
PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS: <1 %, negative, moderate staining intensity.

HER-ZNEU: SCORE 1+, negative.

lmmunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin ﬁxed parafﬁn embedded tissue (Block A4) using the
following monoclonal antibodies: Estrogen receptor (Clone SP1), Progesterone receptor (Clone 1152) and
Her-Zneu ( Clone 435); control sections for HER— 2Neu are provided within a kit (score 0 MCF-‘I, score
1+ T47D, score 2+ MDA—MB—45 3 score 3+ BT474). Detection system used. polymer Primary antibodies,
reagents and control sections for HER-Zneu are all provided by

All controls show appropriate reactivity.

Reactivity of Estrogen and Progesterone receptors is determined based on the percentage of positively
stained nuclei of tumor cells. Reference values (CAP accreditation program checklist 2010 and guidelines on
webpage):

Positive: nuclear staining in 1% or greater than 1% of invasive carcinoma cells

Negative: nuclear staining in less than 1% of invasive carcinoma cells

Staining intensity: is reported as weak, moderate or strong.

}IER.2neu reggtlvlty is reported applying the CAP scoring guidelines (CAP accreditation program checklist
2010 and guidelines on webpage):

Score 0 =- Negative: No immunoreactivity, or faint weak: immunoreactivity in <10% of tumor cells but only a
portion of the membrane is positive.

Score 1 =- Negative: Faint weak immunoreactivity in 10% or >10% of tumor cells but only a portion of the
membrane is positive.

Score 2+ = Equivocal; Weak to moderate complete membrane immunoreactivity in >10% of mar cells or
circumferential intense membrane staining in <30% of cells.

Score 3+ = Positive: More than 30% of the tumor cells must show circumferential intense and uniform
membrane staining. A homogeneous (chicken wire) pattern should be present.

Equivocal results for HER—Zneu (Score 2+) will be subsequently followed by a reﬂex dual-color ISH testing.
