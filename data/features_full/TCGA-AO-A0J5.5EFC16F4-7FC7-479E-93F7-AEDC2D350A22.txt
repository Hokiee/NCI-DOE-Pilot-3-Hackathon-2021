content level 1 1 It onsi t breast h tached
axillary contents. The breast asures 20 cm 0 rl ng ski
ellips suring 8 x . . Si at entrally 0 th ki surface is
a fixed, racted nipple measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. The surrounding

an ret
skin is markedly thickened (up to 0.6 cm). A suture demarcates the axillary
contents which measures 7 x 5 x 2 cm. The posterior surface of the breast is

 

   

 

 

 
 

inked black and the anterior blue. Part of the posterior surface of the
breast is covered by dark red skeletal muscle, measuring 11 x 4 x 0.5 cm.
'The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal an irregular tumor bed (10 x
8.3 x 5.1 cm) with poorly defined white, firm and tan areas. The tumor bed
occupies almost the entire breast volume, extending throughout all four
quadrants. The tumor bed is located 0.2 cm from the posterior margin, 0.3 cm
from the anterior margin, and 0.5 cm from the skeletal muscle. The remaining
breast tissue shows yellow fatty areas with foci of fibrosis. The axillary
tissue is dissected to reveal 13 possible lymph nodes, ranging in size from
0.4 cm to 1.2 cm. Representative sections are submitted. All dissected lymph
nodes are entirely submitted. The specimen is photographed. Tissue is
submitted to TPS.
