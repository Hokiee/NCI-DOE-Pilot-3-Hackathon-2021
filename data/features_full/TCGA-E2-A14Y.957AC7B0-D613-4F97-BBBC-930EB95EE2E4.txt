E. RIGHT BREAST

Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and "right breast" is an oriented 4669, 17.5 x 16 x 2.5 cm
mastectomy with a 7.5 x 3.2 cm skin ellipse and 1.5 cm everted nipple. Ink code: Anterior/superior—blue,
anterior/inferior-orange. posterior-black. The specimen is serially sectioned into 12 slices from lateral to medial with
nipple in slice 8 revealing a 2.7 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm white-tan ﬁrm inﬁltrating mass in the mid upper breast in slices 7-9 that
is closest to the anterior margin at 0.5 cm. There is a clip located within the mass. Adjacent to the mass is a biopsy
site with biopsy clip and surrounding granular tissue spanning ~ 4 cm in slices 4-7 in the upper outer quadrant.
Tissue is procured. Representatively submitted:
