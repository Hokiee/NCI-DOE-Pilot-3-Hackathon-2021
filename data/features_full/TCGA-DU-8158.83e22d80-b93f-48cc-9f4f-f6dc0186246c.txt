PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:

 

A. BRAIN, LEFT FRONTAL, EXCISIONAL BIOPSIES: ASTROCYTOMA WITH

ATYPICAL FEATURES.
B. BRAIN, LEFT FRONTAL, EXCISION: ASTROCYTOMA WITH ANAPLASTIC

FEATURES. MIB—l PROLIFERATION INDEX: 2% TO 3%.
C. BRAIN, LEFT FRONTAL, EXCISION: ASTROCYTOMA WITH ATYPICAL

FEATURES.

SEE MICROSCOPIC AND COMMENT.

Operation/Specimen: Brain, left frontal.

Clinical History and Pre~0p DX: .year old woman,with past history of
difficulty in communicating, probably dysphasic, has a 7 cm,

enhancing,
cystic left frontal tumor.

GROSS PATHOLOGY:
A. Received fresh, one fragment of brain tissue, 1.1 cm across.
Firm,
glistening, tannish—gray. Bisected, in total #1 and 2, frozen
tissue #3.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, left frontal:

1. Smears: Glial proliferation and lymphocytes.
2. Frozen sections: Glial proliferation, consistent with glioma.

B. Received fresh, one fragment, 3.5 x 2.2 x 1.8 cm. Firm,
homogeneously glistening and tannish—gray, with focal areas of
hemorrhage. Serially sectioned, in total #5u9, frozen tissue

#4.
INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, left frontal:

l. Smears: Atypical glial proliferation, consistent with glioma.
2 Frozen sections: Glioma.

C. Received fresh, three fragments, 1.3 cm across in aggregate.
Soft, tannish—gray, glistening. In total #10—12.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, left frontal, smears:

 

Astrocytoma with abnormal vessels.

MICROSCOPIC: Portions of a glial neoplastic proliferation that is
diffusely and heavily infiltrating the brain parenchyma, including
cerebral cortex and white matter. The neoplastic cells have round or
ovoid nuclei with prominent single nucleolus. The background is
heavily fibrillary, and has a capillaryntype vasculature. There are
no

mitotic figures, microvascular cellular proliferation, or necrosis.

B. Portions of a glial neoplastic proliferation similar to that one
described for part A. In here, the neoplasm becomes more cellular,
the

nuclei become hyperchromatic and moderately pleomorphic, and
gemistocytic phenotype is present throughout the tumor. Mitotic
figures are present, but are found with difficulty. There is a sparse
lymphoid infiltrate, better appreciated in some perivascular areas.

C. Portions of brain diffusely infiltrated by a glial neoplastic
proliferation. The neoplasm is similar to that one described for
parts

A and B. However, in here the neoplasm is less cellular, although
still has the anaplastic nuclear features. Mitotic figures although
present, are rather inconspicuous, and microvascular cellular
proliferation and necrosis are absent.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP and MIB—l
were
performed on sections from block 5 and 6.

The GFAP demonstrates the heavy and diffuse gliofibrilogenesis of
the neoplasm. With the MIB—l, proliferative indices of 2% to 3% were
determined in the more active areas.

COMMENT: The neoplasm has a heavily fibrillary astrocytic phenotype.
There are focal prominent hypercellularity and nuclear anaplasia, very
sparse mitotic activity, low MIB—l proliferation indices, and absent
microvascular cellular proliferation and necrosis. These
morphological

features suggest an anaplastic transformation of a low grade
astrocytoma.
