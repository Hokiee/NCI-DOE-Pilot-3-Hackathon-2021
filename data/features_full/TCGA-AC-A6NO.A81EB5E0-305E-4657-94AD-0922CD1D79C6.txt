Microecoplc Examination
#1,2 Microscopic examination performed. —

Comment

The breast is extensively involved by DCIS, over an area that spans all four
quadrants and involves most of the breast. Scattered throughout the DICS are
four discrete foci of invasive ductal carcinoma, all with identical histology.
