. Stomach; gastrectomy:
Chronic gastritis. no evidence of dysplasia or maiignancy.
Extensive fat necrosis of the perigastric adipose tissue.

E. Small bowel; resection: =
Small bowel with no signiﬁcant histopathologic abnormality.

COMMENTS:
Histologic sections show invasive carcinoma composed of small nests of inﬁitrative malignant glands. The tumor is relatively limited in amount and is

immediately adjacent to the pancreatic duct All surgical margins and lymph nodes are negative for tumor. The specimens labeled as peritoneal implant
(specimens A and B) as well as the perigastric adipose tissue show extensive fat necrosis but no evidence of metastatic tumor.
