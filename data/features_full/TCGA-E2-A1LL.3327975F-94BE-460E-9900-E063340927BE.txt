GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. ADDITIONAL AXILLARY NODES LEFT
Received in formalin are multiple tan-pink fragments of ﬁbrofatty tissue aggregating to 4.0 x 4.0 x 2.0
cm. Dissection reveals 7 possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm to 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm.
A1: 4 possible lymph nodes
A2: 4 possible lymph nodes
A3: 2 possible lymph nodes

B. LEFT BREAST WITH AXILLARY CONTENTS LEVELS 1 & 2
Received fresh is a 2,422 gm oriented radical mastectomy specimen, 31 x 27 x 10 cm. The specimen
is partially surfaced with a tan-brown ellipse of skin, 27 x 14.5 cm. The centrally located darkened
areola rim measures 3.0 cm and the partially ﬂattened nipple measures 1.0 cm. The skin surface is
remarkable for a gray-white linear well healed scar, 3.5 cm in length and measuring 6.0 cm from the
nipple in the upper outer quadrant. The specimen is inked as follows: anterior/superior-blue,
anterior/inferior-orange. posterior-black. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into
13 slices; slice 1 being most medial, slice 13 being most lateral. The nipple is located in slice four. The
cut surface reveals a gray-white ﬁrm/necrotic ill deﬁned mass located in the upper outer central outer
quadrant in slice 6, 7 8 and 9, measuring 0.6 cm from the closest deep margin. The mass measures
9.0 x 8.0 x 4.0 cm. and corresponds to the scar on the skin surface. The remainder of the specimen
reveals yellow lobulated adipose tissue interdispersed with gray-white ﬁbrous tissue. The axillary tail
measures 8.0 x 5.0 x 4.0 cm. Dissection reveals 27 possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1
cm to 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. Slice 11 and 12 are remarkable for 3 large ﬁrm lymph nodes, ranging from 1.0
x 0.8 x 0.8 cm to 5.0 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm. Portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

81: 1 lymph node, serially sectioned slice 11

82-85: 1 lymph node. serially sectioned slice 11 & 12

86-812: 1 lymph node, serially sectioned slice 11 & 12

ER: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0
PR: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0

 

COMMENT:

The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the
proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of
cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak
intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining). with a scoring
range from 0 to 8.

ER/PR positive is deﬁned as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is deﬁned as an Allred score
of less than or equal to 2.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
lmmunohistochemistry was performed usina the mouse anti-human ER (ER 105, 1:100) and PR (PGR
136, 1:100) provided by . following the manufacturer 3 instructions. This
assay was not modiﬁed. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published
results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal
review of staining performance.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
Her2 analvsis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit 1

, using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modiﬁed. External kit-slides

provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high. low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-
house known HER2 ampliﬁed control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well
preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identiﬁed for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2
immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided
by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.

This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from
ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology
Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance.
