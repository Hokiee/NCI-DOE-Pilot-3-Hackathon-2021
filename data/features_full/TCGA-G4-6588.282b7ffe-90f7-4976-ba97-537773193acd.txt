SPECIMEN(S):
A. LIVER NODULE
B. RIGHT COLON

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. LIVER NODULE
Received fresh for frozen section is a tan pink soft tissue fragment 0.3cm. Toto FSA.
B. RIGHT COLON
Received is a segment of right colon measuring 19.0 cm long with average circumference of 7.0 cm. Its
proximal end is still attached to the terminal ileum (4 cm long with a 3.0 cm circumference). The
appendix is 6 cm long with a 0.6 cm diameter. There is a cecal mucosa based mass, 7cm from the
terminal ileum margin and 11 cm from the distal colonic margin. Both margins are free of tumor or any
additional findings. The mass is exophytic, tan color, with a rolled edge, which is sharply defined from
the adjacent mucosa. The mass is also circular and measures 4.0 cm in diameter and < 1 cm in depth
(limited to muscularis propria on cross sectioning). On the radial aspect, black ink was applied. The
mesocolon attached is grossly unremarkable, and measures approximately 1-5 cm in thickness. The
remaining ileal and colonic mucosa shows no significant pathology. Summary of blocks:

B1: terminal ileum margin

B2: distal colon margin

B3-Bfo: tumor

Bf 1: appendix with bisected tips and complete cross section and small lymph nodes

Bf 2: contains fat nearest to the tumor invasion area, which is inked black â€”

also contains lymph nodes

B13-B20: possible nodes

DIAGNOSIS:
A. LIVER, NODULE, BIOPSY:
- MINIMALLY ATYPICAL EPITHELIOID CELL PROLIFERATION.
- SEE COMMENT
- NEGATIVE FOR COLORECTAL CARCINOMA

B. RIGHT COLON, HEMICOLECTOMY:
- INVASIVE, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA WITH
FOCAL MUCINOUS FEATURES.
- TUMOR INVADES INTO SUBSEROSAL TISSUE
- SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR
- SEE TEMPLATE
- FIFTEEN LYMPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/15)

COMMENT: The liver nodule shows a proliferation of relatively bland epithelioid cells separated by a
fibrovascular stroma. Unfortunately, the tissue is largely absent on permanent sections and can only be
seen well on the frozen section. Ancillary studies like IHC are not possible. The epithelioid cells may
represent histiocytes or potentially a hyperplastic mesothelial proliferation. There is no evidence of
carcinoma, and I favor a benign process in this nodule. Correlation with clinical findings is
recommended.

Microsatellite instability testing has been ordered on the colon tumor. Those results will be issued in a
separate report.

SUMMARY OF IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY/SPECIAL STAINS

Material: Specimen B
Population: Tumor Cells

Stain/Marker:Result: Comment:

MLH1 Positive
MSH2 Positive
PMS2 Negative
MSH6 Positive

The interpretation of the above immunohistochemistry stain or stains is guided by published results in
the medical literature, provided package information from the manufacturer and by internal review of
staining performance and assay validation within the Immunohistochemistry Laboratory of the. The use
of one or more reagents in the above tests is regulated as an analyte specific reagent (ASR). These
tests were developed and their performance characteristic determined by the Department of Pathology
Laboratory at. They have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.
The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.

Special stains and/or immunohistochemical stains were performed with appropriately stained positive
and negative controls.

INTERPRETATION: No PMS2 expression identified.

The results of microsatellite instability testing will be issued as a separate report.
