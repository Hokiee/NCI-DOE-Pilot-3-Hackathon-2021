Right fallopian tube oxhlbitaznc significant nbnormaility
Left fallopian tube axhibita:no significant abnormality
Bilateral ovarian reveal metastatic endometrioid endometrial
carcinoma.
Comment: The tumor displays at least two distinct morphologien: well
differentiated endomattioid and high grade, nolid, upindled. and
transitional-cell like endometrioid adenocarcinomn.

NOTE: THERE IS METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO BOTH OVARIHS. INCLUDING COLOHIZATION
0F BILATERAL ADENOFIBROMAB. ADDITIONAL IMMUNOSTAINS FOR HICROSATBLLITB
INSTABILITY TESTIHG ARE PENDING AND WILL BE REPORTED AS AN ADDENDUH.

- BENIGN SKIN AND FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE.

3. LYMPR NODES, RIGHT EXTERNAL ILIAC, EXCISION:
- HBTASTATIC ENDOHETRIOID ENDOMRTRIAL CARCIROMA T0 MATTBD LYMPH HOD8(S).

I ATTEET THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPOR HY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/0R OTHER MATERIAL). AND THAT I HAVE REVIEHBD AHD APPROVED
