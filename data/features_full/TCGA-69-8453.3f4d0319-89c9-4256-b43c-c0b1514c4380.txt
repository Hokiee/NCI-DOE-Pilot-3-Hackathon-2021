SURGlCAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Gross Descrigtion:
A. Received fresh for frozen section labeled "4R" are multiple fragments of brown-black soft tissue
aggregating to 1.7 x 1.4 x 0.2 cm. Totally submitted in cassette A1 for frozen section.

B. Received fresh frozen section labeled "7“ are multiple fragments of red soft tissue measuring 1.3 x
0.3 x 0.3 cm in aggregate. Totally submitted in cassette Bi for frozen section.

C. Received in formalin labeled "right lower lobe wedge of superior segment" is a specimen consisting
of a large pulmonary wedge weighing 223 grams, and measuring 13 x 11 x 4.5 cm. A bronchial remnant
measures 1.2 cm in diameter and 0.8 cm in length. The pleural surface shows adhesions and an area of
puckering with underlying firm mass. Three stapled margins are present measuring 3, 4 and 6.5 cm in
length and are inked orange. The pleural surface overlying the mass is inked blue. On sectioning, a
fleshy tan lobulated mass measuring 7.5 x 6.4 x 4.7 cm is present abutting the pleura with pleural
puckering and thickened. The mass is located 0.6 cm from the closet resection margin and 0.5 cm from
bronchial margin. The remainder of the uninvolved parenchyma is pink-red. Sections are submitted as
follows: C1 bronchial margin for frozen evaluation, CZ vascular margin, 03—06 tumor with overlying
pleura, C7 tumor in relation to bronchus, C8439 tumor with closest resection margin (orange), C10
tumor, C11 uninvolved lung parenchyma, 012-013 bronchial lymph nodes.

D. Received in formalin labeled "pleura adjacent to right lower lobe" is an irregular segment of pleura
with adhered soft tissue measuring 12 x 6 x 0.5 cm. Cross sections reveal an unremarkable cut
surface. Representative sections are submitted in formalin in cassettes D1 and DZ.

E. Received fresh on Telfa gauze labeled "Level 11" is a tan anthracotic nodule measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x
0.2 cm. The specimen is totally submitted in cassette E1.

F. Received fresh on Telfa gauze labeled "#7" are multiple irregular anthracotic nodules aggregating to 2
x 2 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is totally submitted in formalin in cassette F1.

G. Received fresh on Telfa gauze labeled ”R9" is a solitary irregular anthracotic nodule measuring 0.7 x
0.5 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is totally submitted in cassette G1.

H. Received fresh on Telfa gauze labeled "R8" is a anthracotic nodule envelope and soft yellow adipose
tissue measuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is totally submitted in cassette H1.

l. Received fresh on Telfa gauze labeled "11R" is a solitary anthracotic nodule measuring 1 x 0.7 x 0.5
cm. The nodule is totally submitted in formalin in cassette l1.

J. Received fresh on Telfa gauze labeled "#7" are multiple irregular anthracotic nodules aggregating to 2
x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.. The nodules are totally submitted in formalin in cassette J1.

K. Received fresh on Telfa gauze labeled "#7" is a gray soft nodule measuring 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. The
nodules are totally submitted in formalin in cassette K1.
