SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

 

Clinical Diagnosis E History:

RLQ tenderness, CT scan revealed mass at hepatic flexure at colon and mass
at segment 7. Colonoscopy revealed mass of colon. Biopsy shown increased
lymphoplasmacytic infiltration at lamina propria. Carcinoma of hepatic
flexure with liver mass.

Specimens Submitted:

1: Lymph node, base of superior mesentery artery, excision -
2: Lymph node, middle colic, excision -

3: Colon, right, hemi-colectomy

DIAGNOSIS:
l. Lymph node, base of superior mesentery artery, excision

-Metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in one of two lymph
nodes (1/2).

2. Lymph node, middle colic, excision -
-One benign lymph node (0/1).

3. Colon, right, hemi-colectomy:

Total number examined: 72
Tumor deposits in pericolorectal soft tissue:
Identified
Identified; number:l
Tumor Staging (AJCC 7th Edition):
pT3 (Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into
pericolorectal tissues)
Lymph Node Stage (AJCC 7th Edition):
N2b (Metastasis in seven or more regional lymph nodes)

Note: Results of immunohistochemical staining for DNA mismatch repair
proteins are as follows:

MLHl: Staining present in tumor

MSH2: Staining present in tumor

MSH6: Staining present in tumor

PMS2: Staining present in tumor

Conclusion:Immunohistochemical staining for the tested DNA mismatch repair
proteins is retained in the tumor.

Some of the immunohistochemistry and ISH tests were developed and their
performance characteristics were determined by the Department of Pathology.
They have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is
not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not
be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified
under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of - (CLIA ' - as
qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

Gross Description:

1. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section labeled "base of
superior mesenteric artery lymph node" are two lymph nodes each measure 0.5
cm greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted for frozen
section.

Summary of sections:
FSC-frozen section control

â€”n-

2. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section labeled "middle colic
lymph node" is a 1.0 cm lymph node. The lymph node is bisected and entirely
summit of the frozen section.

Summary of sections:
FSC-frozen section control

3). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right hemi-colectomy" and
consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum and ascending colon. The
terminal ileum measures 14 cm in length and 3 cm in circumference at the
proximal resected margin. The remaining colon measures 40 in length with a
circumference of 6 cm at the distal resected margin. The appendix is not
present. The intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth. Focally hemorrhagic
lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the specimen
measuring up to 5 cm in thickness. The specimen is opened to reveal a
circumferential mass lesion measuring 6 cm in length and 8 cm in width. The
mass is located in the cecum, 23 cm from the proximal margin and 15 cm from
the distal margin. Sectioning shows that the tumor invades the fat. The
depth of invasion is 1.8 cm grossly. Right underneath the mass is a 4 x 2.5
x 2 cm conglomerate of five nodules with yellow/white cut surface (distance
from tumor surface to the deepest portion of the conglomerate is 4.8 cm).
The remaining mucosa is unremarkable. The specimen is submitted for lymph
node dissection. The attached adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all
identified lymph nodes are submitted. Representative sections of the
specimen are submitted for permanent sections and for TPS.

Summary of sections:

P - proximal margin shave

D - distal margin shave

T - tumor

RS -representative sections

LN - lymph nodes

BLN - bisected lymph nodes

C - conglomerate of 5 nodes, representative section
