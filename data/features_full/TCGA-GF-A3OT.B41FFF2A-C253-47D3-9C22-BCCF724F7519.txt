Two of six discernible discrete lymph nodes positive for metastatic
melanoma.

D. Right back lesion: Skin, excision:
Compound nevus with architectural disorder (dysplastic nevus) and mild to
moderate cytologic atypia, margins free with adjacent seborrheic keratosis.

The examination of this case material and the preparation of this report were
performed by the staff pathologist.

Note:

C: The adjacent scar suggests that this is locally recurrent disease.

DIF was also performed. Granular lgM is noted at the basement membrane zone
which is a nonspecific finding. if there is continuing concern to establish a
diagnosis of lupus in this patient, correlation with serologic studies as well

as lesional biopsy should be considered.

Gross Description:
The specimen is received in four parts each labeled with the patient name.

 

Part A received fresh for Procurement with acquisition of tissue labeled
"axillary brachial plexus mass" and consists of a irregular, lobulated, rubbery
mass which has dimensions of 10.2 x 7.4 x 5.6 cm. The external surface is
gray-yellow to red-brown, smooth and glistening to shaggy with focal cautery
effect. The specimen is received previously incised. The specimen is inked and
further sectioned to reveal a pink-tan to red-black, focally granular, focally
myxoid, focally hemorrhagic and focally degenerated cut surface. This process
extends to the inked external surface at numerous sites. Also, within the fat at
the periphery there are seven discrete lymph nodes identiﬁed that range from
0.4 to 2.2 cm in greatest dimension. The two larger lymph nodes are grossly
positive. Representative sections are submitted as labeled:

A1—4 mass;

A5 three lymph nodes submitted in toto;

A6,7 representative sections of two grossly positive lymph nodes;

A8 two lymph nodes submitted in toto. ‘

Part B received in formalin labeled "brachial plexus sheath" and consists of an
aggregate of irregular, ragged, gray-yellow to red-brown soft tissues which has
dimensions of 4.0 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm. The soft tissues are remarkable for myxoid and
hemorrhagic foci. Representative sections are submitted in cassette B.

Part C received in formalin labeled "excision melanoma left arm proximal 12
o'clock" and consists of an ellipse of gray-tan, wrinkled skin which has
dimensions of 11.6 x 5.2 cm and is excised to a maximal depth of 2.4 cm. The
specimen is received with a suture at the proximal/12 o'clock tip. The specimen
is inked in the following manner: 12 to 6 o‘clock-blue, 6 to 12 o‘clock-black
and deep-red. The epidermis is remarkable for a central, gray-tan, raised lesion
which has dimensions of 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm. This lesion is 2.0 cm from the
nearest 2 o‘clock margin. Additionally, there is some mottling surrounding this
lesion. Additionally, there is a irregular, ill-deﬁned area of hypopigmented
skin adjacent to this lesion (3 o'clock side) which has dimensions of 1.0 x 1.0
cm and is 1.2 cm from the nearest 3 o'clock margin and 0.6 cm from the
previously described lesion. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a
gray-yellow, lobulated, glistening cut surface. The cut surface of the lesion is
pink-tan and ﬂeshy with focal granularity. This lesion extends to within 1.9 cm
of the nearest deep margin. Representative sections are submitted as labeled:

C1 12 o'clock tip;

C2 6 o'clock tip;

C3-38 central cross-sections to include bisected contiguous

sections in cassette C3 and C4, CS and 06, C7 and C8 and trisected contiguous
sections in cassette 09-11, 012-14, C15-17, 018-20, C21-23, 024-26, 027-29,
030—32, 033-35, 036-38. Tissue submitted in cassette C3-38 are submitted
sequentially from 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock.

Part D received in formalin labeled "right back lesion" and consists of an

ellipse of gray-tan, wrinkled skin which has dimensions of 1.5 x 0.6 cm and is
excised to a maximal depth of 0.4 cm. The epidermis is remarkable for a central,
gray-brown, mottled and somewhat granular lesion which has dimensions of 0.4 x

 

 

 

 

 

 

0.4 byjust less than 0.2 cm. This lesion extends to within 0.1 cm of the
nearest cutaneous margin. The specimen is inked, serially sectioned to reveal a
gray-tan, fibrous cut surface. This lesion extends to within 0.6 cm of the
nearest deep margin. The specimen is entirely submitted as labeled:
D1 tips;
D2 central cross-sections.
