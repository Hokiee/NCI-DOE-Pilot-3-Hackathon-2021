B. FINAL DISTAL RECTAL MARGIN

SPECIMEN(S):
A. LOW ANTERIOR RESECTION OF RECTAL CANCER
B. FINAL DISTAL RECTAL MARGIN

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:
A— An ulcerative tumor mass, 9 x 7 .5 cm, involving the colon circumferentially. 3 cm from the distal
margin of resection called by Dr. to Dr. at 1 :00 pm.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. LOW ANTERIOR RESECTION OF RECTAL CANCER
Received fresh is a 30-cm closed segment of colon. The serosa is smooth. There is a suture marking
the distal margin; this region is inked black. Specimen is opened; approximately 3 cm from the distal
margin is a 9 x 7.5 x 0.4-cm ulcerated, indurated, circumferential mass with serpentine borders which
invades the mesocolonic fat. A gross diagnosis was conveyed to O. R. The remainder of the mucosa
has numerous diverticuli and 3 polyps, 0.2-0.4 cm. Tissue is procured. Representative sections are
submitted as follows:
A1: proximal margin
A2: distal margin
A3-A8: mass and relationship to margins and normal mucosa
A9: diverticulum
A10: possible polyps
A11: normal mucosa
A12: proximal, 6 lymph nodes
A13: proximal, 5 lymph nodes
A14-A16: proximal, 2 lymph nodes each
A17: proximal, 1 lymph node
A18—A19: proximal, 1 lymph node
A20-A24: distal, 6 lymph nodes each
A25-A26: distal, 2 lymph nodes each
A27-A28: distal, 1 lymph nodes each
A29: obstructed mesenteric blood vessel
** fat placed in O-Fix for overnight fixation
A30: proximal, 6 lymph nodes
A31: proximal, 5 lymph nodes
A32-A33: proximal, 2 lymph nodes each
A34-A39: distal, 6 lymph nodes each
B. FINAL DISTAL RECTAL MARGIN
Received in formalin is a piece of pink-tan mucosa with surgical staples measuring 2.3 x 1.7 x 0.8 cm.
The staples are removed, specimen is bisected, submitted entirely in cassette B1 .

DIAGNOSIS:
A. RECTOSIGMOID COLON, LOW ANTERIOR SEGMENTAL RESECTION:
- INVASIVE MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED COLONIC ADENOCARCINOMA,
9 X 7.5 X 0.4 CM, INVADING INTO PERIRECTAL ADIPOSE TISSUE.
- MARGINS OF RESECTION ARE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.
- 27 OF 72 LYMPH NODES POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (27/72).
- SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT.

B. DISTAL RECTAL MARGIN, EXCISION:
- COLON TISSUE WITH NO EVIDENCE OF CARCINOMA.
