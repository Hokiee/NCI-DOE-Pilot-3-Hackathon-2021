CLINICAL INFORMATION:

Ere-op Dx: Bladder cancer

GROSS EXAMINATION:

F/S". It consists of one segment of ureter measuring 0. 4 cm in length x 0.5 cm in
diameter. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis in AFS.

B: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled nLeft distal ureter
F/S". It consists of one segment of ureter measuring 0.5 cm in length x 0.3 cm in
diameter. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis in BPS.

C: The specimen is received fresh from the 0.R. and labeled "Urethral marginef/s'.
It consists of one piece of irregularly shaped tan tissue measuring 2 x 0.6 x 0.4
cm. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis in CFS.

D: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Bladder, uterus,
cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries". The entire specimen measures 21.5
x 13 x 5 cm. Peritoneum on the posterior surface measures 20 x 11 x less 0.1 cm
and is smooth, glistening and mobile, being uninvolved by tumor. The bladder
itself measures 8 x 6.5 x 4 cm. A palpable mass is present on the right side.
This area of the outside of the bladder is inked black and the bladder is opened
through the urethra and anterior bladder wall. The opened bladder shows an
gexophytic and ulcerated tumor 6 x 3 x 2 cm on the right lateral wall that involves
the right ureterovesical junction. It comes within 1 cm of the urethral margin.
(Tumor extends through the bladder wall into the perivesical soft tissue to a depth
of 2 cm. A ureteral stent protrudes from the right ureteral orifice. It is
removed and the ureter is opened. The right attached ureter measures 7 cm in
length x 1.5 cm in circumference in its more proximal aspect but narrows to less
than 2-3 mm in its intramural segment where it is surrounding by tumor. The left
UVJ is identified and is patent. It is opened to reveal the left attached ureter
measuring 4.5 cm in length x 0.6 cm in circumference. The ureteral mucosa is

or masses are identified on the bladder mucosa. The uterus with cervix measures 5.5
x 3.5 x 2.5 cm. The external 05 of the cervix is 0.8 cm in diameter. The exocervix

shaped and symmetrical and the serosa is smooth. The uterus is then bivalved. The
endocervical canal measures 2 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter. The endocervical
mucosa is unremarkable. The uterine wall measures 1.1 cm in thickness. The
endometrium is 1 mm in thickness. The myometrium is 1 cm in thickness. The
endometrium, myometrium and serosal are normal. The right fallopian tube measures
4 cm in length x 0.4 to 0.5 cm in diameter. The right ovary measures 1.3 x 0.8 x

INTRAOPERATIVE FROZEN CONSULTATION:

AFS: Right distal ureter
— no high-grade atypia or tumor identified

BPS: Left distal ureter
— no high-grade atypia or tumor identified

CFS: Urethral margin
- no high-grade atypia or tumor identified

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

AFB-CPS: See final microscopic-diagnosis.

D: Sections of the bladder taken from the right lateral wall show a poorly
differentiated invasive urothelial carcinoma (D1.6—9) extending through the entire
bladder wall into perivesical fat (D6,8,9). The tumor involves the right
ureterovesical junction (D1) where it extends into the intramural portion of the
right ureter and extends through the wall into periureteral and perivesical fat.
The invasive tumor has an adjacent focus of urothelial carcinoma in situ (flat
lesion) [D9]. While no lymphatic space invasion is seen, there is a focus of
vascular invasion noted (D8). The peripheral inked perivesical margin is free of
malignancy. Additional random sections of the bladder including the trigone and
bladder neck shew foci of squamous metaplasia but no urothelial dysplasia or
urothelial carcinoma in situ. All final resection margins are free of both
urothelial dysplasia and invasive carcinoma.

E—T: See final microscopic-diagnosis.
