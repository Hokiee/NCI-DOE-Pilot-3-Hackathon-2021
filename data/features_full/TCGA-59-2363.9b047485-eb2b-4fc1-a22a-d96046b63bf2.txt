GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. RIGHT TUBE AND OVARY

Received fresh is an ovarian mass with attached fallopian tube weighing 183 grams and
measuring 20.x 14.5 x 13.2 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a tan-pink solid
papillary tumor. A portion of ﬁm‘on'ated fallopian tube is identiﬁed (3.5 cm in length and 1.2 cm

in diameter) and serially sectioned to reveal a patent lumen. A portion of the specimen is
submitted for tissue procurement. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

FSAI: frozen section

A2-A25: tumor sections (A25 including fallopian tube)
B. LEFT TUBE AND OVARY .
Received ﬂesh is ”an ovarian mass with attached fallopian tube weighing 600 grams and
measuring 12.5 x 11.0 'x 6.5 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal similar tumor to
part A. A corpus luteum is grossly identiﬁed. A possible fallopian tube is identiﬁed and
measures 1.0 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. It is sectioned to reveal a pin-point lumen. A
portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representative sections are
submitted as follows:

Bl: possible fallopian tube

B2~B4: corpus luteum

BS-B l 6: cyst wall with tumor
C. UTERUS ,

Received is a 147 gram uterus measuring 10 cm from fundus to ectocervix, 7.5 cm from cornu to
cornu and 5 cm from anterior to posterior. The serosal surface is tan-pink and grossly
unremarkable. The cervix measures 4 cm in length and 4.3 cm in diameter, and is a remarkable
for a patent split—like os measuring 0.8 cm. The specimen is bivalved into anterior and posterior
halves to reveal a patent endocervical canal measuring 4 cm in length. The right aspect of the
cervix is remarkable for a cyst-like structure (2 X 1 cm). The triangular endocervical canal
measures 5 cm in length and 2 cm in width. The tan-pink trabeculated myometrium measures
23.4 cm in greatest thickness. The endometrium measures up to 0.1 cm. No gross malignancy is
identiﬁed. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Ci ~02: anterior cervix with lower uterine segment
C3-C4: posterior cervix with lower uterine segment (C4 including cyst)
C5—C7: anterior endomyometrium
C8-C9: posterior endomyometrium bisected
' Cl OLCI l : posterior endomyometiium bisected

d2: posterior endomyometiium

D. CUL—DE—SAC IMPLANTS .

1.4 x 0.8 cm). Toto in D].

E. RIGHT PELVIC SIDEWALL

Labeled “right pelvic sidewall” is a tan-pink soft tissue fragment (3.0 x_l'.0ﬂx 0.8 cm). The
specimen is serially sectioned and submitted in ﬁnd in cassette E1. '

F. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODBS

Are multiple tan-pink soft tissue fragments of ﬁbrofatty tissue aggregating to (4.0 x 2.0 x 1.0
cm). Dissection reveals 3 lymph nodes ranging from (1.0 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm to 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm).

G. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES
Labeled “right pelvic lymph nodes” is a tan-pink fragment of ﬁbrofatty tissue (3.5 x 1.5 x 0.8
cm). Dissection reveals tan-pink lymph node (2.3 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm). The specimen is serially
sectioned and submitted in toto in cassette G1.
H. PERIAORTIC LYMPH NODES
Labeled “periaortic lymph nodes” are multiple fragments of ﬁbrofatty tissue aggregating to (2.5 x
2.0 x 1.0 cm). Dissection reveals possible lymph nodes ranging from (0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm to 1.0 x
‘ 1.0 x 0.8 cm). Section code:
H1: 4 possible lymph nodes
H2: 3 possible lymph nodes
l. OMENTUM
Labeled “omentum” is a tan-pink fragment of ﬁbrofatty tissue (20.0 x 6.0 x 0.8 cm). The
specimen is grossly unremarkable. The specimen is serially sectioned, and representative
sections are submitted in cassettes 11 and I2.
J. APPENDIX
Labeled “appendix" is a tan-pink appendix (4.0 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm) with attached mesoappendix (3.0
x 0.5 cm). The serosa is tan-pink and grossly unremarkable. The specimen is serially sectioned
to reveal a patent lumen ranging from (0.5 cm to 0.8 cm) ﬁlled with brown fecal material. The
wall thickness measures 0.1 cm. The tip is longitudinally sectioned, and the specimen is
submitted entirely in cassette J1 and 12 as follows:
I 1: Tip bivalved
J2: Remainder of specimen
