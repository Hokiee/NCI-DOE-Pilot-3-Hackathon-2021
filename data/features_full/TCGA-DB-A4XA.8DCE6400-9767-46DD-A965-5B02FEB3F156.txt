Final Diagnosis:
A—B. Brain, left temporal occipital lesion #l—#2, excision: Low grade oligoastrocytoma (WHO grade II).

Immunohistochemistry is performed on parafﬁn—embedded sections against the following antigens: [DH-l , GFAP.
p53, and Ki-67. Tumor cells are positive for IDH-l (R132H). Occasional tumor cells stain for GFAP. However,
many of the tumor cells lack GFAP reactivity. P53 shows low to moderate staining, whereas Ki-67 shows focally
moderate staining. These immunohistochemical features support the above diagnosis.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for lpl 19q deletion is pending.

Preliminary Frozen Section Consultation:
A. Brain. left temporal occipital lesion #1, smears: Low-grade glioma, probably oligodendroglioma.
