SURGICAL PROCEDURES:
NEPHRECTOMY

GROS‘ DESCRIPTION
The specimen is submitted fresh as "left kidney“ and consists of a kidney
removed with attached adrenal gland and segment of ureter. The specimen
has an overall dimension of 20 x 13 x 5 cm and a weight of 567 grams. The
isolated kidney measures 12.5 x 5.5 x 5 cm. The capsule is removed with
ease revealing a pink tan granular surface interrupted by a 4 x 3 x 2.5 cm
serous cyst at the upper pole. There are two ligated vessels at the hilum
ranging in length from 0.7 to 1.5 cm in length and measuring 0.6 and 0. 4
cm in diameter respectively The segment of attached ureter measures 7 cm
in length and 0.3 cm in diameter at the margin of resection. The ureter
and pelvis are red tan and glistening. Upon opening, the ureteral mucosa
is pink tan with the usual striations. The pelvic mucosa is pink tan and
unremarkable. Adjacent to the capsular cyst at the lower portion of the
upper is a moderately firm red- -yellow, focally hemorrhagic, relatively
circumscribed tumor measuring 2 x 2. 7 x 2. 2 cm which extends to the rim of
the cortex and protrudes into the surrounding perirenal fat. The tumor
does not grossly invade the subjacent pelvis. The remaining renal
parenchyma is pink tan and unremarkable. The cortex measures 0.8 cm in
maximum thickness.
The attached adrenal gland measures 7 x 2 x 1.5 cm and weighs 7 grams.
There is no gross involvement by tumor. Examination of the attached
perirenal fat is unremarkable. No grossly apparent nodes are seen.
Representative sections are submitted, multiple (12) labeled as follows:
Cassette 1: Ureter and vessel margins
Cassettes 2—6: Entirely submitted tumor (capsular margin black
dye)

Cassettes 7-9: Representative adjacent subcapsular cyst
Cassettes 10—11: Representative uninvolved renal parenchyma
Cassette 12: Representative adrenal gland
Please note: Gross photos have been taken. A portion of tissue is
submitted for TCGA studies.

FT NAL DIAGNOS T S

LEFT KIDNEY, PROXIMAL URETER, PERINEPHRIC SOFT TISSUE, AND ADRENAL GLAND
(RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY SPECIMEN): PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, FUHRMAN
NUCLEAR GRADE 2, 2.7 CM MAXIMUM DIAMETER, ARISING IN LOWER PORTION OF
UPPER POLE. THE TUMOR DISTENDS, BUT DOES NOT PENETRATE, THE RENAL
CAPSULE. ADJACENT 4 CM CORTICAL CYST ALSO NOTED. REMAINING KIDNEY SHOWS
SCATTERED FOCI OF INTERSTITIAL CHRONIC INFLAMMATION AND MILD
ARTERIOLOSCLEROSIS. VASCULAR AND URETERAL MARGINS AND ADRENAL GLAND ARE
FREE OF DISEASE.

COMMENT: THE LESION IS OF PAPILLARY TYPE THROUGHOUT. IMMUNOPEROXIDASE
STAINS WERE PERFORMED, AND THE LESION IS POSITIVE FOR RCC
ANTIGEN BUT NEGATIVE FOR TTF-l, CONFIRMING THE RENAL ORIGIN.

Unless otherwise specified, the performance characteristics of the
immunoperoxidase stains performed here have been confirmed by the

These tests have not been cleared or
approved by the 0.5. Food and Drug Administration, although such approval
is not necessary.
