Specimen Date/Time:

laryngectomy (10.2 x 8.3 x 4.5 cm) and attached right lobe of thyroid (4.5 x 3.0 x 1.2 cm) anteriorly contains muscle and soft
tissue, and an elliptical stoma (3.0 x 2.2 cm).

An ulcerated. nodular and polypoid tumor extends from the posterior superior aspect of the epiglottis. coming to within
1.0 cm of the tip and 0.5 cm from the right and left aryepiglottic folds. The tumor extends 5.0 cm from superior to interior. 3.5 cm
from right to left and 3 cm deep. The tumor is presented bilaterally in the supra glottis and is polypoid at the left false vocal cord,
however does not extend to the true vocal cords on the right or left. The tumor is 4.2 cm above the distal tracheal margin and
3.0 cm above the stoma. Subglottic extension is not identiﬁed. The tumor ﬁlls the pre—epiglotlic space and extends to the hyoid
bone anterior superiorly. with a scant fibrous tissue covering over the superior aspect of the tumor. The tumor abuts the thyroid
cartilage and appears to invade it anteriorly.

The right lobe of thyroid is glassy pink-brown and tabular. No masses are identified. Within the fibroadipose tissue.
multiple lymph nodes are identified.

SECTION CODE: 81-32. tracheal margin for frozen section on face; BS, unremarkable subglottic mucosa from right
trachea; 34. superior aspect of epiglottis; 85-86, left and right more inferior, 87-38. left and right epiglottis more inferior; 39—810,
right epiglottis more inferior; B11812. right and left epiglottis more inferior; 813 and 314. tumor behind left and right behind
hyoid bone; B15. vertical section through left true vocal cord; B16. vertical through right true vocal cord; 31?. left arytenoid; 818,
right arytenoid; 319. stoma; 320. right thyroid; 821-825, nodes from left side of neck (821624. one bisected node in each block.
825. 5 whole nodules); 326-829, possible iym ph nodes from right side of neck (826-828. one nodule bisected in each cassette,
829. two whole nodes); 830. two whole possible lymph nodes centrally located.
