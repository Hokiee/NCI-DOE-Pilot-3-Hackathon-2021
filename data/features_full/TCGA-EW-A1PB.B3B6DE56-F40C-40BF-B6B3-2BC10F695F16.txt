Prg ngrativg Diagnosig;
Triple negative carcinoma breast

Specimenls) Received:
Breast. mastectomy. partial/simple

Gross Description:

Received in formalin is a mastectomy specimen, measuring 28.0 x 18.0 x 6.5 cm with an ellipse of skin attached, measuring 25.0 x
16.0 cm with a nipple attached. The specimen is oriented with one stitch marking the superior margin. two stitches marking the
medial margin. The specimen has been previously opened with inked deep margin. Upon serial sectioning. there is an 8.5 x 7.4
x 5.8 cm white lesion located in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. The cut surface appears to be necrotic with foot of
hemorrhage. The rest of the breast appear unremarkable with a stroma to fat ratio of 20 to 80%. Additionally, there is a 4.5 x 3.5
x 3.0 cm white-tan lirrn lesion located in the axilla. These lesions are approximately 0.3 cm to the deep margin. Representative
sections are submitted as follows:

1 Nipple
2 Tumor with skin
3 Tumor with deep margin
