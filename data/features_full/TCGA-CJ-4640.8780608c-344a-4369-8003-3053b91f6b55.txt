EOSINOPHILIC CELLS).
FUHRMAN'S NUCLEAR GRADE 4.
TUMOR EXTENDS INTO RENAL VEIN.
TUMOR MEASURES 9.0 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION.

Adrenal gtand, no tumor present.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION
(A) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND - A radical nephrectomy specimen
(28.0 x 11.0 x 7.5 cm). with segments of renal artery. renal vein and
ureter (3.0 cm in iength and 0.6 cm in average diameter) and adrenal
gland (5.5 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm).

There is a 9.0 x 6.5 x 6.0 cm welt-circumscribed tumor
“entered in the middle of the kidney. replacing two-thirds of the renal

arenchyma. The tumor is white with friable areas and hemorrhage. The

tumor bulges into renal vein (1.0 cm from the margin), and appears to
invade the renal sinus and the perirenal fat, but not reaching the
Gerota‘s fascia. The tumor does not invotve the renal petvis.

The adjacent renal parenchyma is unremarkable. No hilar lymph
nodes are identiﬁed. The adrenat gland has unremarkable cortex and
medulla.

Tumor and normal tissue have been submitted for possible electron
microscopy and tumor bank.

INK CODE: Blue — Gerota's fascia.

SECTION CODE: A1, ureterei. renal vein and artery margins; A2.
tumor in renal vein; A3vA5, tumor in renal sinus; A6, tumor and renal
pelvis; A7~A9, upper part of tumor with soft tissue margin; A10, tumor
with renai parenchyma; A11, A12. lower part of tumor with soft tissue
margin; A13, normal renal parenchyma; A14. adrenat gland. -

CLINICAL HISTORY
Left renal mass.
