DIAGNOSIS:

1) LYMPH NODE, RIGHT EXTERNAL ILIAC: EXCISION:
- MARKED FOLLICULAR HYPERPLASIA, IMMUNOSTAINS PENDIG (SEE NOTE).
- NO CARCINOMA SEEN.

2) UTERUS, CERVIX. BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES; HYSTERECTOMY AND
BILATERAL SALPINGO- OOPHORECTOMY:

- MALIGNANT MIXED MULLERIAN TUMOR OF ENDOHETRIUN (CARCINOSARCOMA). WITH
HETEROLOGOUS ELEMENTS (RHABDOMYOSARCONA).

- THE TUMOR INVADES TO > HALF OF MYOMETRIUM.

—THE MAXIMAL THICKNESS OP MYOMETRIAL INVASION IS 12 MM.

- THE THICKNESS OF THE NYONETRIUN IN THE AREA OF MAXIMAL TUMOR INVASION
IS 18 MM.

- NO ENDOCERVICAL INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

- VASCULAR INVASION IS PRESENT.

— THE MYONETRIUM SHOWS THE FOLLOWING ABNORMALITY: LEIOMYOMAS.
— ALL ADNEXAE ARE UNREMARKABLE.

LY'MPH NODES, LEFT EXTERNAL ILIAC; EXCISION:

METASTATIC CARCINOSARCOMA INVOLVING ONE OF TWO LYMPH NODES (1/2) .

ALL LYMPH NODE METASTASES ARE COMPOSED PREDOMINANTLY OF CARCINOMA.

THE LYMPK NODES SHOW A MARKED AND DIFFUSE FOLLICULAR HYPERPLASIA.

IWOSTAINS ARE BEING PERFORMED TO FURTHER CLASSIFY THESE FINDINGS. AN

ADDENDUM REPORT WILL FOLLOW.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL) , AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED

THIS REPORT.
