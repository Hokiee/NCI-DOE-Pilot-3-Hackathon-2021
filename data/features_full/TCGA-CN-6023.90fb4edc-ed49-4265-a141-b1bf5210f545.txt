COMMENT:

Parts 1 and 3: The capsule of one lymph node (left level 3) contains single
laminated calcification suggestive of a psammoma body. Additional studies are
pending. To address the possibility of papillary thyroid carcinoma, the
remainder of the right thyroid lobe will be submitted for microscopic
evaluation. Addendum will follow.

My s1gnature 1s attestation that I have personally reviewed the submitted
material(s) and the ﬁnal diagnosis reﬂects that evaluation.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in eight parts.

Part 1 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX, and
designated "left neck, levels 2, 3 and 4". It consists of a 10.5 X 4.1 X 1.5

cm piece of soft tissue which includes muscle, adipose tissue and possible
lymph nodes. There are also three unattached fragments -3.8 X 1.8 X 1.2 cm,
1.5 X 0.8 X 0.6 cm and 1.2 X 0.6 X 0.5 cm. The large fragment was divided
into three levels 2, 3 and 4 arbitrarily, as the specimen was received
unoriented. Level 2 has possible lymph nodes up to 2.1 cm. Level 3 has
possible lymph nodes up to 1.8 cm. Level 4 has possible lymph nodes up to 1
cm.

Cassette summary:

1A - level 2, lymph node, bisected

1B - level 2, lymph node, bisected

1C - level 2, lymph node

1D - level 3, lymph node, bisected

1E - level 3, lymph node, bisected

1F - level 3, lymph node, bisected

1G - level 3, three remaining lymph nodes submitted entirely

1H - level 4, lymph node, bisected

II - level 4, remaining two lymph nodes submitted entirely

1J - lymph node from the separate fragment bisected.

Part 2 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials xxx, and
designated "right neck dissection, levels 2, 3 and 4". The specimen consists
of a piece of soft tissue consisting of adipose tissue, muscle and possible
lymph nodes, 12.1 X 3.1 X 1.7 cm. It is received unoriented and divided into
three levels.

Level 2 lymph nodes: Lymph node 1 1.0 X 0.8 X 0.6 cm. Three additional lymph
nodes ranging from 0.6 X 0.5 X 0.5 cm to 0.4 X 0.3 X 0.3 cm.

Level 3 lymph nodes: Lymph node 1 2.7 X 1.5 X 1.3 cm. Upon sectioning has a
firm white-yellow interior that is suspicious for metastasis. Also additional
lymph nodes ranging from 1.4 X 0.8 X 0.6 cm to 0.5 X 0.5 X 0.5 cm are seen.
Level 4 lymph nodes: One lymph node measuring 2.7 X 2.0 X 1.6 cm. Upon
sectioning, has a firm white-yellow interior that is suspicious for

metastasis. Lymph node 2 1.8 X 1.5 X 1.2 cm. Upon sectioning has a ﬁrm
white-yellow interior that is suspicious for metastasis. There are additional
lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.7 X 0.7 X 0.6 cm to 0.2 X 0.2 X 0.2 cm.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

2A - level 2, lymph node one, bisected

2B - level 2, three lymph nodes submitted in total

2C - level 3, lymph node one, bisected

2D - level 3 four lymph nodes submitted in total

2E-2F - level 4, lymph node one, trisected

2G - level 4, lymph node two, bisected

2H - level 4, six lymph nodes submitted in total.

Part 3 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials xxx, and
designated "larynx". It consists of a total laryngectomy measuring 9.8 cm
(superior to inferior), 6.8 cm (anterior to posterior) and 7.4 cm (medial to
lateral). It consists of hyoid, epiglottis and two tracheal rings. There is

a partial right pharyngectomy and right lobe of the thyroid are included.
There is no stoma or skin included. The anterior tissue is inked black. The
hyoid is removed and the tissue posterior to the hyoid is inked in orange.
There is a tumor, 4.6 X 2.7 cm that is firm in texture and occupies right
pyriform sinus involving the medial aspect of the aryepiglottic fold. It has
been inked red and a portion of it has been removed for tissue bank. The
tumor appears is 0.4 cm from the right pyriform tissue edge. The tumor does
not extend into the tracheal cartilage. The tracheal cartilage is ossiﬁed.
Tissue has been banked. Digital images have been taken.

Representative sections submitted as follows:

3A - right pyriform tissue edge shave

3B - left pyriform tissue edge shave

3CDC, D - tracheal margin for decalcification
3E—3F - tumor in relation to epiglottis, base of tongue, vallecula, tissue
edge shave

3G—3H - tumor and paraglottic soft tissue

31 - tumor in pre—epiglottic space

3] - representative section of tumor

3KDR - tumor and thyroid cartilage

3LDR - tumor and thyroid cartilage

3M - right glottis

3N - left glottis

3O - soft tissue

3P—3Q - re resentative sections of th roid.
Part 4 is labe e w1t e pat1ent's name, initials xxx and "right inferior

hypopharyngeal margin." It consists of a 1.1 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm irregular tan
tissue. The specimen is entirely frozen for intraoperative consultation and
the remnant is submitted in cassette 4AF S.
Part 5 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xxx and "superior right
pharyngeal margin." It consists of a 0.6 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm irregular tan tissue.
The specimen is entirely frozen for intraoperative consultation and the
remnant is submitted in cassette 5AFS.
Part 6 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xxx and "right esophageal
inlet." It consists of a 1.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm irregular tan tissue. The
specimen is entirely frozen for intraoperative consultation and the remnant is
submitted in cassette 6AFS.
Part 7 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xxx and "right base of
tongue." It consists of a 1.3 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm irregular tan tissue. The
specimen is entirely frozen for intraoperative consultation and the remnant is
submitted in cassette 7AFS.
Part 8 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xxx and "left
hypopharyngeal margin." It consists of a 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.2 cm irregular tan
tissue. The specimen is entirely frozen for intraoperative consultation and
the remnant is submitted in cassette 8AFS.
