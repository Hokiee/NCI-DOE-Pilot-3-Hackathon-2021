MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: HYSTERECTOMY, BILATERAL SALPINGO-OOPHORECOTMY AND LYMPH NODE
SAMPLING

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 7th Edition): pTlB pNO pMX , . -

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).

Per _i---" _. ‘ he specimen submitted as "F" was uterine contents
that spilled into the vagina during the operative procedure. The vagina

IS NOT involved by tumor, and the hysterectomy margins are negative as
described in specimen A. The tumor staging information is correct as reported
