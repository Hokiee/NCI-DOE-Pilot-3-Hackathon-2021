- Type of tumor: Small acinar adenocarcinoma.

- Location of tumor: Left posterior apex, slides H2, H9; left posterior mid gland, slide H10; left
posterior base, slides H11, H16, H18; left anterior apex, slides H2, H12; left anterior mid gland,
slide H13; left anterior base, slides H14, H16; right posterior apex, slides H1, H6; right posterior
mid gland, slide H7; right posterior base, slides H8, H17.

- Estimated volume of tumor: 7.7 cc.

— Gleason score: 4+5; primary pattern 4, secondary pattern 5.

- Estimated volume > Gleason pattern 3: 80%.

- Involvement of capsule: Tumor invades capsule (right posterior base, slide H8; left posterior apex,
slide H9; left posterior mid gland, slide H10; left anterior base, slide H14; left posterior base,
slide H18).

- Extraprostatic extension: Present, extensive (slides H9-H10, H14, H18).

- Margin status for tumor: Tumor cells are present (0.1 cm away from the margin. No deﬁnite
tumor cells are identiﬁed at the inked margin.

However, rare cauterized glands (<0.1 cm In maximum dimension) that are too distorted by
cautery to better classify are present at the left posterior base (slide H18).

Finally, on frozen section F53 "posterior midline,“ there is a small focus of cauterized epithelioid
cells which most likely represent plump endothelial cells of a small capillary but due to distortion,
this possibility of this representing a small focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma cannot be
completely excluded. This focus of cells is no longer present on permanent sections.

- Margin status for benign prostate glands: No benign glands present at inked excision margins.

- High-grade prostatic lntraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN): Present; focally.

- Tumor involvement of seminal vesicle: Present; bilateral.

— Perlneural infiltration: Present.

— Lymphovascular invasion: Present.

- Lymph node status: Positive;

— Total number of positive nodes: 1.
- Total number of nodes examined: 20.
- Size of largest metastasis in node: 0.3 cm
- Extranodal extension: None.
- AJCC/UICC stage: pT3bN1.

Clinical History

The patient is a '-old man. Review of the electronic medical record reveals
the patient underwent needle core biopsies of the prostate for an abnormal DRE ' with a
diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason grade 3+4/4+5, with perineural invasion. The patient
now undergoes a robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection.

Gross Description

The specimen is received in eight parts, each labeled with the patient‘s name and medical record
number. Parts A-E and Part H are received fresh. Parts F and G are received in formalin.

Part A, additionally labeled "left anterior bladder neck - frozen," consists of red-tan cauterized,

unoriented soft tissue (0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm). The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section diagnosis 1,
and subsequently submitted in cassette A1.

Part B, additionally labeled "left posterior bladder neck," consists of red-tan, cauterized, unoriented soft
tissue (4 x 3 x 2 cm). The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section diagnosis 2, and subsequently
submitted in cassette 81.

Part C, additionally labeled "posterior midline - FS," consists of pink-red unoriented soft tissue (0.3 x
0.1 x 0.1 cm). The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section diagnosis 3, and subsequently submitted
in cassette C1.

Part D, additionally labeled "left base - FS," consists of white-tan unoriented Irregular soft tissue (0.3 x

0.2 x 0.1 cm). The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section diagnosis 4, and subsequently submitted
in cassette DI.

Part E, additionally labeled "left posterior midline - FS," consists of red-tan, unoriented, ovoid soft tissue

fragments (0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm in aggregate). The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section diagnosis
5, and subsequently submitted in cassette E1.

Part F, additionally labeled I'rlght pelvic lymph nodes,“ consists of multiple small, soft, irregular to ﬁrm,
unoriented, yellow-tan, ﬁbrofatty tissue fragments (4.5 x 2 x 1 cm in aggregate). Multiple ovoid to

irregular, ﬁrm, yellow-tan lymph node candidates (0.2-4.5 cm) are identiﬁed. The entire specimen is
submitted as follows:

F1-F2: One lymph node candidate, sectioned. «at
F3: Three lymph node candidates, intact.

F4: Two lymph node candidates, intact.

F5: Two lymph node candidates, intact.

F6: Flbrofatty remnant.

Part G, additionally labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes," consists of multiple soft to ﬁrm, irregular,
unoriented, yellow-tan, fibrofatty tissue fragments (6.5 x 2.5 x 1.3 cm in aggregate). Multiple ﬁrm,

irregular, yellow-tan lymph node candidates (0.3.6.0 cm) are identified. The entire specimen is
submitted as follows:

G1—GB: One lymph node candidate, sectioned.
64: One lymph node candidate, bisected.
GS: One lymph node candidate, bisected.
66: One lymph node candidate, bisected.
G7: Four lymph node candidates, intact.
G8: Fibrofatty remnant.

Part H, additionally labeled "prostate and seminal vesicles,“ consists of an intact, red-tan radical
prostatectomy specimen (43.5 gm; 3.5 cm from apex to base x 4.5 cm in width x 4 cm from anterior to

 

posterior) with attached seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundles (right 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm; left 4 x 1.5 x
0.5 cm).

GROSS PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: There is a large, solid to diffuse, firm, white-tan tumor (2 x 2 x 1.5
cm) running along the left posterolateral apex through base (slices 2-9) with tumor appearing to extend
beyond the capsule into the surrounding fibrofatty tissues and to the surgical margin in slices 5-9. No
other nodules are identified. The tumor also appears to abut and focally extend into the left seminal
vesicle. No other nodules are grossly identified. The anterior fibrous stroma is opened and the
remaining capsule appears otherwise intact.
