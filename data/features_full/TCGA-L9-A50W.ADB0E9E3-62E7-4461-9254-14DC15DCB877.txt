GROSS DESCRIPTION:
Specimen A is received in the fresh state labeled "left lower lobe lung". This is a lobe

of lung recognizable as lower lobe and measuring 11 x 10 x 6 cm. The pleural surfaces are
smooth, dark reddish—tan to black. At the base of the lobe is a firm tumor. The overlying
pleura is smooth and this surface is inked black. The cut surface of the tumor shows

solid white tissue with the appearance of confluent nodules, forming a multinodular

single mass which measures 2.5 x 2.0 cm in greatest surface area. Tumorous tissue focally
extends to within 1 mm of the inked pleural surface at the base of the lobe. A portion of
the tumor is harvested for tumor banking. The tumor is 2 cm from the bronchial margin.
There is a blackened 8 mm peribronchial lymph node. Serial sections through the remainder
of the lung tissue reveal no additional tumors. Representative sections are submitted as

follows:

Al — bronchial and vascular margin
A2 - peribronchial lymph node at margin
A3—6 — tumor
A7 — uninvolved lung
A8 ~ additional bronchi adjacent to tumor but uninvolved
Specimen B is received in formalin labeled "left level 8 lymph node". This is an ovoid

piece of firm dark reddish—brown to white tissue measuring 1.3 x 1.3 x 0.7 cm. The cut
surface is solid homogeneous white, suspicious for metastasis. The specimen is entirely
submitted in cassette 81 and 82.

Specimen C is received in formalin labeled "left level 11 lymph node". It consists of
multiple irregular pieces of dark reddish-brown tissue measuring 10 x 8 x 3 mm in
aggregate. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette Cl.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:

A. Sections of the lung tumor demonstrate a well to moderately differentiated
adenocarcinoma with a mixed glandular, solid and papillary growth pattern. Areas of clear
cell change are noted.
