Frozen Diagnosis
Report : GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. The specimen is received in a container labeled with the
name of the patient and identified as breast, left simple
mastectomy. The specimen consists of a mastectomy measuring
en bloc Ills x 9.5 x 4 cm and weighing 158 grams. There is
an anterior ellipse of skin measuring 6 x 3 cm with a
central 3 cm areolar complex with retracted nipple. Sections
of nipple/areola are sampled in block 1. The skin is
sampled in block 2. The superficial superior margin is
inked orange and the superficial inferior margin is inked
blue. The deep margin is inked green and the specimen '
sectioned, showing an oval grey—tan firm mass measuring 2.8
cm in the upper inner quadrant of the breast. Grossly, this
mass is 0.4 cm from the inked deep margin of resection,
which is submitted in block 3. Sections of the mass are
submitted in blocks 4-7. The remaining breast is composed
of yellow lobulated adipose tissue admixed with islands of
gray-white rubbe tissue. The breast is divided into four
quadrants, upper inner, lower inner, upper outer and lower
outer and sampled in blocks 8—11 respectively. Minimal
axillary tissue is present and no lymph nodes are
identified. Formalin fixation time is 11 hours.

Prior biopsy site.

COMMENT :
Estrogen and progesterone receptors and Her2neu studies were
performed on the prior biopsy 1 with results of

estrogen receptor 2+, progesterone receptor 3+, and HERz/neu
3+. E cadherin, also performed on the prior biopsy, was
negative, confirming a lobular phenotype.

Intradepartmental consultation obtained.
