A. Received in formalin is an irregular tan—gray nodule. measuring 2.0 x 1.6

APC. Received in formalin is an irregular portion of tan-gray soft tissue.

B/BPC. Received in formalin is a portion of tan-yellow fibrofatty tissue.
measuring 6.8 cm from medial to lateral. 6.7 cm frmn superior to inferior. and
4.8 cm from anterior to posterior. The specimen is oriented as follows: short
stitch - superior; long stitch - lateral. The anterior aspect is covered by
skin. measuring 5.0 x 3.0 x 0.2 cm. Centrally located on the skin surface is
the nipple. measuring 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. The cut surface of the nipple is
tan and unremarkable. The specimen is inked as follows: superior - blue;
inferior - green; medial — red; lateral ~ yellow; anterior — orange; posterior
- black. Sectioning from medial to lateral reveals a poorly-defined tan—gray

tumor mass. measuring approximately 5.0 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm. This area is
diffusely covered with blue radiographic dye. The cut surface is firm and
gritty. The tumor mass blends into the adjacent thick fibrotic tissue. The
tumor comes to within 1.0 cm of the medial margin. 0.2 cm of the lateral
margin, 2.0 cm of the superior margin, 0.7 cm of the inferior margin. 1.5 cm
of the skin and nipple. and abuts the posterior margin. The remaining cut
surface is composed of approximately 503 adipose tissue and 50% fibrous
tissue. A biopsy cavity or metallic clip is not found. Representative
sections are sequentially submitted, from medial to lateral. in six cassettes
as follows: cassette 1 - medial margin; cassette 2 — nipple with anterior
aspect; cassette 3 - tumor mass with closest posterior margin; cassette 4 -
tumor mass with superior margin; cassette 5 - tumor mass with inferior margin:
cassette 6 - tumor mass with lateral margin.

C. Received in formalin is an irregular portion of tan‘yellow fatty tissue.
measuring 5 x 4 x 2 cm. Six possible lymph nodes. ranging_from 0.4 x 0.3 x
0.3 cm to 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm, are identified. The cut surface of the largest
lymph node shows foci of tan—gray discoloration. The lymph nodes are entirely
submitted in four cassettes as follows: cassette 1 - one intact and one
bisected lymph node; cassette 2 - one lymph node; cassette 3 - two bisected
lymph nodes (one inked black); cassette 4 - largest lymph node.

==== MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: ==============

A & APC. One slide is examined for each portion of the case. Both slides
demonstrate extensive lymph node involvement by poorly differentiated
carcinoma. Because of the Obvious nature of this finding. it will not be
necessary to perform a cytokeratin stain.

B/BPC. Six slides are examined. Slide 1 show benign breast tissue without
evidence of tumor involvement. The red inked medial margin is free of

tumor. Slide 2 shows tissue from the region of the nipple. There is patchy
ductal hyperplasia and no evidence of Paget‘s disease is evident. Slide 3
shows extensive infiltrating carcinoma with a pattern mostwsuggestive of
Iobular carcinoma with periductal targetoid-like areas and numerous foci of
"Indian file" arrangement. On this slide, tumor is present approximately 0.1
mm to the black inked posterior surface. The tumor shows no evidence of
tubular formation (tubules = 3). Nuclei exhibit occasional prominent nucleoli
and these seem to be multiple in some scattered foci. In the most mitotically
active areas of tumor, approximately eighteen to nineteen mitoses are present
within ten high power field (mitoses = 2). The Nottingham score of this
lesion is therefore 7 (3+3+2). making this a grade II lesion. Slide 4 shows
no evidence of malignancy. Slide 5 shows infiltrating carcinoma with a clear
inferior green inked margin. Changes consistent with a prior biopsy site are
also present. No tumor is seen on slide 6.

C. Four slides are examined. These show six lymph nodes. Positive lymph
