Comment

14. The tumor is a moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, centered in the distal esophagus, extending
through GE junction into proximal stomach. The surface of the tumor is ulcerated. The tumor invades adventitia and

is ~ 0.1 cm from the adventitial surface at the closest point. The gastric part of the tumor mainly involves submucosa and
muscularis propria with focal extension into perigastric fat There is metastatic adenocarcinoma in 1143 lymph nodes
identiﬁed.
