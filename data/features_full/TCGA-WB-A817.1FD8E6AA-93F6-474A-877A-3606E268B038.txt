Date receiving:

Clinical history Hypertension recently revealed by sudden headaches. No risk factors.

Investigations showed bilateral adrenal nodules attributed to pheochromocytomas by metanephrine
measurements.

Macroscogz

Left Adrenal: The surgical specimen weights 149 after dissection of fat and measures 6.5 x 2.5 x 2.5
cm. After cutting, a grayish nodule is observed in adrenal measuring 1 cm.

Right adrenal. After fat dissection, the surgical piece weights 23 g and measures 6.5 x 4 x 4 cm, with
after cutting, a intra—adrenal grayish beige tumor measuring 2cm.

Microscogy

Left Adrenal: a proliferation organized into bays or small nests within a sparse interstitial vascularized
tissue with very small hemorrhagic areas is observed. The tumor cells are large. Cytoplasm are
polygonal basophils. Nuclei exhibit a slight degree of anisokaryosis with a small nucleolus sufﬁciently
visible. Absence of mitosis. Absence of necrosis.

The tumor is limited by a ﬁbrous condensation sometimes clear and sometimes less clear separating
the tumor from the rest of the adrenal tissue and the adipose tissue. Presence of cell clusters ﬂoating
in the blood vessels. Absence of capsular inﬁltration and absence of tumor embolus. The outside
adrenal is normal.

PASS score: large nests or diffuse architecture: 0. Central or conﬂuent necrosis: 0. High cellularity: 0.
Cellular monotony: 0. Tumor cell spindling: 0. Mitotic ﬁgures: 0. Vascular invasion: 0. Capsular
invasion: 0. Profound nuclear pleomorphism: 0. Nuclear hyperchromasia: O ..

IHC study showed that the tumor cells express chromogranin, synaptophysin and N Cam.

CONCLUSION
Benign pheochromocytoma, 1 cm.
PASS Score = 0 ..

Right Adrenal: Benign pheochromocytoma measuring 2 cm

PASS Score = 0.

Cytological and immunohistochemical morphological characteristics are identical to those described
above for the left tumor
