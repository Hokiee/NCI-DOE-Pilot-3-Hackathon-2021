GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Level 11 <AFl)", received trash for Srozen section is a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 on
aggregate oi brown—can tissue which has been entirely frozen as ARI. the
frozen section remnant o: which is submitted in block A1.

 

3. “Right, lower lobe lung and middle tail)". received fresh for ﬁrczen
section is e 480 gram, 20 x 17 x 8.2 cm lobeccomy specimen. The pleura
demonstrates a 4.5 x 4 cm area of puckering and white discoloration as well as
focal areas of hemorrhagic focal adhesiona. Serial sectioning demonstrates a
s x 4.7 x 2.2 cm well-circumscribed central necrotic mass directly abutting
the aforementioned area 0: pleural retraction and discoloration and 5.3 cm
from the bronchial margin. The remainder of the parenchymel cut surface
demonstrates a moderate amount of emphysematous change, but is otherwise
crepitant and brown—can. The bronchial mucoee is trabeculated white-tan with
no abnormalities noted. A representative section of the bronchial margin has
been previously frozen as BFl, the frozen eecticn remnant of which is

submitted in block 31. Additional representative sections are submitted as
follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY:

32- vascular margins

33- lobar lymph node candidates

54-5 sections of mass with respect to pleura (A va stain is prospectively
requested in Be)

36- mass with adjacent uninvolved

37- central eection of mass

36-9 sections oﬁ uninvolved parenchyma

C. "Level 7', received in formalin in a 5 x 4 x 3 cm aggregate at brown—tan
soft tissue which is sectioned and submitted entirely in blocks ci-z-
