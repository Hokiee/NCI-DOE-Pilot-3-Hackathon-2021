CLINICAL INFORMATION: Breast cancer.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in three parts.

Part A‘ Is received fresh from the operating room for frozen section diagnosis in a container labeled with the patients
name and "R sentinel lymph node". It consists of one ﬁrm tan to red lymph node measuring 2.0 x 1.8 x 1 0 cm The

specimen is serially sectioned. Submitted in toto In three cassettes labeled AFS A1 and A2. AFS= frozen section A1
- A2 = remaining tissue.

Part B is received unﬁxecl in a oOntainer labeled with the patient‘s name and "R breast lumpectomy". It consists of a
piece of yellow-white ﬁbrofatty tissue measuring 10.5 x 9.0 x 6.0 cm. An ellipse of skin is not present. An X-ray is
received. A localization needle is not noted. A short suture is noted indicatingthe superior margin and a row of long
sutures are noted indicating the lateral margin. A mass is palpated in the center. The superﬁcial surface is inked yellow

 

 

.r— — - ¥ 7 I I W . —r —_
_ and the deep surface is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned. On cut section, the mass is tan, ﬁrm. poorly
.circumscribed and measures 3.2 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm. The mass comes to 0.3 cm of the superﬁcial, 0.5 cm of the deep and

2.5 cm of the lateral margins. The tissue is composed of 60% fat and 40% intermixed ﬁrm tan-white parenchyma.
Representative sections are submitted in 29 cassettes labeled B1 - B29.

 

Legend: Bl = mass and closest deep surface,

32 = mass and closest superﬁcial sun‘ace(B‘l and 32 = full thickness of mass),
BS — as a mass with adjacent deep margin

39 — 817 = superﬁcial margin over mass

318 - 319 = mass

820 - 821 = superior

B22 ~ 823 = deep margin in lateral part(closest to mass)

B24 — 325 = lateral

326 - 327 = inferior

B28 ~ 829 = medial.

Part C is received unﬁxed in a container labeled with the patients name and "R axillary lymph node dissection". It
consists of two pieces of yellow-red fatty tissue measuring 4.0 x 2.7 x 1.0 cm and 10.0 x 7.0 x 1.0 cm. A suture is noted
attached to one end of the larger piece of fatty tissue. Fourteen lymph moves measuring from 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm to 3.5
x 1.5 x 1.0 cm are identiﬁed. The lymph nodes are submitted in toto 10 cassettes labeled 01 - C10.

Legend: 01 = five intact nodes, 02 - C5 = one bisected node in each cassettes, C6 = one intact node. 07 ~ 08 = one
large quadrisected node, (39 - C10 = nodes closest to suturellarger node is bisected).
