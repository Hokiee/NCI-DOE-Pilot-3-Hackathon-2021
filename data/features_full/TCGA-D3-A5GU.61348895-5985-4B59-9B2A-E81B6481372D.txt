DIAGNOSIS

(A) LEFT HIP, SKIN ELLIPSE:
METASTATIC MELANOMA INVOLVING SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE WITH EXTENSIVE NECROSIS, MARGINS
FREE (WITHIN 1.1 MM FROM CLOSEST LATERAL MARGIN, A3). (SEE COMMENT)
TUMOR SIZE: 7.9 X 6.0 MM (AS MEASURED ON SLIDE).
Tumor borders pushing.

(B) RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION:
METASTATIC MELANOMA INVOLVING ONE OF TWO LYMPH NODES (1/2). (SEE COMMENT)
Largest tumor deposit size: 20.0 x 16.0 mm (per gross description).
Location: Subcapsular and intraparenchymal.
EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION: PRESENT.
Exogenous black pigment, consistent with tattoo, involving one lymph node.

COMMENTS

In parts (A) and (B), the tumor cells demonstrate focal melanin pigment (specimen A) and similar morphology (specimen A and B)
to the patient’s known melanoma of the right shoulder (see case , which supports the above diagnoses.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT HIP NODULE, SHORT STITCH SUPERIOR, LONG STITCH LATERAL - A 2.4 x 0.6 cm tan-pink skin ellipse with
subcutis, excised to a depth of 1.5 cm and oriented by the surgeon with a short stitch designating the superior tip and a long stitch
designating the lateral tissue edge. The specimen is inked and serially sectioned to reveal a 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm subcutaneous
nodule that grossly appears to abut the deep margin. The specimen is entirely submitted in A.

INK CODE: Blue — lateral half; orange — medial half.

SECTION CODE: A1, superior tip; A2, inferior tip; A3, A4, remaining central sections, entirely submitted from superior to
inferior.
(B) MASS RIGHT AXILLA, FOR - Two tan—pink possible lymph nodes (2.0 x 1.6 x 1.4 cm and 2.0 x 1.4 x 0.8 cm). The larger
possible lymph node appears grossly positive for tumor. A portion of the larger lymph node is submitted for studies and tumor
bank. The remaining specimen is entirely submitted In B.

SECTION CODE: B1, 82, remainder of the larger possible lymph node; BB, B4, the smaller possible lymph node, entirely

COMMENT

At the request of the clinician Dr. and per . protocol, immunohistochemical studies for panmelanocytic cocktail (HMB45,
anti—Mart-1, anti-tyrosinase) was performed on tissue block B1. The tumor cells are strongly reactive for panmelanocytic cocktail.
