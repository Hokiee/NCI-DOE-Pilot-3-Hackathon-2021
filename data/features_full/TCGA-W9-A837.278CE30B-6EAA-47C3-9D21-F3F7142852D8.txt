Although a few areas of tumor appear slightly more cellular than others, no features to support progression to a higher grade are
identiﬁed in these sections. Only one mitotic ﬁgure is recognized. Some Ieptomeningeal vascular tissue, bearing a resemblance to
an angioma, is noted in (A), but no microvascular proliferation is detected in the current sections of tumor. Ongoing regular imaging
surveillance is suggested.

Interpreted by: MD, Attending Physician

The tumor has the well-differentiated appearance of oligodendroglioma, complete with perinuclear haloes, a delicate capillary
network, and even spacing of cells, in many areas. No calciﬁcations are noted. A single vessel with some increase in endothelial
cells is noted (section DZ); microvascular proliferation is not identiﬁed. Necrosis is not present in these sections. A single mitotic
ﬁgure is detected (F3) in an area of mild vascular hypertrophy. More closely packed cells with slightly more atypia are seen (F5),
and a focus of bluer, more atypical cells is noted focally in (A2). Infrequent p53 labeling of cells is noted (F5). MlB-1, performed on
several sections (F 1, F5, A2, DZ), stains relatively low numbers of nuclei. In sections from (A). several highly vascular foci of
superﬁcial Ieptomeningeal tissue include back-to-back small vessels.

A. Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and "right frontal brain lesion" is a 2.0 x 1.7 x 0.2 to 0.3 cm piece of reddish
gray matter and a 2.3 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm piece of gray-white matter. A squash is made from the ﬁrst piece of tissue, and a piece of
the second piece of tissue is submitted as A1 F8 for frozen and subsequent permanent sections. The remainder is entirely
submitted in cassettes A2 through A4.

8. Received fresh labeled with the patient‘s name and "anterior wall" is a 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm irregular piece of white-tan tissue.
Approximately ‘/2 is submitted as B1 F8 for frozen and subsequent permanent sections. Squashes are made. The remainder of
the tissue is entirely submitted in cassette 82.

C. Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and "lateral wall" is a 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm irregular piece of red-tan white
matter. Approximately ‘/2 is submitted as C1FS for frozen and permanent sections. Squashes are made. The remainder of the
tissue is entirely submitted in cassette C2. " '

D. Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and "posterior wall" is a gray-white piece of tissue with an indistinct edge
measuring 2.7 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. One~half is submitted as D1 F8 for frozen and subsequent permanent sections. The remaining
tissue is entirely submitted in cassette 02.

E. Received fresh labeled with the patient‘s name and "medial wall" is a 2.0 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm red-tan rubbery piece of tissue.
One-half is submitted as E! F8 for frozen and subsequent permanent sections. The remaining tissue is entirely submitted in
cassette E2.

F. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "right frontal brain mass" is a 4.5 x 4.2 x 1.6 cm aggregate of
tan—white tissue fragments consistent with brain tissue. There are multiple areas of hemorrhage located within the tissue. There
are also areas of softer tissue. Representative sections from throughout the specimen are submitted in cassettes F1 through F5.
