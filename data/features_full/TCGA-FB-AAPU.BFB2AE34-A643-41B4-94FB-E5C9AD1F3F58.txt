Gross Description: Whipple, FS: Received is a Whipple specimen consisting of duodenum and pancreas.
The duodenum measures 19 cm in length x 2.5—3.5 cm in diameter. Both ends are stapled closed. The
serosa is smooth, tan-pink, and the stapled margins are inked black. The duodenum is opened and
reveals a stent in the ampulla and a 1.5 x 1-cm area of flattened mucosa with underlying palpable,
indurated mass 3 cm proximal to the ampulla. The proximal duodenal margin is removed entirely en

face and used for frozen section diagnosis and is resubmitted in toto. The pancreas measures 5.8 x 4 x 4
cm. The neck margin is inked blue, and the radial margin is inked black. On sectioning, a 4 x 3.8 x 3-cm,
ill—defined, indurated, white-yellow mass with clear tan, mucinous filled cystic spaces is identified in the
head of the pancreas, 0.6 cm to the neck IUD . O . :5

margin.

The ill-defined mass surrounds the main pancreatic and common bile ducts;
however, both ducts are probe patent through the ampulla. The common bile
duct contains a blue stent. The ducts appear to enter the duodenum via
adjacent but separate ductal ampullae. Common bile duct at the margin is
dilated at 1 cm in diameter. The main pancreatic duct at the neck margin

is dilated up to 0.6 cm in diameter.

Sectioning through the mass into the duodenum proximal to the ampulla
reveals the mass to extend grossly into the muscularis of the duodenum and
a clear, mucinous, fluid-filled space, 1.4 cm in greatest dimension,

subjacent to the flattened duodenal mucosal area.

Sectioning and palpation of the peripancreatic fat reveals 14 possible

lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.3 cm in greatest dimension up to 1.2 cm
in greatest dimension. Additionally noted is a 4.2 x 3.2 x 0.6—cm, lymph

node versus splenule. All possible lymphoid tissue is submitted.

Representative sections of the largest lymph node versus splenule are

submitted. Representative sections are submitted.

Microscopic Description:

Diagnosis Details: Pancreas and duodenum, Whipple:

- Ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, moderately differentiated

- Size: 4 cm in greatest dimension

- Tumor invades through the muscularis propria of the duodenum and also extends into peripancreatic
fat

- Tumor is present at the pancreatic neck margin of the specimen (see specimen E for final margin)
- Tumor extends to the proximal duodenal margin (see specimen H for final margin)
- Tumor is within 0.1 cm of the portal vein margin and radial margins

— Perineural invasion identified

- Negative for angiolymphatic invasion

— AJCC stage: pT3 pN0 MX

~ Twelve lymph nodes, negative for malignancy (0/12)
