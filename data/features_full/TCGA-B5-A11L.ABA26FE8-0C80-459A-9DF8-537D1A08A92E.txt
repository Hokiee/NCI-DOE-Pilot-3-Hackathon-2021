CLINICALVHISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm of the corpus uteri.

GROSS EXAMINATION: *

A. "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries (AFl)". Received fresh is a
55.5 gram, 8.6 x 5.5 x 2.5 cm uterus with bilateral adnexa. The opened
specimen reveals a tan exophytic endometrial tumor (anterior and posterior
endometrium) that diffusely involves the entire cavity and invades 1.2 cm into
the 1.7 cm thick myometrium. Anteriorly the tumor extends to within 0.2 cm of
the internal cervical os. The cervix and paracervical soft tissue are
unremarkable. The remainder of the myometrium and cervical surface of the
uterus are also unremarkable. The right ovary and fallopian tube (2.1/5 cm)
contain a 0.6 cm ovarian surface nodule that has a white cut surface. The
remainder of the right ovary contains multiple cysts. The fallopian tube is
unremarkable. The left ovary and fallopian tube (1.5 cm/4 cm) are
unremarkable.

BLOCK SUMMARY:
Al— frozen section remnant AFl.
A2- tumor with maximal depth of invasion (from anterior endomyometrium).

A3- anterior cervix.

A4—A5- posterior endomyometrium with tumor.
A6— posterior cervix.

A7— right fallopian tube and ovary.

. AB- left fallopian tube and ovary.

B. "Left pelvic node". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 4 x 4 x 2 cm
aggregate of tan fibrofatty tissue. Multiple lymph node candidates are
dissected out (1.5 cm).

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: HYSTERECTOMY, OOPHORECTOMY & LYMPHADENECTOMY
PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 6th Edition): pTlc pNO pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is _
‘transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for f
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely

upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,

past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative

findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining

the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.

The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).

ADDENDUM 1: V

The remainder of the tissue in container C is submitted in block C5-C8.
Because of prior dissection of this tissue, it is difficult to know exactly
how many lymph nodes are present in these additional blocks, but there are
four lymph node profiles without evidence of carcinoma. In addition, the
original slides are reviewed from part C, C1—C4, are reviewed. In total, there
are eight lymph nodes, with no evidence of metastatic carcinoma (0/8).

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation cf the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).
