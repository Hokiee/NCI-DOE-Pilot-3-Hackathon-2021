La led prostate and bladder neck. The specimen
consists of a 50 g

prostate and seminal vesicles. The gland is 3.5 cm
from base to apex, 5.1

cm transversely, and 3.8 cm from anterior to
posterior. The seminal

vesicles are up to 4.0 cm long. The left is inked black
and the right blue.

The apical margin is shaved and then sectioned
perpendicularly. The basal

margin is similarly sectioned. The bases of the
seminal vesicles are

sampled. On section there is central nodular
hyperplasia. The peripheral

lobes are tan and spongy with a 1.5 x 0.8 cm tan-
yellow mass within the

right posterolateral periphery near the apex and a
1.9 x 1.1 cm mass along

the left posterolateral aspect near the midpoint. No
obvious extraprostatic

extension is noted. Separately within the container
are segments of vas

deferens measuring 2.1 and 2.9 cm in length as well
as a 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm

rubbery tan—brown fragment presumed to be bladder
neck. Upon sectioning, no

masses or lesions are grossly identiﬁed.

 

 

 

 

 

 

    

Sections mm the seminal vesicle
are demonstrate tumor immediately
adjacent to but no into ﬁle
structure. Sections from the
proximal inked

resection margins demonstrate
tumor inﬁltrating close to the inked
margins, but not on the ink.
Deﬁnitive detrusor muscle invasion
is not

seen. Sections from the distal inked
resection margins demonstrate
tumor on

the left side extending to the inked
margin. There are areas of
inﬁltrating prostatic adenocarcinoma
demonstrating a Gleason score of 4
+

5 = 9. Tumor involves the right
prostate lobe in a patchy fashion,
the

left prostate lobe extensively and
the anterior prostate, where it
extends

to the-inked margin. There is
penetration of tumor into the
prostatic

capsule, with extension into
extraprostatic fat in an established
