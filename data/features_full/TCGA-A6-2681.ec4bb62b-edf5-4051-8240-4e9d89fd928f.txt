SPECIMEN
Right colon

CLINICAL NOTES

PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Cancerous cecum.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

Received fresh labeled "right colon" is a previously

unopened 31 cm. segment of proximal right colon with
attached 28 cm. of distal ileum surfaced by smooth tan—pink serosa
with a copious amount of attached mesentery, mesocolon, and
unremarkable omentum. An unremarkable, 3.2 cm. appendix averaging
0.6 cm. in diameter is present. The proximal and distal margins
measure 4.2 and 7.0 cm. in circumference respectively. On opening
there is a well—circumscribed, 2.8 x 2.5 cm. rubbery tan pink—red
tumor mass within the cecal pouch, 2 cm. distal to the ileocecal
valve. A portion of tumor and a portion of normal mucosa are
submitted for tissue procurement as requested. On sectioning, the
tumor has a maximal thickness of 0.6 cm., approaching the

muscularis

and extending to within 0.5 cm. of the inked free radial serosal
surface. The ileal mucosa and uninvolved colonic mucosa is
otherwise unremarkable glistening tan-pink with regular folds and
the walls average 0.5 cm. in thickness. A few uncomplicated
diverticula are evident throughout the colonic segment. Several
soft tan pink tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 1
cm. in greatest dimension are recovered from the attached mesentery
and mesocolon. Representative sections are submitted in fifteen
blocks as labeled. RS—lS.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Proximal and distal margins; [**11—01**] ~
