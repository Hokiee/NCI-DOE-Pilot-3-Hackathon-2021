FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

PART 1: PROSTATE AND BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES. ROBOTIC-ASSISTED RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY —

A. INVASIVE POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 4 + 4 = 8 WITH TERTIARY -
GLEASON PATTERNS 3 AND 5.
THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT LOBES AND HAS A GREATEST NODULAR
DIAMETER OF 1.4 CM.
THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES APPROXIMATELY 30% OF THE EXAMINED PROSTATE VOLUME.
THE CARCINOMA SHOWS ESTABLISHED EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION.
THE EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IS SEEN IN THE POSTERIOR RIGHT BASE REGION (SLIDE 1W).
BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES ARE FREE OF CARCINOM .
THE CARCINOMA EXTENDS TO INKED SURGICAL MARGINS IN THE ANTERIOR RIGHT MID (SLIDE 10),
POSTERIOR RIGHT APEX (SLIDE 1U) AND POSTERIOR RIGHT MID (SLIDE 1V). '
ALL OTHER EXAMINED SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA.
PERINEURAL INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.
NO ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IS IDEl‘IiIED.
