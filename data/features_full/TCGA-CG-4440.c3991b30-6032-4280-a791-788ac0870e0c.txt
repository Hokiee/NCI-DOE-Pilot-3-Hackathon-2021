Diagnosis/diagnoses:

2.: Total gastrectomy preparation with part of transverse colon attached. Stomach with an
ulcerated gastric carcinoma located in the middle of the stomach on the side of the greater
curvature, extending to within 5 cm of the aboral and 7 cm of the oral resection margin,
encroaching on the anterior and posterior wall of the stomach, with a maximum diameter of 7
cm and characterized histologically as a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (gastric
carcinoma of the intestinal type). Invasive tumor spread within all the parietal layers of the
stomach extending deep into the perigastric fatty tissue and up to 4 cm into the gastrocolic
ligament and as far as the serosa with penetration of the serosa. In the tumor resection region
are branches of carcinomatous lymphangitis and small nodular carcinosis of the gastric serosa.
Oral and aboral resection margin, greater omentum and transverse colon part tumor-free.
Eighteen of twenty-four lymph nodes with gastric carcinoma metastases growing over the
capsule.

Mucosa of the antrum with barely ﬂorid, medium-grade chronic gastritis, foveolar
hyperplasia, extensive foci of intestinal metaplasia and partial atrophy of the mucosa and also
corpus mucosa with moderately ﬂorid and chronic gastritis predominantly of the superficial
type with evidence of Helicobacter pylori.

Tumor stage thus pT3 pM1 .) pN3 (18/24)-
