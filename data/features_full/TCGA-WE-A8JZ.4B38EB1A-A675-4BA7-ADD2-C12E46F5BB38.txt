NATURE OF SPECIMEN
Skin biopsy.

CLINICAL DETAILS
Specimen 1 - ?melanoma left lower leg - to fascia 5 mm margin.
?In-transit nodules left lower leg.

Specimen 2 - ?lentigo maligna left cheek — 3 mm margin, to fascia.
Marker superior for all.

MACROSCOPIC:

Two cores 6 and 9 mm and two fragments up to 3 mm. [4 (l) J.

Tear—drop shaped excision of skin 105 X 55 x 7 mm, bearing a
longitudinal, focally crusted 50 mm scar. Suture at 12 o’clock. At
one edge of the scar (towards 6 o’clock) there is an oval shaped
ulcerated area 30 x 25 mm with a peripheral 15 mm hole. 3 o’clock
inked. Slicing shows 7 mm haemorrhagic area near 11 o’clock margin

(embedded in block B). Block C is scar 3 to 9; block A is ulcerated
area with hole in two pieces. Case discussed with . [4 (3) R].

l.An irregular ellipse of skin measuring 75 x 30 x 12 mm. Suture
present at the tip. 3 o'clock edge inked orange. At the 6 o'clock
end of the specimen is a large exophytic nodule measuring 24 x 22 x
12 mm. This lesion is 7 mm clear of the closest tip. In addition
to the main lesion two nodules within the subcutis superiorly to the
large nodule are noted. The closest nodule which is approximately
10 mm superior to the large nodule measures 8 mm in maximum
dimension and the second nodule approximately 15 mm superior to the
first measures 8 mm in dimension.[Ax1; Bxl; TS through tumour with
the closest deep and peripheral margins; C, closest separate nodule,
Dxl, separate superior nodule; R] '

2.Skin ellipse 25 x 18 x 6 mm. Suture present at the tip. 3
o’clock edge inked orange. An ill defined pigmented lesion is noted
measuring approximately 15 x 10 mm.[Ax4, transverse 12 o'clock tip

+ 3 TS; Bx4, 3T8 plus 6 o’clock tip; ].

MICROSCOPY:

2. Left cheek: Skin with lentigo maligna which appears excised by at
least 3mm from the circumferential margin.

Left lower leg: ulcerated skin and underlying scar. There is no
evidence of residual malignancy.

CASE HISTORY:
Metastatic malignant melanoma

MACROSCOPIC:

1.Left groin. Ellipse 15 x 2.5 cm with a central puckered scar 0.8
cm. There is underlying fatty tissue 16 x 7 x 2 cm. Beneath the
skin mark is a 2.3 cm diameter lymph node which contains metastatic
tumour and extends very close to the deep margin (1A). A similar
1.8 cm node is present adjacent (1B). Deep margin inked.

2.Left pelvic. Fat 12 x 3 x 3 cm. It contains lymph nodes the

largest up to 7 cm. The largest has an unremarkable cut surface and
has only been sampled (2F).

MICROSCOPY:

1. 15 lymph nodes identified. 3 contain metastatic malignant
melanoma. The largest microscopic deposit is 12 mm in diameter.
Deep clearance is 0.1 mm. Extracapsular spread is seen

2. 7 negative lymph nodes

DIAGNOSIS:
LEFT GROIN LYMPH NODES: METASTATIC MALIGNANT MELANOMA
LEFT PELVIC NODES: NEGATIVE FOR TUMOUR
