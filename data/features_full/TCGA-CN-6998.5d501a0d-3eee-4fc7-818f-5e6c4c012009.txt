My s1gnature 1s attestation thatI have personally reviewed the submitted
material(s) and the final diagnosis reﬂects that evaluation.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received fresh in four parts labeled with the patient's name,
initials XX and medical record number.

Part 1 is designated "right level 1B neck dissection". It consists of a
submandibular gland (3 X 2.5 X 2 cm) and attached fibroadipose tissue (6.5 X
4.5 X 2.5 cm). The cut surface of the gland is tan-white and multilobated.
Four lymph nodes are identified in the fibroadipose tissue varying in size
from 1.2 X 1.0 X 0.6 cm to 0.5 X 0.5 X 0.4 cm. Representative sections are
submitted as follows:

1A submandibular gland

1B one lymph node bisected

1C two lymph nodes

1D two lymph nodes.

Part 2 is designated "right hemiglossectomy". The specimen measures 7 X 6 X

3.5 cm overall. The lateral surface shows two ulcers measuring 3.5 X 2.5 cm
(ulcer #1) and 1.5 X 1 cm (ulcer #2), respectively. The larger ulcer is 1 cm
from the anterior margin, 1.4 cm from the dorsal/deep margin and 1.1 cm away
from the ventral/deep margin. The smaller ulcer is 0.5 cm away from the
dorsal/deep margin and 2.5 cm away from the ventral/deep margin and 0.5 cm
from the posterior margin. All the margins were evaluated intraoperatively.
On serial sectioning, the larger ulcer shows a tan white mass (1.2 cm deep).
The smaller ulcer also shows a tan white mass (0.2 cm in depth). The two
masses grossly appear to be continuous with each other.

Ink code:

Blue ventral/deep

Green dorsal/deep

Yellow anterior

Orange soft palate/posterior

Red area banked.

Digital images are taken. Tumor was banked for head and neck- tissue
bank.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

2AFS anterior and posterior shave margins of tongue

2BFS ventral shave margin near ulcer #1

2CFS dorsal medial

2DFS posterior/uvula near ulcer

2EFS posterior/uvula near ulcer #2

2FFS deep (closest)

2G—21 tumor (ulcer #1)

2J tumor (ulcer #1 in relation to ulcer #2)

Part 3 is designated "level 1A". The specimen consists of fibroadipose tissue
measuring 3.5 X 2.5 X 0.7 cm. One lymph node is identified measuring 0.8 X
0.7 X 0.7 cm. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

3A one lymph node

3B fibroadipose tissue.

Part 4 is designated "right neck levels 2—4, big nodes 2". It consists of
ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 13 X 7 X 2 cm. An enlarged lymph node (4 X 3 X
3 cm) is identified at level 2. The cut surface is heterogeneous, tan-white
and shows areas of softening and friability. Additional possible lymph nodes
are identiﬁed at level 2, varying in size from 0.8 X 0.6 X 0.3 cm to 0.5 X

0.4 X 0.2 cm. Seven possible lymph nodes are identified at level 3, varying
in size from 1.2 X 1X 0.6 cm to 0.4 X 0.4 X 0.3 cm. Seven possible lymph
nodes are identified in level 4 varying in size from 1 X 1 X 0.3 cm to 0.4 X
0.4 X 0.3 cm. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

4A two possible lymph nodes at level 2

4B-4D enlarged lymph node, level 2

4E two possible lymph nodes, level 3

4F two possible lymph nodes, level 3

4G three possible lymph nodes, level 3

4H one possible lymph node, level 4

41 two possible lymph nodes, level 4

4] two possible lymph nodes, level 4

4K two possible lymph nodes, level 4

4L possible 1 h node, level 4
