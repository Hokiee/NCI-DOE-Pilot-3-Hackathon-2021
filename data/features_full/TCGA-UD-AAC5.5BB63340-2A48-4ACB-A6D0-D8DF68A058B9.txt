CLINICAL

Extrapleural pneumonectomy for mesothelioma. Submitted bronchial, mediastinal,
thymic lymph nodes and pericardial fluid. Superior part of specimen sent for
research and anteromedial part re-attached (resected separately).
MACROSCOPIC:

A. Two dark tan/black lobulated pieces of tissue each 9 x 7 x 6mm and 7 x 5
4mm. The larger specimen is bisected.

B. A lobulated tan/grey piece of tissue,
clot. The specimen is bisected.

BLOCK KEY:

C. The specimen consists of a 1464g (post—fixation) left extrapleural
pneumonectomy specimen (250 x 230 x 90mm) consisting of lung, 145mm
(anterior/posterior) x 40mm (medial/lateral) x 165mm), parietal pleura,
pericardium (105 x 95 x 5mm) and hemi—diaphragm (185 x 80 x 25 to 8mm). The

apical, anterior, lateral and posterior parietal pleural surfaces are grossly
thickened and exhibit subtle diffuse firm pale nodulation. The medial parietal
pleural surface above the hilum also shows similar appearances. Multiple foci
of small whitish tumour nodules are present within the inner aspect of the
parietal pericardium, extending over an area'of 65 x 55mm. There is a defect in
the anterolateral pleural wall, 70 x 35mm in area, which most likely represents
specimen taken for research prior to receipt. There are eight anthracotic hilar
nodes, ranging in size from 15 x 6 x 5mm to 7 x 4 x 4mm, of which only the
smallest shows macroecopic involvement by tumour.
The specimen is serially sliced transversely into multiple slices from apex to
hemi—diaphragm, revealing firm, rind—like cream/white tumour encasing the entire
circumference of the parietal pleura. In areas, there is fusion of the parietal
and visceral pleura with a large loculated effusion present laterally. Tumour
extends into the interlobar septa and into the subpleural lung parenchyma to a
maximum depth of 17mm. There is extensive involvement Of mediastinal fat as
demonstrated by intersecting bridges of firm white tumour. Tumour lies in close
proximity to the anterior and posterior pericardial resection margins as well as
the medial, lateral, anterior and posterior diaphragmatic
Photographs taken.

"MTCROSCOPTC: "

A. The sections show a lymph node laden with histiocytes containing carbon
pigment. Within the subcapsular sinus, there is one small focus of metastatic
mesothelioma, less than 1mm, with focal extra'capSular'extension to a distance
of less than 0.5mm.

B. The sections show shows a lymph node with one small focus,
metastatic malignant mesothelioma.

C. Multiple sections of the left extrapleural pneumonectomy were taken,
including the various resection margins from anterior and posterior pericardium,
anterior, posterior, lateral and medial diaphragm, parietal pleura and
mediastinal fat. The sections confirm wmalignaht mesothelioma exhibiting
predominantly an epithelial growth pattern with a very small component (5%) of
sarcomatous pattern. The vast majority"of the tumour is
pavement—like sheets of large cells often exhibiting a microcystic growth
pattern with focal necrosis. There is abundant pale basophilic material,
confirmed to be hyaluronate on an Alcian blue/hyaluronidase stain. The malignant
cells possess monotonous, round to oval to.mildly pleomorphic vesicular nuclei,
prominent nucleoli and abundant, often vacuolated cytoplasm. In focal areas the
cells exhibit a spindled morphology, intermixed with moderate amounts of dense
collagen. Lymphovascular space invasion is noted.

There is extensive involvement of all parietal pleural

lies close to the anterior pericardial resection margin, as well as the

anterior, posterior, medial and lateral.diaphragmatic resection margins. There
is subpleural extension into lung and extension to the internal surface of the
pericardium. The sections also confirm invasion of the mediastinal fat. The
bronchial resection margin is clear of tumour and there is no invasion of the
bronchial tree at the hilum (described macroscopically). Of eight hilar lymph
nodes retrieved, one small lymph node shows near complete replacement by
metastatic tumour with extracapsular extension to a distance of 0.5mm.

D. The sections show a lymph node with abundant histiocytes containing carbon
pigment. There is no evidence of micrometastasis identified by light microscopy.
CONCLUSION: _ y

A. Bronchial lymph node: Micrometastasis, less than 1mm,
mesothelioma, with focal extracapsular extension.
B. Mediastinal lymph node: Micrometastasis, 1.5mm,
C. Extrapleural pneumonectomy:

of malignant mesothelioma.

1. Extensive involvement by malignant mesothelioma, predominantly of
epithelial pattern, with focal (5 % or less) sarcomatous pattern.
2. Tumour

lies focally close to anterior pericardial resection margin and
anterior, posterior, medial and lateral diaphragmatic resection margins. There
is subpleural invasion of the lung parenchyma and extension to the internal
surface of the pericardium. Involvement beyond the parietal pleural margin is
extensive with invasion into mediastinal fat Bronchial resection margin is
clear of tumour.

3. Of eight hilar lymph nodes, one is positive with focal
extension (1/8).

D. Thymic lymph node: Negative for malignancy, no micrometastases.
