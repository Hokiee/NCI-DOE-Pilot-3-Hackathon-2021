B. Portal tissue

Clinical Information
Gallbladder cancer.
Infectious patient:No

Gross Description
Received are specimen containers A to B. All requisitions and specimen containers are

labelled with the patient's name, The cassettes and identifiers are
labelled with the Surgical Number

A. Specimen is received fresh. The container is designated "A. Liver segment 4~5 and
gallbladder". The specimen consists of a gallbladder with attached liver tissue. The
gallbladder measures 11.0 cm in length and 4.0 cm in diameter. There is a cholelithiasis
measuring 1.5 cm in greatest diameter perforating through the gallbladder at the cystic
duct and. This perforation site has been painted yellow. There is also an indurated
area on the anterior side of the gallbladder without evidence of perforation externally
and this area has been painted orange. The indurated area at the anterior surface of the
gallbladder appears to be fibrosed with some necrosis on sectioning without grossly
evident tumor. The external surface of the liver resection margin has been painted blue
and appears to be uninvolved by mass lesions. The attached adjacent adipose tissue
measures 9.7 x 6.0 x 1.7 cm in greatest dimension. Within the gallbladder is a
tan/white. friable, polypoid lesion measuring 3.8 x 2.4 x 2.5 cm in greatest dimension
roughly arising from the wall and occupying the whole lumen of the mid portion of the
gallbladder Adjacent to this and close to a cystic duct is the perforated
cholelithiasis that is dark brown and ovoid in shape measuring 3.9 x 2.2 x 2.2 cm in
dimension. The tumor is seen to be attached to the perihepatic wall of the gallbladder
and has a maximum depth of invasion 1.1cm through the gallbladder wall into the hepatic
parenchyma as measured from the gallbladder mucosa to the deepest portion.within the
adjacent liver parenchyma. At this area, the maximum_depth of invasion in the hepatic
parenchyma itself as measured from the outer surface of the perihepatic gallbladder wall
into the liver parenchyma is 0.3 cm. There is necrosis and hemorrhage in the central
part of the tumor. Sections are submitted as follows:

Al — shaved cystic duct margin.

A2 - grossly uninvolved part of the liver and gallbladder.

A3 - site of the cholelithiasis perforation at the end towards the cystic duct.
A4 - maximum depth of tumor invasion. split in half

AS - maximum depth of tumor invasion

A6 - area of gallbladder wall induration.

B. Specimen is received fresh and fixed overnight in formalin. The container is
designated "3. portal tissue“. Within it is a tan/brown fibrous tissue with hemorrhage.

The tissue measures 1.2 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm in maximum dimension. The specimen is bisected
and submitted in toto in one cassette. Bl.
