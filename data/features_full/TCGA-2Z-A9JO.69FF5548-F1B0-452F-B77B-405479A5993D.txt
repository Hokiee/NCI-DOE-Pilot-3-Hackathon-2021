Final Diagnosis
A. RIGHT KIDNEY, PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY:

Renal cell carcinoma with hybrid oncocytic features and focal papillary features. See Key
Pathologic Findings.

Surgical margin, free of malignancy.

Palhologic stage: 91' 1b NX MK

B. BEEP MARGIN:
Renal parenchyma, free of malignancy.

Gross Description

A. Specimen A is received fresh for frozen section analysis labeled ”right partial nephrectomy' ﬁnk
equals margin.“ The specimen consists of a 5.5 x 5.5 x43 cm partial nephrectomy. The surgical
margin resection is marked with black ink. Serial sectioning reveals a soft, red-brown mass. (4.5 x 4.5
it 3.6 cm} grossly abutting the surgical margin resection. The overlying capsute Is Intact and marked
with bios Ink. The remainder of the renal parenchyma is red-brown and grossly unremarkable.
Representative frozen sections taken and submitted as FSM. Representative section of the tumor
submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory.
Permanent representative sections are submitted as:

A2: Mirror image of tumor submitted to the Tissue Bank.

A3: Tumor shown in its relationship to weaving capsule.

MAT: Representative sections of tumor showing its relationship to adiacent tissue.

AB: Grossly unremarkable renal parenchyma.

B. Specimen B is received fresh for frozen section analysis labeled "deep margin, Ink is margin.‘
The specimen consists of 1.5 x 0.2 x 6.1 cm spit, tan-pink, irregular fragment of renal parenchyma,

which is marked with ink on the surgical margin resection.“ The specimen is serially resectioned and
entirely submitted for frozen section as F381.
