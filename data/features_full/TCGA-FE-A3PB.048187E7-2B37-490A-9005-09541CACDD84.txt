GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimens are received in eight properly labeled containers with the
patient' 3 name and accession number.

A. The specimen is designated "tissue adjacent to thyroid gland"
and consists of a 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm portion of tan, soft tissue. The
specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section and resubmitted as
received in cassette AFl.

B. The specimen is designated "right retroparotid neck mass" and
consists of a 2.3 x 1.6 x 0.4 cm portion of tan-red, soft tissue. The
specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section and resubmitted as
received in cassette BEl.

C. The specimen is designated "paratracheal mass" and consists of
a 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm portion of tan—red soft tissue. The specimen is
entirely submitted for frozen section and resubmitted as received in
cassette CFl.

D. The specimen is designated "right superior thyroid pole one
stitch = superior pole two stitches = thyroid isthmus" and consists of 6.2
gram portion of thyroid that is 4.3 x 2.3 x 1.2 cm. The specimen is
oriented with one stitch at the superior pole and two stitches at the
thyroid isthmus. The specimen is inked per frozen section as follows:
Anterior, yellow; posterior, black and isthmus, blue. The specimen is
serially sectioned from superior to inferior. The cut surfaces contain a
well-defined and well—circumscribed tan-white nodule at superior pole that
is 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm. The nodule abuts the posterior and anterior thyroid
capsule and comes to within 2.0 cm of the thyroid isthmus. A random
section of the nodule is submitted for frozen section and resubmitted as
received in cassette 0P1. The remaining thyroid parenchyma is deep red and
rubbery.

Summary of Cassettes: DFl, frozen section of nodule; D1, remainder of
nodule; 02, shaved isthmic margin; D3, uninvolved thyroid

E. The specimen is designated "mass adjacent to superior right
thyroid fold" and consists of a 1. 2 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm tan— pink nodule that has
a scant amount of attached adipose tissue. The nodule is inked black and
bisected to reveal a 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm smooth—walled cyst containing a
red-tinged clear, thin fluid.

F. The specimen is designated "right upper jugular node" and

consists of a l.0 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm gray—black nodule that has a scant amount
of attached adipose tissue. ’

G. The specimen is designated "left thyroid lobe one stitch =
superior pole two stitches = isthmus" and consists of a 9.5 gram left lobe
of thyroid that is 5.0 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm. The specimen is oriented with a
single stitch at the superior pole and a double stitch at the isthmic

Ll

 

margin. The capsule of the thyroid contains a 3.0 x 0.8 cm area of ""
disruption. The specimen is inked as follows: Anterior yellow, posterior

black and isthmic margin blue. The specimen is serially sectioned from

medial to lateral. The cut surfaces are deep red and rubbery with no

discrete lesions identified.

Summary of Cassettes: G1, shaved isthmic margin; G2, isthmus; G3-4,
two random sections of thyroid

H. The specimen is designated "left paratracheal mass" and
consists of a 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm tan—red nodule with a small amount of
attached adipose tissue. The nodule is inked black and entirely submitted
for histologic examination.
