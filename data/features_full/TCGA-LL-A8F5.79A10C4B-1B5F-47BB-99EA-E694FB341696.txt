GROSS DESCRIPTION :

A. Received fresh in the operating room labeled with the patient's name and ”right breast
lumpectomy" with request for gross evaluation of margins as well as selection of tissue for
tissue banking is a lumpectomy specimen which weighs 131 grams and measures 9 x 8 x 5 cm.
It is partially covered by a 9 x 1.5 cm ellipse of dark brown skin. Two sutures orient the
specimen as follows: long suture is 10:30 and short suture is 4:30. A palpable mass is
present within the specimen. The tissue surrounding the mass moves easily. The specimen
is inked as follows: 10:30—4 30 blue. 4:30—10 30 black, 4:30 edge red. 10:30 edge yellow.
and deep/posterior green. The specimen is serially sectioned revealing a fairly well
circumscribed grayish—tan mass with hemorrhagic needle tracts which measures 4 cm in
length. 3 cm in depth, and 3 cm in width. Towards the 4:30 aspect. the tumor has a
somewhat more lobulated appearance. The margins are negative with the closest

margin deep which measures 1.5 cm. A portion of the tumor is provided to the tissue bank
coordinator. The specimen is placed in formalin with sections to be held overnight for
optimum formalin fixation.

A4 - tumor as it most closely approximates to blue. inked margin

A5 — additional representative section of tumor

A6 — tumor grossly extending into surrounding ducts

A7 ~ section of fibrotic area near the red. inked margin

B. In formalin. labeled with the patient's name and "first sentinel lymph node" is a 2.5 x
2 x 1 cm ovoid tan lymph node covered by a small amount of adipose tissue. On cross
section. the node is largely composed of adipose tissue. It is totally submitted in blocks
Bl through B3 per sentinel lymph node protocol. The specimen was evaluated late in the day
and is found to be unfixed. It is held for overnight fixation prior to tissue processing.

C. In formalin, labeled with the patient's name and "second sentinel lymph node" is a 1.5 x
1.5 x 1 cm ovoid portion of fatty tissue which contains a 1.5 x 1 x 0.5 cm fatty lymph
node. The lymph node is submitted in block C1 to be held for overnight formalin fixation.
prior to further tissue processing. 7

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION 2
The tumor is a well delineated. nodular, necrotic. poorly differentiated carcinoma with

bizarre nuclei. increased mitotic activity. There is very little tubular differentiation.
Clinical and radiographic correlation is recommended.
