Diagnosis Note

C. HIGH GRADE UROTHELIAL CARCINOMA INVOLVES PROSTATTC
DERIURETHRAL DUCTS BUT NO INVASIVE UROTHELIAL CARCINOMA is SEEN
IN THE PROSTATE GLAND.

THE PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA SHOWS AREAS OF SIGNET “ING
MORPHOLOGY.

PAS IMMUNOSTAIN WAS EXAMINED TO DIFFERENTIATE XNVASIVE PROSTATIC
CARCINOMA FROM POSSIBLE INVASIVE UROTHELIAL CARCINOMA IN BLOCK
C16 AND THE INVASIVE TUMOR WAS POSITIVE WHILE iN SITU UROTHELIAL
CARCINOMA PRESENT IN THE SECTION WAS NEGATIVE.

AppropriaLe positive controls were StaiHEd along side sections
from this case. The control tissue was examined and judged to
be technically acceptable.

"right distal ureter FS" is a yellow—tan soft tissue measuring 5
x 3 x 2 mm. The specimen is submitted totally in B1.

c. Received in formalin labeled with the patient‘s name and
“bladder, prostate and seminal vesicles" is a specimen so
designated measuring overall 16 cm superior to inferior; ll cm
right to left; 7,5 cm anterior to posterior. The prostate itseli
seems enlarged measuring 9 cm anterior to posterior, 6 cm right
to left, 4.5 cm superior to inferior. The bladder cavity
measures 5.5 cm superior to inferior, 3.5 cm right to left, 3 cm
anterior to posterior, and is completely filled with friable
pale tan tumor apparently broadly attached posteriorly
associated with pronounced induration of the bladder wall. On
examination of the posterior aspect the specimen segments of
right and left vas extend for 4 cm on each Side. The area of the
right and left seminal vesicles is rather indurated with fat
surrounding the seminal vesicles somewhat more firm and pale tan
than usual. Scattered staple lines are present along the
posterior resection margin. The right side of the specimen is
inked blue, the left side black. Upon sectioning. there appears
to be tumor extending from the posterior prostate into the area
oi the right and left seminal vesicles bilaterally abutting the
resection margin with the left seminal vesicle practically
obliterated and the right better preserved. The tumor appears
to abut the inked resection margin both in the area of the right
and leﬁt seminal vesicle. Section code: C1=shaved left ureter;
C2=shaved right ureter; C3-C4=distal prostatic urethra shaved
from remainder of prostate and sectioned perpendicular to inked
margin; C5—C9=extensive sampling tumor surrounding left seminal
vesicle with inked surgical margin abutted; ClO—ClSnextensive
sampling right seminal vesicle including tumor and focally
abutted resection margin; C16wjunction left posterior prostate
and periprostatic extension; C17zsagittal plane section
posterior mid bladder with invasive tumor measuring up to 2 cm
thick; Claxleft lateral bladder wall anterior; C19=right lateral
bladder wall anterior superior; C20~021=right lateral bladder
wall Eull thickness section extending from papillary component
oE tumor to serosal aspect. The tumor overall measures 6 x 4 x 4
cm with entire bladder wall involved except limited area at
base.

D. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
”left pelvic lymph nodes“ are multiple fragments of fibrotatty
tissue measuring 3 x 3 X 3 cm in compact aggregate. A dominant
area of indurated fat bisected and totally submitted in D1»D2
and two additional areas of induration totally submitted split
in 03mD4.

E. Received in formalin labeled with the patient‘s name and
“right pelvic lymph nodes" are multiple fragments of
fibroadipose tissue measuring 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm in compact
totally spbmitted in El 82

aggregate. Dominant indu ati
