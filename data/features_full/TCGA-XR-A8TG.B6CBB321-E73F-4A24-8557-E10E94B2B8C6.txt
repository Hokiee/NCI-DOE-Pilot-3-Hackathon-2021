Nature of material: Liver
Biopsy number: 9“) l/Z‘i/ltl
ANATOMOPATHOLOGIC RESULT
MACROSCOPY
Received 2 vials, identified as follows:
-Liver: liver fragment, wedge-shaped, measuring 7.5 x 6.0 x 1.5 cm and weighing 61.0
9. Its external surface shows capsule with opaque and rough appearance due to the
presence of multiple micro undulations. It shows a softened and whitish lesion of
circular shape with a larger diameter 2.5 cm, 1.0 cm away from the surgical resection
margin. The remaining portions of hepatic parenchyma show hardened, brownish and a
cirrhotic pattern.
-Gallbladder: gallbladder, previously opened in its longer axis, measuring 7.5 x 3.5 x 1.0
cm. It is accompanied by the cystic duct stump, measuring 1.5 cm long and 0.6 cm in
diameter. Its outer surface is smooth and greenish-brown. The wall is gray and
homogeneous, while the mucosa shows velvety appearance and yellowish coloring,
with polypoid aspect folds. It was not observed stones.
MICROSCOPY
Description associated with the diagnosis.
DIAGNOSTIC
Product of partial hepatectomy and cholecystectomy:
-Hepatocellular carcinoma of multinodular pattern with well differentiated (grade II of
Edmonson-Steiner - in 40% of the lesion) and poorly differentiated (grade IV of
Edmonson-Steiner - in 60% of the lesion) areas. The lesion shows solid, trabecular and
small cells morphologic pattern, with higher measure of 2.5 cm and focally infiltrating
liver capsule.
-Vascular invasion and angiolymphatic embolization undetected.
-Adjacent hepatic parenchyma with micronodular cirrhosis, associated with moderate
necroinﬂammatory activity. C virus infection, according to clinical data.
-Free surgical margins.
-Gallbladder with tiny and polypoid projections in mucosa, associated with xanthomized
macrophage accumulation (cholesterol polyps): Morphological features are compatible

with cholesterolosis. No signs of malignancy, in the gallbladder.
-Pathological staging (TNM - 7th ed): pT1 pNx.
