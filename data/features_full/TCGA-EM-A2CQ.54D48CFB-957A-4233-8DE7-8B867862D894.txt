1. The specimen labelled with the patient's name and as “left biopsy lower" consists of a piece of
parathyroid tissue that weighs 0.001 g and measures 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm. It is frozen for
intraoperative consultation. ..

2. The specimen labelled with the patient's name and as “right lower parathyroid" consists of a
piece of parathyroid tissue that weighs 0.001 g and measures 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm. It is frozen for
intraoperative consultation.

2A frozen tissue resubmitted

3. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "total thyroid stitch upper right pole"
consists of a thyroid gland that is oriented with suture at right upper pole and weighs 35 g. The
right lobe measures 5.7 cm SI x 2.4 cm ML x 1.5 cm AP, the left lobe measures 5.2 cm SI x 3.1
cm ML x 1.7 cm AP and the isthmus measures 4.2 cm SI x 1.4 cm ML x 0.8 cm AP. The external
surfaces have fibrous adhesions. No parathyroid glands or lymph nodes are identiﬁed grossly.
The external surface is painted with blue dye. The lower left lobe contains a well delineated
nodule that measures 1.8 cm SI x 1.5 cm ML x 1.5 cm AP. The isthmus also contains a well
delineated nodule that measures 1.5 cm SI x 1.1 cm ML x 0.8 cm AP. The remainder of the
thyroid tissue is grossly unremarkable. Sections of nodule and normal tissue are stored frozen.
The remainder of the specimen is submitted as follows:

3A-K right lobe. superior to inferior

3L-N isthmus

30-X left lobe. superior to inferior
