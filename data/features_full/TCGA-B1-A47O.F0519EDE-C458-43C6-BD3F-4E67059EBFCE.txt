COMMENT:

The tumor cells show prominent eoslnophllle and local areas of necrosis. The Fuhrman nuclear grade ranges between 2
and 3. Some of the Fuhrman grade 2 areas with flhrohlstlocyllc cores resemble type 1 papillary renal cell carcinoma l ut
overall a dlagnosls of type 2 papillary renal cell cerclnoma ls favored.

Immunohlstochemlcal stalne are performed wlth adequate controls and demonstrate that the tumor cells are strongly

posltlve for p504e and AE113 and show local I patchy poeltlvlty forCKT, CA9, and EMA. These ﬁndings support the
above diagnosis.
