CLINICAL HISTORY:
Pelvic mass—abdominal/pelvic mass (CA125= 1487 per

 

- .1m49—1595
GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Right ovary and tube (AF1)". Received fresh is a 31.6 gram 4.2 x 3.2 x
1.8 cm ovary and unremarkable 6.3 cm long fimbriated fallopian tube (average
diameter of 0.5 cm) (AZ). Extensive tan. friable, papillary excrescences
project 2.5 cm off the ovarian serosa (Frozen AFl, remnant A1). Cut section
discloses a firmr yellow poorly defined central 0.7 cm nodule (A3—4).

B. "Right inguinal mass", received fresh and placed in formalin. A 2.1 x 1.1
x 0.5 cm specimen of light tan fibromembranous tissue which is bisected and

submitted in toto in B1.

C. "Left gutter tumor". Received fresh is a 3.9 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm specimen of
tan fibromembranous and yellow fibroadipose tissue. It contains two 1.5 cm
cysts with diameters of 1.5 cm each consisting of thin smooth walls and each
contains yellowish mucoid material. One has a 0.4 cm yellow papillary
excrescence projecting into the cyst lumen (Cl).

D. "Cul—de-sac nodule", received fresh and placed in formalin. A 1.1 x 1 x
0.6 cm aggregate of tan fibromembranous tissue submitted in toto in block D1.

E. "Left pelvic lymph node", received fresh and placed in formalin. A 2 x 1.5
x 0.3 cm aggregate of fibromembranous tan tissue containing lymph node
candidates and submitted in toto in block El.

F. "Left tube and ovary“, received fresh and placed in formalin. A 15.1 gram
specimen consisting of a 4.6 cm long fimbriated fallopian tube with a diameter
of 0.5 cm, a 2.6 x 2 x 1 cm ovary and attached soft tissue. The ovary surface
is smooth, tan, glistening except for a dark tan, friable, papillary serous
excrescence projecting focally from the ovary surface and measuring
approximately 1 x 1 x 1 cm. The parenchyma is grossly unremarkable. Section
of ovary with adjacent excrescence and fallopian tube submitted in block F1
and other ovary sections in blocks F2—3.

G. "Omentum", received fresh and placed in formalin a 15 x 10 x 5.5 cm
aggregate of yellow fibroadipose tissue containing multiple firm tan nodules
with a maximum diameter of 2 cm whose cut surfaces are solid white and grossly
metastases (Gl).

H. "Bladder sac, peritoneum", received fresh and placed in formalin. A 3.5 x
2.5 x 1 cm aggregate of tan fibromembranous tissue which contains a 0.7 cm
diameter cyst filled with clear serous fluid and is thin walled and
translucent except for at the base which is solid, light tan, papillary in
appearance and section submitted in blook Hi.

I. "Uterus and cervix", received fresh and placed in formalin. A 115.3 gram,
10.5 x 5.5 x 4.1 cm uterus is received. The serosal surface is tan and has a
1 granular consistency. The cervix is white, smooth and glistening with a

diameter of 2.8 cm. The external 03 diameter is 0.3 cm and the endometrial
canal has a tan herringbone mucosa containing a large amount of mucin. The
endometrial cavity measures 3 cm from cornu to cornu and 4.8 cm long. The
endometrium and myometrium are grossly unremarkable with average measurements
of 0.2 and 2.5 cm respectively.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

rug: 4 U1 .3

12— posterior cervix
13H anterior endomyometrium
I4— posterior endomyometrium

J. "Right pelvic lymph nodes", received fresh and placed in formalin. A 6.5 x
5 x 3 cm aggregate of yellow fibroadipose tissue containing lymph node
candidates is received. Lymph node candidates submitted in blocks J1—2.

K. "Nodule from sigmoid mesentery", received fresh and placed in formalin.
Multiple fragments of fibromembranous and Yellow fibroadipose tissue with an
aggregate 5.3 x 2.5 x 1 cm is received. Representative in block Kl.

L. "Right inguinal hernia sac", received fresh and placed in formalin. A 3 x
1.5 x 1 cm dark tan fibromembranous tissue with a smooth glistening serosal
surface is received. Representative in L1.

NOTE: Information on pathology staging and the operative procedure is being
transmitted to this Institution’s Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation purposes by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology staging is based
solely upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not
incorporate information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology
section, past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Anatomic pathology staging is only a component to be considered in
determining the clinical stage, but should not be confused with nor
substituted for it. The exact operative procedure is available in the
surgeon's operative report.
