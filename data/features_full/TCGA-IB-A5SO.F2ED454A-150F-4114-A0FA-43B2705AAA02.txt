Diagnosis
A: Omencum, Resection:
— Benign fatty tissue with focal hemorrhage

B: Lymph Node, (Node of Importance), Excision:
— Two benign, reactive lymph nodes (0/2)

C: Distal Stomach, Head of Pancreas, Bile Buct, and Proximal Duodenum.

Whipple Resection:

« Moderately differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma involving the

head of the pancreas and wall of the duodenum (see synoptic report
for details)

Soft Tissue, (Superior Mesenteric Artery), Excision:

Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in one lymph node (1/1). No
oxtranodal soft tissue extension is seen. Benign fibroadipose tissue
is also noted

Soft Tissue, (SMA margin #2), Excision:
— Invasive adenocarcinoma is present in fibroadipose tissue. No
vascular involvement is identified. Four benign lymph nodes are
present (0/4}

Soft Tissue. (Portal Vein), Excision:

— Invasive adenocarclnoma is present in fibroconnective tissue and
within the wall of a large vein. Adenocarcinoma is also present in

one of two lymph nodes (1/2)

Gross Description
Received are specimens A to W All reauisitions and specimen containers are labelled

with the patient's name, . The cassettes and AP identifiers are
labelled with the Surgical Number

A. The specimen is received fresh, labelled "omentum" and consists of an irregular
portion of hemorrhagic fatty tissue measuring 35 x 12 x 1 cm. Apart from the hemorrhagic
areas, the tissue is unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted in A1 to A3.

B. The specimen is received tresh, labelled "node of importance", and consists of
fragments of yellow- red soft tissue which measure together approximately 2.5 x 1.0 x 0.4
cm; Submitted in toto in cassettes Bl and BE.

C. The specimen is received fresh, labelled “Whipple specimen", and consists of a
resection of the proximal duodenum, distal stomach, and head of pancreas. The common bile
duct is identified via a stent and this is removed to reveal a dilated bile duct
measuring up to 1 cm in diameter and 4 cm in length. The ampulla demonstrates a slightly
irregular granular area which measures 1.3 cm in diameter. The surrounding gastric and
duodenal mucosa are otherwise unremarkable. On sectioning deep to the ampullary region,
the pancreatic head is diffusely abnormal and appears replaced by a fibrotic whitish
process measuring 3.8 cm. There is no well defined lesion within this although variable
areas of fibrosis, hemorrhagic, and microcystic change are noted.No normal pancreas is
identified.

Cl- Bile duct resection margin
C2~ proximal gastric margin

C3- distal duodenal margin

C4“ pancreatic resection margin
C5aClO— pancreas lesion
C11sC15— potential lymph nodes.

D. The specimen is received fresh, labelled "superior mesenteric artery margin", and
consists of an irregular portion of fibroadipose tissue measuring 2.3 x 1.6 x 0.5 cm.
Submitted in toto in a single cassette D1.

E. The specimen is received fresh labelled “EMA margin # 2", and consists of an irregular
portion of yellow—white fibroadipose tissue measuring 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. On sectioning,
the tissue demonstrates firm white fibrotic tissue. Specimen is bisected and submitted in
toto in cassettes El and E2.

F. The specimen is received fresh, labelled "portal vein resection“, and consists of an
irregular portion of fibroadipose soft tissue measuring 4.8 x 2.5 x 1.6 cm. On
sectioning, the tissue is firm and fibrous, but no focal lesions are identified and no
vessel lumen is seen. Representative sections are submitted in El and F“.
