breast without attached axillary tail. The breast measures 30.5 x 17.5 x
7.5 cm with overlying skin ellipse measuring 30.5 x 8 cm. The nipple
measures 1.2 x 1.2 x 1 cm and areola measures 5 x 5 cm. Two centimeters
above the nipple (upper inner quadrant). there is a well healed scar,
measuring 8 cm. A skin defect and ulceration is identified in the axillary
area, measuring 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The skin is slightly red. suggestive of a
possible surgical draining site. At the posterior aspect of the specimen,
there is a fibrotic area, measuring 6.5 x 3.5 cm. A suture demarcates the
axilla. The posterior surface of the breast is inked blue. Serial
sectioning of the specimen reveals a biopsy cavity under the scar, measuring
4 x 4 cm. The biopsy cavity is about 0.3 cm from the posterior inked margin.

The cavity is lined by hemorrhagic fibrotic tissue with bright yellow, fat
necrosis. No gross nodule is identified. Under the skin defect, there is a
hemorrhagic ares, measuring 1 x 0.4 cm. This area is very close to the
posterior fibrosis. Sectioning the rest of the breast reveals a fatty cut
surface. A few intramammary lymph nodes are identified. Representative
sections are submitted.
