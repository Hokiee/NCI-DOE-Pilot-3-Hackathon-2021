Operative Findings: Unspecified

Operative Diagnosis: Unspecified

Tissue Submitted: l)palate margin; 2)ﬂoor of mouth;

2, 3, 4; 6)left level 1A; 7)left level 1B

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1) SOURCE: Palate Margin

Received fresh for intraoperative frozen section evaluation in a container
labeled correctly with the patient's name, medical record number, and
"palate margin" are two fragments of soft tissue, one with grossly visible
mucosa, measuring each 5 X 3 X 2 mm. The entire specimen is submitted for
frozen section evaluation.

Summary of sections: lAFSC, 2/1.

2) SOURCE: Floor of Mouth

Received fresh labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and
"ﬂoor of mouth" is a 5.0 X 0.1 X 0.1 cm strip of pink-tan soft tissue. The
specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section analysis and subsequently
submitted for permanent sectioning.

Summary of sections: 2AFSC, l/l.

3) SOURCE: Buccal Mucosa Margin

Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name, medical
record number, and "buccal mucosa margin-frozen 3" is a 5 X 0.2 X 0.1 cm
strip of mucosa that is not oriented. The specimen is trisected and
submitted entirely for frozen section.

Summary of sections: 3AFSC, 3/1.

4) SOURCE: Left Composite Mandibular Resection

Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name, medical
record number, and "left composite mandibular resection" is a left mandible
which measures overall 11 X 2.5 X 2.5 cm. A small portion of normal and
tumor tissue are taken for research. The specimen is inked as follows:
superior blue, inferior black, lateral red, medial (lingual side) orange,
proximal green, and distal yellow. There is a 3.0 X 2.5 X 2.0 cm tumor
located along the alveolar ridge in close proximity to the remaining teeth.
This lesion is 1.5 cm from the proximal margin and 5.0 cm from the distal
margin. The lesion approaches focally within 1 mm of multiple mucosal
margins. It appears to involve the teeth and the mandible. Representative
portions are submitted after decalcification.

Summary of sections: 4A, proximal bony margin, 1/1; 4B, mucosal margin from
the medial surface, 3/1; 4C, mucosal margin from the red margin, 2/1;
4D-4E, full thickness section of tumor in relationship to medial, lateral,
and deep margins, submitted in two cassettes, l/l each; 4F-4G, full
thickness section through alveolar ridge in relationship to deep margin
showing tooth in relationship to tumor, 1/1 each; 4H-4I, similar section,

1/1 each.

5) SOURCE: Left Neck Levels 2, 3, 4

Received fresh in a container labeled correctly with the patient's name,
medical record number, and "left neck" is an aggregate of fibroadipose and
lymphoid tissue measuring 7 X 6 X 1.3 cm. After the fat is dissected away,

all candidate lymph nodes are submitted in their entirety.

Summary of sections: 5A-5D, candidate lymph nodes, M/l each; 5E, candidate
lymph node, 1/1; 5F, candidate lymph nodes, W1.

6) SOURCE: Left Level 1A

Received fresh in a container labeled correctly with the patient's name,
medical record number, and "level 1A" are two fragments of fibroadipose
tissue, which in aggregate measure 3.8 X 2.0 X 0.7 cm. The larger fragment
is serially sectioned to reveal grossly unremarkable fat. Both specimens

are submitted in their entirety.

Summary of sections: 6A, smaller fragment, 1/1; 6B-6C, larger fragment, 1/1
each.

7) SOURCE: Level 1B

Received fresh in a container labeled correctly with the patient's name,
medical record number, and "left level 1B" is a fragment of fibroadipose
and lymphoid and salivary gland tissue, measuring 5.5 X 3.0 X 1.5 cm. The
salivary gland is serially sectioned to reveal grossly unremarkable lobular

parenchyma. The fat is dissected and all candidate lymph nodes are
submitted in their entirety.

Summary of sections: 7A, 1 candidate lymph node bisected, 2/1; 7B-7C,
sections of unremarkable salivary gland, l/l each.
