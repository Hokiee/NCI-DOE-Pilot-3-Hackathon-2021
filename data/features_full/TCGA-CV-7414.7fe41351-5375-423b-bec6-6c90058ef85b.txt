COMMENT
The tumor measures 7.0 cm in maximum dimension. Its epicenter is
in the region of the submandibuiar saiivary giand beneath the skin overiying
the mandibie. Grossiy it invoives the mandibie and extends from the buccai
subcutaneous tissue mediaiiy to beneath the orai mucosa. The intervening
soft tissue inciuding the submandibuiar giand and skeietai muscle are
invoived by tumor. The tumor iikeiy originates in the salivary giand and
there is carcinoma in situ present in Wharton's duct and there is no
invoivement of the epidermis or mucosa. Mucicarmine stains faii to
demonstrate intracytopiasmic mucin. Sections of mandibie wiii be reported in
a suppiementai report foiiowing decaicification.

The noduie of squamous ceii carcinoma in the subdigastric area measures
1.2 cm in maximum dimension and iikeiy represents an obliterated iymph node.
The iargest iymph node metastasis compieteiy repiaces a iymph node measuring
0.7 cm in maximum dimension. Extranodai extension measuring 0.1 cm is

iresent .
