ESTROGEN/PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS INHDNDEISTOCHEMICAL REPORT

Using formalin fixed tissues (8-96 hours) and appropriate positive and negative .
internal/external controls; the test for the presence of these hormone receptor proteins is
periormed by the immunoperoxidase method according to the ASCO-CAP Guidelines. A positive
Estrogen or Progesterone receptor tumor showe nuclear immunostaining in greater than or equal to
1% of the tumor cells and the aemiquantitation immunostaining raw data is indicated below. The
ER and PR Hiatologic Score (H—Score, or HS) is calculated as the sum of intensity of staining
times the proportion of cells staining and has a dynamic range of 0 to 300.

Result H Score Raw Imunostaining Semiquantitation
