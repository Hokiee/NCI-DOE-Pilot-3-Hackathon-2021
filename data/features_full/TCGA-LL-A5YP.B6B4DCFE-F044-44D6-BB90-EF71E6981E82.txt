MICROSCOPIC DIAGNOS (Continued)

w PROLIFERATIVE FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES

COMMENT(S)

Bilateral poorly differentiated ductal carcinomas are present. Both have positive axillary
lymph nodes with the positive left axillary node present in the tail of the breast region
of the simple mastectomy specimen. Of note is that the sentinel lymph node on the left
side was found to be negative for carcinoma. High—grade DCIS with comedo necrosis is
associated with both tumors. most prominent on the left side where in some areas it is
difficult to distinguish the in situ from the invasive component. The left breast
carcinoma is associated with numerous amorphous chunk—like microcalcifications.

The previous core needle biopsy material from these tumors ( .eft and

right) were evaluated with a breast prognostic panel. The carcinomas were both
found to be weakly positive for estrogen receptor and with discordant findings with
regards to HERZ/neu by immunohistochemical stain and FISH analysis. Due to the extensive
necrosis present on the previous core needle biopsy. both tumors are being further
evaluated for HERZ/neu status. As this case was received in the department such that it
does not fall within the 6—48 hour time frame for formalin fixation and due to some
difficulty in sorting out the invasive component from the DCIS component in sections of the
left breast mass, the positive lymph node from the left breast with 5 hours of formalin
fixation and two sections of the tumor from the right breast (block Cl with 5 hours of
formalin fixation and block C5 with 77 hours of formalin fixation) are being further
evaluated for HERZ/neu status by immunohistochemical stains and possible FISH. The results
of these studies will be reported separately as an addendum.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh for Tissue Banking. gross evaluation and "left breast". Received is

a 413 gram. 27.0 x 12.5 x 3.0 cm fibrofatty breast. The breast has an overlying 24.0 x 12.5
cm portion of brown/black skin. The skin has a central to slightly eccentric 5.5 x 4.5 cm
areola and a somewhat central 1.5 cm nipple. The skin surface has multiple papules with no
scars or lesions identified. The deep margin is predominantly smooth and is inked blue. The
breast is serially sectioned from medial to lateral to have a central/lateral 2.0 x 1.0 x
1.4 cm indurated to centrally necrotic hemorrhagic to yellow appearing tumor mass. The
tumor mass is at least 18 cm from medial. is approximately 5 cm from lateral. is
approximately 5 cm from superior and 5 cm from inferior. The tumor is 0.2 cm from the deep
margin and the deep margin slides easily over the mass. Sections of tumor are sampled for
Tissue Banking. A large. 1.4 X 1.0 x 0.8 cm. nodular lymph node is identified in the
lateral most aspect of the breast tissue. Two additional smaller lymph nodes are present. A
section of the large lymph node is sampled for frozen section diagnosis. The two smaller
nodes are 0.4 and 0.8 cm. The remainder of the breast tissue is diffusely fibrous with
fibrocystic change. There is indurated fibrocystic change adjacent to the tumor and ranges
up to an additional 2.0 cm. The white fibrous tissue makes up between 75 and 80% of the
parenchyma. There is diffuse ecchymotic hemorrhage lateral to the tumor predominant in the
lower/outer quadrant. The breast tissue is diffusely nodular, however. no additional
discrete tumor like mass is identified. Representative sections are sampled to be submitted
following overnight fixation for a repeat of tumor markers. The remainder of the specimen
will be held for fixation. Representative sections are sampled as labeled in the following
cassettes:

A1 - frozen section residue
A2 — remainder of the lymph node
A3 w sliver of tumor

GROSS DESCRIPTION: (Continued)
All these sections will be submitted following overnight fixation. The remainder of the
sections will be submitted following further fixation as labeled:

tumor)

A13 — upper/inner quadrant sampled

A14 — lower/inner quadrant sampled

B. Part B is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and "left sentinel
node“. Received is a 3.5 x 2.5 x 0.8 cm aggregate of yellow adipose. The adipose is
sectioned to have three nodular lymph nodes which range from 0.5 cm to a linear 1.7 x 0.6 x
0.4 cm. The larger node has been designated in the 0R as the sentinel node. Each node is
sectioned perpendicular to the long axis to be entirely submitted per sentinel lymph node
protocol with the sentinel node submitted in 31—82 and the additional nodes submitted
separately BB—Bd.

C. Received fresh for Tissue Banking, labeled with the patient's name and "right breast
with axillary node contents” is a 445 gram. 23.0 x 13.0 x 3.0 cm fibrofatty breast. The
breast has an overlying 22.5 x 11.0 cm black/brown skin ellipse. The ellipse has multiple
raised papules across the surface and an eccentrically. medially located 6.0 x 5.0 cm
areola with a 1.3 cm mildly flattened nipple. No scars or lesions are identified on the
skin surface. The breast is received with a 9.0 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm axillary tail and the
specimen is consistent with a modified radical mastectomy specimen. The deep fascial plane
is smooth and somewhat irregular. The deep fascial plane will be inked blue and the breast
is serially sectioned from medial to lateral to have a medially located 4.0 x 3.7 x 3.0 cm
tumor mass. The mass is 0.5 cm from the nearest inked deep margin. There is a portion
that comes within 0.6 cm of superior. 0.8 cm of medial and is 0.4 cm from inferior at the
medial most tip of the breast specimen. A second spherical 2.0 cm mass is located in the
upper/outer quadrant. This mass is 0.4 cm from the deep margin and the deep margin slides
easily over the mass. The second mass is approximately 2.5 cm from superior. is 12.5 cm
inferior. is 15 cm from medial and 8 cm from lateral. Further sectioning of the large mass
shows it to focally extend to the superior peripheral margin. The remainder of the breast
parenchyma has diffuse dense white fibrous tissue with diffuse fibrocystic change. The
fibrous tissue makes up between 80 and 90% of the parenchyma. No additional discrete tumor
like masses are identified. The axillary tail is sectioned to have multiple nodular lymph
nodes. The nodes include tumor replaced nodes and range up to a positive. 4.0 x 2.5 x 2.5
cm. lymph node. The large lymph node appears to have necrosis in the center. similar to
the necrosis in the large tumor mass. Representative sections are sampled as labeled in
the following cassettes:

C1 a sliver of tumor which will be submitted following overnight tissue
processing for tissue markers

C2 - nipple

C3 a on face section of areola

C4 — section of large tumor mass to deep margin

C5—C6 — large tumor mass to superior/medial peripheral margins
