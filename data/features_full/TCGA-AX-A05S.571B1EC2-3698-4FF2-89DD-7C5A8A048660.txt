I ntraoperative Consultgﬂon:

An intraoperative non-microscopic consultation was obtained and Interpreted as: "Called to pick a 'cervix, uterus.
bilateral tubes and ovaries' consists of a uterus and cervix that measures 9 cm from superior to interior. 6.5 cm from
cornu-to-cornu and 4.2 cm from anterior to posterior with attached unremarkable bilateral adnexa. The specimen
weighs 221 grams. The anterior and posterior serosa show areas ol firmness and yellow-tan discoloratiOn (12 x 1 cm
anterior serosa); 2.5 x 2 cm on the posterior serosa, consistent with involvement by malignanCy. The light purple—tan
ectocervix measures 4.5 x 3 cm opened to show a 3 cm endocervlcal canal and endometrlal (5 x 2.5 cm) completely
filled by red-tan friable tumor. Sectioned to show a putative invasion through the entire mvometrium nn both anterior
and posterior wall. Tumor, unremarkable cervix taken for Rest for permanents.‘

Microscopic examination substantiates the above cited diagnosis. Additional deeper levels and a cytokeratin stain have
been examined on the right common periaortic lymph node. No carcinoma is identified.

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

The specimen ls received in eight formalin-tilled containers each labeled ' ‘ . ." The first container Is
labeled 'cervix, uterus. bilateral fallopian tube and ovaries." It holds a 221 gram uterus with attached cervix and
attached bilateral adnexa that measures 9 cm from superior to inferior. 6.5 cm from cornu to cornu and 4.2 cm from
anterior to posterior. The serosal surface is glistening and shiny with a firm area of serosal discoloration both anteriorly
and as posteriorly. The 5 x 4.5 x 4 cm cervix has a 5 x 4 cm beige. glistening shiny ectocervix and a 0.8 cm external
05. The 4 x 1 cm endocervical canal is pinkstan. The 5 x 4.2 cm endometrial cavity is completely filled by a tan-yellow,
necrotic tumor. There Is no endometrial lining grossly identified. The mass appears to invade the entire myometrium
anteriorly as well as the posteriorly, The mass appears to invade the lower uterine segment. The maximal myometrial
thickness is 2 cm. Sectioning shows a putative leiomyoma that measures 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm. The 2 x 1.2 x 1 cm pink-tan
left ovary has a normal outer surface. Cut sections show ovarian parenchyma. The attached fallopian tube with
fimbrial and measures 5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. Cut sections shows a pinpoint lumen. The 1.5 x 1.2 x 1 cm pink-tan right ovary
has a normal outer surface. Section shows a putative pink-tan ovarian parenchyma. The 5 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm fallopian
tube with fimbrial end has a normal outer surface. Cut sections show a pinpoint lumen.

Sections are submitted as follows: Al and A2 - anterior posterior cervix: A3 and A4 - anterior posterior lower uterine
segment; A5 to A7 < anterior endomyometrium which was replaced by a tan-yellow necrotic tumor; A8 to A10 ~
posterior endomyometrium with tumor which completely replaced the endomyometrium; A1 1 - putative leiomyoma. A12
and A13 - left adnexa; A14 and A15 - right adnexa. Jar 2.

The second container is labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes.” It holds multiple fragments of adipose tissue that measure
4.5 x 4 x 0.3 cm in aggregate from which multiple putative lymph nodes. the largest measuring 0.8 x 05 x0 .3 cm and
the smallest one measuring 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. are dissected. Labeled Bl to BS. Jar O.

The third container is labeled "left obturator lymph node.” It holds multiple fragments of adipose tissue that measure 3
x 3 x 0.5 cm In aggregate from which multiple putative lymph nodes are dissected. The largest one measures 2 x 1 x
0.4 cm. the smallest one measures 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. Labeled Ct to 02. Jar 0.

The fourth container is labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes.” it holds multiple fragments of adipose tissue that measure 6
x 5 x 0.3 cm in aggregate from which multiple putative lymph nodes are dissected. The largest one measures 2 x 1 x
0.3 cm, the smallest one measwes 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. Labeled 01 to 03. Jar 0.

The fifth container is labeled "right obturator lymph node.“ It holds a single putative lymph node that measures 2.5 x 2
x 1 cm. Bisected and labeled E1 through E2 (one lymph node). JarO.

The sixth container is labeled "right common periaortic.“ it holds multiple fragments of adipose tissue that measure 3 x
3 x 0.3 cm, Two putative lymph nodes are dissected. the larger one measures 1.8 x 1 x 0.2 cm. The smaller one
measures 1 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm. Labeled F1 and F2. JarO.

The seventh container is labeled "left common periaortic lymph node #7." It holds multiple fragments of adipose tissue
that measures 2.5 x 2 x 0.3 cm. Multiple putative lymph nodes are dissected. The largest one measures 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.2
cm. the smaller one measures 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. Labeled Gt through G2. Jar 0.

The eighth container is labeled “omenlal biopsy." It holds a single fragment of adipose tissue measures 10 x 8 x 0.7
cm. Cut section shows normal adipose tissue. There is no firm fibrous lesion identified. Labeled H1 to H5. Jar 1.
