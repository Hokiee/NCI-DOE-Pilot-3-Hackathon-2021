lNTRAOPERATlVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:

FSA: Lymph node. left pelvic, biopsy: Negative for tumor. By Dr., called to Dr. _

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. LEFT PELVlC LYMPH NODES
Received fresh labeled with patient name designated "A — left pelvic lymph node" are multiple
fragments of yellow-red adipose tissue measuring 4 x 3 x 1 cm in aggregate. Two possible lymph
nodes are identiﬁed measuring 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm. and 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. Both lymph nodes are
submitted entirely for frozen section. The remainder of the specimen is submitted in cassettes A2

through A5.

B. PROSTATE
Received fresh labeled with patient name designated "B —— prostate" is a resented prostate gland
weighing 51 grams and measuring 5 cm from right to left, 4.3 cm from anterior to posterior, and 3.? cm
from apex to base. The external capsule is red, smooth and intact. The specimen is inked as follows:
apex-red, anterior-orange, base«blue, posterior-black, rigbt~green. left—yellow. The apex and base are
disassembled from the specimen to yield a new weight of 21 grams. The specimen is serially sectioned
from apex to base. Cut sections show tan—beige ﬁrm, ﬁbrous parenchyma. The right seminal vesicle
measures 2.4 x 2 x 0.5 cm and the left seminal vesicle measures 3.5 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm. Both are bisected
to show beige—tan cystic tissue. Both the right and left vas deferens measure 5.5 cm in length by 0.5
cm in diameter, and 5 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter, respectively. Both right and left vas deferens
are serially sectioned to show ﬁrm, beige tube-like structure. A portion of the specimen is submitted for
tissue procurement and the remainder is entirely submitted for microscopic evaluation. Cassettes are
submitted as follows:

Bi: level 1 right side

B2: level 1 left side

BS: level 2 right anterior

B4: level 2 right posterior

BS: level 2 ieft anterior

86: level 2 left posterior

87-88: level 3 capsule, right side

89: level 3 capsule, left side

810-811: right apex

812-813: left apex

Bl4-Bt6: right base with proximal urethral margin

817-819: left base with proximal urethral margin

820—821: right lateral base

822: left lateral base

823: right posterior base with root of right seminal vesicle and vas

B24: left posterior base with root of left seminal vesicle and vas

825: section of right seminal vesicle and representative section of right vas

B26: section of left seminal vesicle and representative section of left vas

DIAGNOSIS:
A. LYMPH NODES, LEFT PELVlC, DISSECTION:
— FIVE LYMPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (DIS).
