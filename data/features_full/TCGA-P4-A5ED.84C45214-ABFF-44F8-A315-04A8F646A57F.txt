Pathology Report

DIAGNOSIS

(A) LEFT KIDNEY:

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, PAPILLARY, TYPE 2, FUHRMAN'S NUCLEAR GRADE 3 (3.0 CM). (SEE COMMENT)
TUMOR CONFINED TO THE KIDNEY.
Ureteral and vascular margins free of tumor.

COMMENT

The tumor is a papillary renal cell carcinoma that exhibits extensive mucinous change appearing as basophilic intraluminal
secretions on H & E. The Mayer's mucicarmine and Alcian blue stains are positive. The presence of an otherwise typical papillary
renal cell carcinoma is an unusual ﬁnding. The tumor is negative for CD10.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT KIDNEY - A left nephrectomy specimen, (12.0 x 5.7 x 5.0 cm), with associated perinephric fat and an attached ureter.

The ureter is 7.0 cm in length With a diameter of 0.3 cm. The ureter and hilar vessels are grossly unremarkable.
In the superior pole of kidney. adjacent to the pelvis within the cortex is an ovoid circumscribed mass, 3.0 x 2.7 x 2.2 cm.
The mass has a friable pale yellow to tan homogenous cut surface, and focally abuts the renal capsule. The mass does not

inﬁltrate beyond the renal capsule into the perinephric adipose tissue and does not grossly invade the renal sinus. No hilar lymph
nodes are identiﬁed, and no tumor is identiﬁed within the renal vessels.

The renal parenchyma away from the tumor is unremarkable, with ﬁrm red-brown cortex, distinct cortico-medullary
junctions, and unremarkable uretero-pelvic mucosa.

A portion of the tumor is submitted to the Tumor Bank and a portion is placed in glutaraldehyde for possible further
electron microscopic studies.

SECTION CODE: A1, ureter and vascular margins; A2, normal kidney parenchyma from the inferior pole, including renal
papillae, cortex, and pelvis; A3, tumor and renal capsule; A4, A5, tumor and renal pelvis interface; A6, A7, representative sections
of tumor; A8, tumor and surrounding kidney; A9, tumor and adjacent pelvis.

CLINICAL HISTORY

Left renal mass.
