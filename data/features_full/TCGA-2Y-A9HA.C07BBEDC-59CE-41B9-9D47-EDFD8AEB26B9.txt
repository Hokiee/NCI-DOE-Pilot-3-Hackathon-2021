Gross Description

A. The specimen is received fresh, labeled ”liver segment 6" and consists of an unoriented.
reeected segment of liver, 65.5 g, and 6.9 x on it 4.5 cm. The capsule is intact and pitted. No lesion
is grossly seen. The deep margin is contented and inked blue. The cat surfaces exhibit a golden
yellow, circumscribed, circular, spongy mass (1.? cm mameter} which is t are from deep margin and
does not involve the capsule. The lesion does not grossly involve vasculature. Necrosis {5%) is
noted. with no hemorrhage identified. Normal liver oarenchyma Is coarsely Iobulated and congested.
No satellite lesions are noted. Representative sections are submitted in A1-AB as labeled:

A1: Mirror image section of liver lesion for Tissue Procurement
Laboratory.

A2—A3: Liver lesion nearest deep margin.

A4: Liver lesion with vasculature.

Afr—AIS: Liver lesion with necrosis.

A7: Tumor random.

AB: Normal liver porenc hyma.

The tissrze is submitted for Tissue Procurement Laboratory.

B. The specimen is received fresh, labeled ”liver segment 8" and consists of an moﬁented,
ovoid, resected segment of liver, 10.1 g, 3.7 x 2.8 cm, excised to a depth of 2 cm. The capsule is
intact. smooth and glistening. The marg'n of resection is inked bite. The cut surfaces exhibit a pale.
gray-tan. solid. circumscribed, intraparenchymal lesion, 1.5 x 1.3 x 1.4 cm. The lesion is 3 mm deep
from capsule and extends to the deep margin. Punctate necrosis, indicative of biopsy site is noted,

with no hemorrhage identified. The remaining parenchyma is normal, with no satellite lesion noted.
Representative sections. including the entire lesion are submitted in 81-85 as labeled:

81-32: ﬁver lesion nearest deep margin.
33-84: {iver tesion with potential biopsy site.
35: Normal liver parenchyma.

The spectrum is not submitted for Tissue Procurement Laboratory.

C- The specimen is received fresh, labeled ”liver segment I3 new margin; ink-true margin“ and
consists of an oriented, irregular resected liver fragment, £5 9. 2.8 x 2.1 cm. excised to a depth of 3.1
cm- The specimen is markedly cauterized and the deep margin is re-inked blue. A capsule is not
identiﬁed. The cut surfaces exhibit smooth, coarsely tabulated, tamed parenchyma, with no lesion
gross iv seen. Necrosis is not identiﬁed. The specimen is submitted entirely In 0-1-03.

The specimen is not submitted for Tissue Procurement Laboratory.
