Report GROSS EXAMINATION:
The specimen is received in a container labeled with the
name of the patient and identified as breast, right breast.
The specimen consists of a simple mastectomy measuring en
bloc 15.5 x 9.5 x 3.1 and weighs 115 grams. There is an
anterior ellipse of skin measuring 16.5 x 7.5 cm with an
eccentric 2.7 cm areolar complex with everted nipple.
Sections of nipple areola are sampled in block 1. The skin
surface shows a 4 cm long scar located near the lateral
margin and is sampled in block 2. The superficial superior
margin is inked orange and the superficia inferior margin
is inked green. The deep margin is inked black and the
specimen sectioned, showing a firm pale tan mass measuring
4.2 x 3.7 x 2.9 cm. The mass is located in the upper inner
and lower inner quadrants. The mass grossly extends to the
inked deep margin and is 1.7 cm from the superficial
superior margin and 1.9 cm from the superficial inferior
margin. The skin overlying the mass is disrupted. Sections
of the mass are submitted in blocks 3-7. The remaining
breast is com osed of yellow lobulated adipose tissue
admixed with islands of gray-white rubbery tissue. The
breast is divided into four quadrants, upper inner, lower
inner, upper outer and lower outer and sampled in blocks
8-11 respectively. No axillary tissue is grossly
identified.

Formalin fixation time is approximately 12 hours.

 

DIAGNOSIS BASED ON GROSS AND MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

Breast, right simple mastectom :
- Invasive ducta1*carcinoma;of breast, grade 2, extending to
within 0.4 mm of the deep margin (see cancer case summary
