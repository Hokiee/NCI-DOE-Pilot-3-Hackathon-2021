Microscopic Description:

H&E stained tissue demonstrates a moderately cellular neoplasm consisting of cells
demonstrating perinuclear clearing. No necrosis is identified. No vascular proliferation is
identified. The mitotic count is 0 per 20 high â€”power fields.

Addendum Discussion:

The sections demonstrates a minimally hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely
infiltrates both the gray and white matter. In the gray matter, perineural satellitosis is
seen. The tumor cells have round nuclei with little atypia. Most have just a small cap of
eosinophilic cytoplasm without prominent fibrillary processes. The minority
demonstrates well-formed perinuclear halos. No mitotic figures are seen. There is no
microvascular proliferation or necrosis. Only rare MIB-l reactive cells are present, with a
labeling index of 0.1%, indicative of a minimally proliferation neoplasm.

Addendum Diagnosis:

Oligodendroglioma, Who Grade II
MIB-l Labeling Index: <0.1%
