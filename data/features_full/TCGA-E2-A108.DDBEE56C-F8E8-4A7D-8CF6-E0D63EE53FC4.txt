INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:
TPA1: LN positive for carcinoma (SLN #1)
TPB1 and TPB2: LY negative for carcinoma (SLN #2)
C: Gross: Right breast, 1st lesion 2.2 cm, at distance from all margins (1.5 from closest superior margin)
2nd lesion 3.0 cm from the 1st lesion, size 0.8 cm, 0.4 cm from the closest inferior margin.
By Dr. called to Dr. at ' . (A, B) and 3)

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 RIGHT AXILLA
Received fresh labeled with the patient identiﬁcation and "sentinel lymph node #1", is a 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.8-
cm fatty lymph node displaying a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.4-cm ﬁrm white tumor nodule. Touch preparations are
performed. The lymph node is representatively submitted in cassette A1.
8. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 RIGHT AXILLA
Received fresh labeled with the patient identiﬁcation and "sentinel lymph node #2, right axilla", are 2
tan-pink to fatty lymph nodes, 0.5 cm (B1) and 1.2 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm (82). A touch preparation on each
lymph node is performed and the lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows:

B1: Smaller lymph node

BZ: Largest lymph node
C. RIGHT BREAST LUMPECTOMY
Received fresh labeled with the patient identiﬁcation and "right breast lumpectomy", is an oriented
(single - anterior, double - lateral, triple - superior), 153.0-gram, 11.5 x 8.5 x 3.0—cm needle localized
lumpectomy with radiograph. Ink code: Anterior - yellow, posterior - black, medial - green, lateral - red,
superior - blue, inferior — orange. The specimen is serially sectioned into 9 slices revealing a 2.2 x 1.8 x
1.8-cm inﬁltrative ﬁrm gritty white tumor (mass #1 - 12 o’clock). Mass #1 is closest to the anterior and
superior margins at 1.5 cm each. Tissue is procured. There is a second mass/biopsy site, 0.8 cm
which is closest to the inferior margin at 0.4 cm and 3.0 cm from the ﬁrst mass. The remaining ﬁbrous
tissue is ﬁnely lobulated with interspersed clear ﬂuid-ﬁlled 0.2-cm cysts. No additional nodules are
identiﬁed. A gross evaluation is performed. Representatively submitted:

C1: Slice 1, medial margin, perpendicular

C2-C3: Slice 4, tumor to closest anterior superior margins

C4-C6: Slice 6, tumor to superior posterior margins

C7: Slice 6, anterior margin

C8: Slice 6

D. RIGHT AXILLARY CONTENTS LEVELS 1 AND 2
Received in formalin labeled with the patient identiﬁcation and "right axillary contents levels 1 and 2", is
a 9.0 x 5.0 x 1.8-cm portion of adipose tissue, within which 20 possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed
ranging from 0.2 to 3.5 cm. There are 2 tan-pink to fatty lymph nodes exhibiting inﬁltrative tumor, 0.4
and 0.5 cm. Also identiﬁed are 3 matted lymph nodes with an overall dimension of2.2 cm. The
specimen is representatively submitted as follows:

D1: Four whole lymph nodes

D2: Four whole lymph nodes

D3: Three whole lymph nodes

D4: One lymph node bisected

D5: One lymph node bisected

D6: Two whole lymph nodes

D7: Two positive lymph nodes

D8: Three possible matted lymph nodes

D9-D20: Remaining soft tissue
E. SUPERIOR MARGIN
Received in formalin labeled with the patient identiﬁcation and "new superior margin", is a 5.0-gram, 6.0
x 2.0 x 0.8-cm oriented portion of breast (suture at ﬁnal margin). The ﬁnal margin is inked black and on
serial sectioning, no discrete lesions are identiﬁed. Entirely submitted in cassettes E1-E4.
F. MEDIAL MARGIN
Received in formalin labeled with the patient identiﬁcation and "medial margin", is an oriented (suture at
ﬁnal margin) 5.0-gram, 4.5 x 2.8 x1.7-cm ﬁbrofatty tissue. The ﬁnal margin is inked black and on
serially sectioning, no discrete lesions are identiﬁed. Entirely submitted in cassettes F1-F4.
G. INFERIOR MARGIN
Received in formalin labeled with the patient identiﬁcation and "inferior margin", is an oriented (suture at
ﬁnal margin) 4.0-gram, 4.0 x1.5 x1.3-cm ﬁbrofatty tissue. The ﬁnal margin is inked black and on
serially sectioning, no discrete lesions are identiﬁed. Entirely submitted in cassettes G1-GS.

DIAGNOSIS:

A. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #1, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION:
— METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE OF ONE LYMPH NODE (1/1), MEASURING 0.4-CM WITH NO
EXTRANODAL EXTENSION.

B. LYMPH NODES, SENTINEL #2, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION:
- TWO LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/2).

C. BREASTéLCﬁ WIDE LOCAL EXCISION:

- INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 3, MEASURING 2.2-CM

- HIGH NUCLEAR GRADE, DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, SOLID TYPE WITH CENTRAL
NECROSIS AND LOBULAR EXTENSION

- SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR

- BIOPSY SITE CHANGES WITH FIBROSIS AND GRANULATION TISSUE

- SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT AND SEE NOTE.

D. LYMPH NODES, RIGHT AXILLARY CONTENTS, LEVELS 1 AND 2, DISSECTION:

- METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO FOUR OF TWENTY FOUR LYMPH NODES (4/24), LARGEST
MEASURING 1.0-CM WITH FOCAL EXTRANODAL EXTENSION.

E. BREAST, SUPERIOR MARGIN, EXCISION:

- BREAST TISSUE, NO TUMOR SEEN.

F. BREAST, MEDIAL MARGIN, EXCISION:
- BREAST TISSUE, NO TUMOR SEEN.

G. BREAST, INFERIOR MARGIN, EXCISION:
- BREAST TISSUE, NO TUMOR SEEN.

NOTE: Grossly, two tumor masses are identiﬁed, one larger located in the superior anterior and one
smaller located in the inferior lateral aspect of the specimen. The larger mass is composed of invasive
ductal carcinoma measuring 2.2—cm. The smaller tumor is composed of biopsy site changes with
granulation tissue intermixed with clusters of neoplastic ducts located only in the lymphatic channels
(CD31 and D2-4O mark involved spaces). Located in the same level (slice #7) more towards the center
of the specimen is a microscopic focus of DCIS.
