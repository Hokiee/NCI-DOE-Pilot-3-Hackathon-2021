CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral breast carcinoma.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS
A) Lymph node, sentinel node left, excision: One lymph node
negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/1). ‘
FFSl, FFSZ: Palpable area, right axilla, biopsy - Benign lymph
node
present.
GFS: Sentinel node #2, right axilla, biopsy - One lymph node with
no evidence of metastasis.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Received fresh for frozen section labeled "left
sentinel lymph node #1" is an irregularly shaped fragment
of blue stained tissue that measures 1. 3 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. in
dimension. Tissue is entirely frozen.
B. Received fresh, labeled "left breast stitch 12
o‘clock"
is a 26.0 cm.(medial to lateral) x 24.5 cm.(superior to
inferior) x 4.5 cm.(anterior to posterior) diffusely cauterized and
focally blue stained soft, lobulated tan gold- white portion of
fibroadipose tissue in keeping with breast designated as left per
requisition slip and container and oriented by a single suture as
stated previously. A 5.5 cm. (medial to lateral) x 2. 3 cm.(superior

GROSS DESCRIPTION
to inferior) portion of dusky tan white skin with a central,
everted, 1.3 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm. nipple is present along the anterior
aspect. The deep margin is inked black and the specimen is
sectioned. There is a roughly spherical, 2.4 cm. clot—filled
biopsy

cavity within the lower inner quadrant. The cavity is present

within 1.2 cm. of the anterior surface (inked blue see block 2) and

2.8 cm. of the inked deep margin (see block 1). Several
cylindrical

tan white firm structures are evident within the cavity. The
periphery of the cavity is fibrotic with diffuse chalky yellow fat
necrosis. Lateral to the cavity is an ill—defined focus of firm,
tan white fibrous tissue with dilated ductal structures (see blocks
6 and 7). Within the center of the focus, there appears to be a

 

stellate 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. rubbery tan white lesion which is 0.5

cm. from the inked deep margin (see blocks 7 and 8). The remaining
cut surfaces throughout the specimen consists predominately of
glistening lobulated golden yellow adipose tissue with a moderate
amount of interspersed focally blue stained dense tan white fibrous
tissue. No additional mass lesions are identified. Representative
sections are submitted in fourteen blocks as labeled. RS—14.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Biopsy cavity to inked deep margin; 2 — biopsy
cavity to anterior surface; 3—5 - biopsy cavity to adjacent
parenchyma; 6 — firm area lateral to biopsy cavity; 7—8 - apparent
lesion lateral to biopsy cavity to inked deep margin; 9 - random
upper outer quadrant; 10 — upper inner quadrant; 11 — lower inner
quadrant; 12 - lower outer quadrant; 13 — junction of the four
quadrant; 14 - nipple.

C. Received fresh, labeled "tail of Spence", is a 5 x 4 x

1.6 cm. portion of soft, lobulated golden—yellow adipose
tissue. Three soft tan—pink—gold tissues, in keeping with lymph
nodes, measuring up to 1.5 cm. in greatest dimension, are

recovered.

The lymphoid tissues are entirely submitted in three blocks, as

GROSS DESCRIPTION

 

labeled. RS—3

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - One whole presumptive node; 2,3 - one bisected
presumptive node per cassette.

D. Received fresh, labeled "nodule inferior skin flap —

stitch 6 o'clock", is a 3.8 cm. (9 to 3 o'clock) x 0.9 cm.
(12 to 6 o'clock) wrinkled tan-white skin ellipse, with a suture
along one aspect, as stated previously. The 12 o'clock half is
inked blue and the 6 o'clock half is inked black. There is a
stellate, rubbery, 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm. tan—white nodular lesion
within the 9 o'clock half of the specimen, which appears to extend
to within less than 0.1 cm. of the inked 12 o'clock surface. The
specimen is entirely submitted in a sequential manner from 3 to 9
o'clock in four blocks (nodule block 3).

E. Received fresh, labeled "right breast double long 12

o'clock, single long hard mass 10 o'clock" is 27.0
cm.(medial to lateral) x 23.5 cm.(superior to inferior) x 4.5
cm.(anterior to posterior) diffusely cauterized and focally blue
stained soft, lobulated tan gold—white portion of fibroadipose
tissue in keeping with breast designated as right per requisition
slip and container and oriented by double suture as stated
previously. A 4.4 cm.(medial to lateral) x 2.5 cm.(superior to
inferior) dusky tan white skin ellipse with a central, everted, 1.0
x 1.0 x 0.6 cm. nipple is present along the anterior aspect. A
second single suture is present at approximately 9-10 o'clock. The

 

 

intact deep margin is inked black and the specimen is sectioned.
There is a moderately well circumscribed, 5.0 cm.(superior to
inferior) x 3.4 cm.(medial to lateral) x 3.0 cm.(anterior to
posterior) multi-loculated slightly firm cystic structure subjacent
to the aforementioned single suture at the junction of the upper

and

lower outer quadrants. The cyst focally extends to within 0.3 cm.
of the inked deep margin (see blocks 1 and 2) and is 1.5 cm. from

GROSS DESCRIPTION
the anterior surface (subsequently inked blue). A portion of the
cystic focus and a portion of normal parenchyma are submitted for
tissue procurement as requested. The cut surfaces throughout the
remainder of the specimen consists predominately of glistening
lobulated golden yellow adipose tissue with a moderate amount of
interspersed diffusely cystic tan white fibrous tissue. No mass
lesion or additional abnormalities are identified. Representative
sections are submitted in 16 blocks as labeled. RS—16.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1—2 - Cystic structure to inked deep margin; 3—4 —
cystic structure to inked anterior margin; 5—10 - representative
cystic structure to surrounding parenchyma including firm area
sequentially from lateral to medial; 11 - random upper outer
quadrant; 12 ~ upper inner quadrant; 13 - lower inner quadrant; 14

lower outer quadrant; 15 — junction of the four quadrants; 16 -

nipple.
F. Container F is labeled with the patient’s name,
medical
record number and "palpable area right axilla". The
specimen consists of a single fragment of fatty tissue measuring 2
x
1.5 x 1 cm. AS—l. Blocks F81 and F82. G. Container G is labeled
"sentinel node #2 right axilla". The specimen consists of
a

single lymph node measuring 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. ASF, GFF, bisected.

Prognostic markers were done by immunohistochemical stain on
paraffin sections from 10% neutral buffered formalin fixed tissue
using antibodies on a Benchmark automated
stainer.

The Her2/neu antibody is clone 4B5 and has been approved by the FDA
as an aid in the assessment of breast cancer patients for whom

 

 

Herceptin treatment is considered.

This laboratory meets the test validation and quality assurance
requirements of the ASCO/CAP guidelines for Her2 testing for
carcinoma of the breast (Arch Pathol Lab Med 2007;131:18—43).

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
[A few of the antibodies used in our laboratory may be classified

as
analyte specific reagents. These antibodies are monitored and
controlled in our laboratory and their performance for in vitro
diagnosis is well described in the medical literature. They have
not been cleared or approved by the FDA.]
