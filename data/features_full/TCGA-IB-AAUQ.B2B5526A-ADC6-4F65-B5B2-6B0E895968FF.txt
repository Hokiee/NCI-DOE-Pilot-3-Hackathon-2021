Gross Description
Received are specimen containers A to D. All requisitions and specimen containers are
labelled with the patient's name, The cassettes and identifiers are
labelled with the Surgical Number
A. The specimen consists of liver tissue, measuring 0.3 cm. Submitted in toto in one
cassette.
The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The container
is designated "A: Liver biopsy at . The previously frozen tissue is entirely
resubmitted for permanent sections in cassette AQSl. " .
B. The specimen consists of liver tissue, measuring 0.2 cm. Submitted in toto in one
cassette.
The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The container
is designated "E: Liver biopsy number 2 at . The previously frozen tissue is
entirely resubmitted for permanent sections in cassette 3031.
C; The specimen consists of liver tissue, measuring 0.8 cm. Submitted in toto in one
cassette.
The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The container
is designated "C: Liver biopsy number 3 at The previously frozen tissue is
entirely submitted for permanent sections in cassette 0031.
D. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The
container is designated “D: Body and tail of pancreas at ', and contains a 12.0 x 6.0
x 3.5 cm portion of pancreatic body and tail. The pancreatic body margin is inked blue,
the distal margin is inked orange, and the radial margin is inked black. The specimen is
bisected longitudinally and is fixed in formalin overnight. Sectioning reveals an ill-
defined, firm, yellow-tan, 4.5 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm mass with a few punctate hemorrhagic areas.
The mass is located in the anterior half of the specimen and grossly extends to the
anterior across, to within 1.0 cm of the blue-inked pancreatic body resection margin, and
very close (1-2 mm) to the posterior/retroperitoneal margin. The rim of pancreatic
,tissue proximal to the mass is soft and tan-colored with a normal lobular configuration.
The pancreatic tail tissue distal to the mass (3.5 x 1.0 cm) is attenuated, faintly
nodular, and atrophic-appearing. The pancreatic duct passes through the central
posterior aspect of the mass, and shows no obvious dilation, stricture, or intraductal
mass. Within the peripancreatic fat superior, inferior and posterior to the mass, there
are multiple well~circumscribed ovoid, firm, white nodules, consistent with lymph nodes,
many of which appear grossly suspicious for metastatic tumor. Representative sections
are submitted as follows:
