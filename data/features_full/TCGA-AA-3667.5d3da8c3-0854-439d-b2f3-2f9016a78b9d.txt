Diagnosis/ diagnoses:

Resected section of (sigmoid) colon with a colon carcinoma characterized histologically as
a moderately differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma, extending to within 8 cm of a
resection margin and encircling the intestinal wall over a length of 7 cm. Invasive tumor
spread to the muscularis propria. Oral and aboral resection margins are tumor-free.
Twenty-two mesocolic lymph nodes are tumor-free and have uncharacteristically reactive
lesions.

Stage of tumor is therefore: pT2 pNO (0/22) L0 V0; G2

Follow-up report:

As requested an examination was initiated in relation to the question over microsatellite
instability of the colon tumor.

According to the current consultation report (see appendix) there is no further evidence of
the presence of significant tumor disposition, particularly of the HNPCC/ Lynch syndrome

type.
