CLINICAL HISTORY:
Right breast mass with needle aspiration compatible with infiltrating ductal
carcinoma. Right breast carcinoma.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Right breast", in formalin. This is a 2700 gram, 36 x 21.5 x 63 cm
modified radical mastectomy specimen with an attached skin ellipse 31 x 22 cm.
The skin contains circumferential 8.3 x 2.2 cm area and a retracted 1.5 cm
nipple. There is no biopsy scar or other skin lesions. Upon sectioning most
of the breast tissue is fibrofatty yellow—white in appearance. In the upper
outer quadrant. There is a 3.0 x 2.8 x 3.0 cm firm, infiltrating pink—grey
mass. It is 2 cm deep from the skin, 5 cm from the nearest lateral margin and
5.0 cm from the nearest deep margin. Tissue has been submitted for ER/PR
studies. No other focal lesions are found. Attached is a 13.0 x 9.0 x 4.0
axillary tail containing multiple potential lymph node candidates. A suture
demarks level I from levels II and III.
