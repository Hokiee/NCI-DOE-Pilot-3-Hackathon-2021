Comments:

"has reviewed this case and concurs. A benign stromal nodule is identiﬁed within the myometrium (part
i: It stains positively for CD10 and smooth muscle actin, is well-circumscribed, and contains no cytologic atypia or

mitotic figures.

A. Frozen Section Interpretation: Benign. favor dermoid cyst
8. Frozen Section interpretation: Endometrial carcinoma; possible myometrial invasion. up to approximately 2mm
(less than one-half of myometrial thickness).

Gross Description

A. Received fresh labeled "right ovary and right fallopian tube” consists of right ovary and fallopian tube which was received
(@ opened, weighing 24 grams in aggregate. The ovary measures 6.0 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm. The ovary is cysticaliy dilated. The
. external surface is fan and smooth. Within the ovary is yellow tan mucoid. thick material. No distinct hair is identiﬁed. A bony
focus is palpated. Serial sectioning reveals smaller cystic structures within the cyst wall. A portion of the ovary is submitted
for frozen section. An attached fallopian tube measures approximately 5.0 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter. Sections are
submitted as follows: .

KEY TO CASSETTES:
A1 - Frozen section residual
A2-A4 - Representative sections

8. Received fresh labeled “uterus, left ovary and tube" consists of a previously opened uterus with attached left ovary and tube
weighing 188 grams. The serosal surface is tan and smooth with subserosai bulging noted. The left ovary measures 2.0 cm
in greatest dimension. A small piece has been removed. Cut section is unremarkable. The left fallopian tube measures 4.5
cm in length and approximately 0.3 cm in diameter. On the anterior surface of the endometrium is a shaggy, polypoid mass
measuring approximately 5.0 x 4.5 cm in area. it does not appear to extend to the lower uterine segment or endocervix.
There appears to be myometrial invasion grossly. extending to < '/2 of the myometriai thickness. The myometrial thickness is
1.8 cm. The tumor thickness measures up to 2.5 cm. The myometrium is serially sectioned to reveal several white tan well
circumscribed masses with a whorled cut surface measuring up to 3.0 cm in greatest dimension.
