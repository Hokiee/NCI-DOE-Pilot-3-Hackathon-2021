OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
Craniotomy/tumor (brain).

Operation/Specimen: A: Medial temporal, Brain, biopsyln formalin
B: Medial Temporal, Brain, biopsy

C: Hypocampus, Brain,,biopsy

D: Medial temporal, Brain, biopsy

E: Posterior, Brain, biopsy

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:

A, B, C, D, and E. Brain, medial temporal, hippocampus, and posterior
temporal lobe, excision: Glioblastoma, with extensive necrosis. MIB—l
proliferation index: 15%.

See comment.

COMMENT

All the specimens consist of brain tissue and a neoplastic proliferation of
astrocytes with mitotic figures, focal microvascular cellular proliferation,
thrombosis of microvessels thronghout, and extensive zones of necrosis. The
bulk of the specimens {approximately 90%) is necrotic, with only small
portions of viable, diagnostic tissue. In the hippocampus (part C) the
neoplasm is sparsely infiltrative, with microscopic foci of subependymal
spread. The MIB—l proliferation index is up to 15% in the more active areas.

 

PROCEDURES/ADDENDA

MGMT Promoter Methilation .

Interpretation
Block A2: POSITIVE — Methylated MGMT promoter is detected.

Block A3: NEGATIVE — No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates heavy glial fibrillogenesis by
the neoplastic cells. The K91 and MAC387 demonstrate few viable phagocytic
cells and large amounts of tissue debris, respectively. The CD34 depicts
extensive abnormal angiogenesis, with focal perivascular cellular
proliferation. With the MIB—l, a proliferation index of up to 15% is
determined in the more active areas.

The immune results support the diagnosis of a high histological grad
astrocytic neoplasm.
