Operative Procedure/Tissue Submitted: Open adrenalectomy-left.

 

PROCEDURE :. SPGD
VIIIIIlulu-Il-IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

1. ”Left adrenal mass and spleen.” Received in formalin in a large container
is a 480 gm adrenal mass (11.5 x 10.0 x 3.5 cm) with attached capsular adipose
tissue and spleen (160 gm; 11.8 x 7.5 x 2.0 cm). The mass is opened to reveal
a tan-yellow, partially necrotic tumor (necrosis) predominantly in the
inferior portion with a thickened capsule superiorly and numerous nodules that
appear to traverse the capsule into adjacent fat. Inking as follows: superior
blue, inferior green, posterior black, anterior yellow. medial red and lateral
orange. Eight possible lymph nodes are identified (the largest 1.3 cm) in the
periadrenal fat. The splenic vein is opened and appears to be free of tumor.
Sectioning of the mass reveals encroachment of the tumor onto periadrenal
adipose at multiple margins.

1A~H. Representative sections through capsule.

ll. Largest lymph node trisected

1J. Seven possible lymph nodes.

1K-0. Representative sections through capsule.

1R. Representative section through spleen at hilum.

2. ”Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.” Received in formalin in a small
tall container are three fragments of fibroadipose tissue (in aggregate 4.2 x
2.5 x 2.0 cm). Eleven possible lymph nodes identified (0.5 to 1.8 cm).

2A. Seven possible lymph nodes.

28. Largest possible lymph node bisected.

26. Next largest lymph node bisected.

ZD. Ore possible lymph node bisected.

2E. One possible lymph node bisected.

Fat retained.

3. ”Diaphragm.” Received in formalin in a small tall container are two,
tan~gray, soft tissue fragments. Submitted whole in 1 cassette.
