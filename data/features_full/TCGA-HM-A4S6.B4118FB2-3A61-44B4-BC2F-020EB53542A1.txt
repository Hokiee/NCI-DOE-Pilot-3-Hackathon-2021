Gross Description .

A. Received fresh labeled "uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries, right
parametrium" is a 249 g, 8.5 x 5.3 x 4.7 cm symmetrical uterine corpus
with attached, markedly expanded, 6.5 cm cervix and bilateral adnexa.
The serosa is smooth to scaberous tan—pink—red. A scant amount of soft
tan—pink-gold parametrial tissue is present along the right and left
lateral aspects. The cervix measures 5.5 cm from right to left and 5.3
cm from anterior to posterior. The anterior surface is inked blue and
the posterior surface is inked black. The annular 5.3 cm ectocervix
ranges from smooth tan-white to glistening white-pink in keeping with
tumor. A thin rim of wrinkled tan—white vaginal mucosa circumferences
the ectocervical margin. The specimen is opened along the lateral
aspects to show a circumferential soft tan—white cervical tumor. A
portion of the tumor and a portion of normal are submitted for tissue
procurement as requested. A frozen section is performed. On
sectioning, the tumor has a maximal thickness of 3 cm (invasive
thickness), however tumor replaces the entire 6.5 cm cervix. Carcinoma
extends to within less than 0.1 cm of the inked posterior surface. The
triangular 4.5 x 3.2 cm uterine cavity is lined by flat tan—pink—red
endometrium averaging 0.2 cm. The myometrium is smooth tan—pink and
measures up to 2.3 cm. A single, 0.8 cm tan—white intramural leiomyoma
is present anteriorly (see block 15). The rubbery tan—pink right and
left ovaries average 2.8 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm. The stroma of both ovaries is
pale tan with identifiable corpora albicantia. A few cystic structures
measuring up to 0.7 cm are present within the left ovary. The
centrally discontinuous tan-pink right and left fallopian tubes average
6.5 cm in length and range from 0.4—0.7 cm in diameter. RS 20

Summary: 1 — 12-3 o'clock cervical cuff, 2 — 3 - 6 o‘clock cervical
cuff, 3 - 6 — 9 o'clock cervical cuff, 4 — 9 — 12 cervical cuff, 5 and
6 — 12 o'clock cervix/Lus, 7 and 8 - 3 o'clock cervix/Lus, 9 and 10
o'clock — 6 o‘clock cervix/Lus, 11 and 12 — 9 o‘clock cervix/Lus, 13
and 14 ~ posterior cervix tumor to closest inked surface, 15 - anterior
endomyometrium, 16 — posterior endomyometrium, 17 — right adnexa, 18 —
left adnexa, 19 — right parametrium, 20 — left parametrium

B. Received fresh labeled "right lymph nodes, pelvic" is a 7.7 x 6.5 x
3.2 cm aggregate of soft tan gold adipose tissue. Several soft to
slightly rubbery tan—pink-gold tissues in keeping with lymph nodes
measuring up to 3.3 cm in greatest dimension are recovered. The
lymphoid tissues are entirely submitted in 9 blocks

Summary: 1 — 2 lymph nodes, 2 through 5 - l bisected lymph node per
cassette, 6 through 9 — largest lymph node

C. Received fresh labeled "right periaortic lymph node" is a 2.7 x 1.7
x 0.4 cm aggregate of soft, lobulated tan gold adipose tissue which
appears to contain 3 soft tan—pink tissues in keeping with lymph nodes
measuring up to 0.7 cm. The lymphoid tissues are submitted in toto in
one block.

D. Received fresh labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes" is a 5.9 x 5.5 x
2.2 cm aggregate of soft, lobulated tan gold adipose tissue. A single,
ovoid, 2.1 cm soft to slightly rubbery tan—pink-gold tissue in keeping
with lymph node is recovered. The lymphoid tissue is bisected and
entirely submitted in 2 blocks.

E. Received fresh labeled "left periaortic lymph node" is a 2.1 x 2.0 x
0.8 cm aggregate of soft tan gold adipose tissue. No definitive
lymphoid tissues are recovered. ASl
