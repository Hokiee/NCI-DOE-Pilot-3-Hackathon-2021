4%) I/ 263/1"!

B. Ureter, right, biopsy: No tumor.

COMMENT:

Bladder Tumor Synaptic Comment

1. Tumor type: Urothellal (transitional cell) carcinoma.

2. Tumor grade: High grade.

3. Tumor size: Gross appearance at least 1.9 cm in greatest diameter.

4. Extent of tumor in bladder: Invasion through muscularis proprla into perlvesical tissue.
5. Lymphatic/vascular invasion: None definitively identified.

6. Epithelial abnormalities in bladder: Focal areas of carcinoma in situ.

 

 

 

 

 

xtension attired int? organs adjacent to bladder: No adjacent organs involved.
8. Surgical margins:
Urethral margin: Free of tumor.
Right ureter margin: Free of tumor.
Left ureter margin: Free of tumor.
Perivesical margin: Invasive tumor <0.5 mm to inked specimen margin.
9. Lymph nodes: 1 of 4 lymph nodes contain metastatic tumor; the largest metastatic deposit
measures 1.2 cm in greatest dimension; there is no extranodal tumor growth.
10. Other pathologic ﬁndings in bladder: None.
11. AJCC/UICC stage: pTBaNIMx / Stage IV.
12. Additional Comments: There is a single focus of atypical prostatic glands in the section taken as
distal urethral margin on the frozen section slide F53 but this focus is no long present on the permanent
sections. A select slide (slide F53) was shown at the departmental , and the
faculty in attendance concurred with the above diagnosis. No deﬁnitive prostatic or urothelial carcinoma
is present in prostate or seminal vesicles.

In Part A and B, the tissue is best demonstrated on the original frozen section slides and no dysplasia or
carcinoma is identiﬁed.

Clinical History

The patient is a -year-olcl man who undergoes a transurethrai resection of bladder tumor at another
Institution. At cystoscopy, the sessile tumor was greater than 5 cm and invading into the perivesicular
fat.

Gross Description
The specimen is received fresh in eight parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record
number.

Part A is additionally labeled "left ureter frozen section." It consists of a single round piece of soft,
pinksred tissue, measuring 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section
diagnosis as F51, with the frozen section remnant submitted in cassette A1.

Part B is additionally labeled ”right ureter frozen section." It consists of a single irregular piece of soft,
pink-red tissue, measuring 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section
diagnosis as F52, with the frozen section remnant submitted in cassette Bl.

Part C is additionally labeled "bladder and prostate and seminal vesicles." It consists of a bladder and
attached prostate weighing 277.5 grams and measuring 16 x 13 x 4.5 cm. The external surface has

been Inked in the following manner for further histologic analysis: The left has been inked blue, the
right has been inked green, and the posterior has been Inked black. The distal urethral margin has
previously been cut off for frozen section diagnosis C1. The bladder is opened revealing grossly
friable-appearing internal mucosa with one prominent mass near the trigone. The mass is white-tan
and measures 1.9 cm in greatest diameter. The mass appears well-circumscribed and partially
pedunculated. The remaining internal surface of the bladder has the friable, tan-pink appearance. The
prostate is removed and bisected into the left and right halves and subsequently serially sectioned from
the apex to the base revealing homogeneously yellow-tan interior. No obvious lesions or areas of
fibrosis are noted. Sections are submitted as follows:

Cassette C1: The remnant from the frozen section from the distal urethral margin.
Cassette C2: Perpendicular margins from the left apex of the prostate.
Cassette C3: Perpendicular margins from the right apex of the prostate.
Cassette C4: The posterior mid line apex to base of the prostate.

Cassette C5: Section from the left half of the prostate from the apex.

Cassette C6: Section from the left half of the prostate closer towards the base.
Cassette C75 Section from the left seminal vesicle.

Cassette C8: Section from the right prostate at the apex.

Cassette C9: Sections from the right prostate closer towards the base.
Cassette C10: Sections through the right seminal vesicle.

Cassette C11: Section through the posterior right wall of the bladder.

Cassette C12: Two sections through the anterior right bladder wall.

Cassettes C13-C14: Additional sections through the mass at the trigone, as well as the adjacent,
grossly unaffected trigone.

Cassette C15: Distal margin of right ureter and right vas, as well as multiple lymph node
candidates from the right perlvesicular area.

Cassette C16: Two sections from the left posterior wall of the bladder, grossly uninvolved.

Cassette C17: Two sections from the left anterior bladder wall, grossly uninvolved.

Cassette C18: Two sections through the left anterior trigone, including cross-sections through the
prominent mass.

Cassette C19: Additional sections through left anterior bladder wall.

Cassette C20: Sections through the vas and ureter from the left side.

Part D is additionally labeled "apical margin (perm)." It consists of one unoriented piece of soft tissue
measuring 1.7 x 1 x 0.4 cm. It is pink-tan with no obvious lumen. The specimen is bisected, revealing
a white-tan interior and homogeneous. Both halves are submitted in cassette D1.

Part E is additionally labeled “right pelvic, lymph node," consists of multiple soft, yellow-tan, attached
fatty tissue measuring 4 x 3.5 x 2 cm in aggregate. Three lymph node candidates are identified. The
two largest are inked black and serially sectioned. Cassettes are submitted as follows:

Cassette El: Smaller lymph node candidate, submitted in entirety and one of the serially
sectioned larger lymph node candidates.
Cassette E2: Other large lymph node candidate, serially sectioned.

Part F, additionally labeled "left pelvic lymph node," consists of one unoriented piece of soft, fatty
tissue, yellow-tan, measuring 6 x 2.5 x 1 cm. Two lymph node candidates are identified and submitted
in entirety in cassette F1.

Part G, additionally labeled "final left ureter,” consists of one fragment of ureter measuring 0.7 cm in
length and 0.2 cm in average diameter. There is a stitch at one end, as well as some attached fatty
tissue. The specimen is bisected along its long axis revealing a grossly unremarkable internal lumen.
The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette 61.

Part H, additionally labeled "final right ureter," consists of a segment of ureter measuring 1.5 cm in
length and 0.2 cm in average diameter, as well as attached fatty tissue. There is a suture and metal
clip on one end. The specimen is bisected and along its long axis to reveal an unremarkable internal
lumen. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette H1.
