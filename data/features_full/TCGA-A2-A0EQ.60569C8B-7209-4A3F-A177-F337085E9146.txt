SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
Patient: " 3 Specimen #:

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY:
‘ —year—old female with IDC.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, .

designated "LEFT BREAST LUMPECTOMY" consists of a fibroratty tissue
fragment, oriented with sutures (long is lateral, short is superior),
measuring 8.2 cm medial to lateral, 7.2 cm superior to inferior, and 2.7
cm anterior to posterior. Ink code: Red=medial and lateral, blue=superior,
greenzinferior, yellow=anterior, black=posterior. Sectioning from medial
to lateral reveals a well-defined, irregular, tan tumor in the
anterior/inferior portion of the specimen, measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm in
greatest dimension. The tumor is within 2.0 mm of the anterior margin. The
remaining tissue is mostly fatty with patches of dense, fibrous tissue,
especially lateral to the tumor. One section of the tumor, and one section
of the grossly normal fibrous tissue (2.0 cm lateral to tumor) submitted
for the CBCP protocol with matching paraffin section in cassettes A1—A3,
respectively. The specimen is submitted from medial to lateral,
concentrating on the fibrous areas.

Cassette summary:

A6—A7: One paired slice.

Alo-All: One paired slice, from which blocks A1 and A2 were taken.
A12-A13: Paired slices.

A14-A15: Paired slices.

A18-A19: One paired slice together.

A23: Lateral most portion of specimen.

B. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient’s name, --

B, designated "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1" consists of a single lymph node
measuring 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. The lymph node is bisected and half is
submitted for the CBCP protocol. The remainder is submitted for permanent
section. . ,.

C. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name,_

B, designated "NON—SENTINEL LYMPH NODE" consists of a fragment of
yellow/tan fibroadipose tissue, 2.5 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm. One potential lymph
node candidate is identified, measuring 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The
specimen is entirely submitted. .;

D. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient’s name, ,

B, designated "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2" consists of a fragment or pink/tan
to yellow fibroadipose tissue, 2.6 x 1.6 x 0.9 cm. The specimen is
bisected revealing mottled, pink/tan to red cut surfaces. The specimen is

E. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient’s name, _

B, designated “ADDITIONAL LEFT BREAST INFERIOR MARGIN" consists of a
fragment of fibroadipose tissue, 2.1 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm. The specimen is not
oriented and is inked blue and serially sectioned. The cut surfaces reveal
yellow/tan adipose tissue admixed with bands of white, fibrous tissue.

There is a focus of pink/white, firmer tissue measuring 0.5 cm in greatest
dimension. The specimen is entirely submitted. '
