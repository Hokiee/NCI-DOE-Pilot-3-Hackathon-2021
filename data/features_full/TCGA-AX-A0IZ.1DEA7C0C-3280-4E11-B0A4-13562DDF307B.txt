Gross Description

A. The specimen is a 120 g. 9.5 x 6.0 x 3.5 cm hysterectomy
received with attached adnexa. The seroea is tan—brown, smooth,
and unremarkable. The ectocervical mucosa is 4.0 x 3.2 cm, with
erythema overlying the 12 to 6 o’clock position. The on is 0.9
cm, patent and leads into a 2.2 cm long x 0.9 cm wide tan-white,
trabeculated endocervical canal. The endometrial cavity is
notable for a 4 x 2 cm tan—white flattened lesion on the anterior
wall that approaches the anterior lower uterine segment, and is
2.5 cm from the external 05. Further sectioning reveals that the
lesion is 0.5 cm thick and 1.5 cm from the overlying serosa. The
myometrium is 2 cm thick, tan—white with prominent tubular

structures.

The left adnexa are 10.29 and consists of a 2 x 1 x 1 cm ovary, a
3.5 cm in length x up to 0.6 cm in diameter timbriated fallopian
tube, and attached meso‘salpinx. The ovary is sectioned to
reveal no abnormalities. The fallopian tube is notable for a

previous tubal ligation and is otherwise unremarkable.

The right adnexa are 14.79 and consists of a 2.6 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm
ovary, a 4.5 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter Eimbriated
fallopian tube, and attached meso—salpinx. The ovary is
sectioned to reveal a simple 0.8—cm serous fluid-filled cortical
cyst. The fallopian tube is notable for a previous tubal
ligation and two serous fluid—filled paratubal cysts that are up

to 1.2 cm.
