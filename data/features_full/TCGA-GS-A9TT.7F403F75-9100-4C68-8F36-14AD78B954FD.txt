Orchiectomy specimen of 832,1 grams that measures 10 x 9 x 6 cm.
Epididymis and spermatic cord segment are identified. At gross sections a
well defined solid tumour of 7 x 6,5 x 3,5 cm is identified, with hemorrhagic
and whitish areas, that represents 90% of the testicular volume.

TESTE (ORCHIECTOMY):
- DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LINFOMA WITH A HIGH PROLIFERATIVE INDEX

Histological examination shows a testicular parenchyma infiltrated by an
atypical lymphoid proliferation, showing extense areas of necrosis. The
tumor is constituted by layers of large atypical immunoblastic cells which
replace the practical totality of the testicle.

The tumor is intensely positive for CD20, CD79a, BCLZ, MUM1, with
heterogeneous expression of BCL6 and is negative for CD10, CD3 and CD5.
The neoplastic cells show Kappa light chain restriction. There is a very

scarce intratumoral T-cell reactive lymphoid infiltration CD3 and CD5positive.

The Ki67proliferation index is 100%.
