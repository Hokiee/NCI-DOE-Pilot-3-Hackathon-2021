1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section labeled, "Sentinel node
left axilla", and consists of four lymph nodes measuring 1.2 to 1.8 cm in
greatest dimension. All lymph nodes are bisected and entirely submitted.

Sumsry of sections:
FscA, fscB, fscc, fscD -- lymph node frozen section control

2.) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Left breast lumpectomy" and
consists of an unoriented, previous incised, 3.7 x 2.2 x 1.9 cm, piece of
fibrofatty breast tissue. The specimen is entirely inked black. Serial
sectioning reveals a previously biopsied, 1.9 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm, fim, smooth
nodular bordered, pink-white mess, located 0.2 cm with inked resection
margin. The mass is partially surrounded by a 2.5 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm area of
mildly dense, focally nodular, pink-white fibrous tissue. The remaining
breast parenchyma consists of lobules of yellow adipose. A portion of tumor
has previously been submitted to TPS. The remaining specimen is
representatively submitted.

Summary of sections:
MT - tumor and closest tissue edge

FF'r -- full face of tumor
T - tumor
RS -- present in sections of remaining fibrous tissue

3). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "superior margin left breast"
and consists of a piece of fibrofatty breast tissue measuring 2.6 x 2.6 cm,
and 0.6 cm thick. A stitch marks the new margin of excision, which is inked
black. The tissue is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.

4). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "medial margin left breast" and
consists of a piece of fibrofatty breast tissue measuring 3 x 1.8 cm, and
0.9 cm thick. A stitch marks the new margin of excision, which is inked
black. The tissue is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:

5). The specimen is received fresh, labeled “inferior margin left breast"
and consists of a piece of fibrofatty breast tissue measuring 2.5 x 2.2 cm,
and 0.8 cm thick. A stitch marks the new margin of excision, which is inked
black. The tissue is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
SS - sequential sections

6). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "lateral margin left breast" and
consists of a piece of fibrofatty breast tissue measuring 3.5 x 3.2 cm, and
1 cm thick. A stitch marks the new margin of excision, which is inked
black. The tissue is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
SS - sequential sections

7). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "posterior pectoral fascia
margin left breast freshI and consists of a piece of fibrofatty breast
tissue measuring 2.6 x 1.6 cm, and 0.7 cm thick. A stitch marks the new

(0% of invasive tumor cells exhibit complete membranous staining;
uniformity of staining: absent;

Homogeneous, dark circumferential pattern: absent)

Comment: Controls are satisfactory. PATHWAY anti-HER-2/neu is an
FDA-approved rabbit monoclonal primary antibody (clone 435) directed against
the internal domain of the c-erbB-2 oncoprotein (HERZ) for
immunohistochemical detection of HER: protein overexpression in breast
cancer tissue routinely processed for histologic evaluation. The HRRZ test
results are reported in accordance with the ASCO/CAP guideline
recommendations for HER2 testing in breast cancer (J Clin Oncol 2007;
25(1):118—145). The ER and PR rabbit monoclonal antibodies are also FDA
approved.
