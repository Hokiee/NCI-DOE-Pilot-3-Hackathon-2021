1).Tne Specimen is received fresh for frozen section consuttation, iabeted "right renal tumor, stitch-deep surgical margin“. it
consists of a 254 g. 16 x 14 x 5 cm wedge shaped portion of kidney and perinephrio adipose tissue with a suture marking the deep
margin. ”the kidney itseif measures 6 X 5.5 x 4.7 cm. The margin is inked green and perinephric adipose tissue overlying the

cut surface with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. The clearance from the resection margin is 0.1 cm. The tumor is distending
but does not appear to invade through the capsule into the adipose tissue. Representative sections of the nearest margin is
subrttttled for frozen section diagnosis. Representetiveiy submitted. Portions of the tumor are submitted for TPS.
