SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

  

Clinical Diagnosis 5 History:
History of abdominal mass. Biopsy spindle cell neoplasm with myxoid
features.

Specimens Submitted:

1: Right retroperitoneal liposarcomn, right kidney. right colon
2: Additional retroperitoneal nodule

3: Retroperitoneal muscle and fat

4: Retroperitoneel lymph node

DIAGNOSIS:
1. Right retroperitonsal liposarcoma. right kidney, right colon, excision:

- Deditferentiated liposarcoma.

- Groasly the tumor was present as two mnssee measuring 22 x 22 x 11.5
cm and 5.2 x 4.1 x 4 cm, respectively.

- The dedizferentieted component predominates (>50%) and is composed of
high grade undifferentiated morphology with large areas of necrosis in the
smaller nodule and mostly low grade myxotibroserooma-like morphology in the
larger mass.

- Areas 0! well-differentiated liposarcoma are also present.

- Tumor does not involve kidney parenchyma, small bowel and right colon.

— Grossly the tumor mass was surrounded by an intact serosal surface,
which represents the surgical margin.

2. Additional retroperitoneal nodule, excision:
- Reactive lymph node with obstructive-type lymphangiectaeie
- No evidence 0! malignancy

3. Retroperitoneal muscle and fat, excision:
- Fragments of skeletal muscle and fibroadipose tissue
- No evidence of malignancy

4. Retroperitoneal lymph node. excision:
- six reactive lymph nodes with sinus histiocytosis.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF

THE SLIDIB (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL). AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

Gross Description:

1) The specimen is received fresh, labeled right retroperitoneal
liposarcoma, right kidney, and right colon. The entire specimen measures
41.5 x 27.2 x 11 .0 cm. It consists of two masses; a large mass measuring 22
x 22 x 11.5 cm and another smaller mass measuring 5.2 x 4.1 x 4 cm. Also
identified are right kidney, measuring 11.4 x 6.2 x 2.1 cm; and right colon
measuring 21 cm in length. The average circumference of the colon is 3.7 cm
and the wall thickness ranges from 0.2 to 0.3 cm. Appendix is identified and
measures 4.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. A nodule measuring 1.5x1 xlcm is identified
adherent to the wall of colon. The cut section is tan white and homogenous.
The right kidney is adherent to the large mass while the right colon is
located 5.6 cm from the capsule of the large mass. The stump of the renal
vein measures 1.3 cm and that of renal artery measures 0.7 cm. The ureter
measures 17 on in length. The ureter appears to be embedded within the large
mass. The bowel is opened out along the antimesenteric border to reveal a
thinned out bowel mucosa. No other gross abnormalities are identified. The
cut section of appendix shows obliterated lumen due to fibrosis. The kidney
on out section shows grossly unremarkable renal parenchyme: which is clearly
demarcated from the large mass. The large mass is serially sectioned to
reveal a tan-yellow homogenous circumscribed cut surface. Only rare foci of
hemorrhage and necrosis (less than 5%) are identified. The smaller mass is a
serially sectioned to reveal a variegated cut surface with areas of
hemorrhage and necrosis.

Summary of sections:

P - Proximal margin colon

D - Distal margin colon

APx - appendix

RVA - renal vein and artery margin
SM

- smaller mass
KU - Ureter margin
LN - Large mass
NR - Normal kidney
EN - Bowel nodule

PBF - Peri—bowel fat

2) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled l'additional
retroperitoneal nodule'. and consists of a 4.5 x 2.2 x 1.1 on gray purple
nodular portion of rubbery soft smooth tissue. Sectioning reveals gray to
white-tan to gray purple sott out surfaces. The specimen is entirely
submitted.

3) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled 'retroperitoneal muscle
and fat", and consists of a 5.4 x 3.2 x 1.4 cm aggregate of three portions
of gray purple rubbery skeletal muscle and membranous rubbery tissue
partially surfaced by mucosa, and with attached yellow-tan adipose tissue.
Representative sections are submitted.

Summary of sections:
U — undeaignated

4) The specimen is in formalin, labeled 'retroperitoneal lymph node', and
consists of a 4.7 x 2.1 x 1.3 cm irregular portion of grey purple rubbery
tissue. Four gray-tan rubbery lymph nodes identified ranging from 0.7 up to
3.2 cm in greatest dimension. All identifiable lymph nodes are submitted.

Summary of sections:

LN - intact lymph nodes (2)
BLN - bisected lymph node (1)
