DIAGNOSIS:

A. Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and

bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy: Endometrial
adenocarcinoma,

endometrioid type, FIGO grade_l~(of 3) is identified
formi g mass Mm'hlumy

(3.5 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm) in the uterine fundus (both posterior
and

anterior). The tumor invades 0.6 cm into the myometrium
(total

myometrial thickness, 2.0 cm). The tumor does not involve
the

endocervix. Lymphovascular invasion is not identified.
The

background endometrium shows complex hyperplasia with
atypia. The

vaginal cuff margin is negative for tumor [AJCC pleNXMX].
The

bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes show no diagnostic
abnormalities.

B. C. Lymph nodes, right and left pelvic, excision:
Multiple left

pelvic lymph nodes (11 right and 7 left) are negative for
tumor.

This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic

examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of
the

specimen(s).
