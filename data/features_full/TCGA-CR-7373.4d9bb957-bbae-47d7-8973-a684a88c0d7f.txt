INFLAMED ATTACHED SOFT TISSUE; NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis in a container labeled
"posterior mandible" are two fragments of soft tissue that in aggregate
measure 0.2 X 0.2 X 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen
section diagnosis. It is then placed in a teabag and submitted for frozen
section control in cassette 2AFSC.

Summary of sections: 2AFSC, 2/1.

3) SOURCE: Posterior Buccal Margin

Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis in a container labeled
"posterior buccal margin" are two fragments of soft tissue that in
aggregate measure 5.0 X 0.3 X 0.3 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted
for frozen section diagnosis and frozen section control and is submitted in
cassette 3AFSC.

Summary of sections: 3AFSC, 2/1.

4) SOURCE: Anterior Buccal Margin

Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis in a container labeled
"anterior buccal margin" is one fragment of mucosal soft tissue that
measures 6.0 X 0.4 X 0.3 cm. Specimen is entirely submitted for frozen
section diagnosis and the frozen section control is submitted in cassette
4AFSC.

Summary of sections: 4AFSC, 2/1.

5) SOURCE: New Posterior Buccal Margin

Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis is a 3.7 X 0.6 X 0.3 cm mucosal
portion of tan-pink soft tissue that is submitted entirely for frozen

section diagnosis. The frozen section control is submitted in cassette
5AFSC.

Summary of sections: 1/1.

6) SOURCE: Neck Dissection, Left, Levels 2 and 3

Received fresh in a container labeled "left neck level 2 and 3" is one
fragment of fibrofatty tissue that measures 16.0 X 4.5 X 1.0 cm. Specimen

is palpated to reveal multiple possible lymph nodes. Four very tiny
possible lymph nodes are submitted entirely in cassette 6A. One possible
lymph node is bisected and submitted in cassette 6B. One possible lymph
node is bisected and submitted in cassette 6C. One possible lymph node is
bisected and submitted in cassette 6D. One possible lymph node is bisected
and submitted in cassette 6E, and one possible lymph node is bisected and
submitted in cassette 6F.

Summary of sections: 6A, 5/1; 6B-6F, 2/1, each.

7) SOURCE: Neck Dissection, Level 1A

Received fresh in a container labeled "neck dissection level 1" is one
fragment of fibrofatty tissue that measures 8.0 X 4.0 X 0.5 cm. The
specimen is searched for lymph nodes, and three very tiny lymph nodes are
palpated and submitted entirely in cassette 7A. The remainder of the

10) SOURCE: Mouth, Left Mandibular Gingival Cancer

Received fresh in a container labeled "left mandibular gingival cancer,
stitch anterior" is a specimen that consists of a left lower jaw with

attached soft tissue. The specimen is oriented by the surgeon with a stitch
denoting anterior. The specimen is inked as follows: anterior yellow,
posterior green, medial blue, lateral black and inferior orange. The
specimen measures 8.0 cm from anterior to posterior, 7.0 cm from superior
to inferior, and 3.5 cm from medial to lateral. There is a portion of
mandible that can be seen anteriorly and posteriorly. There are also 5
attached teeth; three molars and two incisors. Lateral to the last molar on
the gingival surface there is a raised, firm mass that measures 2.0 cm X

1.5 cm. A gross photograph of the specimen is taken. Representative
sections of soft tissue associated with the anterior portion of the

specimen are submitted in cassette 10A. Representative sections of lateral
soft tissue to tumor are submitted in cassette 10B-10D. The tumor appears
to be 0.7 cm away from the lateral soft tissue margin. A representative
section of the posterior soft tissue margin to tumor is submitted in

cassette 10E. A representative section of medial soft tissue margin to
tumor is submitted in cassette 10F. The inferior portion of the tumor
eXhibits a salivary gland that measures 2.7 cm in greatest eXtent and
appears uninvolved by tumor. A representative section is submitted in
cassette 10G. The inferior muscular soft tissue appears completely
uninvolved by tumor. A representative section is submitted in 10H. Another
representative section of lateral margin to tumor is submitted in cassette
101. Another representative section of tumor is submitted in cassette 10J.
A representative section of posterior mandibular margin is submitted in
cassette 10K. Representative sections of the anterior mandibular margin are
submitted in cassettes 10L and 10M. The bone grossly appears to be involved
by tumor. Representative sections of this are submitted in cassettes 10N
and 100. Sections 10K-1OO are submitted following decalcification.
Summary of sections: 10A, 2/ 1; 10B-10N, 1/ 1, each; 100, 2/ 1.
