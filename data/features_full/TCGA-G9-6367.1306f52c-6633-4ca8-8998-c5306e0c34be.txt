GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. PROSTATE
Received fresh is a 379 resected prostate measuring 4.5cm from right to ieft, 4.2cm from anterior to
posterior, and 3cm from apex to base, with attached right and left seminai vesicles and vas deferens.
The specimen is inked as fotlows: Anterior-Orange, Posterior—Stack. Apex-Red, Base-Btue, Right-
Green, and Left-Yellow. After removal of the apex and base, the remaining prostate weight is 22. The
specimen is serially sectioned from apex to base to reveai ﬁrm tan ﬁbrous parenchyma. No obvious
lesions or nodules are grossly identiﬁed. The attached right and left seminal vesicles are 4 x 1.5 x
0.8crn and 3.5 x 2.5 x icm, respectively. are sectioned to beige tan cystic tissue with no gross evidence
of tumor involvement. The attached right and left segments of vas deferens are 1 x 0.65ch and 1.2 x
0.6m, respectively, are sectioned to reveal ﬁrm tan tubular structure with no gross evidence of tumor
involvement, A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement (Level ll). The remainder is
submitted as follows:
A1: right apex

B. RIGHT PELViC LYMPH NODES
Received in formaiin are multiple tan pink soft tissue fragments aggregating to 5 x 3 x 1cm. Dissection
reveals 1 lymph node 1 x 1 x 1cm.
B1: 1 lymph node
82-83: remainder of specimen
C. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES
Received in formalin are three tan pink lymph nodes ranging from 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3cm to 2 x 2 x 1.5cm.
Ci: 2 lymph nodes
OZ: 1 iymph node

DIAGNOSIS:
A. PROSTATE, PROSTATECTOMY:
— PROSTATIC ADENOCARCENOMA. GLEASON SCORE 4 + 5 = 9,
WiTH TERTIARY GLEASON GRADE 3.
- TUMOR INVOLVES BILATERAL LOBES AND ~ 25% OF THE PROSTATE.
- EXTRAPROSTATiC EXTENSION IS PRESENT.
- TUMOR IS PRESENT AT INKED MARGINS.

 

 

— BELATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES, NO TUMOR SEEN.

NOTE: Tumor with cautery artifact is present at the inked margin in slides A6 {left posterior) and A19
(ieft base (biadder neck». each involving less than one millimeter of the inked margin. Cytokeratin
AE1/3 stains highiight the tumor near but not at the inked margins in slides A12 and A14.

B. LYMPH NODES, RlGHT PELVIC, EXCISION:
— THREE LYMPH NODES, NO TUMOR SEEN (0/3).

C. LYMPH NODES, LEFT PELVIC, EXCISION:
- TWO LYMPH NODES, NO TUMOR SEEN (0/2).
