GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. EXCISION LEFT BREAST

(Single-Anterior, Double-Lateral, Triple-Superior) left lumpectomy with 5 x 2 cm tan pink unremarkable skin ellipse.
Ink Code: Anterior-Yellow. Posterior-Black, Medial-Green, Lateral-Red, Superior—Blue, Inferior-Orange. The
specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 8 slices to reveal a 3 x 3 x 2.30m gray white ﬁrm ill deﬁned
mass. 0.5cm from the closest anterior-superior margins in slices 3-6. A portion of the specimen is submitted for
tissue procurement. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Received in formalin is a piece of yellow-tan adipose tissue, 9.5 x 0.5 x 2.7 cm. Multiple lymph nodes are identified
ranging in size from 0.1 to 2.7 cm. The larger lymph nodes are bisected and have variegated pink-tan coloration.
There is a blood vessel, 0.9 cm and the length and 0.4 cm in diameter. which is clipped at both ends. It contains
blood clot. Specimen is submitted entirely:

METHODOLOGY:
Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no innnar than 74 lhours. Her2 analysis
was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit using rabbit anti-

human HER2. This assay was not modiﬁed. External kit-slides provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high,
low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in~house known HER2 ampliﬁed control tissue were evaluated along
with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identiﬁed for HER2 evaluation.
Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,
information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.

This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from A800 and CAP
and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology Department takes full responsibility
for this test's performance.
