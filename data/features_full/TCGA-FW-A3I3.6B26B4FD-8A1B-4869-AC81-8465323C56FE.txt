Ross DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in four containers labeled with the pallent's name

A. ContainerA is additionally labeled 'iotal pelvic exenteration' and contains a total pelvic exenteration specimen having overall dimensions of 26.0 x
13.5 x 12.5 cm. This composite specimen is comprised of perineal skin (13.0 x 6.5 cm). vagina (10.0 cm in length x 3.5 cm in diameter). urethra (7.5 cm
in length x 0.5 cm in diameter). bladder (5.5 x 6.0 x 4.0 cm). right ureter (7.5 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter), left ureter (6.5 cm in length x 0.5 cm in
diameter). uterine cervix (5.0 an in length x 4.5 x 4.5 cm in diameter). uterine corpus (3.5 cm in length x 5.5 x 4.0 cm). right l‘lmbrlated fallopian tube (8.3
cm in length and ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 cm in diameter), right ovary (3.5 x 2.0 x 1.7 cm). left fallopian tube (3.5 cm in length and ranging from 0.5 to 0.7
an in diameter). lelt ovary (4.0 x 2.8 x 1.8 cm), redoslgmoid colon (19.0 cm in length and ranging from 3.5 up to 4.5 cm in diameter). and abundant
yellow-tan ﬁbroadlpose tissue partially surfaced by purplegray glistening ﬁbromembranous soft tissue at the bladder dome. The peritoneal skin features
clitoris. vaginal and anal oriﬁces. No skin lesions are identiﬁed. Within the vagina and involving the vaginal mucosa are multiple pink—tan polypoid
lesions. One bears a suture. The sutured lesion is 1.1 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm and the remaining lesion is 6.0 x 4.0 x 1.5 cm. These lesions approach to within 3.5
cm of the closest perineai skin edge. and 2.5 cm of the cervix. 0n section. the sutured lesion approaches to within 4.0 cm of the clitoris and does not
involve it. The sutured lesion is present at the ureteral oriﬁce and focally extends to involve the urethral mucosa. The remainder ofthe urethra is lined by
pink—tan, glistening and focally erythematous mucosa with no additional lesions. Sections through these lesions reveal a 2.0 x 1.7 x 1 .3 cm well-
circumscribed nodule bearing a pink—tan hemorrhagic, centrally necrotic cut surface that resides 0.7‘ cm below the anterior vaginal mucosa and
approaches to within less than 0.1 cm of the deep inked soft tissue margin. Additionally, this nodule approaches to within 0.7 cm of the bladder wall.

The ectocervical mucosa is pink-tan and glistening and features a central 1.0 cm potent as. The endooervical canal is yellow-tan. ﬁbrous and lndurated.
The left alien; is adherent to the left lateral wall of the cervix. it is dense and ﬁbrotic: however. no discrete masses are identiﬁed. The endometrium is
pink—tan and glistening with an average thickness of 0.3 cm. The surrounding myometn’um is pinkvtan and ﬁbrous with an average thickness of 2.1 cm.
Within the myometrium are two wall-circumscribed nodules. 0.4 and 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. These nodules feature gray-white whorled cut
surfaces with no evidence of hemon‘l’iage or necrosis.

The right ovary is pink-tan and lobuiated and is sectioned to reveal a pink—tan ﬁbrous cut surface with gray—white corpus albicans and a 1.5 cm
unileculated subcortical cyst. The cyst features a smooth inner lining and contains clear. watery ﬂuid. The aforementioned left ovary is pink-tan and
lobulated. Sections through the ovary reveal a cystic and solid cut surface. The cysts contain yellowdan serous ﬂuid and'feature gray-white papillary
excrescences up to 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. The solid areas are comprised of pink-tan ﬁbrous stroma.

The anterior bladder wall features a 2.0 x 1.5 cm defect featuring smooth. regular borders consistent with cut surface. The edge of the defect is inked
blue. The bladder mucosa is pink-tan and glistening with the normal folds. No discrete masses are identiﬁed.

The recto-sigmoid colon is opened to reveal a wall averaging 1 .0 cm in thickness. The mucosa ls pink‘tan and glistening with the normal folds. Multiple
divenlcull are identified. but no masses or perforations are seen.

On section and palpation. six ﬁn'n fatty possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed within the associated an” “em-As These range from 0.2 up to 0.5 cm in
greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes A1 through 36 labeled signated as follows: 1 - right ureter
