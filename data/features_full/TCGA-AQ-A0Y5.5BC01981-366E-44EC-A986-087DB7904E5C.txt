Frozen Section Pathologist:

Clinical History:

invasive ductal Ca, right breast, Grade 2.

Gross Description:

Received are six appropriately labeled containers.

Container A: Received fresh for frozen section is a 3 x 3 x 2 cm aggregate of multiple tan lymph
node candidates and adipose tissue. Two larger lymph nodes were isolated, sectioned and frozen
as FSA1 and FSA2.

Further examination of the adipose tissue ﬁnds four additional lymph node candidates from 5 x 5
x 3 mm to 7 x 4 x 4 mm. All lymph node candidates are submitted as is in block A1. Fibrofatty
tissue is retained in formalin.

Container B: Received fresh for frozen section is a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm fragment of yellow fibrofatty
tissue within which one lymph node candidate was identified at the time of frozen section. The
lymph node was serially sectioned and was frozen as FSB1. Fibrofatty tissue is retained in
formalin.

Container C: Received fresh for frozen section is a 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm fragment of pink/yellow -
fibrofatty lymphoid tissue. The fragment was frozen as FSC1, NTR.

Container D: Received fresh for frozen section is a 1 x 1 x 0.5 cm fragment of yellow lobulated
fibrofatty lymphoid tissue. The fragment was serially sectioned, was frozen as FSD1, NTR.
Container E:

Specimen fixation: formalin

Time in fixative: approximately 8 hours, 45 mins

Type of mastectomy: unspecified

Size of specimen: 880 grams; 22 cm medial to lateral x 25.5 cm superior to inferior x 4 cm
anterior to posterior

Orientation of specimen: Per the specimen requisition, a short stitch indicates superior and a long
stitch indicates lateral.

At the time of Tissue Procurement triage, the specimen is inked as follows: anterior=blue,
posterior=black, and lateral=yellow.

Skin ellipse dimensions: 18.0 x 13.5 cm; The lightly pigmented skin ellipse is remarkable for some
blue sentinel dye discoloration lateral and slightly inferior to the nipple.

 

Nipple/areola: Nipple: 1.0 cm
Areola: 2.7 cm
The structures are unremarkable.

Axillary tail: There is no well delineated axillary tail. The lateral most breast tissue is sectioned,
however, no lymph node candidates are identified.

Biopsy site: absent

Residual tumor: present, A 2.4 x 2.0 x 1.9 cm firm white mass with a somewhat gritty cut surface
and stellate borders is identiﬁed. This mass has no hemorrhagic areas or necrotic areas readily
identified.

Location of tumor: roughly located in the midline between the upper outer quadrant and the lower
outer quadrant

Distance of mass/biopsy site from surgical margin: The mass is focally 6 mm to the black inked
posterior margin, 1.5 cm to the skin (anterior margin), 9 cm to the inferior margin, 11 cm to the
superior margin, at least 4.5 cm to the lateral margin and distant (at least 14 cm) to the medial
margin.

Gross involvement of skin or fascia/muscle by tumor: absent

Description of remainder of breast: The remainder of the mastectomy specimen consists of yellow
lobulated fibroadipose tissue separated by thin ﬁbrous septae. Much of the breast consists of
dense white fibrous breast tissue. The breast tissue medial to the mass is intensely stained with a
blue dye. There are some areas within this firm breast tissue which are firmer than others.

Other remarkable features: On the superior edge of the tumor a small metal radiographic marker
is identified.

Tissue submitted for special investigations: Tumor and normal was taken by Tissue Procurement.

Digital photograph taken: no

Container F is additionally labeled "right axillary contents." It holds a 12 x 9.5 x 3.0 cm aggregate
of multiple fragments of yellow lobulated fibroadipose tissue which are palpated for lymph node
candidates. Multiple lymph node candidates from 4 x 4 x 3 mm to 1.4 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm are
identified.
