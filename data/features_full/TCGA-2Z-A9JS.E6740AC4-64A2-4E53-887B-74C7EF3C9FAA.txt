Gross Description

A. The specimen is received fresh labeled ”ieﬂ partial mpnrectomy" and consists of a 3.0 g, 2.5
x 2.!) x '23} cm partial nephrectomy specimen. The specimen has been oriented by the surgeon with
ink.“ The margin of resection is re—‘mked in black. The capsule is irregular, tan to tan-red. W hen
sectioning the specimen a tan—yeliowlsh, partially hemorrhagic and necrotic mass is noted measuring
2.2 it LS x 1.6 cm iocated at 0-1 cm from closest inked parenchynral margin of resection. The margin

of reSeotlon is submitted tor frozen section evatuatlon as FSA? and the remaining tissue is entirely
submitted in cassettes A2 and A3.

Representative tissue was submitted to Tissue Procurement.

3. The specimen is received fresh labeled “deep margin". The specimen consists of: fragment
of dart: red-brown son tissue measuring 1.6 it list X 02 cm. The margin of resection had been marked
