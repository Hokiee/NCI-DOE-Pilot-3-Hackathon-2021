COMMENT:

Part 3: I am aware that this patient underwent recent loft partial nephrectomy for a conventional (clear cell) renal cell
carcinoma which was staged as pathologic stage pT‘Ib Nx Mx If the carcinoma In the right kidney (current resection) is
an independent primary, than the pathologic stage of the right renal tumor is p‘f‘lb Nx M): The possibility that the right
and loft tumors represent primary and metastatic lesions cannot be entirely excluded but this us less likely if requested
mutational genotyping of the left and right tumors may be performed to compare the mutational profiles of these tumors,
to more objectively determine whother they are more likely to ho independent or related.

Part 4: The specimen part number 4 Iaboled "elovonth rib" has been subjected to a gross examination only. If it is desired
that thin specimen be processed for additional studies, particularly microscopic examination, it is suggested that the
case pathologist be notiﬁed within two weeks of the signout date of this. report. This is particularly important as
specimens are routinely disoarded utter a prescribed period of time.
