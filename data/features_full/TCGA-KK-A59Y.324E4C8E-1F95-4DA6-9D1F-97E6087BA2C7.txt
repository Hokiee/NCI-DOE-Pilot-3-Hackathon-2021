ADDENDUM

This modified report is being issued to provide additional information/results.

DIAGNOSIS

(E) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 9 (4+5) (SEE COMMENT).
TUMOR EXTENDING FOCALLY INTO EXTRAPROSTATIC TISSUE.
FOCAL EXTENSION TO THE CAUTERIZED APICAL MARGIN OF RESECTION CANNOT BE EXCLUDED.
Right and left seminal vesicles, no tumor present.
TUMOR FOCALLY PRESENT IN LEFT PERIVESICULAR SOFT TISSUE.
SEE PREVIOUS REPORT FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF THE PELVIC LYMPH NODES.

COMMENT

The prostate gland contains a single focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor is located in the left anterolateral, left lateral,
left posterolateral, left posterior, mid posterior, right posterior, right posterolateral, and right lateral peripheral zone. The tumor
focus 3.0 x 2.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in the four cross sections and extensively in the apex
and base regions. The tumor exhibits extraprostatic extension in the left superior neurovascular bundle region (less than 1.0 mm).
In addition, tumor is also present in left perivesicular soft tissue (less than 1.0 mm). No invasion of the seminal vesicle proper is
present.

Please refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(E) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES — A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (5.1 x 2.5 x 3.5 cm, 31 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
right and left posteroiateral aspects of the prostate appears symmetrical. A nodule is palpated on the left side of the prostate.
Serial cross sections after ﬁxation demonstrate ﬁrm areas consistent with tumor in the left lateral and left posterolateral peripheral
zone of cross sections 2—4.

The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

SECTION CODE: E1-E4, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; E5—E8,
left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; E9, prostatic base, right border; E10, E11,
prostatic base, right posterior border; E12-E17, prostatic base, central portion; E18, prostatic base, left border; E19-E21, prostatic
base, left posterior border; E22, apex anterior; E23, apex left; E24, apex posterior; E25, E26, apex right; E27, detached portions of
margin of resection according to the specimen radiograph; E28-E43, sections of the four cross sections of the prostate according

to the specimen radiograph.
The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in

black.
Blue ink (E23-26, E29 and 31) and orange ink (E29) denote surfaces that do not represent the true margin of resection.
