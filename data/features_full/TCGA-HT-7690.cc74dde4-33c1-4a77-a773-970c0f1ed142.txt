Microscopic

Sections demonstrate a mildly to markedly hypercellular glial neoplasm that
diffusely infiltrates both gray and white matter. The neoplastic cells range from
microgemistocytis to ordinary gemistocytes and many have round nuclei wit
prominent perinuclear halos. Atypia is moderate. Neither microvascular
proliferation nor necrosis is seen. However, up to nine mitoses are seen in 10
high power fields.

Diagnosis

Anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, oligodendroglioma predominant grade III
