Main diagnosis/diagnoses:

Pulmonary wedge resection material with peripheral manifestation of a focally mucin-formin g
adenocarcinoma (sample 1.)) showing a predominantly tubular or acinar structure, in parts a
bronchioloalveolar growth pattern and a small solid and papillary component.

Comment/supplementary remark:

According to the conventional histology, the findings are consistent with a peripheral mixed
bronchopulmonary adenocarcinoma (C 34.1, M 8255/3), the TNM classification of which on
the basis of these samples is pT2 pNO pMX L1 V1 RX, corresponding to stage IB.
(Immunohistological analysis as to the tumorâ€™s point origin will follow.) The tumor shows
foci of infiltration in the visceral pleura and extends to the basal resection margin, which
gives rise to RX classification from the patho-anatomical viewpoint.

The immune profile (positive for cytokeratin 7 and TTF-l, negative for cytokeratin 20 and
CDX-2) confirms the bronchopulmonary origin of the tumor.
