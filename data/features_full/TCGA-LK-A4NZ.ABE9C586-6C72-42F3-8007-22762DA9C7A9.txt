a. PLEURAL HYALINE PLAQUE.

COMMENT:

The histomorphology of the tumor shows a diﬁuss malignant mesotheiioma with a predominantly epitheliold variant.
However. a tubulopaplliary pattern is focally seen.

Addendum
Probe: Dual Color Probe

RESULTS :

Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies performed on the malignant meeothelloma demonstrate 1 (1.6%) cells with
homozygous lose and 10 (15.6%) of cells with hemlzygoue loss. The ratio of p16 (9p2‘l) to the centromere of chromosome
9 was 0.95. The targeted region (total 64 cells) le considered to be NEGATIVE for p10 (9p21) deletion. ,

interpretation guidelines for 9p21 by FISH:
Ratio of p16 to the centrome're of chromosome 9:

Normal Range Ratio: 0.85-1.10 ,
Normal 9i. deletion: less than 20%

Clinical studies Indicate diagnostic and prognostic significance of p18 deletion in malignant mesotheliomae.

FISH analysis was manually performed and quantitatively assessed by analysis of a minimum of 60 cells.
