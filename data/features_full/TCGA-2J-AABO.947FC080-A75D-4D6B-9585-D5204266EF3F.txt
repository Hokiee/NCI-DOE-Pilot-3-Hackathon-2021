A. Liver, right lobe, blopsy: Scant liver parenchyma with capsular
ﬁbrosis. Rare cluster of atypical cells of uncertain signiﬁcance.

B. Lymph node, common hepatic, biopsy: Involved by metastatic
adenocarcinoma.

C. Common hepatic duct, margin, excision: Negative for tumor.

D. Pancreatic body, margin, excision: Intraductal papillary
mucinous neoplasm with high—grade dysplasia, present in the
pancreatic duct. No invasive carcinoma.

E. Portal vein, adventitia, biopsy: Negative for tumor.

F. Head pancreas, gallbladder, duodenum, common bile duct, portion
jejunum, Whipple resection: Invasive moderately differentiated
ductal adenocarcinoma on a background of extensive intraductal
papillary mucinous neoplasm with high-grade dysplasia, forming a
solid 4.6 x 2.3 x 2.0 cm mass located in the pancreatic head. The
tumor extends beyond pancreas to involve the peripancreatic soft
tissue. Perineural invasion is present. The uncinate margin tissue
shows metastic adenocarcinoma to a lymph node with soft tissue
extension. The tumor is 0.1 cm from the portal vein groove. The
patient has had no prior treatment. Multiple (7 of 15) regional
lymph nodes are involved by metastatic metastatic adenocarcinoma.
The gallbladder shows mild chronic cholecystitis.

G. Pancreatic body, new margin, excision: Negative for invasive

adenocarcinoma. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with
low-grade dysplasia.

AJ CC stage (with available surgical material): pT3N1 (7th edition).

This ﬁnal pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic
examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the
specimen(s). A revised report will be issued to document the ﬁnal
interpretation after review of the Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)
permanent sections.

ADDENDUM:

Frozen section interpretation has been conﬁrmed by Hematoxylin and
Eosin (H&E) permanent section review.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received fresh labeled "right lobe liver biopsy" is a 1.2 x 0.3 x
0.3 cm aggregate of tan-pink tissue. All submitted. Grossed by

x 0.3 cm lymph node. All submitted. Grossed by

C. Received fresh labeled "common hepatic duct margin" is a 1.5 x

0.5 x 0.3 cm fragment of pink-tan soft tissue with orientation.
Margin submitted. Grossed by

D. Received fresh labeled "pancreatic body margin" is a 3.0 x 2.0 x
0.5 cm portion of pink-tan soft tissue with orientation. Margin
submitted. Grossed by —

E. Received fresh labeled "adventitia tissue portal vein" is a 0.3 x
0.1 x 0.1 cm fragment of pink tissue. All submitted. Grossed by

F. Received fresh labeled "head pancreas, gallbladder, duodenum,
common bile duct, portion jejunum" is a Whipple specimen consisting
of 34.0 cm in length portion of duodenum, 6.0 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm portion
of pancreas, 9.3 x 4.2 x 2.6 cm gallbladder. The pancreatic
uncinate margin is inked yellow and shaved, the portal vein groove
is inked black and submitted perpendicularly. There is a 4.6 x 2.3 x
2.0 cm diffusely inﬁltrative mass within the pancreas, 0.1 cm from
the portal vein groove margin. The mass is conﬁned to the
pancreas. The gallbladder contains no choleliths. Peripancreatic
lymph nodes and periduodenal lymph nodes are identiﬁed.
Representative sections are submitted. Research tissue collected,
Grossed by

G. Received fresh labeled "new pancreatic body margin“ is a 3.1 x
2.0 x 0.7 cm portion of pancreatic tissue with orientation. All
submitted. Grossed by
