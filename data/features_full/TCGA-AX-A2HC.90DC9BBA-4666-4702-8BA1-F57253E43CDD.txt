Specimen 2. received fresh and labeled ”left pelvic node," consists of an enlarged soft, pink lymph
node with attached fat measuring 3.0 x 2.5 x 0.4 cm. The entire specimen is submitted as follows:
2FSA - remainder from frozen section tissue
28 through 20 - tissue not used for frozen

Specimen 3, received fresh and labeled "right common iliac lymph node," consists of an enlarged soft,
pink lymph node which measures 4.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. Serial sectioning reveals two large. ﬁrm. tan,
circumscribed nodules within the lymph node parenchyma which measure 1.3 and 0.9 cm in greatest
dimension. respectively. The entire specimen is submitted as follow:

3FSA - remainder from frozen section tissue

38 thrOugh 3F - tissue not used for frozen

Specimen 4. received in formalin and labeled "right adnexa," consists of a small, ovoid, ﬁrm. wrinkled
tan ovary with attached fallopian tube and which measures 4.4 x 3.3 x 1.6 cm. The
unremarkable-appearing ovary measures 2.3 x 1.6 x 1.2 cm and the attached fallopian tube has a soft.
pink. coiled. tubular-like structure which measures 4.5 cm in length and 0.7 cm in diameter. No tumor
is seen on the external surface of this adnexal structure. On cross section. the fallopian tube has a
pinpoint lumen. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

4A

- ovary
4B - ovarian hilum with blood vessels
4C - fallopian tube
40 and 4E - two more representative sections of the ovary

Specimen 5, received in formalin and labeled "left adnexa," consists of an ovary with attached
fallopian tube which measures altogether 5.1 x 2.6 x 2.8 cm. The ﬁrm, tan. wrinkled
unremarkableappearing ovary itself measures 2.8 x 2.5 x 0.9 cm and the attached fallopian tube is a
soft, pink, coiled. tubular-like structure which measures 4.2 cm in length and 0.7 cm in maximal
diameter. No tumor is seen grossly on the external surface of the specimen. Representative sections
are submitted as follows:

5A through 50 - ovary
SD - ovarian hilum including blood vessels
5E - fallopian tube

Specimen 6, received in formalin and labeled “right pelvic nodes," consists of a fragment of fatty
yellow tissue wnich measures 4.6 x 2.9 x 1.1 cm. Careful palpation reveals several small to large
lymph nodes which range in size from 0.6 to 2.5 cm in largest dimension. The entire specimen is

submitted as follows:

6A and 63 - largest lymph node bisected

6C and GD - second largest lymph node bisected

6E through 6H - smaller lymph nodes bisected. one lymph node per cassette
Additional lymph nodes are found and these are submitted as follows:

6i and GJ - lymph nodes bisected. one per cassette

6K and 6L - multiple smaller lymph nodes

Specimen 7, received in formalin and labeled "left pelvic nodes." consists of several fragments of soft.
yellow fatty tissue which measures in aggregate 5.0 x 3.2 x 1.5 cm. Careful palpation reveals several
small to large lymph nodes which range in size from 0.8 to 2.6 cm in largest dimension. The entire
specimen is submitted as follows:

7A and 7B - largest lymph node bisected
7C and 7D - largest lymph node bisected
7E - smaller lymph node bisected
7F and 7G - fatty tissue

Specimen 8. received in formalin and labeled "left common iliac lymph nodes," consists of three small
to large soft. pink lymph nodes which range in size from 0.8 to 2.5 cm in largest dimension. The entire
specimen is submitted as follows:

8A through SC - largest lymph node serially sectioned
80 - second largest lymph node
8E - smallest lymph node bisected

Specimen 9, received in formalin and labeled "periaortic iliac lymph nodes." consists of an enlarged.
soft. pink-tan lymph node which measures 2.9 x 1.6 x 1.1 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned to
reveal firm, well-circumscribed. tan cut surface and is entirely submitted in cassettes 9A through 90.

Specimen 10, received in formalin and labeled “omental biopsy." consists of a soft, yellow, fatty
fragment of tissue which measures 5.6 x 3.4 x 1.2 cm. No obvious tumor nodules are seen or
palpated. The entire specimen is submitted in cassettes 10A through 10A.

Microscopic Exam

All sections are examined. Histologic findings are summarized in Pathologic Diagnosis.

The attending pathologist whose signature appears on this report has reviewed the diagnostic slides
and has edited the gross and/or microscopic portion of the report in rendering the ﬁnal microscopic
diagnosis.
