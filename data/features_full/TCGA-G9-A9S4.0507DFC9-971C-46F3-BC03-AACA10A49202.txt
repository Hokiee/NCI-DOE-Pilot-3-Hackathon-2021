GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES
Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "right pelvic lymph node" are pieces of
yellow-tan soft tissue in aggregate. 5.2 x 2.9 x 1.1 cm containing lymph nodes ranging from 0.7 x 0.6 x

0.3 cm to 2.5 x 1.7 x 0.7 cm. The largest lymph node is bisected; submitted entirely:
A1: 4 lymph nodes

A2: 1 bisected lymph node

A3: remainder of soft tissue

B. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "left pelvic lymph node" are pieces of
yellow-tan soft tissue in aggregate, 3.7 x 3.2 x 1.2 cm containing lymph nodes ranging from 0.4 x 0.3 x
0.2 cm to 3.4 x 1.1 x 0.7 cm. The larger lymph nodes are sectioned; submitted entirely:

B1: 4 lymph nodes

B2-B3: 1 lymph node in each cassette

B4: remainder of soft tissue

C. PROSTATE

Received in formalin. previously sectioned and procured. is a 49 g resected prostate gland measuring
4.7 cm from right lateral to left lateral, 4.5 cm from anterior to posterior. and 3.9 cm from apex to base.
Ink code: Anterior-orange, apex-red. base-blue. right lateral-green, left lateral-yellow, posterior-black.
After sectioning, the prostate has a nodular tan parenchyma.

tissue. The right vas deferens is 2.5 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm and the left is 2.8 x 1 x 0.7 cm; they consist of
tubular tan tissue. Tissue is procured (6 9): submitted entirely:
