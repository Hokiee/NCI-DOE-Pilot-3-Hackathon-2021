AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT2 pN2a pr

Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the
time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and
additional information.

Comment:

Two foci of inﬁltrating ductal carcinoma are present, both in the lower inner
quadrant. Grossly, these masses were separated by 1.9 cm of soft ﬁbroadipose
tissue. Histologically, the intervening tissue shows ductal carcinoma in situ

and carcinoma present within lymphatic spaces. The smaller tumor is less than 1
mm ﬁom the posterior specimen margin in the mastectomy specimen; however, it is
possible that this margin is superseded by the separately submitted ' posterior
margin' (part A).

The morphology of the invasive carcinoma from the two masses is similar, as is
the morphology of the in situ carcinoma admixed with each mass. These two
masses may represent two separate foci of invasion arising from ductal carcinoma
in situ or may be arising from a focus of lymphovascular invasion (i.e., an
intramammary metastasis). The tumor stage is based on the larger of the two

 

 

 

masses.

Immunohistochemical studies for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and
HER-2/neu were performed on the biopsy specimen from the larger of the two

masses. Immunohistochemical analysis of the smaller tumor mass will be performed and
the results will be reported in an addendum.

Gross Description:

Specimen A is received in a formalin-ﬁlled container labeled "left re-excision
posterior margin, tumor clip posterior" and is a partially oriented 2.6 x 1.8 x
1.0 cm ﬁagment of mainly brown/red muscle with some minimal adherent
ﬁbroadipose tissue. There is a clip on one surface indicating the margin. This
surface is inked blue. The remainder of the specimen is inked black.

Sectioning exhibits unremarkable red/brown muscle with minimal ﬁbroadipose
tissue. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in blocks A1
and A2,

Specimen B is received in a formalin-ﬁlled container labeled "right total
mastectomy, stitch marks axillary tail".

Orientation of specimen: There is a stitch marking axillary tail. At

the time of tissue procurement triage, the specimen is inked as follows:
anterior/green, posterior/purple, axillary tail (lateral)/yellow.

Skin ellipse dimensions: 18.5 x 4.2 cm. The lightly pigmented skin
ellipse is remarkable for multiple brown papules from 2 to 13 mm in greatest
dimension. Just superior lateral to the nipple, there is a 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.2 cm
raised ﬂesh colored papule identiﬁed. The remainder of the papules are
somewhat ﬂatter and some are macules.

Nipple/areola: 1.5 cm / 2.7 cm

Axillary tail: Axillary tail is not well-delineated. The lateral
breast tissue is sectioned and no lymph node candidates are identiﬁed.

Biopsy site: N/A

 

 

Residual tumor: N/A

Location of tumor: N/A

Distance of mass/biopsy site from surgical margin: N/A
Gross involvement of skin or fascia/muscle by tumor: N/A
Description of remainder of breast: The entire specimen

consists of yellow lobulated ﬁbroadipose tissue separated by thin ﬁbrous
septae. There is scattered dense white breast tissue throughout the entire
specimen. There are no abnormalities readily appreciated.

Other remarkable features: None

Tissue submitted for special investigations: Normal given to
tissue procurement.

Size of specimen: 400 grams, 19 x 15 x 3.0 cm

Orientation of specimen:

Skin ellipse dimensions: 19 x 5.0 cm. The lightly pigmented skin
ellipse is remarkable for scattered light brown to medium brown papules from 3
mm to 1.3 cm in greatest dimension. .

 

Nipple/areola: 1.5 cm / 3.5 cm. These structures are
unremarkable.
Axillary tail: Axillary tail is 8 x 6.5 x 1.8 cm. The

axillary tail is amputated and palpated for lymph node candidates. Multiple
lymph node candidates are identiﬁed from 4 x 4 x 3 mm to 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm.

Biopsy site: N/A

Residual tumor: Present. There are two lesions identiﬁed. The

ﬁrst lesion is 2.5 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm. This lesion is well-circumscribed and has a
tan/red, focally hemorrhagic cut surface. This lesion is found within a
background of dense white breast tissue. There is a second 1.4 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm
mass identiﬁed. This mass is also well-circumscribed and has a ﬁrm red/white
cut surface.

These masses are 1.9 cm from one another. Mass #1 is slightly inferior to the
nipple in the subareolar region. Mass #2 is inferior and posterior to mass #1.

Location of tumor: See above. Both masses are found in the inner lower
quadrant.
Distance of mass/biopsy site from surgical margin: Mass #1 2.4 cm to

the deep purple inked margin, 5 mm to the skin, 4.1 cm to the inferior margin,
approximately 6 cm to the medial margin, approximately 8 cm to the superior
margin and distal to the lateral margin. Mass #2 is very close to the purple
inked posterior margin, is approximately 3 cm to the inferior margin, at least
10 cm to the superior margin, approximately 5.6 cm to the medial margin and
distant to the lateral margin. Mass #2 is 3.4 cm to the green inked anterior
margin.

Gross involvement of skin or fascia/muscle by tumor: N/A

Description of remainder of breast: The remainder of the
mastectomy specimen consists of yellow lobulated ﬁbroadipose tissue separated
by thin ﬁbrous septae. There is dense ﬁrm white breast tissue scattered
throughout the entire specimen.

Other remarkable features: None

Tissue submitted for special investigations: Tumor and normal

Comment:

The quantitative scores reported above were obtained using the F DA-approved
, The control slides for this case show

appropriate staining.

The patient' s larger tumor was sampled and tested previously, which showed a similar
pattern of immunohistochemical staining for HER—2/neu. Subsequent in situ
hybridization studies for HER-2/neu gene ampliﬁcation on that specimen showed that the
tumor was positive for Her-2/neu gene ampliﬁcation. In situ hybridization studies can be
repeated on the current specimen, if clinically desired.

Some of the immunohistochemical reagents used in this case may be classiﬁed as
analyte speciﬁc reagents (ASR) or research use only (RUO) reagents. These were
developed and have performance characteristics determined by the

. These reagents have not
been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA
has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests
are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational
or for research. This laboratory is certiﬁed under the Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualiﬁed to perform high complexity
clinical laboratory testing.
