Diagnosis / Diagnoses:

1.: Right hemicolectomy specimen with tumor-free resection margins, under inclusion of
an ulcerated, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (right ﬂexure), with infiltration
and penetration of the lamina muscularis propria (G2, pT2).

2.: Rectal resectate with inclusion of a broad-based tubulovillous adenoma with mild
dysplasia (synonym: low-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia) and also with free-free
resection margins.

A follow-up report will be made on the lymph node status.

 

Follow-up report:

A total of 18 lymph nodes of up to 0.9 cm in size in the Vicinity of the tumor were
dissected out of the pericolic fatty tissue in the region of the right ﬂexure (1.) after
acetone fixation.

Based on microscopy, these were all tumor-free.

In conclusion, or in summary, a stage of pT2 pNO (0/ 18) is thus determined for the
adenocarcinoma described in the right hemicolectomy specimen.

There were also no histological abnormalities in the fatty tissue on the rectal resectate.
