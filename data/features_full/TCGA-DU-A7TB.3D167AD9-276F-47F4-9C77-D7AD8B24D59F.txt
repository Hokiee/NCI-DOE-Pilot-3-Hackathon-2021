Clinical History
year-old man experienced a recent onset seizure and has a left facial droop. On imaging there is
a mass in
the medial and superior temporal lobe that extends into the insula, with mass effect and uncal herniation.
Operative Diagnoses
Benign brain neoplasm.
Operation I Specimen
A: Brain, right temporal lobe, excision biopsy
B: Brain, temporal lobe, excision biopsy
Pathologic Diagnosis
A and B. Brain, right temporal, excisional biopsies:
1. Oligodendroglioma, diffusely inﬁltrating.
2. MlB-1 proliferation index: 3%.
See Microscopy Description and Comment.
Comment
The sections contain portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter that are diffusely and
moderately infiltrated
by a glial neoplastic proliferation made of rather uniform round nuclei, with some perineuronal satellitosis.
The MlB-1
proliferation index is somewhere between 1.5% and 3%. There is not mitotic activity, microvascular
proliferation, or
necrosis.
In this limited sample the neoplasm has a phenotype consistent with an oligodendroglial origin, and is
devoid of
anaplastic features (WHO ll).

Loss of Heterozygosity 1p, 19q Assay (LOH)
Date Ordered: Date Reported:

Surgical Pathology

Page 2 of 4

Interpretation

POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 19q is detected.

Allelic loss on chromosome 1p is not detected.

Informative loci are: D1S548, D181592, D18552, D198219, D198412, and PLAZG4C
Results-Comments

Testing was performed on DNA extracted from tumor parafﬁn block (B1). H&E stained slide
was examined

and marked by a pathologist for subsequent tumor dissection. Peripheral blood DNA was used for
germline

comparison,

TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)! Tumor DNA
pairs using 3

markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1p are D18548, D1S1592, and 018552 (with D18468.
D1 81 612, and

D1S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D195219, D1QS412, and PLAZG4C (with
D198606 and

D1QS1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a
minisatellite (26

nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and
ease of

interpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or

otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the .

typical ﬁnding in oligodendrogliomas with 1p and 19q deletion.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand-alone diagnostic
test. This test

was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the

as required

by CLIA' 88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for speciﬁc uses by the US. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are

provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in the context of established
procedures

and/or diagnostic criteria.

TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in the sample may preclude the
detection of

allelic loss.

MGMT Promoter Methylation
Date Ordered: . Date Reported:
Interpretation
NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected.
Results-Comments
Testing was performed on DNA extracted from tumor parafﬁn block (B1). H&E stained slide
was examined
and marked by a pathologist for subsequent tumor dissection.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
benefit
from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status Involves bisulﬁte
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR ampliﬁcation of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors
such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample. or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

Microscopic Description
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates a glioﬁbrillary background throughout the
specimen, and
numerous reactive astrocytes. About one fourth of neoplastic nuclei over express strongly the p53
protein. With the
MIB-1 the proliferation index of the total number of cells is about 1.5%, perhaps about 3% in the
neoplasm assuming
that one half of nuclei are native non-neoplastic cells.
