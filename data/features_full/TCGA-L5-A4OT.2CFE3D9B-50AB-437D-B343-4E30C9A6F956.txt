1. 1"High lesser curvature perigastric soft tissue’. Received in a small W
container is a 1.6 cm soft tissue bit. [ﬂy/U"
Frozen section control.

2. ”Thoracic esophagus, stitch marks origin of left gastric artery and celiac
node”. Received in formalin in a large container is a segment of esophagus (4
cm long x 5.5 cm circumference) with attached proximal stomach (16 cm long x
average 6 cm circunference). 8.5 x 5 cm full circumferential ulcer/erosion
involving the entire gastroesophageal junction and upper half of proximal
staunch. 8.5 cm long x 0.5 cm in diameter fistula tract on the deep
periesophagoel fibroadipose tissue on the left lateral side, extends from the
distal resection margin to a little past the mid point of the stomach.
Esophageal mosal ulceration/erosion is. 3 cm from the nearest proximal
esophageal margin and 7 cm from the nearest distal stmch margin. Stitch in
the deep periesophageal iibroadipose tissue, area inked green. Remaining deep
fibroadipoee tissue underneath ulcer/erosion inked blue. Tuner invades .to a
maximal depth of 2 cm, invading through the auscularis and into the
adventitia: possibly to the deep resection mrgin at multiple areas. There are
multiple staple lines running along the left lateral side of the distal
stomach. Portion of artificial mesh at the distal margin.

ZA-Zc. Full thickness sections of tunarunderlying ulcer/erosion with maximai
invasion. (Each

an. Area under ulcer/erosion extending to stitch.

ZE. Tumr involving gastroeeophageal junction and extending towards proximal
resection margin.

ZF-ZG. Full thickness section from tunor extending to distal resection margin,
bisected.

Zﬂ. Lynph node under tuner. section trisected.

2K. three possible lyirph nodes.
2L. one possible lymph node bisected.
2H. Ulcer/erosion with adjacent fistula tract on the left lateral side of the
stomach.
3. 'Cervical esophageal margin". Received in formalin in a small container is
a 1.8 cm long x 1.5 cm in diameter segment of esophagus with staple line at
one end. Proximal margin submitted in one cassette.
