GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in three parts, labeled with the patient's name and MR
number.

Part A is labeled "#1. Left chest wall sarcoma with ribs, pectoralis major,
pectoralis minor, portion of left breast (three white sutures hold lung in
approximation to tumor), short black suture superior/long black suture
posterior", and consists of a 533—gram chest wall resection (16.0 x 13.1 x 7.6
cm) with five ribs (ranging from 6.2 to 16.0 cm in length). A portion of lung
(5.0 x 4.5 x 0.9 cm) with a stapled resection margin (9.1 cm in length, inked
blue), a portion of fibroadipose tissue and muscle (14.8 x 9.4 x 5.6 cm) with
an unoriented tan/white skin ellipse (4.2 x 0.6 cm). which exhibits a
well—healed linear scar (2.8 cm). The specimen is inked per pathology protocol
as anterior-blue, posterior—black, medial—orange, lateral-yellow, superior—red,
inferior—green. There is a large firm, focally hemorrhagic and necrotic
tan/red mass (10.0 x 7.3 x 4.6 cm) invading to the chest wall and ribs and
possibly invading into the breast tissue. The medial surface of the mass is
covered by smooth surface consistent with parietal pleura (10.2 x 10.8 x 8.5
cm). A representative section of the mass is allocated for cytogenetics,
electron microscopy and tissue bank. A representative section of normal lung
is sent for tissue bank. The mass is 4.6 cm to the anterior third rib margin
and 2.7 cm to the posterior third rib margin. The mass is 4.5 cm to the fourth
rib anterior margin and 2.6 cm to the fourth rib posterior margin, 3.4 cm to
the anterior fifth rib margin and 2.9 cm to the posterior fifth rib margin, 4.1
cm to the sixth rib anterior margin, and 3.8 cm to the sixth rib posterior
margin, 3.9 cm seventh rib anterior margin and 3.1 cm to the seventh rib
posterior margin, 1.4 cm to the posterior soft tissue (between fifth and sixth
rib), 2.0 cm to the anterior soft tissue (between third and fourth rib), 0.9 cm
to the stapled resection margin of the lung, 3.0 cm to the superior rib margin,
and 2.5 cm to the inferior soft tissue margin. On sectioning, the mass extends
anterior to the rib and possibly invades beyond the deep muscle into breast.

In the breast parenchyma, there is an area of hemorrhage next to the mass,
which represents possible invasion. There is also a firm fibrous stroma in the
breast (6.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm). The mass extensively involves the fifth rib. The
fourth and sixth ribs are intact but the surrounding soft tissue is infiltrated
by the mass. Representative sections are submitted for histological
examination. Gross photographs are taken. The mass was oriented and sections

were taken per , soft tissue fellow. The bony sections are
submitted after deca1c1r1cation.
