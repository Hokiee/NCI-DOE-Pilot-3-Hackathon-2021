COMMENT
Note is made that both in the specimen #2 and the specimen #5 labeled “additional left retrotrigone”, the squamous cell carcinoma
involves the lateral/deep margin of resection that according to a is adjacent to the bone.

Elastin stain positivity in one of the blood vessels involved by tumor conﬁrms the presence of lymphovascular invasion, and
immunostain for p16 is diffusely positive both in the cytoplasm and nuclei.

Gross Description:
Specimen #1 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled as left retromoiar trigone, and consists of a 0.4 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm

tan-pink soft tissue covered by mucosa on one aspect. The specimen is submitted in lots for frozen section consultation and
subsequently labeled as 1AFS.

Specimen #2 is received fresh labeled as left oral pharyngeal tumor, long suture medial and short suture inferior, and consists of a
4.0 cm (superior to inferior) x 3.5 cm (medial to lateral) x 2.0 cm (anterior to posterior) tan-pink soft tissue covered by mucosa on
anterior aspect. Specimen is oriented by a surgeon with a long suture designated as medial and a short suture designated as
inferior. The mucosal aspect displays two small ulcers measuring 0.5 cm and 0.6 cm in diameter, located 0.1 cm and 0.3 cm from
the superior margin. The specimen is inked as per protocol: red-medial. yellow-lateral, blue-superior. green-inferior and black-
posterior. The specimen is serially sectioned from superior to inferior into nine slices. Ulcers are present in slices 1 and 2. The
remainder of the cut surface displays a 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm tan-white ﬁrm tumor abutting the lateral, posterior and inferior margins.
The tumor is 0.2 cm and 1.0 cm from superior and medial margins respectively. Tissue is partially submitted for TCGA studies.

Superior and inferior margins (slices 1 and 9) are sectioned perpendicularly. The specimen is entirely submitted and subsequently
labeled as:

2A: superior margin, perpendicular sections (slice 1)
28: slice 2. bisected

2C: slice 3. bisected

20: slice 4, bisected

2E: slice 5 (medial half)

2F: slice 5 (lateral and posterior margins)

ZG: slice 6, medial margin

2H: slice 6. lateral margin

2i: slice 6. lateral and posterior margins

2J2 slice 7. bisected

2K: slice 8, bisected

2L: inferior margin. perpendicular sections (slice 9).

Specimen #3 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled as left superior margin clip medial. and consists of a 2.0 cm
strip of tan-pink mucosal tissue. Orange ink on medial aspect. The specimen is submitted in toto for frozen section and
subsequently labeled as 3AFS.

Specimen #4 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled as left medial margin. slice superior. and consists of a 2.0 cm

strip of tan-pink tissue. Orange ink on superior aspect. The specimen is submitted in toto for frozen section consultation and
subsequently labeled as 4AFS.

Specimen #5 is received in formalin labeled as left additional retro trigone margin. and consists of a 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm tan-pink
tissue covered by mucosa on one aspect. The tissue is submitted in toto labeled as 5A.

Specimen #6 is received in formalin labeled as second left retromoiar margin. and consists of a 0.8 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm tampink soft
tissue which is submitted in toto labeled as 6A.

Specimen #7 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled as third left retromoiar margin, and consists of a 1.0 x 0.3 x

0.2 cm tan-pink tissue covered by mucous on one aspect. The specimen is submitted in toto for frozen section consultation and
labeled as 7AFS.

Specimen #8 is received in formalin. labeled left neck lymph nodes level 4. and consists of two irregular portions of ﬁbrofatty tissue
measuring 4.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm and 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm. The lymph nodes are submitted in their entirety as follows:

8A-88: lymphoid tissue bisected

BC: four lymph nodes

80: two lymph nodes bisected inked respectively
8E: one lymph node bisected

8F: three lymph nodes

Specimen #9 is received fresh. labeled left neck lymph node level 2N3. and consists of a 6 x 4.8 x 3 cm aggregate of ﬁbrofatty
tissue and lymph node in which each lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging from 0.2 cm up to 4.5 x 3.8 x 2.5 cm. The largest lymph
node is sectioned to reveal tan-pink rubbery-to-indurated to soft somewhat friable and cystic cut surfaces consistent with tumor.
The lymph nodes are submitted in their entirety (with the exception of the largest grossly positive lymph node) as follows:

9A: three lymph nodes

QB: two lymph nodes

90: one lymph node bisected

9D: one lymph node bisected

9E-QG: representative sections of largest positive lymph node

Please note a small portion of the largest lymph node is submitted for TCGA studies.

Specimen #10 is received in formalin, labeled left neck lymph node level 23. and consists of a 3.0 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm irregular portion
of fibrofatty tissue which contains 9% of lymph nodes. The lymph nodes are ranging from 0.5 cm to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension.
The lymph nodes are submitted as follows:

10A: ﬁve lymph nodes

103: two lymph nodes

10C: two lymph nodes

Intraogerative Consult Diagnosis
lA/FSDX: POSITIVE FOR SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA. FAVOR INVASION.
3A/FSDX: NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

4A/FSDX: REACTIVE ATYPIA. NO IN-SITU OR INVASIVE SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA.
TA/FSDX: SQUAMOUS MUCOSA. NO TUMOR.
