COMMENT:

The features are of a type It papillary renal cell carcinoma. upon receipt of the specimen. there is capsular
disruption about the lower pole of the specimen, with exposed necrotic tumor present at surface. Histologic sections do

not reveal capsular invasion. and thi .nding ”Biologically appears to be iatrogenic. Correlation With the clinical

GROSSZDESCRIPTION:
e & ureter: Received fresh labeled kidney and ureter‘I and consists of a 1151 gram

nephrectomy specimen measuring 25 x 15 x 9 cm inciud ng dney measuring 22 x 12 It 6 cm and perirenal fat
ranging In thickness from ‘i to 6 cm. Extending from the renal pelvis is a ureter (6 x 0.5 cm). Tenet artery meaUrIng 7x
0.5 cm. and Tenet vein measuring 0.5 x 1 cm. The renal vein Is free of gross abnon'neiity at the margin. The specimen
is received with a surface disruption at the interior pole and at the iaterai‘aepect of the kidney measuring 6 cm in
greatest dimension through which friable necrotic debris extrudes. The adjacent lat is marked with black ink. In the
mid tower pole and corresponding to the capsular disruption is a well drcwnscribed predominantly necrotic mase
measuring 15 It 10 x 9 cm. The mass lies 1 cm from the renal vein margin and groeely extends through the renal

capsule and perirenai fat at the capsular disruption site. The remainder of the renal cortex is tan-brown with a well
defined corticomeduliary junction. The pelvis and caiyces are covered by smooth glistenin mucosa. The adipose
tissue is thinly sectioned. and no lymph nodes are found. The case is reviewed by‘ Representative sections
of the specimen are submitted as follows: A1) renal vein, artery and ureter margins on face; A2-3) capsular
disruption two fragments per cassette; A4-8) capsule wall. two fragm ants per cassette; A9) non-neoplastic kidney;
A10) perinephritic fat.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:

Sections of vascular and ureteral margin tissues do not show a neoplasm. Sections of the grossly described
lesion show a necrotic papillary carcinoma with patchy hemosiderin. and areas of variably loamy cytoplasm. Nuclear
characteristics show areas of prominent nucleoli and irregular nuclear borders. There is associated organizing blood.

Small vessel vascular space invasion is present. Tumor does not a r to involve renal pelvis or hiiar tissues.
Sarcomaioid areas are not seen in the examined sections. ﬂ
