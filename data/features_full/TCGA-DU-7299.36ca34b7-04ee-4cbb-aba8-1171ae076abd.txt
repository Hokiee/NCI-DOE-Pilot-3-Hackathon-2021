parietal occipital tumor.

OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
Not Given

Operation/Specimen: A: Brain mass, biopsy
B: Brain, resection

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:

A and B, Brain, parietOmoccipital, excision: Gemistocytic
astrocytoma,

diffusely infiltrating, anaplastic. Mlﬂel proliferation index:
10%.

S e e COTﬂI'IlP. I'lt .

COMMENT

The specimens contain cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter
diffusely

infiltrated by an astrocytic neoplastic proliferation, which is
focally

cellular and pleomorphic. Many of the nuclei are naked, but many other
have a

gemistocytic phenotype. Mitotic figures are found with difficulty,
but are

present. There is no microvascular cellular proliferation or necrosis.
The
MIB—l proliferation index is greater than 10%.

INTRA—OPERATIVE CONSULTATION

Brain mass, biopsy, touch prep and smears: Glioma.

   

 

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. Received fresh, four fragments, 2.2 cm. across in aggregate. Semi

firm,

tannish—yellow, poorly demarcated cerebral cortex. In total, Al—A3.
B.

SPECIMEN: Brain mass.

FIXATIVE: Formalin.

GENERAL: A 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm. aggregate of several irregularly

shaped

fragments of gray—tan to gray—white tissue.

SECTIONS: Bl — all submitted.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates a gliofibrillary
background with

abundant gemistocytes. More than 45% of the tumor cells over express
the p53

protein. With the MIB—l a proliferation index greater than 10% is
determined

in the more active areas.

These results support the diagnosis of an aggressive astrocytoma.
