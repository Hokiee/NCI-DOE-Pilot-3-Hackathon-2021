FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

PART 1: LEFT BREAST AT 2 O’CLOCK, SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY -—

A INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, NOTTINGHAM GRADE 3 (NUCLEAR GRADE— 3, TUBULE SCORE— 3
MITOTIC ACTIVITY SCOREa 2; TOTAL SCORE: 819).
CARCINOMA MEASURES 4.0 CM

NO DIAGNOSTIC LYMPHOVASCULAR SPACE INVASION (ABUNDANT RETRACTION ARTIFACT IS SEEN).
DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), NUCLEAR GRADE 2, SOLID AND CRIBRIFORM TYPES WITH
CALCIFICATIONS AND COMEDO NECROSIS.

MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE; MICROSCOPICALLY TUMOR IS CLOSEST TO THE SUPERIOR MARGIN (0.4 CM).
FIBROSIS. SUGGESTIVE OF PRIOR BIOPSY.
FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES.

TUMOR PREVIOUSLY REPORTED TO BE POSITIVE FOR ER AND PR, AND NEGATIVE FOR HER-2 BY FISH
