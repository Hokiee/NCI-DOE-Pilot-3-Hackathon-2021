Final Diagnosis

A. Uterus, cervix, ovaries, and fallopian tubes, F/s (TAR/BSD):
UTERUS:

— Endometrial adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, moderately
differentiated, FIGO grade 3.

-Tumor site: Anterior and posterior endometrium

~Tumor size: 7.2 X 6.3 x 2.5 cm

-Tumor invades more than two thirds of the myometrium (2.2 cm
invasion depth/ 2.5 cm myometrial thickness) or 38% of
myometrial wall.

~ Foci suspicious for lymphovascular invasion are seen.

- Right and left parametria are negative for tumor.

~ Margins are uninvolved by invasive carcinoma

— Distance of invasive carcinoma from closest margin: 3 mm
(Anterior serosa).

CERVIX:

— Acute and chronic cervicitis.

- Negative for carcinoma.

OVARIES AND FALLOPIAN TUBES:

— Follicular cysts

- Negative for carcinoma.

Pathologic TNM stage (AJCC 2002): le MG MK.
8. Anterior vaginal margin (excision):

Squamous mucosa with mild chronic inflammation.
Negative for malignancy.

C. Posterior vaginal margin (excision):
Squamous mucosa with focal acute and chronic inflammation.
Negative for malignancy.

D. Left pelvic lymph node (excision):
Three lymph nodes, negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/3).

Left periaortic lymph node (excision):
Two lymph nodes, negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/3).

Right pelvic lymph node (excision):
Four lymph nodes, negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/4).

C)

Right periaortic lymph node (excision): ,
Eight lymph nodes, negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/8).

Comment:

The frozen section of the right ovary had an area that was
suspicious for metastatic carcinoma. However, on permanent
section that area turned out to be only a solid collection of
follicular cells.

Gross Description
The specimen is submitted in 7 parts, labeled W

Specimen A is received fresh for frozen section, labeled
"uterus, cervix, 350". It consists of a hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy spm weighing 266 grams. The
uterus measures 9.5 cm from superior to inferior, 7.2 cm from
cornu to cornu and 6.5 cm from anterior to posterior. The
serosal surface is pink-tan and smooth. The anterior surface of
the uterus is inked blue and the posterior surface is inked
black. The uterus is opened with a Y-shaped incision to reveal a
soft, pink-red, hemorrhagic, irregular, tumor mass, occupying
the entire endometrial cavity. The mass measures 7.2 X 6.3 x
2.5 cm. The endocervical canal measures 3.1 cm in length. The
endocervical mucosa is pink-red and hemorrhagic. The anterior
myometrium measures 2.5 cm in thickness and the posterior
myometrium measures 2.2 cm in thickness. The tumor infiltrates
deep into the anterior myometrium and measures up to 2.2 cm into
the myometrium. The right fallopian tube measures 7.5 cm in
length and 0.2 cm in average diameter. The right ovary is
pink-tan, enlarged with a smooth seroeal surface. The right
ovary measures 4.1 x 2.2 x 1.7 cm. The ovary is bisected to
reveal a cystic sectioned surface with central firm, pink-tan
areas. The cysts measure 0.2 to 0.6 cm in greatest dimension.
The left fallopian tube measures 6.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm in
average diameter. The left ovary is pink-tan, enlarged with a
smooth outer surface. The left ovary measures 4.0 X 2.2 X 2.0
cm. The left ovary is bisected to reveal a firm, pink~tan
sectioned surface with multiple cysts that range in size from
0.3 to 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. A representative section
of the tumor from the anterior wall, including the myometrium,
is submitted for frozen section. The tumor with the myometrium
is submitted as frozen sectionl and the remainder of tissue is
entirely submitted in ' -A1. The tumor mass with the
endometrium is submitted as frozen section 2 and the remaining

tissue is entirely submitted as ' .-A2. A representative
section of the right ovary is submitted for frozen section and
the remainder of the tissue is submitted as A3.

Representative sections are submitted for microscopic
examination as follows:

Specimen B is received in formalin, labeled "anterior vaginal

margin". It consists of an elongated piece of tan tissue,
measuring 1.5 X 0.8 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is entirely
submitted in El.

Specimen C is received in Ecrmalin, labeled "posterior vaginal

margin". It consists of an irregular piece of pink-tan tissue,
measuring 0.8 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is entirely
submitted in C1.

Specimen D is received in formalin, labeled "pelvic lymph node".

It consists of two irregular pieces of fatty tissue, measuring
in aggregate 3.5 X 2.5 X 1.2 cm. Three lymph nodes are
identified, measuring 1.5, 1.7, and 5.1 cm in greatest
dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows:
D1 two lymph nodes, one bisected, D2 and D3 one lymph node
sectioned into 4 pieces.

Specimen E is received in formalin, labeled as "left periaortic
lymph node". It consists of multiple irregular pieces of
fibro~lymphoid tissue, measuring in aggregate 2.7 X 1.4 X 0.6
cm. Two lymph nodes are identified, measuring 1.4 and 1.0 cm in

greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as
follows: E1 one lymph node bisected, 82 one lymph node
bisected. ' '

Specimen F is received in formalin, labeled "right pelvic lymph
node“. It consists of an irregular piece of fibre-lymphoid
tissue, measuring 2.7 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm. Two lymph nodes are
identified, measuring 2.1 x 1.3 X 2.5 cm and 0.8 X 0.3 X 0.3 m.
The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows: 51 and F2
one lymph node bisected, F3 one lymph node with entire
remaining fatty tissue.

Specimen G is received in formalin, labeled "right periaortic
lymph node". It consists of an irregular piece of fibrofatty
tissue, measuring 2.6 X 1.6 x 0.3 cm. Three lymph nodes are
identified, measuring 0.8, 1.0 and 0.5 cm in greatest dimension.
The specimen is entirely submitted as follows: G1 one lymph
node, G2 one lymph node, bisected, GS one lymph node with
entire remaining fatty tissue.
