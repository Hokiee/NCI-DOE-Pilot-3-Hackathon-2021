MICROSCOPY

Sections show a pigmented choroidal melanoma of mixed cell
type in which the epithelioid cell component amounts up to
80%. Tumour cells express Melan— A and HSP 27 (score 1).
number of mitosis is approximately 2/40 high power fields.

The micrcvasculature of the melanoma is prominent but closed

loops are not present in the planes of

lymphocytic infiltrate within the tumour is mild. Scattered
macrophages are present. Tumour necrosis is not seen.

Bruch's membrane appears intact in the sections examined.
There is minimal tumour extension into inner sclera but no
evidence of optic nerve or vortex veins involvement is seen.
Tumour cells are not seen at the resection margins.

Elsewhere, the cornea shows no significant abnormality. The
anterior chamber angles are open and the anterior chamber is
deep. The iris shows no significant abnormality but the
ciliary body appears atrophic with hyalinisation of ciliary
processes. The lens shows subcapsular degenerative changes.
Retina overlying the tumour is slightly atrophic and there
is peripheral cystoid degeneration.

DIAGNOSIS

Left eye, enucleation: Choroidal melanoma of mixed cell

type.
