MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:

A~Cz See microscopic-diagnoses.

D: Sections of the exophytic mass lesion and adjacent ulcerated lesion seen
grossly on the mid to left dome region correspond histologically to invaSive
transitional cell carcinoma (02, D3, D4). The neoplastic cells have high NC ratio
with large pleomorphic hyperplastic nuclei and are arranged in solid sheets and
single cells. Extensive desmoplastic change is seen. The tumor extends thr0ugh
the muscularis propria into the perivesical soft tissue to involve the peritoneum.
Multiple satellite tumor nodules are identified in the perivesical soft tissue. No
carcinoma in situ is identified. Extensive lymphovascular space invasion is seen.
Sections of the prostate show focal prostatic intraepithelial neoplasm (FIN 11 and
III) characterized by hyperplastic glands lined by stratified layers of enlarged
cells with corresponding large nuclei and variable prominent nucleoli.
