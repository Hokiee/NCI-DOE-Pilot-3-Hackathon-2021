A. The specimen is subdtted frcsh as "right colon" and consists of a
segment of large bowel removed in continuity with cecum and.terminal
ileum. The proximal and distal margins are joined with a line of
metallic staples. The ileal segment measures 4.5 cm in length and 1.5 cm
in diameter at the partially stapled proximal margin. The colonic segment
including cecum measures 13 cm in length and 2 cm in diameter at the
partially stapled distal margin. The serosa is pink with a scant amount
of membranous adhesions and a moderate amount of pericolic fat. There is
* puckered 2.5 cm area at the cecal pouch- The vermiform_appendix is not
Jrossly identified- The lumen contains a small amount of hemorrhagic
fecal material- The mucosal surfaces are pink tan with the usual folds
and a large nodular 6.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm tumor which fills the cecal pouch.
The tumor is firmly fixed to the underlying muscularis and corresponds to
the puckering previously described. The radial mesenteric margin measures
9 cm in length- Sectioning reveals the tumor to infiltrate nearly Lhe
entire thickness of the bowel wall approaching 0.1 cm of the inked (black)
serOsa- There are two small sessile tan 0.2 cm nodules at a distance of
11 and 5 cm from the distal margin of resection. Also noted is a 0.6 cm
area of suhmucosal hemorrhage at a distance of 3 cm from.the distal
margin. Exanunation of the attached adipose tissue reveals sixteen
moderately firm.to firm.pink and pale white nodules ranging 0.3 to 1.5 cm
in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted, multiple
(10) labeled as follows:

Cassette 1: Margins (proxinel nergin green dye, distal margin
blue dye)

Cassettes 2-5: Tumor (deep margin black}

Cassette 6: Sessile polyp

Cassette 7: Suhmucosal hemorrhage

Cassettes 8-10: Nodules found in the attached pericolic fat

Please note: A.portion of tissue is collected for TCGA studies-

 

 

 

 

B. The specimen is submitted fresh as "right ovary" and consists of a
segment of fallopian tube with attached ovary —- The
fallopian tube includes the fimbria and measures 3 cm in length and 0.3 cm
in diameter. There is a 0.4 cm plastic ligation ring at the proximal
margin. The lumen is patent. The ovary measures 3 x 3 x 3 cm. The
external surface is yellow white and lobulated- Sectioning reveals
multiple serous cysts with a smooth lining ranging 0.3 to 1.5 cm in
greatest dimension and a firm 2 cm pink white whorled nodule. '
Representative sections are submitted, 9 (6) labeled "1" to "6".

C. The specimen is submitted fresh as "left ovary" and consists of a
segment of fallopian tube with attached ovary - — The
fallopian tube is stretched across the ovarian surface and includes the
fimbria measuring 6 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter- The ovary
measures 6.5 x 5 x- 3.5 cm. The external surface is pink to yellow tan and
lobulated with membranous adhesions. Sectioning reveals a multiloculated
serous cyst with a smooth lining and a small 0.? cm area of ten papillary
projections. Representative sections are submitted, multiple (6) labeled

"1" to “'6" _
