Pathohistological diagnosis
Seminoma testis (pT2 NXMX), right testicle

Description:

A testicle with tumor, size 7:5 524.5 cm with 9 cm long funiculus and 2.5-3 cm diameter was
received, Inside the testicle we ﬁnd white, nodular tumor tissue with hemorrhaging and
necrotic areas encompassing an area of 6.2:5:4.5 cm. Histologically, the tumor is made of
solid tumor cell clusters with round and oval bright nuclei with pronounced smaller nuclei
with medium abundant bright cytoplasm. Around tumor cells we ﬁnd lymphocyte seat
clusters. Furthermore, we observed up to 5 mitosis per microscope large visual ﬁeld. On
several location we observed sinciciotrophoblast cells. Surrounding, preserved, testicular
tissue is mostly atrophic.

The tumor inﬁltrates tunica albuginea and vascular areas, but does not inﬁltrate rete testis,
epididymis nor funiculus.
