Gross Description

Three specimens are received fresh. labeled with the patient‘s name. and medical record number.

Specimen A is received for intracperative consultation and is labeled "level 7 lymph node." It consists of multiple lymph node

fragments and soft tissue measuring in aggregate 5.5 x 3.2 x 1.1 cm. The lymph nodes are submitted entirely for frozen section
diagnosis in cassette "A1FS" through "A5FS."

Specimen B is received for intraoperative consultation and is labeled "level 4R lymph node." It consists of multiple lymph nodes
and lymph node fragments measuring in aggregate 6.0 x 4.2 x 1.0 cm. The lymph nodes and lymph node fragments are
submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis in cassettes "Bi FS" through "BBFS." The remaining tissue fragments are
submitted in cassettes "89" and "B10."

Specimen C is further designated "left 9R lymph node." It consists of two fragments of tan soft tissue in aggregate measuring 1.2
x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is submitted entirely In cassette "C1.“

Specimen D is further designated "right lung.“ It consists of a lung measuring 230 x 23.0 x 6.0 cm and weighing 726 grams.
There is a well-circumscribed. homogenous, white mass centered around the main bronchus that invades the bronchus and
approaches the peripheral edge by 3.0 cm. The mass measures 4.5 x 4.0 x 3.5 cm and is 1.2 cm from the bronchial margin.

The distal central ainivay has abundant mucous with diffuse bronchiectasis in the surrounding parenchyma. The uninvolved
parenchyma is otherwise grossly unremarkable. No hilar lymph nodes are grossly identified. A portion of tumor and normal
tissue are submitted for Ti55ue Procurement Services. The bronchial margin is submitted for frozen section diagnosis in cassette
"D1FS." Additional representative sections are submitted as follows:
