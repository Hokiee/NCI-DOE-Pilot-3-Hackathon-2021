GROSS DESCRIPTION
The specimen Is received in four separate containers iabeled 'osignated A. B,

C. D.

A The container is received fresh unﬁxed labeled “right sentinel lymph node #1 for frozen section".
The specimen consists of an ovoid nodule of tan-gray ﬁrm rubbery tissue which is 1.5 x 1 x 0.4
cm. and has attached fatty materiai. A single node is bisected and entirely submitted as two
frozen sections by Dr. The entire specimen Including frozen sections are submitted

In three blocks.

B. The container is received fresh unfixed labeled “right sentinel lymph node #2 for frozen section"
The specimen consists of an ovoid nodule of firm tan.gray soft rubbery tissue and attached fat

and measures 1 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. The node is bisected and entirely submitted as a frozen section
by Dr. The entire specimen including frozen section Is submitted In two blocks.

The container is received fresh unﬁxed labeled 'addltlonal node non-sentinel for frozen section".
The specimen consists of an ovoid nodule of pink-tan firm rubbery tissue with a scant amount of
attached fat 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. in greatest dimension. The entire specimen is submitted as a
frozen section by Dr. ' “ ‘ ._ The entire specimen is submitted in one block.

The container is received fresh unﬁxed labeled "right breast lump“ and consists of a 41 gm. ovoid
mass of apparent fatty tissue with an attached skin ellipse 5 5 x 4.5 x 3,5 cm. in greatest overaii
dimension. The attached skin ellipse is 4 x 1 cm. in greatest overall dlrnenslon. Gross margins
are observed and appear free by Dr, There is a long suture Indicating lateral margin
inked with purple dye. medial is inked red. There is a single short suture indicating superior
margin inked with orange dye. inferior is inked black. The skin is designated as anterior, posterior
is inked yellow. Sectioning reveals a ﬁrm tan-gray striated mass which is 2 5 x 2 cm. in greatest
overali dimension and grossly appears to be 0.4 cm. away from the inferior margn, 0 8 am away
from the superior margin. 03 cm. away from the posterior. 0.8 cm. away from the medial margin
and 1 cm. away from the inferior. The specimen is submitted in eleven blocks.

Key Note Block Summary: 1—lateral. 2—medial, 3—euperior. 4—lnferior. 5—anterlor. 6-—
posterior. 7 through 10—tumor, 11—skin.
