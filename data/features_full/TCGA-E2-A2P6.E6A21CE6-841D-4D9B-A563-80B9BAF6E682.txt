- MULTIFOCAL INVASIVE LOBULAR CARCINOMA, NOTTINGHAM GRADE 2.
- LARGEST FOCUS IS 3.5 CM.
- INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS PRESENT AT THE SUPERIOR MARGIN
AND IS WITHIN 0.1 CM OF THE INFERIOR MARGIN.
- LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU (LCIS).

NOTE: Several foci of invasive carcinoma are seen. spanning throughout a 6.4 cm lumpectomy.

B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 1. LEFT AXILLA, BIOPSY:
- METASTATIC CARCINOMA (1.9 CM IN SIZE) IN ONE LYMPH NODE
WITH FOCAL EXTRANODAL EXTENSION (1/1).

C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 2, LEFT AXILLA, BIOPSY:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/1).

D. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 3, LEFT AXILLA, BIOPSY:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/1).

E. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 4, LEFT AXILLA, BIOPSY:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/1).

F. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 5, LEFT AXILLA, BIOPSY:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/1).

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. WIDE LOCAL EXCISION LEFT BREAST
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "left breast wide local excision" is
an oriented, previously inked, 55 g, 6.4 x 5.5 x 3.3 cm lumpectomy. The single suture designates
anterior, double-lateral, triple—superior. Ink code: Anterior-yellow, posterior-green, medial-black, lateral-
red, superior-blue, inferior-orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from posterior to anterior into 5
slices revealing a 2.5 x 2.1 x 1.9 cm, ill-deﬁned ﬁrm pale tan mass, located 0.6 cm from the lateral
margin. The remainder of the specimen shows focal areas of white dense ﬁbrous parenchyma. Tissue
is procured. The specimen is representatively submitted:
A1-A2: Representative section posterior margin (green ink)
A3: Slice 2, inferior/lateral
A4-A5: Slice 2, lateral/medial, respectively
A6-A11: Slice 3, entirely submitted, A7 demonstrating mass and nearest the lateral margin
A12-A13: Slice 4, mass, lateral margin
A14-A15: Slice 4, medial/inferior, respectively
A16: Slice 4, superior -
A17-A18: Representative perpendicular sections anterior margin
B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 LEFT AXlLLA

axilla" is a yellow-tan lymph node measuring 1.9 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm. The specimen is sectioned, entirely
submitted, B1.
C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 LEFT AXlLLA
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "sentinel lymph node #2 left
axilla” is a yellow-tan lymph node measuring 2.4 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is sectioned, entirely
submitted, C1.
D. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #3 LEFT AXlLLA
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "sentinel lymph node #3 left
axilla" is a tan lymph node measuring 1.6 x 1 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is sectioned, entirely submitted,

D1.

E. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #4 LEFT AXlLLA

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "sentinel lymph node #4 left
axilla“ is a yellow-tan lymph node measuring 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is sectioned, entirely
submitted, E1.

F. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #5 LEFT AXlLLA

Received fresh labeled with the patient‘s identiﬁcation and designated "sentinel lymph node #5 left
axilla" is a tan lymph node measuring 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted, F1.
