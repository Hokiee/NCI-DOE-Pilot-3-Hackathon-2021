the gastric serosa. There is a small amount of adherent perigastric fat that
is focally hemorrhagic. The adventitia is inked blue and the gastric seroso is
inked green. Arising in the GE junction is a 2.2 x 1.7 cm, centrally ulcerated
mass that comes to within 6.2 cm of the gastric margin. Host of the mass
involves the gastric mucosa, with a 0.8 cm portion involving the esophageal
mucosa. The cut surface through the moss shows its maximum thickness of 0.7
cm, penetrating into the submucosa but not involving the muscular wall or
adventitia. lymph node candidates from perigastric fat are retrieved up to 0.3
cm in greatest dimension.
