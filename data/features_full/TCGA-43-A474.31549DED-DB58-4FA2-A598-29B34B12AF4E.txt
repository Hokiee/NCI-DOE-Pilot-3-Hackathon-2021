DiagnOSis
E. and F. Lung, Left Upper Lobe lobectomy and subsequent bronchial 3*)
margin:

Invasive squamous cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated, 5.6 cm

(pT2b)

Tumor involves the main bronchus

Final bronchial margin (specimen F.) negative for tumor

Pleura negative for malignancy

No lymphatic or vascular space invasion identified

Venous and arterial margins negative for tumor

4 peribronchial lymph nodes negative for tumor (0/4)
K. Completion left pneumonectomy:

Pulmonary hemorrhage compatible with procedural effects

Focal hemosiderin compatible with more remote hemorrhage
Atelectasis

Bronchial and vascular margins unremarkable
A. Lymph node level #5, biopsy: Single lymph node negative for
metastatic tumor (O/l)

B. Lymph node, level #6, biopsy: Single lymph node negative for
metastatic tumor (0/1)

C. Lymph node, level #4, biopsy: Single lymph node negative for
metastatic tumor (0/1) -

D. Lymph node, level #9, biopsy: Single lymph node negative for
metastatic tumor (0/1)

G. Lymph node, level #11, biopsy: Single lymph node negative for
metastatic tumor (0/1)

H. Lymph node, level #7, biopsy: Single lymph node negative for
metastatic tumor (0/1)

I. Lymph node, level #4, biopsy: Single lymph node negative for
metastatic tumor (0/1)

J. Lymph node, level #10, biopsy: Single lymph node negative for
metastatic tumor (0/1).

Microscopic Description:

A—J. Microscopic examination performed and summarized in the template
below:

Histologic type: Invasive squamous carcinoma

Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated

Primary tumor (pT): 5.6 cm in greatest dimension (pT2b)

Margins of resection: Final bronchial margin in specimen F. negative
for tumor. Bronchial margins negative for tumor

Direct extension of tumor: Tumor involves the main bronchus of the left
upper lobe and invades pulmonary parenchyma. No extension into the
pleura is identified.

Venous (large vessel) invasion: Negative

Arterial (large vessel) invasion: Negative

Lymphatic (small vessel) invasion: Negative

Regional lymph nodes (pN): All examined lymph nodes are negative for
malignancy. Prominent anthracosis is present. (pNO)

Distant metastasis (pM): Not evaluated (pMX)

other findings: Mild emphysematous change is present. Areas of
anthracosis are present. Some bronchiectasis and some nonspecific
focal interstitial fibrosis is noted away from the main tumor in the
left upper lobe. The left lower lobe is notable for marked hemorrhage
within the alveoli and prominent atelectasis. Anthracosis and
hemosiderin laden macrophages are also prominent. No malignancy is
identified in the left lower lobe.

Gross Description

A. Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled "level #5
node "is a 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm gray—tan irregular soft nodular tissue
fragment which is bisected and entirely submitted in one cassette. A81
B. Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled "level #6
node "is a 1.3 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm gray-tan nodular tissue fragment. The
specimen is trisected and entirely submitted in one cassette. ASl

C. Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled "level #4
node "is a 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm gray—tan irregular nodular tissue
fragment which is entirely submitted in one cassette. ASl.

D. Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled "level #9
node "is a 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm black red irregular soft tissue fragment.
ASl.

E. Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled "left
upper lobe of lung "is a 26.0 x 16.0 x 6.0 cm lobe of lung. The
specimen is partially covered with a pink-tan smooth glistening pleura
showing diffuse black stippling. The specimen shows a firm mass near
the hilar surface. No discrete pleura umbilication is grossly
identified however the mass can be palpated. The specimen is sectioned
to show a large white tan ill circumscribed lesion which is 5.6 x 5.5 x
4.3 cm. It does not appear to grossly involve the pleura surface and
comes within 0.2 cm of the bronchial margin. Tumor is grossly present
within the bronchus. No discrete hilar nodes are grossly identified.
The remainder of the cut surface of the specimen is pink red and spongy
with diffuse black stippling present. Representative sections of the
specimen are submitted as follows: 1 - bronchial and vascular margins,
2 — tumor to pleura, 3 — tumor in bronchus, 4 — possible hilar nodes
bisected, 5 — tumor to normal, 6 - additional tumor to normal, 7 —
representative normal. RS 7.

F. Received fresh for frozen section labeled "F. bronchial margin" is
a 4 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm piece of stapled tan rubbery cartilaginous tissue.
The stanles are removed and the specimen is frozen as frozen section
FFS l.

G. Received rresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled "level #11
node "is a 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm black red irregular soft tissue fragment
which is bisected and entirely submitted in one cassette. ASl.

H. Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled "level #7
node "is a 2.2 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm gray—tan irregular nodular tissue
fragment is bisected and entirely submitted in 2 cassettes

I. Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled "level #4
node "is a 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm gray-tan irregular soft tissue fragment
which is bisected and entirely submitted in one cassette. ASl.

J. Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled "labeled
"level #10 node "is a 1.2 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm gray—tan irregular nodule
which is bisected and entirely submitted in one cassette. ASl.

K. Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled
"completion left pneumonectomy "is a 20.5 x 8.5 x 3.5 cm lobe of lung
with an extended portion of bronchus measuring 5 cm in length. The
pleura is violaceous smooth glistening with diffuse black stippling
present. The specimen is palpated to identify no discrete gross
lesions. The specimen is sectioned to show pink red spongy cut surface
with no other discrete gross lesions identified. No discrete hilar
lymph nodes are grossly identified. Representative sections of the
specimen are submitted as follows: 1 — representative normal, 2 ~
bronchial margin, vascular margins with possible lymph node. 4 — 5 —
additional representative sections of the specimen.
