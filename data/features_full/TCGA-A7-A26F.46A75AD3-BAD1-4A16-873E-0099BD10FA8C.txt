Date Col)

SPECIMEN
A. Left axillary sentinel lymph node
B. Left breast

CLINICAL NOTES
CLINICAL HISTORY: A —year—old with left breast metaplastic
cancer.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS
AFS Left axillary sentinel node, excision:
No evidence of metastasis in 1 node (0/1)

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. Received in a container labeled with the patient's name,

medical record number and "left axillary sentinel lymph
node". The specimen container holds a single soft tan lymph node
measuring 1.5 x l x 0.5 cm. AS block ASF, bisected.

B. Container B is labeled with the patient's name, medical

record number and "left breast". The specimen consists of
an excisional biopsy oriented by two sutures and measuring 3.5 cm.
from anterior to posterior, 3.8 cm. from superior to inferior and
2.5 cm. from medial to lateral. The specimen margins are inked as
follows: blue-interior, black-posterior, red—superior,
green—inferior, yellow-medial, orange—lateral. The specimen is
serially sectioned and there is a firm, tan stellate lesion
measuring 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm., located extending in the direction of
the inferior margin of resection and appearing to involve the
inferior margin. ASBl-BZO.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
A. There is no evidence of metastasis in one left axillary
sentinel lymph node. The node is examined by multilevel
sectioning with H&E staining, as well as for immunohistochemistry
for pankeratin.
B. Invasive Carcinoma: Present.
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation,
metaplastic.
Histologic grade:
Overall grade: 3
Architectural score: 3
Nuclear score: 3
Mitotic score: 3

Greatest dimension (pT): 1.8 cm (pTl)

Specimen margins: Positive.

Vessel invasion: Invasive carcinoma involves inferior margin over
a distance of greater than 1 cm.

Vessel invasion: foci suspicious.

Calcification: Present.

Ductal carcinoma in situ: Present.
Histologic pattern: Solid.
Nuclear grade: 3
Central necrosis: Present.

 

% DCIS subtotal tumor: Less than 10%.
Extensive intraductal component: Absent.
Specimen margins: Negative.
Calcification: Present.

Description of non-tumorous breast: Unremarkable.
Comments: None.
Prognostic markers: Previously FISH for HER—2 v=s reported as
equivocal and a block is sent at the request of
repeat HER-2 by FISH.

DIAGNOSIS
A. Left/axillary sentinel lymph node, resection:
_:/ No evidence of metastasis in one lymph node (0/1).
E. Left breast, excisional biopsy:
- Poorly differentiated carcingmg with metaplastic features,
grade 3, "#’_M‘ “A "
1.8 cm.
- Invasive carcinoma extends to involve the inferior margin
of resection.
— Ductal carcinoma in situ, solid and comedo subtypes,
nuclear grade 3 with necrosis, margins negative.
