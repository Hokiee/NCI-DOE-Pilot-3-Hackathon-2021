Other pathologic findings:

e Cervix: Nabothian cysts and chronic inflammation.

— Endometrium: Mixed endometrial/endocervical polyp and
background atrophic pattern with breakdown.

— Myometrium: Multiple leiomyomas up to 1.9 cm.

— Ovary, right: Benign inclusion cysts and age related changes.
— Ovary, left: Focal calcification with associated inflammation,
benign inclusion cysts and age related changes.

— Fallopian tubes, bilateral: Unremarkable.

Tumor estrogen and progesterone receptor immunohistochemistry
results (A14):

Estrogen receptor: Weakly positive in epithelial component only,
1+, 75%

Progesterone receptor: Positive in epithelial component only,
2+, 50%

AJCC Pathologic Stage: pTla le pMX

FIGO (2008 classification) Stage grouping: IIICl

Note: These stages are based on information available at the
time of this report, and are subject to Change pending
additional information and clinical review.

B: Lymph nodes, left pelvic, regional dissection:

— Three of fifteen lymph nodes positive for metastatic
malignancy (0/15) [See comment].

— The metastatic foci consist of single cells and small (<5
cells) groups consistent with micrometastases from the
epithelial component of the carcinosarcoma.

C: Lymph node, right pelvic, regional dissection:
— Five lymph nodes negative for malignancy (0/5).

Comment:

Immunohistochemical stains were performed on blocks A17, B1, B3
and B4, with appropriate controls. Block A17 contains the left
ovary and shows a single focus of parenchymal calcification
surrounded by mildly atypical cells which are morphologically
most consistent with histiocytes and do not resemble the
patient' 5 endometrial tumor. CD68, inhibin and pan-cytokeratin
(AEl/AES), performed on block A17, are non—contributory due to
loss of the focus on further sectioning. Blocks Bl, B3 and B4
contain left pelvic lymph nodes with rare foci of atypical
single cells and groups which stain positive for pan—cytokeratin

(AE1/AE3) and negative for desmin, consistent with the above
diagnosis.

Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis:
A frozen section was requested by Dr.

FSAl: Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries, endometrium,
total abdominal hysterectomy

— Poorly differentiated malignancy, defer to permanent

— Differential diagnosis includes leiomyosarcoma vs. MMMT

— No definite malignant glandular component identified

 

 

 

 

Drs.

Frozen Section Pathologist:, MD

Clinical History:
~year-old female with a uterine sarcoma

Gross Description:
Specimen A:

Received is one appropriately labeled container.

Adnexa: bilateral tubes and ovaries are present

Weight: 935 g

Shape: irregular

Dimensions:

height: 19.0 cm

anterior to posterior: 7.5 cm

breadth at fundus: 12.2 cm

Serosa: tan-pink smooth and glistening

Cervix: the cervix measures 3.5 cm in diameter with a patent
cervical 03

length of endocervical canal: 2.3 cm

ectocervix: tan—white smooth and glistening

endocervix: tan-white and trabeculated

Endometrium:

length of endometrial cavity: 11.2 cm

width of endometrial cavity at fundus: 4.2 cm

thickness of endometrial lining: 0.1 cm

other findings: the endometrium is tan-white and appears
flattened or effaced by a large mass within the endometrial
cavity

Myometrium:

thickness of wall: 3.2 cm

other findings: There is a large mass which appears to be
arising from the posterior myometrium measuring 14.5 x 13.7 x
7.8 cm. The mass appears to have both solid tan—white to yellow
components as well as cystic areas. There are focal areas of
hemorrhage and extensive necrosis present within the mass.
The mass grossly appears to be at least 1.5 cm away from the
posterior serosal surface. There are multiple additional tan—
white nodules within the myometrium ranging in largest diameter
from 0.7 to 1.9 cm. The cut surface of these nodules are tan—
white firm and whorled in appearance.

Adnexa:

Right ovary:

measurement: 2.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm

external surface: tan—white and cerebriform

cut surface: tan—white and unremarkable

Right fallopian tube:

measurement: 3.0 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter sectioning
reveals a patent lumen

other findings:

Left ovary:

measurement: 2.5 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm

external surface: tan—white and cerebriform

cut surface: tan-white and unremarkable

Left fallopian tube:

measurement: length 2.8 cm, diameter is 0.6 cm

other findings: sectioning reveals a patent lumen

Other comments: none
