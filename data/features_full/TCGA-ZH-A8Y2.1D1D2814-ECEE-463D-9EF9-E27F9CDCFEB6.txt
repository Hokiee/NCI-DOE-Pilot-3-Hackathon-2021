Comment:

H & E stained sections show a relatively well circumscribed
gland forming neoplasm with moderate nuclear pleomorphism and
focal tumor necrosis. A mucicarmine stain and immunostains are
performed on block B5. The mucicarmine stain is negative. The
malignant cells are positive for Cam 5.2, CK7 (focal),

CD5, CEA (focal, cytoplasmic), and CD56 (focal), and negative
for CK20, HepParl, chromogranin, and synaptophysin. In the
appropriate clinical setting, these findings are consistent with
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The preliminary results were
reported to Dr. by text message on

Representative H & E stained sections, the mucin stain, and the
immunostains were also reviewed by Dr. , who agrees with the
interpretation.

Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis:
A frozen section was requested by Dr. in OR

FSAl: Liver, segment 8, final margin
— Benign liver with mild inflammation of portal tracts and
steatosis, no tumor seen

DIS. at on

Clinical History:
—year-old female with a liver mass.

Gross Description:

Specimen A was received fresh for frozen section labeled
"segment 8 final margin" and consists of a 3.8 x 2.5 x 0.4 cm
fragment of red/brown tissue. A stitch marks the final margin.
The final margin is inked blue and the remainder is inked black.
The cut surface is smooth, tan/brown, and unremarkable. A full
thickness section was frozen as FSAl and the remainder is
submitted in Al—A4,

Specimen B is labeled "liver segment 2, 3, 4, and part of 8" and
consists of a 650 gram, 16.5 x 15.5 x7.4 cm partial hepatectomy
specimen that has a short suture indicated as segment 8 (per
requisition). The parenchymal margin is inked black and the

caval margin is inked red. There is an 11.9 x 9.3 x 5.8 cm
lobulated firm smooth pink/tan mass with patchy areas of soft
yellow discoloration occupying approximately 15% of the mass.
This mass is 0.1 cm from the caval margin, grossly abuts the
vessels at the vascular margin, is 0.5 cm from the parenchymal
margin, and focally retracts the capsule but does not extend
through it. The mass occupies approximately 75% of the
parenchyma with the regional vasculature uninvolved by mass. The
vasculature has a smooth and glistening gray/white inner lining.
The remainder of the parenchyma is tan/brown and unremarkable.
The capsule is intact, purple/gray and smooth with a 6.3 x 5.7
x 0.2 cm piece of adherent fibrofatty tissue (inked blue). The
mass is 0.1 cm from the fibrofatty tissue. A portion of tumor
was given to tissue procurement.

Block Summary:

B1 — Perpendicular of mass with vascular margin

B2 - Perpendicular mass with caval margin

B3 — Perpendicular of mass closest to the parenchymal margin
(segment 8 margin)

B4 - Mass with overlying adherent fibrofatty tissue

B5 — Mass with capsule

B6 — Mass with regional vasculature

B7 - Yellow discoloration of mass

B8 — Uninvolved parenchyma away from mass

Additional sections following initial microscopic examination:
B9 — Perpendicular of mass closest to caval margin

B10-BlZ — Perpendicular of mass closest to parenchymal margin
813 - Bile duct margin, en face

B14—B15 — Additional duct/vascular margin, en face (along the
parenchymal margin)

Specimen C is labeled "gallbladder" and consists of a 9.6 cm
long x 2.8 cm in diameter intact gallbladder. The serosa is
purple/red, smooth and glistening and focally stained green at
the body fundus interface. The wall is 0.2 cm thick and the
lumen is filled with green/brown viscous fluid. The mucosa is
pink/tan and velvety. Calculi are absent. The cystic duct
margins and sections of gallbladder from neck and body in C1.

Addendum

To add the results of additional sampling of the tumor in
specimen B

Addendum Comment

At the request of Dr. , additional sections of the tumor are
submitted for microscopic examination to evaluate for a possible
hepatocellular carcinoma component (blocks B16—B23). The
additional sections show tumor morphology comparable to that
seen in the original sections. There are occasional more solid
appearing areas. A HepParl immunostain is performed on one of
these areas in block B21 and is negative.

There is no definitive morphologic or immunophenotypic evidence
of a hepatocellular carcinoma component to this tumor. The
histologic grade and percentage of necrosis remain unchanged.

There is no definitive lymphovascular invasion identified in the
additional sections.
