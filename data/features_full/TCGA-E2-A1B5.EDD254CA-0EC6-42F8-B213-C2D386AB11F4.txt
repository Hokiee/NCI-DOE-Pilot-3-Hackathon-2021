D. LEFT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION
Received fresh labeled with matching patient identiﬁers and designated "wide local excision left breast"
is a portion of resected breast tissue weighing 290 g and measuring 11 x 9 x 6 cm. The specimen is
accompanied by a mammogram and needle localization wire. The specimen is received with
orientation. the single short suture designates superior, long suture designates the lateral. The
specimen is inked as follows: Anterior-blue, posterior-black, superior-red ‘a““"orange, medial-green,
lateral-yellow. The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 10 sections. Cut section
shows a ﬁrm beige ill-defined mass located 0.4-cm from the anterior/inferior margin. The mass
measures 1.7 x 1.1 x 1 cm. the remainder of the specimen shows areas of white ﬁbrous streaking
septae adjacent to the lesion (medial aspect). The specimen was taken to mammography, sections
were x-rayed. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

DIAGNOSIS:
A. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #1, LEFT AXILLARY, BIOPSY:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1)
- AE 1/3 NEGATIVE.

B. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #2. LEFT AXILLARY, BIOPSY:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1)
- AE 113 NEGATIVE.

C. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #3 AND #4. LEFT AXILLARY, BIOPSY:
- TWO LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/2)

- AE 1/3 NEGATIVE

— S100 MARKS CAPSULAR NEVUS.

D. BREASIﬂEFLWiDE LOCAL EXCISION:

— INVASIVE. LOBLILAR CARCJNQMA, SBR GRADE 2. MEASURING 2.1-CM
- INVASIVE TUMOR PRESENT AT THE ANTERIOR SURGICAL RESECTION
MARGIN

- PLEOMORPHIC LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU

- SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT AND SEE NOTE.

E. BREAST. ADDITIONAL RETROAREOLAR TISSUE, BIOPSY:
- INVASIVE LOBULAR CARCINOMA PRESENT AT INKED SURGICAL
RESECTION MARGIN, SEE NOTE.

F. LYMPH NODE. LEFT AXILLARY, BIOPSY:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1).

NOTE: The specimen was serially sectioned and x—rayed. The main mass was identiﬁed in slice #5. In
slices #6 and 7, suspicious density is identiﬁed. This corresponds to the extending density seen on the
mammogram. The main mass and the extending density microscopically are invasive Iobular
carcinoma. Also identiﬁed is metallic clip (area submitted in #02). This are shows focus of LCIS. The
largest invasive tumor measured on the slide (2.1—cm).

The tumor is present at the anterior surgical resection margin (slide #07) at a distance of 7-mm. The
additional retroareolar tissue (part E.) also shows invasive tumor, presents at the anterior marked
margin at a distance of 2-mm.

Breast biomarkers pending and addendum report to follow.

SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ERIPR RESULTS
Specimen: Surgical Excision
Block Number: D7

 

ER: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3
PR: Positive Allred Score: 5 = Proportion Score 2 + Intensity Score 3

 

COMMENT:

The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the
proportion score (0 = no staining. 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining. 3 = 11-30% of
cells staining. 4 = 31-60% of cells staining. 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak
intensity of staining. 2 = intermediate intensity of staining. 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring
range from 0 to 8.

ERIPR positive is deﬁned as an Allred score of >2 and ERIPR negative is deﬁned as an Allred score
of less than or equal to 2.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 105. 1:100) and PR (PGR
136, 1:100) provided by Dako (Dako, Carpenteria, CA) following the manufacturer 5 instructions. This
assay was not modiﬁed. Interpretation of the ERIPR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published
results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal
review of staining performance.

METHODOLOGY:
Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
Herz analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit (

I sing rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modiﬁed. External kit-slides
provndeo by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-
house known HER2 ampliﬁed, control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well
preserved, clear—cut invasive carcinoma was identiﬁed for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2
immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided
by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.

This assay has been validated according to the ’joint recommendations and guidelines from
A800 and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology
Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance.
