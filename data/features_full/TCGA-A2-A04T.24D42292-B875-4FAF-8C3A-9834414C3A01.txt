SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
Patient: Specimen #:

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left breast cancer.

POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left breast cancer.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. The snecimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient’s name,
, g is designated as "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1". It
consists of multiple fragments of pink to yellow/tan, irregularly shaped
tissue, which measure 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm in loose aggregate. The

specimen is submitted entirely. 1C?

a. The specimen is received fresh, labeled with the patient’s name,

and is designated as "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2". It
consists of a 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.3 cm piece of fatty tissue containing a 2.5 x
1.3 x 1.2 cm lymph node. The node is bisected, revealing extensive
fat infiltration. One half of the node is submitted for CBCP protocol; the
remaining half is submitted for paraffin section in cassette 32. 2CF “

c. The snecimen is received fresh, labeled with the patient’s name,

' _ and is designated "LEFT BREAST TISSUE - ONE STITCH
MEDlAL, TWO STITCHES SUPERIOR, THREE STITCHES ANTERIOR". It consists of a
210 gm portion of fatty tissue,which measures 11.5 x 8.5 x 2.7 cm. The
specimen is oriented with sutures (long single medial, two stitches
superior, three stitches anterior). Ink code: blue superior posterior,
orange, superior anterior, black inferior posterior, green inferior
anterior. Sectioning reveals a well circumscribed, slightly lobulated tan
tumor in the lateral portion of the specimen, measuring 2.2 x 1.8 x 1.5
cm. On cut section, the tumor has a centrally placed hemorrhage filled
cavity, consistent with prior biopsy. The tumor is at least 1.0 cm from
the near margin (black, orange). The remaining tissue is predominantly
fatty with a 1.0 cm area of fibrous tissue punctuated with yellow flecks

C1: grossly normal fibrofaty tissue, approximately 5.0 cm medial to tumor.
C2: fibrous area with yellow flecks.

C3: tumor.

C4: tumor.

Additional sections are submitted.
C5 and C6: lateral margin.
