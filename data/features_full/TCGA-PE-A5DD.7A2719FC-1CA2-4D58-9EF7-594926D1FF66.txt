Touch Preparation/Frozen Section Evaluation: TOUCH PREP NO TUMOR SEEN,

FROZEN SECTION NO TUMOR SEEN PER

Gross Description: Received ﬂesh for touch preparation/frozen section
evaluation labeled "sentinel node right axilla" are two tan focally blue dye stained ﬁrm
lymph nodes, 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. They are sectioned, touch preparations are
made and frozen sections are performed on each lymph node. The frozen section

residues are submitted in two blocks. The remaining lymph node tissue is

entirely submitted in four blocks.

Designation of Sections: lFSA— frozen section lymph node A, lFSB- ﬁ'ozen

Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled #2, "right breast lumpectomy"

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled "right breast lumpectomy" is a 9.0 x 7.5 x 4.5
cm yellow-tan fragment of breast tissue. It is covered in part by a 5.0 x 2.5 cm light-tan
skin ellipse. There is a short stitch denoting the superior margin and a long
stitch denoting the lateral margin. The margins are inked in black, the
specimen is serially sectioned to reveal predominantly yellow-tan adipose
tissue. There is an ill-deﬁned, 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.6 cm ﬁrm mass having tan
gritty cut surfaces with inﬁltrating borders. This grossly appears to

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled " ﬁnal posterior margin (pectoral margin)" is a

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled "ﬁnal anterior and medial margin" is a 6.0 x

inked in black, it is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in two blocks.

Final Diagnosis:

1. Right axilla, sentinel lymph nodes, excision:

- Two lymph nodes with no tumor seen (0/2), see note.

Note: Immunohistochemical stains for Cytokeratin will be reported as an
addendum.

2. Right breast, lumpectomyz- Invasive lobular carcinoma, grade II with
microscopic focus of pleomorphic changes (3.0 cm); lymphovascular invasion
is not seen.

- Invasive carcinoma extends to the inked and cauterized lateral and inked
anterior breast parenchymal margin; approximately 2.0 mm from the inked
posterior margin.

- Focal atypical ductal hyperplasia approximately 1.0 mm from inked
superior margin.

3. Final posterior margin:

- Fibroadipose tissue and skeletal muscle, no tumor seen.

4. Final anterior and medial margin:
- Skin and subcutaneous tissue, no tumor seen.
(pT2 NO Mx).

Addendum Diagnosis
Irnrnunohistochemistry stains for the sentinel lymph nodes (specimen #1) do
not reveal metastatic carcinoma, comﬁrming the histologic diagnosis.

These tests were developed and their performance characteristics
determined by the immunohistochemistry laboratory at the

These tests have not been cleared or approved by the u.S. Food
and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or
approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes.
They should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This
laboratory is certiﬁed under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments of 1998 (CLLA) as qualiﬁed to perform high complexity clinical
testing.
