PART 1: LYMPH NODES, RIGHT PELVIC, EXCISION —

NO EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASIA EN FIVE LYMPH NODES (DIS). I
1

PART 2: LYMPH NODES, LEFT PELVIC, EXCISION -- ‘-

NO EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASIA IN TWO LYMPH NODES (0/2). -

PART 3: PROSTATE AND BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES, RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY -

PROSTATE ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 4 + 3= 7.

A TERTIARY COMPONENT OF GLEASON GRADE 5 CARCINOMA IS ALSO PRESENT.

THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT LOBES AND HAS A GREATEST NODULAR DIAMETER OF
1.3 CM IN ONE HISTOLOGIC SECTION.

THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES 15% OF THE EXAMINED PROSTATE VOLUME.

THE CARCINOMA SHOWS EVIDENCE OF ESTABLISHED EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION.

EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IS PRESENT AT ANTERIOR LEFT BASE (SLIDES ST and 3U) AND POSTERIOR LEFT
MID (SLIDE 32) AND'POSTERIOR LEFT BASE (SLIDE 3BB).

BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA.

ALL EXAMINED SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA.

PERINEURAL INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

N0 ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

HIGH GRADE PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA IS IDENTIFIED.

PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT3a N0 MX.

BACKGROUND PROSTATE TISSUE WITH NODULAR HYPERPLASIA AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATION.
