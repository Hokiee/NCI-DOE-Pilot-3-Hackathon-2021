3). The specimen is received fresh, labeled '"l‘otal thyroid" and consists of a thyroid weighing 27.5 g. The right lobe measures 4.3
x 2.5 x 1.5 cm, the left lobe measures 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm and the isthmus measures 2.5 x 1.6 x 0.5 cm. The external surface is
covered by a thin fibrous capsule. The posterior surface of the specimen is inked black, and the anterior is inked blue.

Sectioning reveals cystic. papilliferous, well-circumscribed, focally calciﬁed. brown-tan nodule measuring 3.4 x 3.0 x 1.7 cm in the
