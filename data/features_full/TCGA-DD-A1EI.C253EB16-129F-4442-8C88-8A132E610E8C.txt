TISSUE DESCRIPTION:

--.v Al A2 A3 Bl B2 B3 B4 B5
Right lobe liver (765.0 grams, 16.0 x 13.0 x 11.0 cm) and
separately submitted gallbladder (8.0 x 4.0 x 1.0 cm).

DIAGNOSIS: p//
Liver, right lobe, resection: Grade 2 (of 4) hepatocellular
carcinoma forming a mass (1.8 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm) located 0.6 cm
from the cauterized margin. The surrounding liver parenchyma
shows chronic hepatitis consistent with clinical hepatitis B,
mildly active (grade 2 of 4) with cirrhosis (stage 4/4).

Gallbladder, cholecystectomy: Benign gallbladder mucosa with
cholelithiasis containing multiple (2) cholesterol stones (0.3
cm in greatest dimension, each).

PRELIMINARY FROZEN SECTION CONSULTATION:

Liver, right lobe, resection: Grade 2 (of 4) hepatocellular
carcinoma. History of hepatitis B. Hold over to categorize
surrounding liver.
