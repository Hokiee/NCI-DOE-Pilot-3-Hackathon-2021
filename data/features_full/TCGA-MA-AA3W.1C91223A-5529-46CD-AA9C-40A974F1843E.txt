Gross Description

The specimen is received in nine parts, each labeled with the patient's name
and medical record number.

Part A: Received fresh and labeled "LEFT PARAMETRIAL NODE" is a 1.0 x 0.8 x

0.2 cm pink-tan rubbery portion of soft tissue, which is submitted in toto
for frozen section as FSAl.

Part B: Received fresh and labeled "UTERUS AND CERVIX" is a 114 gram uterus
with attached cervix, vaginal cuff margin, and right fallopian tube and
ovary. The uterine body measures 4.8 x 4.5 x 3.3 cm, and the attached
cervix and vaginal cuff measure 2.6 x 4.5 x 3.2 cm. The vaginal cuff margin
is pink-tan, smooth and glistening, and the cervix is tan—brown to tan-red
and bosselated and displays an ill—defined os measuring 0.5 cm in diameter.
A representative section of the cervix at the 1 to 2 o'clock location is
submitted for the research study V The anterior vaginal
cuff lower uterine segment margin is inked blue and the posterior vaginal
cuff lower uterine segment margin is inked black and the vaginal cuff margin
is removed en face and submitted as follows:

B1: 12 to 3 o'clock

DZ: 3 to 6 o'clock

BB: 6 to 9 o'clock

B4: 9 to 12 o'clock

The uterus is bisected to reveal a poorly demarcated squamocolumnar junction
and a lobulated tan—brown endocervical canal. Grossly the tumor is
Circumferential and invades for a depth extending from the cervical lip into
the myometrium for a distance of 4.1 cm, and for a width from the
endocervical mucosa to the uterine soft tissue margin of 2.0 cm. The
endometrium is tan—pink and velvety and measures 0.2 cm in thickness and the
myometrium is pink-tan and rubbery and measures up to 1.7 cm in thickness on

the anterior wall and 1.4 cm in thickness on the posterior wall.

Representative sections of the cervix and endocervical canal are submitted
as follows:

35-36: 12 o'clock cervix to lower uterine segment, proximal end inked green
B7~B8z 3 o'clock

B9-BlO: 6 o'clock ‘

Bil—813: 9 o‘clock

514-816: anterior lower uterine segment

B17: anterior endomyometrium

BlB—BZO: posterior lower uterine segment

821: posterior endomyometrium

B22-B23: left parametrium

324—327: right parametrium

The attached right fallopian tube is pink-tan with a delicate fimbriated end
and measures 5.6 cm in length and ranges in diameter from 0.5 to 0.3 cm.

The fallopian tube is adhesed to a tan~yellow bosselated ovary measuring 2.5
x 1.6 x 1.0 cm. The fallopian tube is serially cross sectioned to reveal a

pinpoint lumen. The ovary is bisected to reveal a tanewhite homogenous cut

surface with tan—white corpus albicans. Representative sections are
submitted as follows:

B28: ovary
329: fallopian tube with attached ovary

Gross photographs are obtained.

Part C: Received in formalin and labeled "LEFT PARAMETRIUM #2" are two
tan-pink rubbery portions of soft tissue measuring 0.7 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm and
0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette C1.

Part D: Received in formalin and labeled "RIGHT PARAMETRIUM" is a pink—tan
rubbery portion of soft tissue measuring 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm. The specimen
is submitted in toto in cassette D1.

Part E: Received in formalin and labeled "LEFT OVARY AND FALLOPIAN TUBE" is
a pink—tan fallopian tube measuring 4.0 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm. The fallopian tube
displays a delicate fimbriated end with an attached tan-yellow bosselated
ovary measuring 3.0 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm. The fallopian tube is serially cross
sectioned to reveal a stellate lumen. The ovary is bisected to reveal
tan-pink to tan-white parenchyma with tan—white corpus albicans. The
ovarian capsule adjacent to the ovarian ligament displays a 0.4 cm in
diameter cyst containing clear serous fluid. The walls are twp, smooth and

glistening, with no papillary excrescences. Representative sections are
submitted as follows:

El: fallopian tube
E2: portion of ovary with cyst
E3: cross section of ovary

Part E: Received in formalin and labeled "LEFT VAGINAL MARGIN" is a
tan—pink rubbery portion of soft tissue with overlying mucosa measuring 2.1
x 1.0 cm, excised to a depth of 0.6 cm. No orientation is provided. The
specimen is bisected along the longitudinal axis to reveal pink-white cut
surfaces. The tissue is submitted in its entirety in cassettes F1 and F2.

Part G: Received in formalin and labeled "LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE" are
multiple golden-yellow fibrofatty portions of tissue, and a laparoscopic sac
containing additional portions of tissue, 5.0 x 4.6 x 1.3 cm in aggregate.

The tissue is dissected for lymph nodes and reveals thirteen possible lymph
nodes which are submitted as follows:

, Page 4 of 6

Gl: nine possible lymph nodes
G2: two possible lymph nodes
G3: one lymph node bisected

G4-G5: one lymph node

Part H:

Received in formalin and labeled "DISTAL LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE" is

a golden—yellow fibrofatty portion of tissue measuring 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm.
The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette H1.

Part I:

Received in formalin and labeled "RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE" are

multiple golden—yellow fibrofatty portions of tissue measuring 5.8 x 5.5 x

1.5 cm.
nodes, which are submitted as follows:
11: four lymph nodes

12: six lymph nodes

13: six lymph nodes

14: three lymph nodes

I5: one lymph node bisected

16: one lymph node bisected
