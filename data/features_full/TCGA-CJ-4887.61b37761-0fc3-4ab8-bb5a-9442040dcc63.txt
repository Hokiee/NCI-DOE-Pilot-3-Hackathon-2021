DiAGNOSlS
(A) RIGHT KIDNEY:
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (4.0 CM MAXIMUM DIMENSION), CONVENTIONAL TYPE
(40% CLEAR CELLS,
60% EOSINOPHELIC CELLS), FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3, INVASIVE
iNTO RENAL VEIN.
(SEE COMMENT).
Margins of resection free of tumor.
(B) LEFT ADRENAL GLAND:
METASTATIC CONVENTIONAL RENAL CELL CARCINOMA IN ADRENAL GLAND.

COMMENT

The renal cell carcinoma invades into the renal vein. The perinephric
adipose tissue and renal sinus adipose tissue are free of tumor. Tumor
is also present within vascular-lymphatic spaces within the renal sinus
adipose tissue.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
(A) RIGHT KIDNEY, VACCINE PROTOCOL — A radical nephrectomy specimen
with surrounding perinephric adipose tissue (16.0 11:10.0 x 5.0 cm
overall), including the kidney (11.0 x 5.5 x 4.2 cm) and attached length
of ureter (4.7 cm x 0.4 cm). No adrenal gland is present.
A tan-yellow circumscribed tumor (4.0 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm) is Iocated in
the mid-pole of the kidney. The tumor is approximately 0.3 cm from
Gerota's fascia. The tumor appears confined to the renal parenchyma.
Areas of renal sinus involvement are grossly noted. Tumor Is present
within the renal vein, approximately 1 cm from the margin of resection.

The remaining uninvolved kidney Is red-brown and unremarkable.
Portion of the tumor is submitted for the vaccine protocol. A portion

of tumor is sequestered for potential electron microscopy.

INK CODE: Black = Gerota's fascia.

SECTION CODE: A'i, renal arteries. vein, and ureter margins, en face;
A2, tumor within renal vein; A3-A6, tumor and renai sinus; A7, tumor and
Gerota's fascia; A8—A10, tumor and normal; A11-A12, representative
sections of tumor; A13, representative sections of normal.

(B) LEFT ADRENAL GLAND FOR VACCINE PROTOCOL - An a renal gland (7.0 x
3.5 x 3.5 cm) largely replaced by a yellow-tan lobulated tumor (5.0 x

3.5 x 3.5 cm). Focaliy, within the tumor are areas of gray mucoid
material. Focal areas of the specimen show checolate brown tissue
suggestive of normal adrenal. Portions of the tumor are submitted for
the vaccine protocol.

SECTI ' B1, tumor and normal; 32-84, representative sections
of tumor.

CLINICAL HISTORY
Right renal mass. Left adrenal.
