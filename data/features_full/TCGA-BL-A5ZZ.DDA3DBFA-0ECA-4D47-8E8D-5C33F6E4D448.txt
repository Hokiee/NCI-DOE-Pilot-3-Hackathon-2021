Invasive high grade urothelial carcinoma (see tumor characteristics in

the microscopic description).

D. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, excision:
Two lymph nodes negative for metastatic carcinoma I

E. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, excision:
Two lymph nodes negative for metastatic carcinoma (

Microscopic Description:

Histologic type: Urothelial carcinoma
Histologic grade: High grade

Tumor size: 4 cm

Primary tumor (pT): Tumor invades into the vaginal wall, pT4a.

Margins of resection: The distal urethral margin shows high—grade
papillary urothelial carcinoma with no invasion. The ureteral margins
are negative. The outer soft tissue margins of the specimen are

negative.

Vascular invasion: Present
Regional lymph nodes (pN): pNO
Distant metastasis (pM): pMX

Other findings: other areas of urothelial atypia with severe atypia and

focal papillary urothelial carcinoma are present.

The tumor shows extensive necrosis. Immunohistochemical stains with
the neural markers synaptophysin, chromogranin and CD 56 are performed.

The synaptophysin and chromogranin are negative

CD 56 is focally

positive suggestive of focal neuroendocrine differentiation within the

tumor.

Gross Description

A. Received fresh labeled "right ureteral margin" is a stapled tissue
specimen that measures 1.2 cm in diameter and 0.3 cm in wall thickness.
The tissue is cut away from the staple and entirely frozen. AFSl

B. Received fresh labeled "left ureteral margin" is doughnut shaped
specimen that measures 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm in dimension. Entirely
frozen.

C. Received fresh labeled "bladder" is a 6.5 x 6.5 x 4.8 cm symmetrical
bladder with attached 2.5 cm urethra, a copious amount of pericystic
adipose tissue and bilateral ureters averaging 2.5 cm in length. The
ureters and urethra are probe patent to the bladder lumen. A 4.5 x 3.5
cm portion of wrinkled tan—pink vaginal mucosa is present along the
posterior aspect. The right half of the specimen is inked blue and the
left half is inked black. On opening, there is a 4.0 x 3.8 cm
papilliferous, twisting tan—white to chalky yellow—white tumor mass
occupying the right lateral posterior wall. The tumor surrounds the
ureteral orifice. On sectioning, the tumor has a maximal thickness of
2.5 cm, grossly extending to within 0.4 cm of the inked surface of the
specimen. A portion of tumor and a portion of normal mucosa are
submitted for tissue procurement as requested. The tumor involving the
posterior wall extends to within uro—0.2 cm of the vaginal mucosa. The
remaining bladder mucosa is glistening tan—pink to tan-red with normal
folds and the wall averages 0.9 cm in thickness. An area of tan-red
edematous mucosa is noted just superior to the tumor along the
posterior wall. No additional mass lesion or abnormality is noted.

Summary: 1 — urethral margin en face, 2 - right ureteral orifice, 3 —
left ureteral orifice, 4 and 5 - right lateral wall, 6 through 8 —
tumor to posterior vaginal mucosa, 9 — bladder to urethra, lO — left
lateral wall including area of edema, ll — Dome/posterior wall, 12 —
anterior wall

D. Received fresh labeled " left pelvic node" is a 5.5 x 4.3 x 2.0 cm
portion of soft, lobulated tan gold adipose tissue. Two rubbery
tan—pink—gold tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 5.4
cm in greatest dimension are recovered. The lymphoid tissues are
entirely submitted.

Summary: 1 — l bisected lymph node, 2 through 4 — largest lymph node

B. Received fresh labeled "right pelvic node" is a 4.9 x 3.4 x 1.0 cm
portion of soft, lobulated tan gold adipose tissue. Two slightly
rubbery tan-pink—gold tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up
to 3.5 cm are recovered.

Summary: 1 v 1 bisected lymph node, 2 and 3 — bisected larger lymph
node
