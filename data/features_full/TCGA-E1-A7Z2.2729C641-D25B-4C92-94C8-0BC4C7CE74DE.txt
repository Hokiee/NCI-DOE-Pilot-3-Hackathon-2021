CLINICAL HISTORY:

Brain neoplasm left frontoparietal, left facial seizures. HISTORY OF PRESENT
ILLNESS: 7 comes to clinic today. .. She had a
sensory seizure. She had a second sensory seizure. She had two MRI scans
that showed a growing lesion in the left frontal area. She is right—handed.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Brain tissue (AF1)", received fresh for frozen section placed in formalin
at ‘_—Im’— 7 is a 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm aggregate of multiple fragments
of soft tan tissue. Representative is frozen as AFl, frozen remnant in A1.

Additional sections are submitted in A2, with a small fragment retained in
formalin.

B. "Brain tissue", received fresh placed in formalin at? I is a
1.5 x l x 0.5 cm aggregate of multiple fragments of soft tan tissue, submitted
in B1 and 2. Small fragments are retained in formalin.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
A. "Brain tissue": AFl (representative)—glioma, low grade (Dr.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

Microscopic examination shows brain infiltrated by a glial neoplasm
characterized by cells with round nuclei and delicate chromatin. Satellitosis
and minigemistocytes are seen. Mitoses are rare. Endothelial proliferation and
necrosis are not seen. The tumor cells are immunopositive for GFAP. HAM56
highlights blood vessels. The Mib-l index is approximately 15%.

ADDENDUM 4:
Test Performed: TP53 GENE SEQUENCING

Interpretation:

EXTRACTED DNA, — FROM UNSTAINED SLIDES, _ (TP53
SEQUENCING FOR LI—FRAUMENI SYNDROME AND SOMATIC MUTATIONS):

NEGATIVE.
TP53 MUTATIONS NOT DETECTED. SEE OBJECTIVE FINDINGS AND COMMENT.

Comment: Mutations in TP53 are rarely found in gliomas with 1p/19q loss of
heterozygosity. TP53 mutations are more often found in astrocytic tumors and
correlate with a worse prognosis. Additional information can be found in
McLendon et al. Cancer. 2005; 104:1693—9 and references within. Clinicians
should correlate these results with clinical and other laboratory findings.

The sensitivity of DNA sequencing is 99% for the detection of nucleotide base
changes, small deletions, and insertions in the regions analyzed. However,
this assay may not detect an acquired mutation which is present below the 25%
detection limit (i.e., mutant cell population of < 25%). Only the coding
regions of the TP53 gene and immediate flanking intronic sequences were
examined. Changes in the promoter region, farther into the introns, or in
other non-coding regions of the gene would not be detected. Mutations in genes
other than TP53 would not be identified. Large deletions, duplications,
multiple exon insertions, sequence alterations adversely affecting primer
binding, and complete deletion of one allele may not be identified using these
methods. For additional information or for help interpreting the results of
this test, please contact the
