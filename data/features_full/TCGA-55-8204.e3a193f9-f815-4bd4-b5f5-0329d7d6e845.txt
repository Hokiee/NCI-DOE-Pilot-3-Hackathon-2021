Clinical History
Left upper lobe lung cancer

Specimen

#1 Station 7 lymph node

#2 Station 7 lymph node #2

#3 4L lymph node

#4 4R lymph node

#5 Left upper lobe nodule

#6 Level 6 lymph node, left lung
#7 Level 10 lymph node, left lung

Gross Examination

#1 Received fresh labeled as station 7 lymph node is a portion of tan-brown
tissue measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm with no gross lesion, submitted in toto,
frozen section, one block.

#2 Received fresh labeled as station 7 lymph node #2 are two portions of
tan-black tissue measuring in aggregate 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm, submitted in toto,
frozen section, one block.

#3 Received fresh labeled as 4L lymph node are five portions of tan—black
tissue measuring in aggregate 1.1 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm, submitted in toto, frozen
section, one block.

#4 Received fresh labeled as 4R lymph node are two portions of tan—brown
tissue measuring in aggregate 0.8 x 0.5 X 0.2 cm, in toto, one cassette for
frozen.

#5 Received fresh for frozen section labeled left upper lobe wedge is a 10.6
x 7.2 x 3.0 cm lung wedge resection with red-purple, finely nodular pleura. The
pleura is focally retracted over an ill—defined 2.7 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm gray—brown,
firm mass. The mass abuts the overlying pleura (with central aforementioned
retraction) and is 0.9 cm from the closest stapled parenchymal margin. A’
representative section of the nodule and the closest staple margin are frozen
("SFSA and 5FSB" respectively).

The remainder of the parenchyma is soft, red, and spongy with prominent
emphysematous change. No additional mass lesions are identified. Representative

fresh tumor and normal parenchyma are procured for the Genome Study following
signed consent. Five sections are submitted in five: "A"—"E". Block summary:
"A", "B" mass with respect to pleura, perpendicular (pleura inked black); "C"

mass with respect to a ' renchyma; "D", "E' parenchyma with
emphysematous change.

#6 Labeled level 6 lymph node are two fragments of pink—tan to black tissue
that measure from 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm up to 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. In toto one
cassette.

#7 Labeled level 10 lymph node. There is a single fragment of pink-ta
black tissue that measures 1.7 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. In toto one cassette.

Frozen Section Diagnosis

#1 MEDIASTINAL LYMPH NODE, LEVEL 7, EXCISION (1 FS): NEGATIVE FOR
CARCINOMA.

#2 MEDIASTINAL LYMPH NODE, LEVEL 7 #2, EXCISION (1 FS): NEGATIVE FOR
CARCINOMA.

#3 MEDIASTINAL LYMPH NODE, 4L, EXCISION (1 FS): NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.
#4 MEDIASTINAL LYMPH NODE, 4R, EXCISION(1 FS) NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.
#5 LUNG, LEFT UPPER LOBE, NODULE, WEDGE RESECTION (2 FS) POORLY
DIFFERENTIATED

NON-SMALL CELL CARCINOMA. CLOSEST STAPLED MARGIN OF RESECTION NEGATIVE

CARCINOMA.
REPORTED TO DR.

Microscopic Examination

#1— #7 Microscopic examination performed. The tumor is poorly differentiated
with a background fibrous and inflamed stroma. Scattered lumens with clusters of
neutrophils are present. Immunohistochemical stains are performed on block "5B"
of the tumor and show the malignant cells are positive for TTF- l, CK7, and p63.
The malignant cells are negative for CK20. The overall morphologic and
immunohistochemical findings are most consistent with adenocarcinoma of primary
lung origin. Elastin stains performed on blocks "5A" and "5B" confirm the tumor
inv to the visceral pleural surface. Select slides are reviewed with Dr.
