Clinical History:
—year—old female with a pelvic mass.

Gross Description:
Received are two appropriately labeled containers.

Container A:

Adnexa: bilateral tubes and ovaries are present and detached
Weight: 380 grams

Shape: pear shaped

Dimensions:

height: 12.5 cm

anterior to posterior width: 7.4 cm

breadth at fundus: 7.3 cm

Serosa: tan/pink, smooth and glistening

Cervix: 2.5 x 2.4 x 1.5 cm

ectocervix: tan/white, smooth and glistening

endocervix: red/tan and trabeculated

length of endocervical canal: 2.1 cm

Endomyometrium:

length of endometrial cavity: 7.5 cm

width of endometrial cavity at fundus: 5.2 cm

tumor findings:

dimensions: 6.1 x 6.0 x 3.1 cm

appearance: The tumor is tan/white and solid with focal areas of
necrosis and hemorrhage.

location and extent: The tumor appears to involve the anterior
and posterior upper and mid corpus as well as the lower uterine
segment.

myometrial invasion: outer one—half

thickness of myometrial wall at deepest gross invasion: 1.8 cm
other findings or comments: There are three subserosal and
intramural tan/white firm rubbery nodules within the anterior
uterus ranging in largest diameter from 0.3 to 1.0 cm. The cut
surface of these nodules are tan/white and whorled in
appearance. In addition, there is an endometrial polyp within
the anterior lower uterine segment measuring 0.6 cm in diameter.
Adnexa:

Right ovary:

dimensions: 2.1 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm

external surface: tan/white and cerebriform

cut surface: unremarkable

Right fallopian tube:

dimensions: 5.2 cm in length, 1.0 cm in diameter

 

 

other findings: On the external surface is a yellow/tan raised
nodule measuring 0.1 cm in diameter. Sectioning of the tube
reveals a patent lumen. In addition, tubal ligation device is
present.

Left ovary:

dimensions: 2.2 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm

external surface: tan/pink and cerebriform

cut surface: unremarkable

Left fallopian tube:

dimensions: 4.5 cm in length, 0.7 cm in diameter

other findings: Tubal ligation devices are present; sectioning
of the tube reveals a patent lumen

Lymph nodes: n/a

Other comments: none

Digital photograph taken: not taken

Tissue submitted for special investigations: Tumor is given to
Tissue Procurement.

Block Summary:

A1 ~ anterior cervix

A2 - endometrial polyp from anterior lower uterine segment
A3 - additional section of anterior lower uterine segment
A4,A5 - anterior mid corpus, bisected

A6,A7 — anterior upper corpus/fundus

A8 - representative sections of subserosal nodules

A9 - posterior cervix

A10 — posterior lower uterine segment

A11,A12 — posterior mid corpus, bisected

A13,A14 posterior upper corpus/fundus, bisected

A15 — representative section of posterior intramural nodule
A16 — right ovary

A17 — right fallopian tube

A18 — left ovary

A19 — left fallopian tube

Container B is additionally labeled "omentum." It holds a
section of omentum measuring 17.1 x 7.1 x 0.9 cm. The omentum is
serially sectioned to reveal one mass measuring 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.7
cm. The mass is well circumscribed and tan/white and sectioning
reveals areas of necrosis. The remainder of tissue consists of
yellow/tan adipose tissue with no other masses or lesions
identified.

B1 — sections of mass
