Gross Description:
Specimen #1 is received in formalin, labeled gallbladder, and consists of an 8.5 x 3.5 x 1.4 cm intact gallbladder with attached pink
cystic duct exhibiting a 0.5 cm in diameter lumen. The serosa is gray-pink and smooth. Opening reveals approximately 15—20 cc of

amber viscous bile. The wall averages 0.1 cm. The mucosa is tan-red and velvety. No choleliths are identified. Representative
sections are submitted labeled 1A.

Specimen #2 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation, labeled right lobe of liver (tissue removal time ), and
consists of a 1,289-gram, 16 x 13.5 x 9.5 cm right lobe of liver exhibiting a focally retracted and nodular capsule associated with a
fool of adhesions. The resection margin is inked blue and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 9.1 x 9 x 6.8 cm lobulated
mass exhibiting a variegated yellow-tan to hemorrhagic (approximately 20%) cut surface. The mass comes to within 1.6 cm of the
blue inked resection margin. The above is related to the surgeon intraoperatively. The remaining parenchyma appears gross
unremarkable, exhibiting a homogeneous mahogany surface. Representative normal and tumor are triaged per a depth and
protocol. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

ZB: tumor to closest blue inked resection margin

20—2E: representative sections of tumor with blue inked capsular adhesions/calcificatlons and hemorrhage (after decalcification)
2F-2l: additional representative sections of variegated cut surface

2.]: representative sections of normal liver parenchyma

2K-20: periphery of tumor, question satellite lesions

2P-2T: Question vascular invasion of tumor.

Specimen #3 is received in formalin labeled section of diaphragm and consists of a 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm tan white tissue fragment
exhibiting a focally granular cut surface. The tissue is bisected and entirely submitted labeled 3A.

Specimen #4 is received is received fresh labeled segment of omentum and consists of a 10.0 x 7.5 x 1.8 cm lobulated portion of

omentum exhibiting focal cautery and erythema. Sectioning reveals no gross nodules. Representative sections are submitted
labeled 4A—4B.
