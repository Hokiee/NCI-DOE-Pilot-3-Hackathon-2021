Microscopic Description:

Sections demonstrate a moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates
both gray and white matter. The tumor is composed primarily of cells resembling
fibrillary astrocytes and to a lesser degree, gemistocytic astrocytes. In the much larger
specimen 2, gemistocytic astrocytes predominant, whereas fibrillary astrocytes
predominate in specimen 1. There is prominent prineuronal satellitosis. Atypia is mild to
moderate. Whereas there are generally only rare mitoses, up to three mitoses are seen in
10 high power fields. There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis.

Addendum Discussion:

The calculated MIB-l labeling index ranges up to 25.5% in the most proliferative regions
of tumor.

Addendum Diagnosis:

Frontal Brain Tumor, Anaplastic Astrocytoma, Gemistocytic (Who Grade 111).
MIB-l Labeling Index: 25.2%
