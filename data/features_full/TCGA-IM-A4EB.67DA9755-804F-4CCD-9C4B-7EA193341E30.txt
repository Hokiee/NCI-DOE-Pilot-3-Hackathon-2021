GROSS DESCRIPTION: (Continued)

tan, solid and firm nodule with papillary appearance, 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm. The nodule
involves the mid portion and lower lobe and extends up to but not through the
black-inked surface. It is 0.5 cm from the isthmus surgical margin. The thyroid
parenchyma toward the upper lobe is red-brown and unremarkable. No other lesions are
grossly identified. Sections are submitted as follows:

Cassettes #1&2: Upper pole
Cassettes #3—11: Mid portion with nodule (#3—10 — compOSite section)
Cassettes #12~14: Sections from lower pole in relation with isthmus surgical
margin
D. Received in formalin and labeled "Prelaryngeal tissue" are three irregular~shaped,

yellow—tan fibroadipose tissue fragments, 3.0 x 2.5 x 0.8 cm in aggregate. No lymph
nodes are grossly identified. Representative sections are submitted in three
cassettes.

E. Received in formalin and labeled "Left lobe thyroid“ is a left thyroid, weighing 7.4
grams and measuring 4.0 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm. The isthmus surgical resection margin is inked
yellow. The remainder of the surface is inked black. No parathyroid gland is grossly
identified. The specimen is serially sectioned from upper to lower pole, revealing an
ill—circumscribed, pale tan area located at the mid portion, 0.5 cm in greatest
dimension. The remainder of the thyroid parenchyma is red—brown and unremarkable. No
other lesions are grossly identified. Submitted in toto as follows:

Cassettes #l&2: Upper pole
Cassettes #3—7: Mid portion (#5—7 — pale tan area in toto)
Cassettes #8—10: Lower pole in toto
F. Received in formalin and labeled "Suspicious lymph node at midline" is a gray—tan
lymph node, 0.8 x 0.8 X 0.3 cm. The specimen is bisected and submitted in toto in one
cassette.
G. Received in formalin and labeled "Right central compartment" is an irregular-shaped,

yellowMtan fibroadipose tissue fragment, 4.0 X 2.5 x 0.8 Cm. Examination of the
specimen reveals nine possible lymph nodes, from 0.3 cm to 0.7 cm in greatest
dimension. The lymph nodes are submitted in toto as follows:

Cassettes #l-S: One lymph node bisected per cassette
Cassette #6: Four possible lymph nodes in toto
H. Received fresh and labeled ”Rule out parathyroid" is a small fragment of pink~tan soft
