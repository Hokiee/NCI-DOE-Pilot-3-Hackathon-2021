Gross Description:

1). lbs specimen is received fresh. labeled "tell kidney“ and consists of a kidney with attached ureter. renal vessels and
perinephrlo fat weighing 648 g in total. The kidney measures 14.5 x 8.5 x 8 cm. The attached ureter measures 4.5 cm in length
and 0.5 cm in diameter. The attached renal vein measures 0.5 cm in length and 0.7 can in diameter. The renal vessels and
ureter margins are grossly unremarkable. An adrenal gland is identified, measuring 4.5 x 3.5 x 1 cm. The kidney is inked black
and bivalved to reveal 9.5 X '15 X 5 cm yellow -- white relatively well-circumsoribed tumor occupying the upper pole of the
specimen and extending into perinephrlc fat. The tumor shows multitacei areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. Sections through
the remainder of the kidney reveal a pink—brown parenchyma, with a well—defined cortico—ntedullary junction. The cortex measures
1.3 cm and the calyces appear normal. Few lymph nodes are identiﬁed in the perinepbric fat. Representative sections are
submitted for TPS and for permanent sections.

Summary of sections:

UVM -- ureteral and vessel margins

LN- lymph nodes

T-— tumor

THF-- tumor with hiiar fat

TK -- tumor with adjacent kidney

RP -- renal pelvis representative sections

K ~- representative sections kidney

AD -~ adrenal gland

2).The specimen is received in formalin labeled. "para-aortic lymph nodes", and consists of a single piece of yellow —- gold and red
ten soft tissue measuring 6.5 x 2 x 1.8 cm. Multiple lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging in size from 0.3 to 1 cm in greatasl
dimension and are submitted.

3).The specimen is received in formalin labeled, "suprahilar para-aortic tissue". and consists of e slngie piece of red tan soft tissue

measuring 1.2 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm. Entirely submitted.
