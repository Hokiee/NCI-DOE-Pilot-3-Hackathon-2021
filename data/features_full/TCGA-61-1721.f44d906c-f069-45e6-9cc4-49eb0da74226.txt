COMMENT:

The tumor cells demonstrate relatively uniform population with moderate cytologic atypia and up to 5 mitoses per 10 high
power fields. Therefore, it is considered a low grade lesion (please refer to the reference articles). Approximately 20% of
tumor cells show p53 nuclear positivity, further supporting the iow grade nature of the lesion. Modest fibrosis and

scattered apoptotic bodies are seen, while no tumor necrosis or foam cell aggregate is identiﬁed, indicating minimal
response (< 5%) to chemotherapy.

Both ovaries are involved by multiple large nodules of carcinoma. No Intrae itheliai or invasive carcinoma is identified in
the fallopian tubes. Based on the criteria proposed by the—, the tumor is considered

ovarian primary.

Previous excisional biopsy of the umbilical stalk revealed the involvement of skin
the tumor is regarded as stage IV.

Tissue findings correlate with pelvic wash which Is positive for adenocarcinoma I
