PROCEDURE:

DPER DATE: RED DOC:
VERIFIED BY:

year-old male Iwith difficulty swallowing, positive esophageal carcinoma.
Esophageal cancer. Transhiatal esophagectomy.

VERIFIED BY:

1. ”Thoracic esophagus". A 9.5 cm length of esophagus in continuity with a 9.0
x 2.0 cm proximal stomach. Located 5.0 cm from the proximal margin and 2.0 cm
from the distal margin is a 5.5 x 4.0 cm polypoid mesa. sectioning reveals the
mass penetrates to a depth of 1.0 cm and distorts the exterior of the
specimen. The mass extends across the GE junction and into the proximal
stomach. The mucosa extending for s cm proximal to the GE junction is a band
of salmon colored moose. The proximal most 2 cm of esophageal mucosa is pink.
wrinkled and unremarkable. Several lymph nodes are identified in the
periesophegeal adipose tissue, the largest firm, white and 1.5 cm.

1A-c, 10-F. Cross section through lesion to include distal margin inked blue,
each trisected. <1ss each). Deepest point of invasion in 1a and is.

16. Proximal esophagus inked blue incontinuity with salmon colored moose.

111. Largest lymph node bisected.

11. Possible lymph nodes.

1.1. Possible lymph nodes.

2. ”#8 periesophageal in”. A 1.7 x 1.1 x 1.0 cm black lyrrph node. Cut surfaces
reveal a black lymph node expanded by uniform, white tissue. .

3. "Cervical esophageal margin". A 2.2 cm length of tubular esophagus 2.0 cm
in diameter. The shave margin imediately subjacent to the staple line is

submitted in one cassette. IC‘D'O' 3

ACCESSION: OPER DATE: REC DOC:

Pattern of invasion: infiltrative

Esophageal and gastric resection margins involved: No
Deep resection margin involved: No

rim classification: T3N1Mx

PROCEDURE: VERIFIED BY:

1. Distal esophagus and proximal stomach, transhiatal esophagectomy:

Invasive

adenocarcinoma arising in the background of Barrett's mucosa. The neoplasm
invades through the esophageal wall to the adventiti a and closely approximates
the inked soft tissue margin. Distal, gastric margins negative for neoplasm.

Three esophageal lymph nodes positive for carcinoma. See template.

2. "#8 periesophageal lymph node”, excision: Positive for adenocarcinoma.

3. Esophagus, cervical margin: Negative for neoplasm.
