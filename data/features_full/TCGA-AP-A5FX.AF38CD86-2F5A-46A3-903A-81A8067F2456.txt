Specimens Submitted.

1: SP: Uterus. cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries
2: SP: Right external iliac lymph nodes
3: SP
4:

5.

: Right obturator lymph nodes
SP: Left external iliac lymph nodes
' SP: Omentum

DIAGNOSIS:
1. SP: Uterus, cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries:
Tumor Type:

High grade carcinoma, see note
Architectural Grade (For Endometrioid Types only):
III (>50% solid growth)
Nuclear Grade (For Endometrioid Types only):
Grade 3
FIGO Grade (For Endometrioid Types only):
Grade 3
Myometrial Invasion:
(>50%)
MeasuresZSmm in maximum depth
Myometrium thickness measures26mm in the area of maximal tumor
invasion
Tumor extends to the subserosal surface.
Endocervioal Invasion:

NOTE: MORPHOLOGICALLY THE TUMOR SHOWS FEATURES OF BOTH SEROUS AND HIGH GRADE
ENDOMETRIOID CARCINOMA. THE SLIDES FROM THE PREVIOUS CURETTAGE

ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW. THEY SHOWED A HIGH GRADE CARCINOMA THAT
REPORTEDLY STAINED FOR ER, PR, CK7, AND P53 CONSISTENT WITH A SEROUS
CARCINOMA. IMMUNOSTAINS PERFORMED ON THE CURRENT CASE SHOW THE TUMOR CELLS
ARE DIFFUSELY POSITIVE FOR P16, WEAK AND FOCAL POSITIVE FOR P53 AND MODERATE
TO STRONGLY POSITIVE FOR ER. CASE DISCUSSED AT CONSENSUS CONFERENCE.

2. LYMPH NODES, RIGHT EXTERNAL ILIAC; REGIONAL RESECTION:

- METASTATIC ADBNOCARCINOMA INVOLVING TWO OF TWO LYMPE NODES (2/2).
3. LYMPH NODE, RIGHT OBTURATOR: BIOPSY:

-METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA INVOLVING ONE OF ONE LYMPH NODE (1/1).
4. LYMPH NODE, LEFT EXTERNAL ILIAC; BIOPSY:

- METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA INVOLVING ONE OF ONE LYMPH NUDE (1/1).

OMENTUM; RESECTION:

-BENIGN OMENTUM.

5.

Some of the immunohistochemietry and ISH tests were developed and their
performance characteristics were determined by the Department of Pathology.
They have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is
not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not
be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified
under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA ' 88) as
qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL). AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED

THIS REPORT.
