COMMENT:
Immunohlslochemlcal staining for vlmenlin and cytolreralln, CAM 5.2. support the above diagnosis. The metastatic
tumor In mainly composed of sarcomatouo component of the malignant mixed mullerlan tumor. Selected slide of this
case was also reviewed by Dr. , who concurs with the above diagnosls. This ondometrlal cancer
represent a malignant mixed muiiarlan tumor. FIGO stage ac. Peritoneal cytology“ ls negative.
Correlated with previous surglcal specimen”.
