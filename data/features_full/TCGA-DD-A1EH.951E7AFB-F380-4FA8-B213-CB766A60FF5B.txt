REVISED REPORT (Addendum/Procedure included)

TISSUE DESCRIPTION:
Al A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 B1 C1 D1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7 D8
Right lobe liver (1035 grams, 22.7 x 13.8 x 10.6 cm), tissue
from the left portal vein (thrombus, 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm),
gallbladder (9.2 x 3.1 x 1.3 cm) and peri—choledochal lymph
nodes (together measuring 4.1 x 2.0 x 1.3 cm).

DIAGNOSIS: V/
Liver, right lobe, resection: Grade 3 (of 4) hepatocellular
carcinoma is identified forming a multinodular mass (15.3 x
13.2 x 7.6 cm) associated with vascular invasion. There are
multiple (7) satellite nodules ranging in size from 0.3 cm to
2.7 cm in greatest dimension. Tumor extends to within 0.1 cm of
the surgical resection margin. Tumor thrombus is also present
within the vein but the vessel margin is negative. Embolic
material and coils also identified. Assessment of nonneoplastic
liver to be reported in an addendum.

Soft tissue, left portal vein, excision: Positive for
hepatocellular carcinoma.

Gallbladder, cholecystectomy: Without diagnostic abnormality.
Negative for malignancy.

Lymph nodes, peri-choledochal, excision: Multiple (6)
peri-choledochal lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

ADDENDUM:
Non-neoplastic liver shows inactive chronic hepatitis with

bridging fibrosis (stage 3), consistent with the patient's known
history of chronic hepatitis B.
