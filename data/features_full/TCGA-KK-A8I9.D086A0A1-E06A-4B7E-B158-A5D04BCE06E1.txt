DIAGNOSIS

(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:

PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA. GLEASON SCORE 8 (4+4). (SEE COMMENT)

EXTRAPROSTATIC EXTENSION PRESENT.

FOCAL EXTENSION OF TUMOR TO THE CAUTERIZED MARGIN OF RESECTION CANNOT BE UNEQUIVOCALLY
EXCLUDED. '

Right and left seminal vesicles, no tumor present.

Segments Of right and left vasa deferentia, no tumor present.

PERINEURAL AND LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION PRESENT.

COMMENT

The prostate gland contains two foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, one in the peripheral zone and one in the transition zone. The
dominant tumor focus is located in the right lateral, right posterolateral, right posterior, mid posterior and left posterior peripheral
zone. This tumor focus measures 2.5 x 2.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the single cross
section of the prostate and extensively in the apex and base. The tumor exhibits extensive extraprostatic extension in the right
posterolateral Surface of the prostate and right superior neurovascular bundle region. The added length of extraprostatic extension
is 18.5 mm. On the right base, focal extension of tumor to the cauterized margin cannot be unequivocally excluded. The second
tumor focus is located in the left transition zone. This tumor focus measures 0.8 x 0.3 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension
and it is present in the single cross section of the prostate, focally in the apex and extensively in the base. This tumor focus is of
lower histologic grade and conﬁned to the prostate with negative margins.

GROSS: DESCRIFTION

(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES — A specimen consisting Of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (5.1 x 3.1 x 3.9 cm, 28.0 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
posterolateral aspects of the prostate is abundant and symmetrical. A nodule is palpated on the right side of the prostate. Serial
cross-sections after fixation demonstrate an area consistent with tumor in the right side of the single cross-section of the prostate.

The seminal vesicles and segments Of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

SECTION CODE: A1—A4, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; A5-A7,
left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; A8, prostatic base, right border; A9-A12,
prostatic base. right posterior border; A13—A20, prostatic base, central portion; A21, prostatic base, left border; A22-A24
prostatic base, left posterior border; A25-A26, apex anterior; A27-A28, apex left; A29-A31, apex posterior; A32-A33, apex right;
A34-A37, sections of the single cross-section of the prostate according to the specimen radiograph.

The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in
