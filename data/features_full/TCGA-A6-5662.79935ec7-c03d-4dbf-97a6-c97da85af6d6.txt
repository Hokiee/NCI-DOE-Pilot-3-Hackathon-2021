SPECIMEN
Splenic flexure please send for K—ras

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Left colon cancer.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
Received fresh labeled "splenic flexure" is a previously
unopened, 15 cm. segment of colon surfaced by smooth,
glistening tan—pink serosa with a moderate amount of attached
mesocolon. The undesignated margins average 4.6 cm. in
circumference. Central palpale mesenteric mass is noted and the
overlying surface is inked blue. On opening, there is a central,
3.8 x 3.4 cm. rubbery tan white—pink tumor mass which is
equadistantly located 7.5 cm from each of the undesignated margins.
On sectioning, the tumor has a maximal thickness of 2 cm. grossly
extending into the muscularis to within 0.4 cm. of the inked free
radial serosal suface. A portion of tumor and a portion of normal
mucosa are submitted for tissue procurement as requested. No
additional mass lesion or abnormality is identified. The
aforementioned mesenteric mass measures 2.7 cm in greatest
dimension
with glistening tan—white cut surfaces and appears contigous with
the aforementioned mucosal tumor, spanning an overall depth of 3.2
cm. and focally extending to within 0.1 cm. of the inked free
radial
serosal surface (see contiguous sections blocks 5 and 6). The
remaining mucosa is unremarable glistening tan pink with regular
folds and the wall averages 0.5 cm. in thickness. A few soft to
rubbery tan white—pink tissues in keeping with lymph nodes
measuring
up to 2 cm. in greatest dimension are recovered from the attached
mesocolon. Representative sections are submitted in 15 blocks as
labeled. RS—15.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Proximal and distal margins; 2—6 tumor full
thickness to inked free radial serosal surface (cassettes 5 and 6
represent tumor to mesenteric mass with point of continuity inked
green); 7 — random colon; 8 — three whole lymph nodes; 9—12 — one
bisected lymph node per cassette; 13—15 — additional ocolon (in
lieu of minimal number of nodes normally required).

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma
Histologic grade: Moderate to poorly differentiated
Primary tumor (pT): Extends to the muscularis propria and into
pericolonic tissue (pT3)
Proximal margin: Uninvolved
Distal margin: Uninvolved
Circumferential (radial) margin: Close
Vascular invasion: Present
Regional lymph nodes (pN): Metastatic carcinoma is present in 7 of
13 pericolonic lymph nodes (pN2).
Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: Extensive
Distant metastasis (pM): Could not be evaluated by this specimen
(PMX)
Other findings: None
