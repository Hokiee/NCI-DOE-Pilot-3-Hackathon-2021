INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:

A-left colon: Tumor mass is 9 cm away from the distal margin, called byâ€”

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. LEFT COLON
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "left colon" is a 24 cm segment of colon with
circumference of 7.5 cm with a suture designating the distal margin. The serosa is unremarkable. The
mesocolon and serosa, subjacent to the mass, is inked black. A 9 x 6.5 x 3cm circumferential, polypoid,
indurated, necrotic mass is present, 9 cm from the distal margin, involving the subserosal fat. Proximal
mucosa has diverticuli and 3 polyps, 0.2 cm, 0.3 cm, and 0.5 cm. A gross assessment is conveyed to O.
R., a photograph is taken, and tissue is procured. Representatively submitted:
A1: shave of proximal margin
A2: shave of distal margin
A3-A8: mass
A9: possible diverticuli
A10: polyps
A11: normal appearing mucosa extending into flattened mucosa
A12-A13: proximal, 6 possible lymph nodes in each cassette
A14: proximal, 1 lymph node
A15-A16: distal, 6 possible lymph nodes in each cassette
A17: distal, 4 lymph nodes

DIAGNOSIS:
COLON, LEFT, RESECTION:
- INVASIVE MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA, MODERATELY
DIFFERENTIATED, ARISING IN A TUBULOVILLOUS ADENOMA.
- TUMOR MEASURES 9 X 6.5 X 3 CM.
- TUMOR INVOLVES THE SUBSEROSA.
- MARGINS, FREE OF TUMOR.
- METASTASTIC CARCINOMA IN TWO OF 26 LYMPH NODES (2/26).
- TWO TUBULAR ADENOMAS.
- DIVERTICULOSIS.

NOTE: On slide A3, mucin with fibrosis and marked inflammation is seen at an inked radial aspect that
is fragmented. Tumor is not definitely identified at the radial margin. Dr. concurs. Clinical-surgical
correlation is recommended.
