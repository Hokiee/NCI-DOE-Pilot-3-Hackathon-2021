2. The specimen container labeled with the patients name and as “uterus, cervix, bilateral adnexa‘ contains a uterus with
cervix. bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes received in 10% buffered formalin. The specimen weighs 249.2 g. The uterus
with the cervix measures 9.4 cm Si x 7.4 cm ML x 6.0 cm AP. The uterine serosa has hemorrhagic, ﬁbromembranous
adhesions. The endomelrlal cavity measures 5.7 cm in length, 4.0 cm comu to comu. There is a tumor mass occupying
the entire endomelriai cavity measuring 5.0 cm Si x 4.0 cm ML x 3.5 cm AP. The tumor is ten, softto solid and extends
from the fundus to the lower uterine segment it extends superficially into the myometrium and it is at least 2 cm away
from the serosal surface. The myometrium, ﬁrm, pink-tan, with fecal hemonhage measuring 1.5 x 1 x 1 cm. The cervix
measures 3.1 cm ML x 3.0 cm AP. The exocervix is smooth and slightly hemorrhagic, more so anterioriy. The external
cervical 05 is slit shaped and measures 0.9 cm. The endocervix has a 0.3 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm anterior cervical canal polyp and
a 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm posterior cervical canal polyp. Both polyps are approximately 1 cm from the lower uterine segment
tumor. The right ovary measures 1 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm. it is solid with some hemorrhagic, membranous adhesions on the
surface and locally hemorrhagic on cut surface The left ovary is not grossly identiﬁed. Right adnexal tissue with query
ovarian tissue present measures 2.7 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm. The right ﬁmbriated fallopian tube measures. 7.5 cm in length and 0.6
cm in diameter and is grossly unremarkable. The left ﬁmbriated fallopian tube measures 7.2 cm in length and 0.5 cm in
diameter and is grossly unremarkable.

Sections of the right ovary, right and leﬂ fallopian tubes and endometrlal tumor are stored frozen.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

2A, 28, right ovary in into.

20, 20, left adnexal tissue query-ovary.

2E. 2F right fallopian tube, in toto (2F—longitudinally bisected ﬁmbria.)

ZG, 2H. let! fallopian tube. in toto (ZH—longltudinally bisected fimbria.)

2l-2K sagittal anterior cervix (2l- with small cervical canal polyp)

2L, 2M sagittai anterior lower uterine segment

2N, 20 sagittal posterior cervix with cervical anal polyp in toto.

2P saglttal posterior lower uterine segment

20, 2R full thickness anterior endomyometrium corpus. section bisected.

28 full thickness anterior endomyometrium fundus. section bisected.

2T uterine wall with focal hemorrhagic myometrium and serosal adhesions

2U. 2V full thickness posterior endomyometrium, section bisected.

2W posterior endomyometrium with tumor.

3. The specimen container labeled with the patient's name and as “right pelvic lymph nodes' contains one piece(s) of fatty
tissue measuring 6.5 x 4 x 1.7 cm received in 10% buffered formalin. Multiple lymph node(s) are identiﬁed measuring
from 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2. cm to 2.8 x 1.3 x 0.6 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted as follows:

3A-30 one lymph node'bisected each block.

30-3F multiple lymph nodes each block.

36 representative fatty tissue

4. The specimen container labeled with the patients name and as 'right common iliac node' contains one piece(s) of fatty
tissue measuring 3.8 x 1.7 x 1.3 cm received in 10% buffered formalin. One lymph node(s) is identiﬁed measuring 2.8 x
1.4 x 1.0 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted in toto as follows:

4A-4C one lymph node sectioned.

4D the remaining fatty tissue.

5. The specimen container labeled with the patients name and as 'Ieft pelvic lymph node' contains two plece(s) of fatty
tissue measuring 2.5 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm and 3.8 x 2 x 1.2 cm received in 10% buffered fonnalln. Three lymph node(s) are
identified measuring from 0.8 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm to 1.8 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted as follows:
5A two lymph nodes.

SB, one lymph node bisected

50 4 nodes.

6. The specimen container labeled with the patients name and as “left para-aortic lymph node' contains two piece(s) of
fatty tissue measuring approximately 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm each received in 10% buffered forrnalln. Three lymph node(s) are
identiﬁed measuring from 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm to 1.3 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted in ioto as
follows:

6A two lymph nodes.

28 one lymph node bisected
