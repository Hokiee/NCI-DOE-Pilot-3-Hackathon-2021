GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Brain tumor (AFl: AFZI"; received fresh for frozen section. A 1.0 x 0.8 x
0.4 cm aggregate of soft white—tan tissue was entirely received for frozen
sectioning. A fragment of the tissue was submitted as frozen sectioning AFl
and the frozen section remnant is submitted in toto in a mesh bag in block

Al. Two more tissue fragments were submitted for frozen sectioning AFZ and
the frozen section remnant are submitted in toto in a mesh bag in block A2.
The remainder of the tissue is submitted in toto in a mesh bag in block A3.

B. "Brain tumor (BF1)", received fresh for frozen sectioning. A 1.5 x 1.0 x
0.3 cm aggregate of soft white~tan tissue was received for frozen

sectioning. A fragment of the tissue was submitted for frozen sectioning in
BFl and the frozen section remnant is submitted in toto in a mesh bag in block

B1. The remainder of the tissue is submitted in toto in a mesh bag in block
B2.

C. "Brain tumor". received fresh and placed in formalin. An 11.5 x 7.5 x 1.0

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:

A. "Brain tumor": AFl—AFZ — hypercellular brain
B. "Brain tumor ?" BFi— glioma

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: .

Specimen in container A labeled "brain tumor AFl, AFZ", in container B labeled
"brain tumor BFl", and in container C labeled "brain tumor" consists of brain
tissue which is infiltrated and replaced by a population of anaplastic
astrocytes. The cells are very pleomorphic and tumor giant cells are seen in
many areas. Mitotic figures including abnormal mitoses ara'présént.
Endothelial proliferation is focally seen but necrosis is not identified.
