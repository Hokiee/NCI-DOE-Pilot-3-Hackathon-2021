The specimen labeled with the patients name and as 'Thyrold: Total thyroid, level 6 neck dissection, stitch marks right superior
pole“ consists of a thyroid gland that is oriented with a stitch and weighs 14.5 g. The right lobe measures 4.5 cm Si x 2.4 cm ML x
1.2 cm AP, the ieﬂ lobe measures 4.0 cm Sl x 2.4 cm MLx 1.7 cm AP and the isthmus measures 4.6 cm Sl x1.4 cm ML x 0.6 cm
AP. The external surfaces have ﬁbrous adhesions and are painted with silver nitrate. No parathyroid glands or lymph nodes are
dentiﬁed grossly. No central compartment is identified. The upper left lobe contains a well delineated nodule that measures 2.0
:m SI x 1.8 cm ML x 1.4 cm AP. The remainder of the thyroid tissue is grossly unremarkable. Sections of left lobe nodule and
iormsi tissue are stored frozen. The remainder of the specimen is submitted as follows: .

iA-E right lobe. superior to inferior

1F-G isthmus

1H-N left lobe. superior to inferior
