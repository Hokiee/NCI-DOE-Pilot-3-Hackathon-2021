My si—tation that I have personally reviewed the
submitted

material(s) and the final diagnosis reflects that evaluation.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in 5 parts.

Part 1 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx
and

"right supraglottic lesion". Received are 2, irregular, soft to
rubbery, tan,

tissue biopsies each measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. A touch prep is
performed
with an intraoperative diagnosis completed. The specimen is entirely
submitted
for processing in a cassette labeled 1A.
Part 2 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx
and
"right zone ZB node". Received is a single, tan, oval, soft to
rubbery, lymph
node measuring 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is inked, bisected and
entirely submitted for processing in a cassette labeled 2A.
Part 3 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx
and
"right neck level 2, 3, and 4". Received is an irregular unoriented 13
x 4.5
x 1.3 cm right selective neck dissection, presumably lymph node levels
2
through 4 without an orienting suture. Neck dissection is divided
equally
into 3 segments. The measurements for the lymph node—containing soft
tissue
levels are as follows: Level A—4.2 X 3.5 X 1.5 cm, level B— 4.3 x 4 x
1.0 cm,
and level C— 4 x 3.2 x 1.5 cm. Multiple lymph nodes, ranging from 0.2
to 2.0
cm in greatest dimension are identified. Several of the larger lymph
nodes
appear to be tumor involved and are present in greater numbers within
level A.

Lymph nodes are entirely submitted in cassettes labeled:
3A — level A — six possible lymph nodes
33 — level A—six possible lymph nodes
3C — level A —single bisected lymph node
3D — level A single bisected lymph node
3E — level B— seven possible lymph nodes
3F — level C—9 possible lymph nodes
Part 4 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx
and
"left neck level 2, 3 and 4". Received is an irregular unoriented 11.5
x 6 x
1.2 cm left selective neck dissection, presumably lymph node levels 2
through
4 without an orienting suture. Neck dissection is divided equally into
3
segments. The measurements for the lymph node—containing soft tissue
levels
are as follows: Level A—4.3 X 3.5 X 1.25 cm, level B— 5.5 x 3.1 x 0.8
cm, and
level C— 4 x 3 x 1.2 cm. Multiple lymph nodes, ranging from 0.2 to 2.0
cm in
greatest dimension are identified. Several of the larger lymph nodes
appear
to be tumor involved and are present in greater numbers within level A.
Lymph nodes are entirely submitted in cassettes labeled:
4A — level A — four possible lymph nodes
43 — level A— single possible lymph node
4C level B— seven lymph node

4D level B — one lymph node

4E — level C— eight possible lymph nodes

4F — level C—three possible lymph nodes

Part 5 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xx
and

"larynx". The specimen consists of total laryngectomy measuring 8.5
cm

(superior to inferior), by 4.2 cm (anterior to posterior), by 5.8 cm
(width)

when reconstructed. The specimen includes the hyoid bone which is
removed.

The hyoid bone measures 8.2 cm in length by 0.3 x 0.3 cm in greatest
dimension. One tracheal ring is identified. There is a supraglottic
irregular exophytic ulcerated mass measuring at least 2.8 x 2.2 cm in
maximal

dimension. The tumor is centered at the level of the supraglotttis and
more

prominent and cavitary toward the right side. The tumor appears to
compress/invade the right and left false vocal cords as well as the
anterior

pyriform sinus. The tumor is grossly located at 1.3 cm from the right
arytenoid mucosal margin, 1.8 cm from the left arytenoid margin, 3.0 cm
from

the epiglottic margin and at 3.2 cm from the jugular margin (inferior).
The

anterior soft tissue margin appears intact and no gross lesion is
identified.

Upon sectioning the tumor measures 4.8 cm superior to inferior by 3.2
cm

anterior to posterior, by 4.5 cm in width. It involves the pre—
epiglottic

space, paraglottic space and anterior soft tissue. The tumor appears
to

superficially invade the thyroid cartilage as well as epiglottic
cartilage.

The anterior soft tissue margin including muscle and fibroadipose
tissue

appears uninvolved by tumor. The right thyroid lobe is identified
measuring

3.2 x 2.5 x 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. No parathyroid tissue is
identified. On section no discrete, well circumscribed or ill defined
lesions

en. A section of the tumor was selected and - -

red and banked. The specimen is submitted in fourteen cassettes
as
follows:
5A epiglottic margin, perpendicular
5B tracheal (deep) margin, shaved
5C right arytenoid margin, perpendicular
5D left arytenoid margin, perpendicular
5E right anterior soft tissue margin (area inked blue is not a
margin)
5F tumor and thyroid cartilage right side
5G supraglottic tumor area right side
5H — ventricle tumor area right side
5I anterior soft tissue margin left side

5J tumor and epiglottic cartilage

5K ventricle tumor area left side

5L tumor and thyroid cartilage left side

5M 5N representative section of thyroid gland.

On Part 5 cassettes A, B, F, H, J and L will be placed in decalcifying
1 ion.
