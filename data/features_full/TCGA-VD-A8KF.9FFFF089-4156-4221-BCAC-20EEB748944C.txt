MICROSCOPY

Sections show a non-pigmented ciliochoroidal melanoma - -‘
associated with exudative retinal detachment. The tumour 3
consists of a mixed cell population in which the epithelioid
cell component amounts up to 80%. Tumour cells express
Melan-A and HSP 27 (score 2).

The number of mitosis is high, approximately 16/40 high
power fields. The microvasculature of the melanoma is

prominent, and closed loops are present in the planes of
section. The lymphocytic infiltrate within the tumour is
minimal. Tumour necrosis is not seen. There is focal tumour
extension into the sclera. Optic nerve and vortex veins
examined show no evidence of tumour involvement. There is no
convincing evidence of ring pattern of spread. Tumour cells
are not seen at the resection margins.

Elsewhere, the cornea shows no significant abnormality. The
anterior chamber angles are open and the anterior chamber is
deep. The iris appears uninvolved. The lens shows
subcapsular degenerative changes. Retina overlying the
tumour is slightly atrophic and Bruch's membrane appears
intact in the sections examined.

DIAGNOSIS
Right enucleation — Ciliochoroidal melanoma of mixed cell

type .

COMMENT

In the meantime, molecular genetic analysis of tumour DNA
extracted from fresh uveal melanoma tissue was performed ' -
using the technique termed multiplex ligation-dependent -;.::-f--Ii'.“:i.’.-‘:
probe amplification (MLPA) . These investigations were
performed in the ‘

The kit P027 from which examines for gains or
losses in 31 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and B, was used.
The DNA concentration was measured using : and the
quality assessed using multiplex-POE prior to the MLPA
reaction.

i

i—_..._....—__..._.. _......_.. .a... . . . .v

The DNA concentration was high and of good quality on
assessment. The MLPA reaction was run at least twice on
differing occasions, resulting in similar results.

The results of the sequence analysis of the MLPA products is .
printed on a separate report. In summary, sequence analysis ,
demonstrated :

normal chromosome 1,
monosomy 3,

normal chromosome 6p

and gains of chromosome 8q.

These molecular data require correlation with the clinical
and morphological data for metastatic risk assessment.

SUPPLWTARY REPORT " , '_',.L—'

On request of the treating clinicians, BRA]? testing of the ';
primary tumour was performed. The sample was analysed for 3
sans vsnnm anne mutation using the . BRAF RGO PCR kit I
on a PCR cycler.

The DNA was of sufficient quality: there was no V6003 |
