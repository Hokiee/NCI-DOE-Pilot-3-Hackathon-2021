Specimen(s) Received

A:Subcutaneous mass
BzLeft kidney (fresh)

Clinical History
The patient is an female with a left kidney mass which is solid and cystic in the left upper
pole. This lesion is greater than S cm. Additionally, there is a second lesion in the interpolar region.

The ‘ has a 2.4 cm lesion in the liver. She now undergoes a left laparoscopic nephrectomy
(

Gross Description

The specimen is received fresh in two parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record
number.

Part A, additionally labeled ”subcutaneous mass,” consists of three fragments of white and yellow soft

tissue measuring 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm in aggregate. These fragments are entirely submitted in cassette
A1.

Part B, additionally labeled "left kidney," consists of a 236 gram, 14 x 6 x 6 cm kidney with a small
amount of perinephric fat. The superior pole has a 4.6 cm, red to yellow salt mass with solid and
liqueﬁed areas within 0.3 cm of the pelvis and abutting the renal capsule over much of the tumor. The
tumor is suspicious for invasion into the renal capsule grossly. Additionally a second lesion is identiﬁed
in the interpolar region of the kidney, which is entirely contained in the cortex and does not appear to
invade. This lesion is composed of a cyst-like space measuring 2.4 cm. Cassettes are submitted as
follows:

Cassette Bl: Pelvic margin vessels and ureter.

Cassette BZ: Pelvis with red to yellow mass.

Cassette B3: Cystic lesion to pelvis.

Cassette B4: Normal pelvis.

Cassette 85: Parenchyma with vessels.

Cassettes 36-88: Tumor with capsule.

Cassettes 39-810: Extrarenal soft tissue.

Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. Final diagnosis made by attending pathologist
following review of all pathology slides.
