------------------------------------------------------------ Page 2 of 3

1) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled I'Secondary nodule right

medial thigh' and consists of unoriented, irregular fragment of fibroadipose
tissue measuring 2.6 x 1.8 x 1.7 cm. The specimen is inked black and
serially sectioned to reveal a tan-brown. ovoid, fleshy nodule measuring 0.9

x 0.6 x 0.6 cm that abuts the inked edge. The entire specimen is submitted.
Photographs are taken.

Summary of sections:

PET—full face of nodule submitted in one cassette
MM-perpendicular sections of nodule to closest margin
Rs-remaining specimen

2) The specimen is received in formalin. labeled llDistal margin right thigh
stitch marks true distal' and consists of a piece of red-brown. ragged
skeletal muscle measuring 4.1 x 3.4 x 1.5 cm. A stitch at one edge of the
specimen marks the true distal margin of excision. which is inked black. The
tissue is serially sectioned and entirely submitted. Photographs are taken.

Summary of sections:
35 - sequential sections

3) The specimen is received fresh, labeled 'Right thigh myxotibrossrcoma.
black stitch -- proximal margin, white stitch —- lateral margin, skin
superiicial'l and consists of an oriented, 26.9 x 16.9 x 1.2 cm soft tissue
mass, with partially overlying, 26.9 x 3.1 x 0.1 cm smooth, focally scarred,
tan—white skin ellipse. The specimen is oriented as follows: black stitch
-— proximal margin, white stitch —- lateral margin, and skin superficial.
The specimen is inked as follows: proximal yellow, distal -- orange,
lateral -- green, medial blue, deep black, and superficial -— skin. The
specimen is bivalved to reveal a 17.2 cm (proximal to distal) x 11.9 cm
(medial to lateral) x 10.0 cm (anterior posterior). poorly defined, soft to
rubbery, diffusely bulging, tau-yellow gelatinous mass with roughly 30%
necrosis (proximal aspect). The mass is grossly adherent to the fascia of
the surrounding muscle, and does not involve the overlying skin. The mass
is located 0.2 cm from the closest deep margin, 0.9 cm from the proximal
margin, 3.7 cm from the distal margin, 0.6 cm from the lateral margin. and
2.5 cm from the medial margin. A portion of tumor and normal tissue is
submitted to TPB. The remaining specimen is representatively submitted for
permanent. Photographs are taken.

Summary of sections:

M mass -- sequential sections of greatest dimension of mass, from proximal
to distal
PRM -- proximal margin

DIN —- distal margin

MM medial margin

Lu lateral margin

AM -— anterior margin —- skin scar
Du deep margin closest to mess
