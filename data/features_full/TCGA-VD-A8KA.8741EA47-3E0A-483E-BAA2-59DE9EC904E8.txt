Choroidal melanoma W 9775/03
CLINICAL DIIAILS 5.1: ® W C 99.5

Local resection of tumour, right eye. €9k:>)//7//4/
MACROECOPIC DESCRIPTION

Local resection 15 x 17 x 10mm. Scleral rim up to 2mm.
MICROSCOPY

Histological sections demonstrate a choroidal melanoma with
attached adjacent normal choroid and sclera. --- r~~~

The tumour is pigmented and consists of a mixture of spindle
and epithelioid cells. The latter occupy approx. 30% of the
tumour cell population. The number of mitoses is moderately
high, approx. '12/40 high power fields. The tumour cells are
immunoreactive for MelanA, CD10 and for HSP- 27 (score 2).

_.-..___......_...._..._-._I_...._._._.-.,,.f-‘-', .. .. m, .

The microvasculature of the melanoma is prominent, and
closed loops are focally present. Occasional "vascular
seas" can also be observed: there is, however, no obvious
tumour infiltration. The lymphocytic infiltrate within
tumour is minimal.

There is no evident tumour extension into the sclera. The
lateral resection margins are free of tumour.

DIAGNOSIS

Trans—scleral resection of a choroidal melanoma of mixed
cell type.

1, 3, 6 and 8. Should the DNA concentration be insufficient
for MLPA. microsatellite analysis will be undertaken.

A supplementary report will follow as soon as these
investigations are complete .

SUPPLEMENTARY RE?ORT

 

In the meantime, molecular genetic analysis of tumour DNA

extracted from the fresh uveal melanoma tissue was performed 1
using the technique termed multiplex ligation-dependent I
probe amplification (MLPA). These investigations were

performed in the I
The kit P027 from '. which examines for gains or '

losses in 31 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and a, was used.

The DNA concentration was measured using I and the

quality assessed using multiplex—PCR prior to the MLPA

reaction. I

The DNA concentration was high and of good quality on ;
assessment. The MLPA reaction was run at least twice on
differing occasions, resulting in similar results. ""'

The results of the sequence analysis of the MLPA products is
printed on a separate report.

In summary, sequence analysis demonstrated loss of
chromosome 1; essentially normal chromosome 3 (note
borderline loss of 2 loci ~ VHL and CPO); gain in chromosome
6p; and gain in chromosame B.

These molecular data require correlation with the clinical
and morphological data for metastatic risk assessment.
