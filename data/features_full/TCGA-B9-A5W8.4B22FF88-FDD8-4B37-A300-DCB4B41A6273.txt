Pathologic findings in non-neoplastic kidney: Scattered
sclerotic glomeruli and arterioles with intimal thickening are

present in sections taken from grossly uninvolved kidney
parenchyma adjacent to tumor.

AJCC Staging:

pTZb

pNX

This staging information is based on information available at

the time of this report, and is subject to change pending
clinical review and additional information.

Clinical History: ,
-year-old man with a right renal mass. Per , the patient has a

9 cm right renal mass suggestive of possible renal cell

carcinoma and most likely brain metastasis.

Orientation: The parenchymal margin is inked black, and the
capsule is inked blue.

Presence/absence of adrenal gland: absent

Tumor description: yellow/brown, multinodular and well
circumscribed with extensive areas of hemorrhage and necrosis

Tumor size: 11.8 x 9.2 x 9.5 cm

Tissue submitted for special investigations: Tumor is submitted
to Tissue Procurement

Digital picture: not taken

Block summary:
(Inking: parenchymal margin=black, capsule=blue)

Al—A3 — tumor in relation to black inked parenchymal margin
A4 — tumor in relation to grossly uninvolved kidney

A5—A6 — tumor in relation to blue inked capsule

A7-A12 - additional representative sections of tumor

A13 — representative section of grossly uninvolved kidney
(nearest tumor 3 mm away)

Tissue remains.
