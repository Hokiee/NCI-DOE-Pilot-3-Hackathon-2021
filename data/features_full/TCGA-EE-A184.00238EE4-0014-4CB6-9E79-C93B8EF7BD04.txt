pigmented cut surface. Two representative slices from the centre of the mass embedded in blocks A - D.
Each slice in two blocks respectively.

"METASTATIC MELANOMA RIGHT WRIST SUTURE PROXIMAL": The sections show nodular

subcutaneous tumour composed of pleomorphic epithelioid and spindle cells associated with pigment,

consistent with melanoma. There is adjacent haemorrhage and granulation tissue in the overlying dermis. A

deﬁnitejunctional component is not seen. No residual lymph node is identiﬁed. Where the deep tissues are
‘”‘mm""““"intact’th“e‘tmn6ur appears to be 0.5mm from the inked deep/ 12 o'clock margin. In some sections the tumour
appears to abut the deep aspect of the section, however no ink is seen and the true margin tissue may have
retracted.
