CLINICAL DETAILS

Invasive bladder cancer. Clinically nodes into 2. G3 pT2 N2.

MACROSCOPY

A. Radical cystectomy with hysterectomy and salpingo-oophrectomy including
cervix. The bladder measuring 85 mm superior-inferior x 61 mm medial-lateral x
53 mm anterior-posterior with attached fat up to 115 mm. The uterus measures
68x45x32 mm, right fallopian tube 42 mm x 5 mm with right ovary measuring
21x13x12 mm, leﬁ fallopian tube measures 47 mm x 6 mm diameter with left ovary
21x12x9 mm. Ovaries and tubes unremarkable. There is a subserosal nodule
measuring 11 mm in uterine body. Few surface ﬁbroids seen. The perivesicle fat
and peritoneum is unremarkable does not contain tumour. The cervix is
unremarkable.

On sectioning the bladder, there is a ﬁrm white solid lesion on the right

lateral side extending to dome and left lateral side measuring 40x20x47 mm. The
lesion goes through the wall extending to perivesicular fat.

Block Key

1 = Urethra resection margin, 2 = Right lateral aspect of tumour, full thickness
with perivesicular fat, 3+4 = Composite tumour through vesicular wall and fat
and left dome, 5+6 = Composite tumour through vesicular wall and fat, left side
and dome, 7 = Tumour with perivesicular fat, 8 = Tumour perivesicular fat,
tumour interface with non-affected mucosa, 9 = Trigone, 10 = Right lateral not
affected mucosa, 11 = Left lateral not affected mucosa, 12 = Cervix and lower
uterine segment, 13 = Uterus body, 14 = Cervix with lower uterine segment, 15 =
Right adnexa, 16 = Left adnexa, 17 = Lymph node ? a deposit 7 mm across was in
right peraurricular fat away from main tumour, 18 = ?separate deposit of tumour
on left side peraurricular fat.

B. Fatty tissue measuring 81x32x10 mm. (One lymph node 17 mm in 1 & 2, 3 = ?
lymph node).

C. A piece of fatty tissue with node measuring 95x20x7 mm. Lymph node
measuring 13 mm (blocks 1) lymph node measuring 27 mm (blocks 2 + 3), lymph
node

measuring 19 mm (block 4) another lymph node 5 mm across (block 5).

D. A piece of fatty tissue measuring 17 mm across containing lymph node
measuring 7 mm across.

E. Fibrous tissue with lymph node measuring 35x23x7 mm. Lymph node measuring
20 mm across grossly involved.

F. 2 pieces of ﬁbrofatty tissue the larger measuring 25x12 mm, the smaller
measuring 15x8 mm. There is a 15 mm lymph node (block 1). Another lymph node
10 mm across (block 2).

G. A piece of ﬁbrofatty tissue measuring 85x25xl3 mm, 25 mm lymph node
involved (block 1) and a lymph node of 9 mm (block 2) and a 12 mm ?lymph node
(block 3).

H. Tube measuring 9 mm length x 4 mm diameter.

1. Tube with ﬁbrous tissue measuring 13 mm in length x 3 mm in diameter, with .
ﬁbrous tissue up to 11 mm.

MICROSCOPY

A. Bladder, ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes and cervix; Sections from the
macroscopically identiﬁed lesion conﬁrm a poorly differentiated solid

urothelial carcinoma arising from surface carcinoma in situ and extending the

full thickness of the bladder wall to extend into the perivesicle fat.

The tumour invades with broad fronts and does not elicit a lymphocytic

inﬁltrate at the tumour host interface. Lymphovascular invasion is frequent.
There is occasional perineural invasion.

The tumour extends to within 4 mm of the circumferential surgical resection
margin. The background bladder wall is within morphologically normal limits.
The urethral surgical resection margin shows squamous metaplasia only. Bladder
wall also contains a mesonephric duct remnant.

The tumour cells themselves are markedly pleomorphic and have moderate amounts
of eosinophilic cytoplasm. There are numerous admixed giant cells some which
are osteoclastic type. They do not have trophoblastic differentiation. No
background sarcomatoid change or heterologous elements are noted.

The sections of the uterus and cervix conﬁrm inactive endometrium, two
subserosal small leiomyomas, normal cervix and normal adenexae.

The nodule identiﬁed separately in the remnant fat away from the main specimen
is a lymph node with metastatic carcinoma with extracapsular extension.

B. Left external iliac node; A single lymph node with no evidence of metastatic
carcinoma.

C. Leﬁ obturator lymph node; Three lymph nodes, one with metastatic carcinoma.
The deposit measures 7 mm in maximum dimension and there is no extracapsular
extension.

D. Left common iliac node; A single lymph node with no evidence of metastatic
carcinoma.

E. Right external iliac node; A single node with metastatic carcinoma. The
deposit measures 10 mm and there is no extracapsular extension.

F. Right common iliac node; Two lymph nodes with no evidence of metastatic
carcinoma.

G. Right obturator node; Three lymph nodes, one with metastatic carcinoma. The

deposit measures 6 mm and there is extracapsular extension into the hilar soft
tissue.

H & I; This is ureteric tissue within normal limits.
