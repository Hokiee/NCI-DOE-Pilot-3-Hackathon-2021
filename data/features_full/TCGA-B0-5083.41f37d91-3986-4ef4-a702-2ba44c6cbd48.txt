FINAL DIAGNOSIS: ‘
KIDNEY, LEFT, RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY -—
A.

reemmpom

  

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR CELL) TYPE, FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRAD , .
GREATST DIMENSION.

THE TUMOR HAS A PREDOMINANT GRANULAR (EOSINOPHILIC) MORPHOLOGY (See comment).

THE TUMOR IS CONFINED WITHIN THE RENAL CAPSULE.

NO INVASION OF THE RENAL VEIN, OR IT'S BRANCHES, IS IDENTIFIED.

NO EVIDENCE OF LYMPHATIC INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

ALL SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF'TUMOR.

NON~NEOPLA$TIC KIDNEY WITH NO SPECIFIC PATHOLOGIC ABNORMALITY.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE: pTNM = pT'Ia NX NIX.

THE ADRENAL GLAND IS NOT SUBMITTED.

COMMENT:

The tumor has faintly granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and lmmunohistochemical stains are performed to rule out the
possibility of chromophobe renal cella’carclnoma. The neoplastic cells are positive for vimentin and CD10 and weakly
positive for CKT. They are negative for Hale's colloidal iron. These findings are consistent with conventional (clear cell)

renal cell carcinoma.
