PART 1: LYMPH NQDES. RIGHT PELVIC, EXCISION -
NO EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASIA IN FOURTEEN (14) LYMPH NODES EXAMINED.

PART 2: LYMPH NODES, LEFT PELVIC, EXCISION —
METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA IN ONE (1) OF NINE (9) LYMPH NODES EXAMINED.

PART :I: PROSTATE AND BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES, RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY —
A: INVASIVE POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 4 + 4 = 3 WITH TERTIARY

GLEASON PATTERNS 3 AND s. .

THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT LOBES AND HAS A GREATEST MODULAR

DIAMETER OF 1.4 CM: '

THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES APPROXIMATELY 15% OF THE EXAMINED PROSTATE VOLUME.

THE CARCINOMA SHOWS ESTABLISHED EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION.

THE EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IS SE N IN THE POSTERIOR RIGHT EASE AND MID REGIONS (SLIDES

3AA-3DD). ~

.THE RIGHT SEMINAL VESICLE IS INVOLVED Y CARCINOMA.

THE LEFT SEMINAL VESICLE WALL IS FREE 0 CARCINOMA. BUT THERE IS TUMOR IN THE SOFT TISSUE

SURROUNDING THE WALL.

ALTHOUGH ALL EXAMINED SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA. THE

CARCINOMA IS VERY CLOSE (LESS THAN 0.1 CM) To THE POSTERIOR RIGHT BASE REGION MARGIN

(SLIDE 30D). .
