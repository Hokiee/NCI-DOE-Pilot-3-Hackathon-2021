Metastatic melanoma in one of twenty five lymph nodes (1/25) characterized
by:

a. Metastatic focus: 2 cm

b. Extracapsular extension: Present

COMMENT

B-C) The evaluation of the sentinel node specimens, including histologic
evaluation of H&E levels, and immunohistochemical stains (using antibodies
to Melan A and melanoma cocktail composed of MART-1 and Tyrosinase
antibodies) was performed in accordance with the standard departmental
procedure and has been approved by medical staff committees. The stains
were performed on blocks B1, 82. C1 and C2.

D) There is no residual melanoma present within this wide local excision,
presumably the patient had a previous biopsy, however. no prior pathology
material is present within our system. if the prior material was made
available to us we would review it and incorporate it into complete staging
parameters as clinically desired.

SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPTION

A) SOURCE: Melanoma, stitch marks superior wide local excision of back
Labeled "wide local excision of back, stitch marks superior' is a 7 x 3.2
cm ellipse of tan skin. excised to 1.8 cm with black suture secured to the
mid aspect of one edge denoting superior (redesignated 12 o'clock). The
central tan skin discloses a 1.1 x 1.1 cm gray-brown thickened, plaque-like
scar, 2.6 cm from the 3 o'clock tip, 2.8 cm from the 9 o'clock tip, 1.1 cm
from the 12 o'clock margin and 1 cm from the 6 o'clock margin. The 12-3
o'clock margin is inked blue, 3-6 o'clock margin inked green, 6-9 o'clock
margin inked red. 9-12 o'clock margin inked yellow and the central deep
soft tissue margin is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned
disclosing focal hemorrhage deep to the aforementioned scar, without
discrete masses or hyperpigmentation.

Representative sections including entire central lesion and nearest margins
are submitted in 19 cassettes as follows:
1. 3 and 9 o'clock tips

2-3. Central, composite slice 1

4-5. Central, composite slice 2

6—7. Central, composite slice 3

8-9. Central, composite slice 4

10-11. Central, composite slice 5

12-13. Central, composite slice 6

14—15. Central, composite slice 7

16-17. Central, composite slice 8

18-19. Central, composite slice 9

NOTE: Composites slices are submitted sequentially from 3 o'clock to 9
o‘clock. Composite slices 4-6 include entire skin lesion and nearest

margins.
Note: Specimen removed from patient at ” ' ‘pecimen placed in
10% neutral buffered formalin at :. Specimen ﬁxed in

formalin for a minimum of 6 hours, and not longer than 48 hours.

B) SOURCE: Sentinel node #1, melanoma , left axillary

The specimen is received labeled "left axillary sentinel node #1 It
consists ofa 1.5 cm rubbery tan fatty lymph node, sectioned disclosing no
discrete lesions or hyperpigmentation. Entirely submitted in two cassettes.

C) SOURCE: Sentinel node #2, melanoma , left axillary

The specimen is received labeled "left axillary sentinel node #2.” It
consists of a 1.3 cm rubbery tan partially fatty lymph node, sectioned
disclosing no discrete lesions or hyperpigmentation. Entirely submitted in
two cassettes.

D) SOURCE; Axillary contents, right

Received fresh labeled "right axillary contents" consists of an unoriented
lobulated portion of adipose and fibrous tissue measuring 12 x 11 x 4 cm.
\Mthin this tissue are 26 mottled tan fatty lymph nodes ranging from
0.1-3.1 cm in greatest dimension.

NOTE: Tissue is taken for possible ancillary studies.

Nodes are entirely submitted in 19 cassettes as follows:
1. Fournodes

:—

“

2-6. Second largest node, sectioned
7. Five nodes

8. Five nodes

9. Three nodes

10. Two nodes, one bisected, inked blue
11. One node, bisected

12-13. One node, bisected

14. One node, bisected

15. One node, bisected

16. One node, bisected

17-19. Largest node, sectioned
