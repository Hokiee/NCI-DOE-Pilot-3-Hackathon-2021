C. Received fresh, the specimen is labeled "pelvic lymph nodes,"
and consists of an aggregate of fatty tissue which measures 5.0 x
4.0 x 1.0 cm. Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the
specimen is entirely submitted. Summary of sections: Cl—one
lymph node bisected; C2—C8—remaining lymph nodes.

 

DIAGNOSIS:
A. Prostate gland, right neurovascular margin (biopsy):
Benign prostatic tissue, (benign glands are seen
only on the frozen section control slide).
B. Prostate gland and seminal vesicles (radical prostatectomy):
Adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 7 (3 + 4).
The tumor is present in the right lobe only and is
organ—confined.
The surgical resection margins and seminal vesicles are
free of tumor.
Please see attached staging summary.
C. Lymph nodes, pelvis (excision):
Six lymph nodes, negative for metastatic carcinoma
(0/6).
SYNOPTIC DIAGNOSIS:
Histologic Type: Adenocarcinoma
(conventional, not otherwise specified)
Primary Pattern: Grade 3
Secondary Pattern: Grade 4
Total Gleason Score: 7

Tumor Quantitation: - Proportion (percent) of
prostatic tissue involved by tumor: 5%
Pathologic Staging (pTNM): pT2a: Unilateral,

involving one—half of 1 side (lobe) or less
pNO: No regional lymph

 

node metastasis
Number of regional lymph
nodes examined: 6
Number of regional lymph
nodes involved: 0
pMX: Distant metastasis
cannot be assessed

Margins: Margins uninvolved by
invasive carcinoma

Extraprostatic Extension: Absent

Seminal Vesicle Invasion: Absent

Perineural Invasion: Present

Additional Pathologio Findings: High—grade prostatic

intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN)
Other: Organized,
thrombosed periprostatic veins
