Received in formalin, brain parenchyma fragment weighing 209 and measuring 3.2 X
1.2 X 1.0 cm. Its outer surface is homogeneous and whitish. To cuts, shows up softened
and brown-gray.

Microscopy:

Histological sections stained with H & E show fragments of neocortex with
neuroepithelial neoplasm of white matter with marked cortical inﬁltration. The neoplastic
cells have round nuclei, delicate chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. The cytoplasm
is scant, indistinct, with frequent formation of perinuclear halos. The tumor inﬁltrates the
cortex, where it is observed neuronal satellitosis by neoplastic cells and the formation of
Scherer secondary structures in the subpial region. In some areas the tumor exhibits
greater cellularity, where there are some microcysts. Mitotic figures are occasional. It
was not observed vessels with microvascular proliferation in this material.

Diagnosis: -
Excisional biopsy product of the left parietal tumor: - WHO grade II oligodendroglioma
(ICD-O 9450/3).
