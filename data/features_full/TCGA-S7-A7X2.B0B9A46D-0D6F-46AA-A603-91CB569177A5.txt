Gross:

Left adrenal gland with ovoid tumor (dimension 90x60x45 mm, weight 72 g), tumor with
ﬁbrous capsule 60x50x45 mm.

On cut, adrenal cortex with ochre yellow color, 2 mm thick, tumor with grey-pink color and
soft consistency, with central hemorrhage.

Representative excision with largest tumor diameter was processed in four blocks.

Micro:

Diffusely alveolarly growing pheochromocytoma with ﬁbrous capsule with signs of fresh and

old hemorrhage and scariﬁcation. On periphery, remnants of regular adrenal cortex were
found.

Imunohistochemic examination:

$100 protein ~ no positive sustentacular cells were found, internal control in the excision
(small nerves in the pcriadrenal tissue) positive

KI 67 —— I~2% tumor nuclei positive
