GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. CYST MORGAN AGNI
Received in formalin and labeled "cyst morgan agni“ is an oval tan tissue measuring 1.3 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm.
On the surface are two polypoid raised white-tan nodules measuring 0.2 cm. each. The tissue is
attached to a silver metal clip, by a translucent membrane, measuring 1.4 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm. On
sectioning, the tissue has a golden-yellow coloration. Totally submitted in block labeled A1.
B. RIGHT ADNEXA
Received in formalin and labeled with the patient's name and "right adnexa' is a ligated fallopian tube
measuring in total 3.3 cm in length with a diameter of 0.7 cm. There is a paratubal cyst measuring 0.2
cm. The ovary measures 3.4 x 2.7 x 0.9 cm and the surface has a cystic appearance. On sectioning.
the fallopian tube is unremarkable and the ovary contains several clear ﬂuid cysts ranging in size from
0.3 to 0.9 cm. The cyst walls are free of any masses or papillary lesions. Representative sections are
submitted in block 81-33.
C. LEFT ADNEXA
Received in formalin and labeled with the patient's name and "left adnexa" is a fallopian tube measuring
4.2 cm in length with a diameter of 0.7 cm. There are clear ﬂuid-ﬁlled paratubal cysts ranging in size
from 0.5 to 0.7 cm. Within the serous membrane is a silver metal clip measuring 1.4 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm.
The ovary measures 6.6 x 2.6 x 1.6 cm and there are clear fluid-ﬁlled cysts present on the serosai
surface ranging in size from 0.4 to 0.8 cm. On sectioning, the fallopian tube is unremarkable and the
ovary contains cysts ranging in size from 0.1 to 0.8 cm with the cyst walls free of any masses or
papillary lesions. Representative sections are submitted in block C1-C3.
D. UTERUS
Received fresh and labeled and "uterus" is a 162 gram utems without tubes and ovaries measuring
11.0 x 6.0 x 4.8 cm. There is an attached cervix. The serosai surface is smooth and the ectocervix is
unremarkable. The specimen is bivalved to reveal an exophytic friable tan mass ﬁlling the endometrial
cavity. The myometn’um wall thickness measures 2.0 cm and the mass invades 0.4 cm into the
myometrium (20%). The mass measures 5.0 x 3.4 x approximately 0.7 cm. Representative sections
are submitted as follows:

D1: frozen section

D2-DS: representative sections of cervix

D4-DB: representative sections of endomyometrium, including mass
E. LEFT EXTERNAL ILIAC LYMPH NODES
Received in formalin and labeled with the patient's name and "left external iliac lymph nodes" is an
aggregate of yellow-tan fat measuring 3.3 x 3.3 x 0.6 cm. Five possible lymph nodes are found ranging
in size from 0.7 to 2.3 cm. The largest lymph node is sectioned and representative sections are
submitted as follows:

E1: four possible lymph nodes

E2-E3: one lymph node
F. RIGHT EXTERNAL ILIAC LYMPH NODES
Received in formalin and labeled with the patient's name and "right external iliac lymph nodes" are
multiple pieces of yellow-tan fat. an aggregate measuring 4.7 x 3.5 x0.8 cm. Eight possible lymph
nodes are found. The larger ones are bisected and have a variegated pink-tan colorization throughout.
Lymph nodes are totally submitted as follows:

F1: four possible lymph nodes

F2-F5: one lymph node each
G. PARA AORTIC LYMPH NODE
Received in formalin and labeled with the patient's name and ”para aortic lymph node" is an aggregate
of yellow-tan fat measuring 2.7 x 2.3 x 0.5 cm. Three possible lymph nodes are found with lymph nodes
submitted as follows:

G1: two possible lymph nodes

62: bisected lymph node

ADDENDUM:
Additional tissue has been submitted for histologic evaluation.

TSS: _

E. LEFT EXTERNAL ILIAC LYMPH NODE:
- ADDITIONAL 4 LYMPH NODES. NEGAATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/4).

F. RIGHT EXTERNAL ILIAC LYMPH NODE:
- ADDITONAL 3 LYMPH NODES. NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/3).

G. PARA AORTIC LYMPH NODE:
- ADDITIONAL FIBROUS ADIPOSE TISSUE SUBMITTED.
- NO LYMPH NODES IDENTIFIED.

Note: All the ﬁbrous adipose tissue from parts E, F and G have been submitted for histologic
evaluation.
