Description of material: laparoscopic adrenalectomie left

Macroscopy:

Fresh received adrenal left with over adherent fatty tissues, weight with fat 112 grams. There is seen a
spherical lesion which a diameter of 45 mm. Tumor is smooth bounded. At the location of
the normal adrenal tissue is an iatrogenic lesion seen (less than 10 mm). Piece of tumor is frozen.

Adrenal left with adherent fatty tissues.

Dimensions of preparation 7 x 11.5 x 3.5 cm. Preparation is already largely halved. On

diameter recognizable adrenal parenchyma with at both ends sharply deﬁned round lesion whose
largest lesion with gold, brown discoloration and maximum diameter of 4.3 cm.

The other lesion at other end is sharply deﬁned, dark yellow and has a maximum diameter of 1.3 cm.
Between the two lesions has pro-existing adrenal parenchyma dimensions of 1.7 x 1.7 cm. There is
a macro picture of the preparation. When outside of the preparation there is transition to adrenal.
There is a lamina decreased through adrenal with both lesions. On the edge of the lesion there is
transition to pre—existing adrenal parenchyma. Longitudinal laminas are made from

the preparation. On section there is an even smaller lesion in the transition large tumor. normal
appearing renal parenchyma with a maximum diameter of 0.6 cm.

enclosed:

Cassette 1: small lesion with sharply defined transition to normal adrenal parenchyma-looking.
Cassette 2: pre-existing adrenal parenchyma with transition to large lesion.

Cassette 3—5: cross-sections through the major lesion with a 5—to the edge pre-existent adrenal.

Cassette 6: length lamina through pre-existent and large adrenal tumor still the third small tumor.
Mostly 6b.

Microscopy

Intersection of adrenal with some nodular growing tumor consisting of solid ﬁelds with some
"Zelballen" configuration. The tumor cells contain quite ﬁnely granular cytoplasm with scattered
hyaline inclusions. The cells have large nuclei with polymorphic vesicular chromatin pattern and
prominent nucleoli with sometimes very hyperchromatic nuclei. Spread are multinuclear tumor cells.
There are seen no mitoses, no necrosis or vascular ingrowth. The lesion is surrounded by a capsule.
No capsular invasion. Tumor is completely removed. In addition, there is nodular hyperplasia of the

pre-existing adrenal cortex with a focus in one compartment bounded nodule of up to 1.4 cm in
diameter.

Additional research

Chromogranin is cytoplasmic +, inhibine + in pre—existent adrenal cortex and - in tumor cells 8100 +
cells in sustentaculair cells.

Conclusion

Laparoscopic excision left adrenal gland: localization pheochromocytoma of maximal 4.3 cm

Completely . in addition. nodular hyperplastic changes of the pre—existing adrenal cortex
with a macroscopic nodule of 1.4 cm.
