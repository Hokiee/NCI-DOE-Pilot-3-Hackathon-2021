 

Clinical Diagnosis & History:
Left frontal intra axial primary brain tumor with enhancement malignant glioma.

S ecimens Submitted:

1: Left frontal brain tumor-

2: Left frontal brain tumor # 2

3: Enlarging region left frontal lobe brain tumor

 

 

DIAGNOSIS:

‘l. Frontal brain.ie
- Diffusely inﬁltrating glioma. see below.

2. Frontal brain# 2;biopsy:
- Diffusely inﬁltrating glioma with focally increased proliferative activity. see note.

3. Enlarging region frontal lobe, brain,left;biopsy:
- Diffusely inﬁltrating glioma with focally increased proliferative activity. see note.

Note: While this inﬁltrating glial neoplasm exhibits some oligodendroglial features, it is predominantly of astrocytic appearance and
we think that it fundamentally represents a diffuse astrocytoma. A subset of tumor cells labels for p53. There is tumor expression of
R132H mutant IDH1. The great majority of this lesion is at the WHO grade II levei and manifests low MlB-‘i labeling activity. We
ﬁnd a solitary focus in specimen 2 in which a number of mitotic ﬁgures can be identiﬁed and in which the MIR-1 labeling index rises
into the 8-1 0% range. Given the increased proliferative activity. this would qualify as regional progression to the anaplasticl WHO
grade I“ level though the focus in question is quite limited in volume. Material has been forwarded for MGMT promoter methylation
analysis and chromosome 1p/19q deletion testing.

IA'I'I'EST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SLIDES (ANDIOR OTHER |\.'ht3tTEer=tL)I AND THAT I HAVE
