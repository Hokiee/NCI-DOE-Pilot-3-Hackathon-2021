Histological sections stained by the H & E show sections of glial neoplasm with
hypercellular areas and moderately cellular areas with predominantly myxoid stroma
with frequent microcystic degeneration. The cells are rounded with delicate cytoplasmic
processes. often with clear perinuclear halos, showing moderately atypical,
hyperchromatic and pleomorphic nuclei, with rare cells with gangliocytic phenotype. Are
noted eventual gemistocytes. Presence of 7 mitoses per 10 HPF, sometimes atypical
and numerous apoptosis ﬁgures. There are still pockets of microvascular proliferation.
Were not detected foci of tumor necrosis.
