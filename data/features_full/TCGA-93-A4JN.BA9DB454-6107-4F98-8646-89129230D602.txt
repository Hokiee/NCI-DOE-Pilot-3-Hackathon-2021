Sections oi the submitted "linguia" (part E) show an Invasive. poorly differentiated adenocaroinome (3.2 cm) Mitch has
an infiltrative and poorly circumscribed border. involving the visceral pieure (9L2). The tumor invades into but not
through the visceral pleura (biockET). Ail surgical resection margins are free oitumor. or note. multiple Intro-arterial
invasions with tumor cells colonizing the endothelial wall are also seen. A provisional primary Iuma staging ls provided
as T23 based on the staging iniormation from the ‘llngula' specimen.

Additional sections at the specimen "pleural deposit‘ (part A) show focal small basophilc nests of tumor cells with
some features of neuroendocrine diﬂerentiation. Small amount oi mature adipose tissue Is also present. At deeper
level, some of these areas also showed tubular and aoinar architecture. These tumor cells are positive for WA and
are negative for synaptophysin and chromogranin. conﬁrming their malignant nature.

 

"“Per discussion with we understand that lhe submitted “pleural deposit” (part A) we: acquired
from distant parietal pleural site (M13). This report is ammended to Include this information and to upstage
the lesion to STAGE IV.”

Numerous granulomae are seen (part 3. part 0, part 0. part E). GMS. FITE. AFB are performed on the lymph node
specimen acquired from level 7 (part B) and the results are negative.

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

6 D i n'
The specimens are received in ﬁve formant-ﬁlled containers. each labeled with the patient's mung"
The ﬁrst container is additionally labeled pleural deposit: F81 " It contains a green tissue cassette

which holds multiple minute brown-tan frozen section tissue remnants, measuring 0 5 x 0. 3 it 0 1 cm 'n aggregate.
Wrapped. Labeled M (F31). JarO.

The second certainer is labeled 'level 7 lymph nodes.‘ It contains a pink-tan lymph node candidate. measuring 2 x 1
x 1 cm in greatest dimension. Bisected to show no grossly identiﬁable lesion. Labeled 81. Jar o.

The third container is labeled “level 11 lymph node." It contains one single pink-prom lymph node candidate,
measuring 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm. Bleected. Labeled C1. Jar 0;

The fourth container is labeled ”level 11 lymph node: F82.” It contains a green tissue cassette labeled "F52.“ which

holds two pieces ofbroMi-pink frozen section tissue remnants. measuring 1 it 1.2 x 0.3 cm and 1 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm each.

Labded D1 (F52). Jar o.

The Trail container is labeled ”m F53 .“ it contains a green tissue cassette labeled “F53." which holds a 1.8 x
1.2 x 0.2 cm pink—ten frozen section tissue remnant. Labeled E1 (F83). Also present within the container to a
previously inked and sectioned lingula lobectomy specimen weighing 78.5 g. and measuring 13 x 12 5 x 3cm A
staple line is present at the site of resection. The staple line is removed and its undenying parenchymal resection
margin is inked black. Sectioned to showa 3. 2 x 2. 7 x 2 5 cm tumor mass, which' is located approximately 0.5 cm
irom the nearest inked parenchymal resection margin (sampled' In 63) and' is located 1 2 from the bronchial resection
margin. . The pleural surface overlying the tumor shows pocketing that measures 0.5 cm in the greatest dimension.
The pleural surface in this area is inked blue. The uninvolved area of lung is iunher sectioned to show brow-tan
spongy, unremarkable parenchyma. Upon further inspection. a 0 2 cm whitewtiom pearly lesion is present at the
periphery of the pleural suriace (sampled‘ in E3). Labeled E2- bronchial and vascqu resection margin: E3 ~ tumor in
relation to the nearest inked parenchyrnel resection margin; E4- tumor in relation to the pleural puckerlng; E5 -
additional tumor with pleura puckering; E6 ~ additional tumor with black inked parenchymal resection margin; E7 -
more tumor with pleura puckering; E8 - 0.4 cm pearly pleural nodule: E9 - grossly uninvolved lung. Jar 2.
