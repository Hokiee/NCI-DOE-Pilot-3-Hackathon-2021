Gross Description
Received are two specimens, in formalin, each labeled with the patient's name and
specimen identification.

Specimen one is labeled "gallbladder", and consists of an intact, 6.8 x 3.5 x 3‘0
.cm_hi1a~nrained gailhiaddnr The!§e{gﬁ§_is smooth and unremarkable; hepatic
surface is unremarkable. The specimen is opened and releases approximately 15 cc
of green viscus bile and reveals a black-green bile stained mucosal surface, which
is overall velvety and unremarkable. The specimen is absent of gallstones‘
Representative tissue to include neck margin is submitted in cassette 1A. The

remain-ng specimen

Specimen two is labeled "central hepatectomy section 4. 5, 8", and consists of a
450.0 g, 17.0 x 9.5 x 7.0 cm segment of unoriented liver. The hepatic capsule of
the anterior surface is intact and the central surface has a bulging, multinodular
tumor mass, 11.0 X 7.5 and protruding 1.3 cm above the uninvolved anterior surface,

the opposing surface consisting of surgical resection margin is pepper

surgical staples and multiple linear surgical resection lines extending from
3.5«6.5 cm in length. Vasculature is amputated flush to the hepatic margin.
specimen is inked, is serially sectioned, and has an ill—demarkated, irregular,
11.5 x 6.8 x 6.0 cm tumor mass approaching to within 0.1 cm of the hepatic capsule
margin and 0.4 cm from the hepatic resection margin. The tumor has a multinodular,
yellow~white to pink—tan, bulging, solid cut surface with scattered peripheral
nodules. Ink code is as follows: Anterior capsule margin ~ yellow; surgically
stapled resection line ~ blue; hepatic resection line - black. Representative
tissue is submitted as follows: 2A—2G - tumor approaching nearest surgical
resection margins and hepatic capsule margin; ZH-zl ~ tumor. The remaining

specimen is returned to formalin.

Adden um Di sion

At the request of the.materia1 was re-reviewed for margin status.
Carcinoma cells a present at the black—inked operative margin. This operative
margin is designated as hepatic resection line in the gross description. Thus
malignant cells are present at the hepatic resection line.
