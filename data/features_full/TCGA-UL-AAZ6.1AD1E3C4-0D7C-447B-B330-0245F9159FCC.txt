GROSS DESCRIPTION

The specimen is received fresh in tour containers labeled with the patients name, medical record number, and identiﬁed as A.

”Right Total Mastectomy'. 8. "Sentinel Lymph Node #1 Hot". c. lSentinel Lymph Node #2 Hot” and D. ”Sentinel Lymph Node #3
Hot”.

Specimen A. consists or a mastectomy (811.1 grams. 2? x t? x 3.5 cm) with a 22 x 8.5 cm skin ellipm and a centrally located
unremarkable 1.2 cm nipple. The specimen has been oriented by the surgeon with a stitch indicating the tail of the specﬁmn. The
deep margin is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal an irregrdar iinn tan colored mass with local hemorrhage
and calciﬁcation (3.4 x 3 x 2.5 cm) in the 12:00 position. 2 cm to the deep margin. 1 2 cm to the anterior skin margin. and 2 cm to
the nipple. The remaining breast parenchyma appears grossly unremarkable. One 0.7 cm lymph node is identiﬁed in the tail oithe
specimen. The specimen is submitted representatively as follows: At thru A3, tumor, Alli-tumor and anterior skin. AIS-anterior skin

margin, A6~posterlor deep margin. 7-nlpple, A8 and AS-teteral upper quadrant, A18 and Int-lateral lower quadrant. A1 3-medial
upper quadrant, A14 and A15-medial tower quadrant. 16-0.? cm lymph nodes. bisected,

Specimen 3 consists at a 2.2 cm sentinel lymph node. The lymph node is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in two cassettes
labeled 31 and 32.

Specimen 0 consists of a 2.5 cm sentinel lymph node. The lymph node is serially sectioned and submitted entirely NI two cassettes
labeled C1 and C2.

Specimen D consists of a 1 cm sentinel lymph node with fibroadlpose tissue. Lymph nodes are serially sectimed and submitted
entirety in two cassettes labeled Eli and DZ.
