Gross Description
A. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"right pelvic lymph nodes" is a yellow fibrofatty tissue
fragment measuring 3 x 2 x 0.3 cm. The fat is trimmed and one
probable lymph node is grossly identified which measures 1.5 x 1
x 0.3 cm. Bisected, wrapped and entirely submitted in A1.
B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
“left pelvic lymph nodes" is a yellow fibrofatty tissue fragment
measuring 3 x 2 x 1 cm. The fat is trimmed and one probable
lymph node is grossly identified which measures 1.5 x l x 0.3
cm. Bisected, wrapped and entirely submitted in El.
C. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"tissue anterior to prostate" is a yellow fibrofatty tissue
fragment measuring 5 x 4 x 0.5 cm. No lymph nodes are grossly
identified. Submitted complete in C1—C7.
D. Received in formalin labeled "prostate gland is a radical
prostatectomy specimen which includes a 44 gram prostate gland_
with attached seminal vesicles and vas deferentia. The prostate
gland measures 4 x 4 x 3.5 cm and has a shaggy capsule that is
disrupted at the bladder resection margin and has been
previously inked black on the left and blue on the right. The
right seminal vesicle measures 3 x 1.5 cm. The right vas
measures 2.5 x 0.5 cm. The left seminal vesicle measures 3 x 1.5
cm. The left vas measures 3 x 0.5 cm. The inferior prostate
is sectioned transversely, removed from the rest of the specimen
and sectioned from anterior to posterior following the plane of
the urethra. The remaining gland is serially sectioned
transversely and shows a firm, focally nodular parenchyma. The
seminal vesicles and vase deferentia show no abnormalities.
Representative sections submitted as follows: inferior prostate
