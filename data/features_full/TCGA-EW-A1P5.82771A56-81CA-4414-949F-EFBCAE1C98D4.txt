C. Received in formalin and labeled "right breast 1 short superior. 1 long lateral fs' consists of a mastectomy ed ecimen

weighing 6.63 grams and measures 20.0 x 16.0 x 4.0 cm. Specimen is oriented with a short stitch superior d a long
stitch lateral. There is an ellipse of skin present. 10.0 x 5.5 cm the nipple and areola are present. The areol complex
measure 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. The nipple is inverted. distracted and measures 0.7 cm in greatest d mansion. For
gross purpose the specimen is inked as follow: Superior resection margin inked blue, inferior resection ma n inked
green, medial resection margin inked red, lateral resection margin inked orange. anterior margin inked yello and
posterior surgical resection margin inked black. Sectioning of the specimen reveals an ill-deﬁned, pale-tan. rm mass. 2.5

margin. it is located 2.0 cm from the anterior resection margin and 1.0 cm from the deep resection margin. pon
sectioning the stroma is composed of yellow, lobulated adipose tissue. The ﬁrm. white area is closely assoc ted with the
skin. No other lesions are identified. Specimen submitted as follows.
