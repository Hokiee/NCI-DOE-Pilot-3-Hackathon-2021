SURGICAL PATHOLOGY

Surgical Pathology Report

Diagnosis:

A: Omentum, mass, excision

- Metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with colonic primary

B: Terminal ileum, appendix and right colon, right hemicolectomy

Tumor Histologic Type: Invasive moderately differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma
Histologic Grade: 2

Tumor Location: Right colon

Depth of Invasion: Through muscularis propria into the subserosa, pericolic soft tissue
Lymphovascular Invasion: Not identified

Perineural Invasion: Not identified

Margins:

Proximal margin: Negative

Distal margin: Negative

Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative but close, <1.0 mm

Distance of carcinoma from closest margin (specify): < 1.0 mm from serosal surface; 8.5 cm from proximal mucosal margin.

Regional Lymph Nodes:
Total number with metastasis: 1
Total number examined: 24

Additional pathologic findings: Appendix with follicular lymphoid hyperplasia and no tumor seen; tumor satellite nodule identified.
A] CC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT3 lea

Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information available at the time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical
review and additional information.

C: Liver mass, Segment 5, removal
- No evidence of metastatic disease.
- Benign liver with minimal steatosis and mild portal triaditis

D: Hernia sac, removal
- Benign fibrovascular and fibroadipose soft tissue, consistent with hernia sac, with focal foreign body giant cell reaction with associated
polarizable foreign material; no evidence of metastatic disease.

Clinical History:
large mass in the ascending colon. Biopsy demonstrates invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. CT imaging confirms mass and
evidence of metastatic disease.

Gross Description:
Received are four formalin-filled containers.

Container A:

SITE: "omentum"

METHOD: excision

MEASURE: 6.5 x 3.6 x 1.5 cm

COMMENT: yellow/tan fibroadipose tissue with a central firm hard mass; cut section demonstrates a white/yellow firm surface
BLOCK: A1, omental mass

Container B:

Specimen ﬁxation: formalin
Parts of bowel received: terminal ileum, cecum and proximal ascending colon
Specimen length: 27.3 cm

Orientation: The specimen was received with a stitched end which appears to be the right ascending colon, inked blue. The distal
ileum is inked black.

Tumor location: tumor is located just distal, but apparently involving the ileocecal valve

Gross appearance of tumor: distal to the ileocecal valve is a ulcerated mass with whorled edges, this mass is ﬁrm; proximal to this
is the ileocecal valve and this also appears to be at least superﬁcially studded with tumor

Tumor dimensions: 3.5 x 2.4 x 1.2 cm

Circumferential growth: 70%

Gross depth of invasion: the mass appears to grossly invade the subserosal soft tissues

Gross evidence of perforation through visceral peritoneum: no

Luminal obstruction: no

Bowel circumference at tumor site: 6.0 cm, 1.5 cm diameter at tumor site

Gross distance of tumor from margins: 9 cm from blue inked distal margin, 8.5 cm from black inked proximal margin
Lymph nodes: per block summary

Other remarkable findings: The rest of the colon and ileum are grossly unremarkable. Appendix is present with the specimen and is
not grossly involved.

Tissue submitted for special investigation: tissue submitted to Tissue Procurement
Digital photograph taken: no

Block Summary:
(Inking: proximal ileal margin=black, distal right colonic margin with stitch=blue)

B1 - appendix, longitudinal section of tip, cross section of base
B2 - proximal (black inked) margin, en face
B3,B4 - distal (blue inked) margin, en face
B5 - section of mass

B6,B7 - additional section of mass, bisected
B8 - mass in relation to pericolic fat

B9 - section of ileocecal valve

B10 - additional section of ileocecal valve
B11 - five lymph node candidates

B12 - five lymph node candidates

B13 - five lymph node candidates

B14,B15 - one grossly positive node, bisected
B16 - four lymph node candidates

B17 - two lymph node candidates

Container C:

SITE: "liver, Segment 5"

METHOD: biopsy

MEASURE: 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm
COMMENT: tan/brown soft tissue mass
BLOCK: c1,-

Container D is additionally labeled "hernia sac." It holds three pink/tan soft tissue fragments measuring 2.5 x 1.9 x 0.8 cm in aggregate.

Block Summary:
D1 - hernia sac
Fibroadipose tissue remains.
