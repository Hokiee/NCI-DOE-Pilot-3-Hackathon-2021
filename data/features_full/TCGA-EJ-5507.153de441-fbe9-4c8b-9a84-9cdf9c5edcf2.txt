Addendum
Spectmen labeled “right pedlole margin" has been evaluated with multiple levels and PSA, racemase. CK903 and p63

.iinmunohistochemical stalns.

The Immunohtstochemtcat stains show PSA expression in the glands, confinnlng prostatlc origin. Immunohistochemlcal
stalns show expression of racarnase in these glands. Presence of basal cells Is conﬁrmed by CKSD3 and p63
immunohlstochemlcal stains.

This Immunohistochemical profile suggests these glands represent high grade prostatic intraepithellat neoplasia. No
evidence of Invasive carcinoma is seen.

 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

PART 1:

LYMPH noose. RIGHT PELVIC, exalsson -
A. METASTATIC CARCINOMA m 1 or: :3 LYMPH NODES (1113).
s. EXTRANODAL EXTENSION rs PRESENT.

PART 2:

LYMPH NOOES, LEFT PELVIC, excreton —

METASTATIC CARCINOMA IN 1 or 8 LYMPH NODES (113}.

 

PART 3:

PROSTATE AND BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES, RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY ——

PROSTATE ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 4 + 5 = 9.

THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT LOBES AND HAS A GREATEST NODULAR DIAMETER OF
2 CM IN ONE HISTOLOGIC SECTION (SLIDE 3U).

THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES 35% OF THE EXAMINED PROSTATE VOLUME.

EXTENSIVE EXTRAPROSTATIC EXTENSION IS PRESENT.

BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES ARE INVOLVED BY CARCINOMA.

THE INKED MARGINS OF RESECTION ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA.

EXTENSIVE PERINEURAL INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

HIGH GRADE PROSTATIO INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA IS IDENTIFIED.

PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT3b N1 MX.

BACKGROUND PROSTATE TISSUE WITH NODULAR HYPERPLASIA AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATION.
