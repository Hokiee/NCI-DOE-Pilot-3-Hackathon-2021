CLINICAL INFORMATION;
Right breast multicentric cancer. ER/PR done previous biopsy

SPECIMEMS) RECEIVED:

A. Right axillary sentinel node

B. Right axillary sentinel nodes

C. Left breast tissue

D. Right modified radial mastectomy with multicentric cancer

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received trash is a 2.3 x 2 x 1.5 cm fragment of golden yellow ﬁbroadipose tissue containing one rubbery.
partially fat-replaced 1.1 x1 x 0.4 cm lymph node. The node is bisected and submitted for frozen section in A1.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: Lymph node. positive for metastatic breast carcinoma;-

8. Received fresh is a 3 x 2 x 1.5 cm fragment of golden yellow fibroadipose tissue. Dissection reveals two
rubbery. partially fat-replaced nodes, 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm and 1.1 x 0 9 x 0.5 cm. Both nodes are bisected'and
submitted for permanent section in E31 and 82.

C. Received fresh are two fragments of iobular golden yellow Iibroadipose tissue along With attach ed and
unattached smooth. unremarkable tamed skin weighing 256 grams in aggregate and measuring from 5 x 3.4 x 2.2
cm to 16 x 11 x 3.5 cm. Sectioning reveals a cut surface consistent of lobular yellow adipose tissue interspersed
with fibrous pink-white breast parenchyma. Representative tissue is submitted in CI — C2.

D. Fixed in formalin for approximately 33 hours is a 1.215 gram modiﬁed radical mastectomy with the breast
proper measuring 20 cm from medial to lateral x 19.5 cm from superior to interior x 7 cm from anterior to posterior.
Dissection of the 11 x 6 x 4 cm axillary Iail reveals several rubbery tan-red lymph nodes. 0.3 to 2.3 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm.
There is an 18 x 9 cm ellipse of tan-red skin on the anterior surface with a superomedial placed nipple. The
superior margin is inked black. interior blue. medial green. lateral yellow and posterior red. The Specimen is
serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 17 slices measuring from 1 to 1.3 cm. In the upper outer quadrant of
the breast is a large ﬁrm. multinodular, ill-defined 7 x 5 x 3.8 cm pink-gray mass which extends from the 910 11
o'clock position, 5-6 cm away from the nipple. This large. multinodular lesion appears grossly to come within 0.5
cm of the posterior margin, 15 cm of the superior margin and greater than 2 cm away from all remaining margins.
In the upper inner quadrant of the breast at approximately lbs 2 o'clock position, 7-8 cm away from the nipple. is a
smaller. Iirm. ill-defined 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm pink-gray mass located 1 cm away from the superior margin and greater
than 2 cm from all remaining margins. This mass appears grossly to be located 3.5 cm away from the larger lesion
The rest of the specimen consists of Iobular yellow adipose tissue interspersed with ﬁbrous pink-white breast
parenchyma. A photograph of slices 4 through 14 is taken to illustrate both lesions and their relationship to the
inked margins. Sections submitted are indicated on the photograph and are sublabeled 010-025. Sections to
include the mass at 2 o'clock are in D10 and Di 1. and the mass at the 1 to 3 o'clock position is in 014, D15. 01?.
020. 021. 022. 023. D24 and 025. The nippIe is in 013. and an additional section of medial breast is in DB and
lateral breast in 09. The lymph nodes are submitted as follows: D1-DZ — one node trisected: 03 -— one node
bisected; D4-D7 — intact lymph nodes; DS ~ medial breast tissue. 09 -— lateral breast tissue.

Slides were microscopically examined by Ina pathologist.
