Addendum Discussion:

Scattered MIB-l reactive cells are present throughout the tumor. A labeling index of
6.1% is seen in the most proliferative areas. This is an intermediate level of proliferation
activity. While higher than commonly seen in low grade oligodendrogliomas, it does not
warrant classification as anaplastic.

Addendum Diagnosis:

Brain tumor, biopsy and resection:
Low grade oligoastrocytoma (WhoGrade II)
MIB-l Labeling Index = 6.1%

Microscopic Descriptions:

Sections of gray and white matter demonstrate a diffusely infiltrating glioma. The tumor
is mildly to moderately hypercellular. It is composed of cells with round to somewhat
irregular nuclei and scant processes. Most have perinuclear halos. Only a rare mitotic
figure is seen. No microvascular proliferation or necrosis is present.
