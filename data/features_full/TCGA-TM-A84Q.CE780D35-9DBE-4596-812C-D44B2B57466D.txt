CLINICAL DETAILS

(L) temporal tumour for frozen section. Headaches speech disturbance.

FROZEN SECTION REPORT

1. Examined by frozen section and reported by "Glioma".

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
t. LABELLE‘D ‘LEFT TEMPORAL TUMOUR‘. An aggregate-oi ml tissue 25 x l0 :4 2mm sampled
For smears and frozen section. Block M frozen section. [B remainder oi‘tissuc.

2, LABELLED ‘LEFT TEMPORAL ‘l‘UMOUR'. Multiple fragments oi“ friabic tan and yellow/soft
tissue 80 x 80 x l0mm in aggregate. Representative sections embedded in three blocks.

3. LABELLED 'LEFT TEMPORAL ’I‘UMOUR‘. Multiple fragments of ﬁrm tan haemorrhngic tissue
25 x 25 3: ”him in aggregate. The largest pieces have firm tan tissue on sectioning. Representative
section embedded in one block.

MICROSCOPIC REPORT

l-3. The processed parafﬁn sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis. The sections show brain
tissue in which there is a gomistooytic as-trocytoma. The tumour is predominantly (60—70%)
composed of neoplastic getnistocytcs with plumpt glaSsy and eosinophilic cells bodies ol‘angular
shape. A small amount of grade 2 ﬁbrillary nstro'cytoma component is also present in the
background. No mitoses, necrosis oFendothelial proliferation is seen. Adjacent nonmeoplastic brain
shows prominent porivascniar lympltooytic cufﬁng.

The tumour cells are strongly positive for GFAI’. The Ki67 proliferation index is approximately 2%.

hnmunohistochemical Study for p53 and 8ch is in progress. A Supplementary report will follow.

COMMENT

Gemistocytic astrocytomas frequently are clinically aggressive and they have a poorer prognosis than
is suggested by their histological grade.

This case has been reviewed in consultation with who agrees with the interpretation.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT

Inununuhistochemical study shows the tumour cells are strongly positive for p53. There is patchy
weak staining for BcIZ. The immlmoproﬁlc is consistent with gemismcytic astmcytoma.

SUPPLEMENTARY SUMMARY

Brain, left temporal tumour - Gemistocytic astmcytoma, WHO grade 2.
