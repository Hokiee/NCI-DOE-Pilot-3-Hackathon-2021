Right upper lobe of lung, wedge excision with frozen section:
Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.

1.5 cm diameter.

Neoplasm is adjacent to but does not invade pleura.
AJCC stage T1a,N0.

Right upper lobe of lung, excision:
No residual carcinoma identified.
Margins of excision are free of neoplasm in planes of section.
Hilar lymph node is reactive, but contains no metastatic neoplasm.

 

Clinical Information
Right upper lobe lesion.

Frozen Section Diagnosis

FS with scrape prep, lesion, RUL: Non—small cell carcinoma.

 

Gross: Wedge resection, 5 x 4 x 2 cm with centrally located 1.5 cm gritty-whitish nodule.-

Gross Description

"A, NFSA." Received after frozen section is a 16 gram wedge of lung which measured 5.0 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm at frozen section. The
specimen has been previously sectioned to reveal a 1.5 x 1.3 cm white-tan, ﬁrm mass, which grossly appears to abut the
adjacent pleura. The pleura overlying the mass will be inked black. A portion of the specimen has been submitted for frozen
section in cassette "FSA." "A1-A3," random sections of the mass to include overlying pleura.

"B, Right upper lobe." Received is a 304 gram, 21.4 x 10.7 x 3.8 cm lobe of lung. The bronchial margin will be inked black.

There is an 8.0 cm suture—closed area in the lung. The pleura in the region of the suture-closed area will be inked orange. On
sectioning the lung in the region of the suture-closed area, no masses or lesions are grossly identiﬁed. The remainder of the
lobe is congested and no masses or lesions are grossly identiﬁed. The hilum of the lobe is examined, and there is 1 possible

lymph node, which is 1.1 cm. "B1," bronchial and vascular margins; "82-84," random section ' region of the
suture-closed area; "BS," random sections remainder of lung; "BB," possible hilar lymph nod
