Case Clinical Information
PROSTATE CANCER, UMBILICAL HERNIA

Gross Description
A. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"tissue anterior to prostate” are multiple fragments of
lobulated fat measuring 3 x 3 x 3 cm in compact aggregate. All
material is submitted in Al—A4.
B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"right pelvic lymph nodes" is a fibroadipose fragment measuring
3 x 3 x 3 cm including a dominant lymph node bisected and
submitted in Bl—BZ. Additional subtle areas of induration are
submitted in B3.

"left pelvic lymph nodes" are multiple fragments of fibroadipose
tissue measuring 3.5 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm to include a dominant 4.5 cm
lymph node. The dominant lymph node is totally submitted in
C1-C3. Additional areas of induration are submitted in C4.

D. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"umbilical hernia" is a fibro—membranous tissue measuring 2 x 2
x 1 cm thick. The entire specimen is submitted in D1.

E. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"prostate and seminal vesicles" is a 40 gram specimen of a
prostate gland with seminal vesicles, with the prostate itself
measuring 5 cm right to left, 4 cm anterior to posterior and 3
cm superior to inferior. The right and left vas deferens
measure 2 x 0.5 cm and 2 x 0.5 cm. The right and left seminal
vesicles measure 2 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm and 2 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm in
greater dimensions. The right side of the Specimen has been
inked blue, the left side black. Both the superior bladder
margin and the inferior distal margin are amputated from the
remainder of the specimen, sectioned parallel to the urethra and
totally submitted anterior to posterior, with the remainder of
the prestate submitted as well. Section code: EI—EG: apical
margin of prostate entirely submitted anterior to posterior;
first additional slice proceeding inferior to superior, anterior
lobes in E7-E8; posterior lobes in 39—310; second additional
Slice anterior lobes in Ell-312; posterior lobes in 313~E14;
next additional slice anterior lobes in ElS—EIG; posterior lobes
in E17—Els; remaining posterior lobes and area of seminal
vesicles in E19~E20; 321=right seminal vesicle and vas resection
margin; E22u1eft seminal vesicle and vas resection margin;
E23-E25: bladder margin totally submitted parallel to urethra
anterior to posterior. /
