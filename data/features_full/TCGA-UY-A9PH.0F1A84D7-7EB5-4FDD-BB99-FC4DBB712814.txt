Gross Description

The specimen is received in nine parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record
number. Parts A—C are received fresh. Parts D-I are received in formalin.

Part A, additionally labeled "right ureter," consists of one, soft, pink—white, ovoid, unoriented tissue
fragment (0.5 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm). The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section diagnosis 1, and
subsequently submitted in cassette A1.

Part B, additionally labeled "left ureter,‘ consists of one, soft, pink-white, irregular, unoriented, ovoid

tissue fragment (0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm). The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section diagnosis 2, and
subsequently submitted in cassette 81.

Part C is additionally labeled "bladder + prostate,” and consists of a cystoprostatectomy specimen
containing bladder (239.6 cm; 9 cm from right to left x 3.6 cm from anterior to posterior x 11.2 cm
from superior to inferior) with attached ureters and prostate (3.1 cm from apex to base x 3.2 cm from
left to right x 3 cm from anterior to posterior).

GROSS PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: At the junction of the leﬂ: inferior bladder and prostate there is a
well-circumscribed, ovoid, firm, tan nodule (1.6 x 1.5 x 1 cm) that is located 1.1 cm from the left
anterior resection surface. Within the mucosal surface of the bladder there are three indurated,
red-brown areas. The ﬁrst area is located in the right trigone (1.2 x 0.8 cm) and Is located 4 cm from
the urethral resection surface and 2 cm from the radial resection margin. The second indurated, red
mucosal area (0.3 x 0.3 cm) is located in the posterior wall of the bladder and is located between the
oriﬁces of the ureter and is 5 cm from the urethral resection surface. The third indurated, red mucosal
area (1.2 x 0.9 cm) is located in the left lateral wall of the bladder and is 5.3 cm from the urethral
resection surface. The remaining portion of the uninvolved bladder appears unremarkable with
red-pink, normal-appearing mucosa. The surrounding adipose tissue is extensively examined for lymph
nodes with multiple ﬁrm tan-white candidate lymph nodes (0.3 cm in diameter) identiﬁed.

There is an irregular, yellow—tan area within the left mid gland of the prostate measuring 0.9 x 0.4 x 0.3
cm, and is conﬁned to the prostate. The left seminal vesicle (2.9 x 2 x 0.7 cm) and the right seminal
vesicle (2.5 x 2.2 x 0.8 cm) are firm tan-brown and appear unremarkable.

ORIENTED BY: Anatomic landmarks - bladder and prostate.

INTRAOPERATIVE EVALUATION: Frozen section of urethral margin, en face (F51), submitted in cassette
C1.

INKING:

- Anterior surface: Green.

- Anterior left surface: Blue.

- Posterior surface: Black.

GROSS PHOTOGRAPHS: Yes.

CASSETTES: Representative sections are submitted as follows:

C1: Urethral margin, frozen remnant.

C2: Ureter resection surface, en face (right ureter inked in green and left ureter inked in
blue).

C3: Urethral resection surface, en face.

C4-C5:Perpendlcular section through prostatic urethra and inferior bladder.
C6-C9:Entire left lateral indurated mucosal area.

C10: Entire posterior wall indurated mucosal area.

C11—C14: Entire right trigone indurated mucosal area.

C15: Representative section through central portion of bladder trigone.
C16: Representative section from mid portion of bladder.

C17: Representative section from bladder dome.

C18: Left anterior prostate base, nodule.

C19: Left posterior prostate and seminal vesicle.

C20: Left anterior mid gland of prostate with irregular, yellow-white area.
C21: Right posterior base of prostate and seminal vesicle.

C22: Right mid gland of prostate.

C24-C25: Nodule junction between left inferior bladder and prostate.

C26: Nodule junction between left inferior bladder and prostate, closest relationship to radial
margin.

Part D, additionally labeled “right obturator nodes," consists of multiple, soft, tan—yellow fatty tissue
fragments (3.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm in aggregate). The specimen is extensively searched for lymph nodes.
Multiple candidate lymph nodes are found and submitted as follows:

Cassette D1: Three intact nodes.

Cassette D2: Three intact nodes. -

Part E, additionally labeled "right internal iliac nodes,“ consists of multiple, soft, tan-yellow fatty tissue
fragments (3 x 2 x 0.6 cm in aggregate). The specimen is extensivel searched for lymph nodes. Two
candidate nodes are found and submitted intact in cassette E1.

Part F, additionally labeled “left internal iliac lymph nodes," consists of multiple, soft, tan-yellow fatty
tissue fragments (3.5 x 2 x 1 cm in aggregate). The specimen is extensively searched for lymph nodes.
Multiple candidate lymph nodes are found and submitted as follows:

Cassette F1: Three intact nodes.

Cassette F2: One intact node. -

Part G, additionally labeled “left obturator lymph nodes,“ consists of one, soft and firm, tan-yellow fatty
tissue fragment (3.5 x 2 x 1 cm). The specimen is extensively searched for lymph nodes. Multiple
candidate lymph nodes are found and submitted as follows:

Cassette G1: Three intact nodes.

Cassette 62: One intact node. ‘

Part H, additionally labeled "final left distal ureter, stitch marks distal,“ consists of an oriented soft, tan
and yellow segment of ureter (2 cm length, 0.4 cm average diameter). The specimen has a stitch at
one end that is designated as the distal aspect by the surgeon. The stitch is removed and the area is
inked blue. The specimen is cross-sectioned and entirely submitted in cassette H1. '-

Part1, additionally labeled "final right distal ureter, stitch marks distal,“ consists of one, soft, tan~yellow
segment of ureter (3 cm length, 0.4 cm average diameter). The specimen is oriented with a stitch
indicating the distal aspect. The stitch is removed and the area is inked blue. The specimen is
cross-sectioned and entirely submitted in cassette 11. ,-

Diagnosis based on gross and microsc0pic examinations. Final diagnosis made by attending pathologist
following review of all pathology slides.
