nodule located at the junction of the upper outer and lower outer
quadrants, measuring 2 x 1.5 x 1.5 ca. This nodule is dyed blue.
There in an extension of granular, firm tissue measuring
approximately 4 x 2 x 2 cm, and extending toward the axillary
tail. In this granular area. there is a hemorrhagic cavity,
probably corresponding to a previous biopsy site. The indurated
area and the granular area are located at leant 1 to 2 on away
from the nearest deep inked margin. There is a second indurated
area measuring less :hnn 1 cm in diameter, clearly separate iron
