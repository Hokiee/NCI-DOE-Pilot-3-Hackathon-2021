x 2.9 x 2.4 cm prostate. a 3.1 x 0.9 x 0.6 cm left seminal vesicle. a 1.8 it 1.0 x 0.5 cm right seminat vesicle, a 2.? by 0.3 cm left vas deferens and a 1.9 by
0.3 cm right vas deferens. The orientation of the specimen is not comptetely obvious. The outer surface of the prostate is shaggy and tan-pink. The
cut surface consists of nodular gray~wltite to tan-yeltow soft tissue. Also received in the same container are three irregutar to tubular tan-white soft
tissues ranging from 0.5 by 0.2 cm to 3.3 by 0.2 cm. .

There is also a 4.5 x 2.8 x 0.9 cm aggregate of ﬁbroadipose tissue barring three irregular tan-yellow ﬁrm tissues consistent with probable lymph node
ranging from 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm to 3.5 x 2.3 x 0.? cm.

The specimen is serially sectioned and representative sections are submitted as tabeled: 1 -- left apical margin (perpendicutar): 2 .. right apical margin
