- DIAGNOSIS

(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA GLEASON SCORE 7 (4+3). (SEE COMMENT)
EXTENSIVE EXTRAPROSTATIC EXTENSION PRESENT.
MARGINS OF RESECTION FREE OF TUMOR.
Right and left seminal vesicles, no tumor present.
Segments of right and left vasa deferentia, no tumor present.
PERINEURAL AND LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION PRESENT.
PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH-GRADE.
SEE PREVIOUS REPORT FOR DIAGNOSIS OF PELVIC LYMPH NODES.

COMMENT

The prostate gland contains three foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, two in the peripheral zone and one in the transition zone. The
dominant tumor focus is located in the right lateral, right posterolateral and right posterior peripheral zone. This tumor focus
measures 2.5 x 0.6 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the four cross sections of the prostate,
extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. The tumor exhibits extensive multifocal extraprostatic extension.
Extraprostatic extension is present in the right lateral, right posterolateral surface of the prostate and right superior neurovascular
bundle region. The added length of extraprostatic extension is 23.0 mm. The margins of resection are free of tumor. The second
tumor focus is located in the left lateral and left posterolateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 1.0 x 0.1 cm in the
largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in two cross sections. The third tumor focus is located in the left transition zone.
This tumor focus measures less than 0.1 x less than 0.1 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in one cross

section. The nondominant tumor foci of lower histologic grade and confined to the prostate. All margins of resection are free of
tumor.

Please refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.

GROSS. DESCRIPTION

(A) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES — A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (4.6 x 3.4 x 3.7 cm, 36 grams, post ﬁxation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
posterolateral aspects of the prostate is scant and symmetrical. Firmness is noted on the right mid region of the prostate. Serial
cross sections after ﬁxation demonstrate an area consistent with tumor in the right side of the ﬁrst three of the four cross sections

of the prostate.
The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

Also included in the container are three separate fragments of tissue, two consistent with segments of vas (4.5 x 0.5 x 0.3
cm and 3.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm) and one consistent with adipose tissue (1.8 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm).

SECTION CODE: A1, A2, detached fragments of tissue; A3, A4, base of right seminal vesicle and right vas deferens; A5,
A6. base of left seminal vesicle and left vas deferens; A7, prostatic base, right border; A8, A9. prostatic base, right posterior
border; A1 O-A14. prostatic base, central portion; A15, A16, prostatic base, left border; A17, A18, prostatic base, left posterior
border; A19, apex anterior; A20. apex left; A21, A22, apex posterior; A23, apex right; A24—A39, sections of the four cross sections
of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.

The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in
black. Blue ink (A20) denotes surfaces that do not represent the true margin of resection.
