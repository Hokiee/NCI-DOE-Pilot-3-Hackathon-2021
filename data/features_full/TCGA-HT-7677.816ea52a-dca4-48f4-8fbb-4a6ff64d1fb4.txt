Microscopic

Sections demonstrate an infiltrating glioma with oligodendroglial features. The tumor
exhibits multifocal regional in both cellularity and atypia, suggestive of anaplastic
progression in a background low grade tumor. In some areas, the tumor appears less
cellular and demonstrates classic low grade oligodendroglial features including round
nuclei with mild atypia and prominent perinuclear halos. In other areas, the neoplasm
exhibits marked hypercellularity with more pronounced nuclear atypia. Numerous
microgemistocytes are scattered throughout the tumor. The neoplastic cells diffusely
infiltrate the adjacent brain. Areas of grey matter demonstrate foci with prominent
perinueronal tumor satellitosis. The tumor exhibits scattered microcalcifications, myxoid
change and thin branching vasculature. Neither necrosis, nor microvascular proliferation
is seen. Although only 2 mitotic figures per 10 high power fields are counted, the
previous biopsy demonstrated a MIB-l labeling index of 24.5%, consistent with
markedly elevated proliferative activity.
