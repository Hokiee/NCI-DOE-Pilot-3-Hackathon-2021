A. KIDNEY — Left renal mass- - margins - ? cancer

CLINICAL INFORMATION
Left kidney tumor

GROSS DESCRIPTION

'men is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis labeled with the patient’s ham”

m left renal mass" and consists ofa 6.5 x 5.5 x 5 cm red-brown portion of partial ne .

ce of the kidney overlying the tumor is inked in green. The entire normal kidney margin is inked
in black. The estimated tumor size is 3 x 2 X 2 cm. The cut surface is not homogeneous with areas of
dark brown tumor admixed with foci of lighter tan friable tumor. Representative sections are frozen as
FSA1 and FSA2. The remainder of tissue are submitted in cassettes (A1) and (A2),
respectively. Representative sections submitte In cassette A3)-(A9).

  
  

SLIDE KEY:

A1 — remainder of tissue from FSA1

A2 — remainder of tissue from FSA2

A3-A6 — sections with tumor

A7 — normal-appearing kidney

A8—A9 — additional sections of margins near tumor.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:
Renal mass, left: “Deep and renal ca sule mar ins within a few microns. Renal carcinoma, classification

pending permanent section."

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Permanent sections show a variant of papillary renal cell carcinoma with areas of solid proliferation
without papillary structures. The lesion has a pseudocapsule, and it appears to be resected with
approximately 0.4 mm distance between the tumor and the normal kidney resection plane. The papillary
appearance is more pronounced at the periphery of the tumor. Nuclei are bland and are consistent with
Fuhrman grade 1 without evidence of nucleoli. The cells in the solid areas have some kind of an
eosinophilic matrix with occasional globoid bodies. Mitotic figures are rare, and in some areas, there is

 

    

the appearance of pseudorosette formation. The lesion contains some calcium. In slide A-6, there are
good psammoma bodies represented. The nearby renal parenchyma appears to be normal. Vascular or
lymphatic invasion is not observed.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STUDIES:
These are carried out to evaluate the solid areas of the tumor. The controls are appropriate, and the
following results are obtained:

Synaptophysin — negative.

Chromogranin — negative.

Keratin cocktail — there is 1-2+ reactivity.

CK7 — there is 1+ staining of the cytoplasm.

Vimentin — there is good vimentin staining, about 2-3+.
CD10 — negative.

COMMENT:

We are dealing with an unusual variant of papillary renal cell carcinoma with solid areas and presence of
low-grade nuclei indicating that this would fit a type 1 papillary carcinoma which is associated with a
better survival rate than classic clear renal cell carcinomas. The lesion appears to be resected although it
is close to the resection plane, at least focally. 5 reviewed the slide and concurs. A
neuroendocrine component has been exclude .
