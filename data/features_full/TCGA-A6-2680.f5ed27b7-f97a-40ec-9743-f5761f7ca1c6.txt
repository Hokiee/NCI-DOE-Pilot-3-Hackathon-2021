SPECIMEN
Extended right hemicolectomy

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE~OP DIAGNOSIS: Hepatic flexure cancer.
POST—OP DIAGNOSIS: Same.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

Received unfixed for tissue procurement, labeled ”extended

right hemicolectomy" is a portion of the ileum that is 9.5
cm in length, and 3 cm in circumference. There is an attached
portion of colon that is 22 cm, which includes the cecum and
ileocecal valve. The average circumference of the colonic portion
of the specimen is 7.3 cm. Wall thickness is, on average, 0.4 cm.
In the distal end of the colonic segment is a tumor that is
circumferential, with raised, rolled edges and central ulceration, 9
x 4.2 cm in cross sectional area. The tumor mass is 5.7 cm from the
distal margin, and 24 cm from the proximal ileal margin. The mass
is 1 cm from the ileocecal valve. A portion of tumor and normal
tissue is submitted for tissue procurement. Sectioning through the
tumor shows subserosal invasion, but the mass does not reach the
serosal surface. Representative sections submitted in 13 blooks as
labeled. RS—13

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 m proximal and distal margins; 2H4 — tumor full

thickness to inked free radial serosal surface; 5 — tumor to normal
mucosa; 6 — ICV; 7 and 8 — random colon; 9—11 — 9 whole lymph nodes
per cassette; 12 — 8 whole lymph nodes; 13 u l bisected lymph node.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma
Histologic grade: Moderately—differentiated
Primary tumor {pT3}: carcinoma invades through the muscularis
propria into the subserosa.
Proximal[distal/circumferential margin: Negative
Distance of tumor from closest margin: 5.? from distal margin
Vascular invasion: Not identified
Regional lymph nodes (pNO): 34 negative lymph nodes (0/34)
Non-lymph node pericolonic tumor: not identified.

Comment: There is a small nodule of surface tumor submitted with
lymph nodes; slide also reviewed by —, who agrees with
this interpretation.

DIAGNOSIS
Colon, hepatic flexure, extended hemicolectomy:
Adenocarcinoma, moderately—differentiated, with invasion through
the muscularis propria into the subserosa (pTB).
Margins of excision negative.
Angiolymphatic invasion not identified.
Thirty-four negative lymph nodes {0/34}.
