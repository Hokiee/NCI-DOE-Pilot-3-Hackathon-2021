Gross:

Left adrenal gland with tumor (weight 219g, dimensions 120x80x55 mm). Tumor is
encapsulated, on cut with large hemorrhages. Material was procured in ﬁve blocks.

Micro:

Pheochromocytoma with large necroses with only focally preserved vital tumorous structures.
Cellulization with granular neutrophils, siderophagic cleaning reaction (Fe), and focally
beginning ﬁbrotization are present on the border of necrotic foci.

Vital adrenal cortex is focally subcapsular which is followed by ﬁbrous and fatty
hemmorhagic capsula. Blocks D, E contain necrotic a hemmorhagic tumorous tissue in more
than 90% cut surface. '

Imunohistochemic examination:

Chromogranin is in tissue strongly positive, adrenal cortex and periadrenal adipose tissue with
reactive ﬁbrosis and posthemmorhagic cleaning reaction are negative. MIBl 3-5% tumor cell
nuclei positive

CD34, FVIII - no angioinvasion was found

8100 — sustentacular cells only sporadically positive
