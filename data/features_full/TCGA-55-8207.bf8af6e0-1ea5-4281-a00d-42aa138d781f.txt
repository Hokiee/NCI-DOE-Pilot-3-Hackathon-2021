Clinical History
Left loWer lobe lung cancer

Specimen

#1 Level 4 left lymph node

#2 Level 2 left lymph node

#3 Level 7 lymph node

#4 Level 4 right lymph node

#5 Level 11 lymph node

#6 Bronchial margin main bronchus and superior segment bronchus
#7 Additional Level 11 lymph node

#8 Bevel 10 lymph node

Gross Examination

#1 The first specimen received fresh, level 4 left lymph node, is a 1.1 x
0.5 x 0. 5 cm blue— gray and tan— pink aggregate of soft tissue. All of the tissue
is submitted for frozen section in one block.

#2 The second specimen received fresh, labeled level 2 left lymph node, is a
1.2 x l. -O x 0. 6 cm aggregate of dark blue- -gray and tan-pink soft tissue. All of
the tisSue is submitted for frozen section in one block.

#3 The third specimen received fresh labeled level 7 lymph node, is a 0.6 x
0.5 x 0.2 cm aggregate of two pieces of blue—gray, soft tissue. All of the
tissue is submitted for frozen section in one block. ‘

#4 The fourth specimen received fresh, level 4 right lymph node, is a 1.5 x
1.0 x O. 5 cm aggregate of blue- gray tissue fragments. All of the tissue is
submitted for frozen section in two blocks.

#5 Labeled level 11 lymph node is a 2.4 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm aggregate of three

fragments of red-black lymphoid tissue. It is entirely submitted as five
sections in three: "A"—"C". Block Summary: "A", two smaller fragments, entirely
submitted; "B","C", largest fragment, trisected.

#6 Received fresh for Frozen Section, placed in formalin and labeled bronchial
margin, main bronchus and superior segment bronchus, is a 326.8 gram, 15.0 x
11.5 x 4.5 cm lobe of lung. The bronchial margin is submitted'for Frozen Section
as "3FS". Adjacent to the bronchus is a 6.5 cm long staple line. Approximately
5.0 cm from the bronchus on the opposite surface of the lobe, the pleura is
focally retracted over an area of 2.5 cm (inked black). Sectioning through this
area demonstrates a 4.0 x 3.8 x 2.2 cm ill-defined pale tan grey mass, coming to
within 0.1 cm of the overlying pleura, and 3.5 cm from the bronchial margin.

The parenchyma otherwise is dark red to tan red, soft and spongy. There are no
additional lesions identified. There are no lobar lymph node candidates
identified. Seven representatiVe sections are submitted in five: "A—E". Block
summary: "A", vascular margin, tangential; "B—D", mass with overlying pleura
(inked black), perpendicular; "E", uninvolved parenchyma. ‘

#7 Labeled additional Level 11 lymph node, is a 2.3 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm portion of
dark grey red soft tissue, bisected and entirely submitted in one cassette.

#8 Labeled Level 10 lymph node, is a 1.1 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm ovoid fragment of dark
grey red soft tissue, bisected and entirely submitted in one cassette.

Frozen Section Diagnosis

#1 LYMPH NODE, 4L, BIOPSY: (1 ES): NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA. -
#2 LYMPH NODE, LEVEL 2 LEFT .(1 ES): NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA. -

#3 LYMPH NODE LEVEL 7 (1 FS): NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA. -

#4 LXMPH NODE, LEVEL 4 RIGHT; (2 FS): NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA. -

#6 BRONCHIAL MARGIN, MAIN BRONCHUS AND SEGMENT OF BRONCHUS (1FS): BRONCHIAL

MARGIN, NEGATIVE. REPORTED TO DR. —

Microscopic Examination _
#1-8 Microscopic examination performed. An elastic tissue stain was performed
on two blocks from specimen #6 to assist with pleural status assessment.
