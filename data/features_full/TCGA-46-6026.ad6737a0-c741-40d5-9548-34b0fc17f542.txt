3 3- : GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. The specimen is submitted fresh for frozen section as "right lower
lobe frozen section margins (bronchial)" and consists of a lobe of lung
weighing 311 grams and measuring 18 x 14 X 5 cm. The pleural surface is
pink, focally hemorrhagic and smooth with a puckered area, located in the
anterior aspect measuring 2.5 cm. The main bronchus and vessel margins
have been sealed with metallic staples. After removal the bronchial
margin measures 0.4 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter. Vessels measure
up to 0.3 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. The pleural surface at the
area of the puckering will be marked with black dye. Sectioning exhibits
a firm.gray mass measuring 4 x 3 x 2.5 cm.which approaches to within

2.5 cm of the bronchial margin. A portion of the tumor is necrotic, soft
and friable. Further Sectioning of the lung is unremarkable exhibiting
pink spongy air—filled tissue. Representative sections are submitted,
cassettes as follows:

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: Bronchial margin, negative for tumor -

Cassette 1 Vessel margin

Cassette 2 Tumor showing adjacent vessel

Cassettes 3 through 6 Random sections of tumor showing puckered
pleura

Cassette 7 Tumor showing adjacent normal lung tissue

Cassette 8 Normal air filled lung tissue

FSP Bronchial margin of resection, used for

 

frozen section

 

 

B. The specimen is submitted fresh as ”4R right lower paratracheal" and
consists of multiple segments of yellow adipose tissue having an aggregate
dimension of 4 x 3 x 1 cm. Sectioning exhibits six tan to grey black
lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 to 1 cm. The lymph nodes are submitted
intact and in toto, 6 (l).

C. The specimen is submitted fresh as "Level 7 subcarinal" and consists
of six grey black lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 to 1.2 cm; submitted intact

and in toto, 6 (l).
D. The specimen is submitted fresh as "posterior 10R right

tracheobronchial angle“ and consists of three tan to tan brewn tissue
fragments ranging from 0.4 to 0.9 cm; submitted, 3 (l).

RIGHT LOWER LOBE (LOBECTOMY):

INVASIVE MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA {4 CM).
TUMOR IS 2.5 CM FROM BRONCHIAL MARGIN AND EXTENDS TO 1 MM
FROM AND DOES NOT INVADE THE VISCERAL PLEURA.

TUMOR IS WELL CIRCUMSCRIBED WITH EXTENSIVE NECROSIS AND DESMO—
PLASTIC STROMAL REACTION.

NON—NEOPLASTIC LUNG PARENCHYMA SHOWS MODERATE EMPHYSEMATOUS
CHANGE.

LYMPHOHVASCULAR INVASION IS NOT IDENTIFIED.
ALL SURGICAL MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
