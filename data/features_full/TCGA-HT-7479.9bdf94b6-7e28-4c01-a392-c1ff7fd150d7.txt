ADDENDUM DISCUSSION:

Most of the neoplastic cells are reactive for GFAP, however, some of the
larger cells with halos are GFAP negative. Neu-N demonstrates that the tumor
cells are negative for Neu-N with only cortical neurons being positive. The
atypical cells, including the large cells without obvious processes are

strongly reactive for p53, suggesting astrocytic lineage. There is variable
immunoreactivity for MlB-l. Slide 1A has a labeling index of <0.5% while 2A
demonstrates a labeling index of up to 9.2%.

ADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS:

1, 2. BRAIN TUMOR, BIOPSY AND RESECTION:
ANAPLASTIC ASTROCYTOMA (WHO GRADE Ill).
MlB-l LABELING INDEX = <0.5% UP T0 9.2%.

COMMENT: Despite the absence of significant mitoses, the degree of atypia,
along with the high MlB-l labeling index warrants the diagnosis of grade
Ill/anaplastic.

ADDENDUM MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:

2. Sections demonstrate a neoplastic proliferation of glial cells that

diffusely infiltrate the gray and white matter. Hypercellular is quite modest.
However, atypia ranges from mild to marked. There is variably prominent
autolytic change that results in artifactual perinuclear halos surrounding
neurons in the gray matter. However, in addition, many of the atypical cells

as well as smaller cells have halos that appear to be real and likely

represent oligodendroglioma differentiation. In other areas, the tumor appears
astrocytic. No mitotic figures are seen despite the atypia. There is no
microvascular proliferation or necrosis.
