GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. Received in formalin, designated as "right external iliac tissue," are two
segments of pink and yellow soft tissue aggregating to 3.5 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm. Each
tissue segment is bisected and entirely submitted in cassettes Al—A2.

B. Received without fixative, designated as "radical resection right pelvic
sarcoma," is a 15 x 12 x 9.5 cm soft tissue mass. The outer surface is partially
covered by fatty soft tissue and skeletal muscle. The outer surface is inked blue.
The specimen is sectioned revealing an ill—defined 14.7 x 9 x 9 cm tumor with fleshy
pink—tan cut surfaces. Central areas of necrosis and cystic regions are present on
cut surface. Tissue is collected for cytogenetic analysis. Tissue is forwarded for
Additionally, representative sections are submitted in cassettes Bl—Blo.
