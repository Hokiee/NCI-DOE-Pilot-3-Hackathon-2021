ADDITIONAL REPORT FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL SECTIONS AND IMMUNONISTOCHEMISTRY:

1. Adrenal gland, left, resection: Adenocortical carcinoma, low-grade by
mitotic activity, with capsular and vascular invasion. Ki-b? proliferation

marker shows a proliferation rate above that typically found in benign tumors.

See COMMENY.

COMMENT:

This adrenocortical neoplasm has a very low mitotic activity as assessed by
count ng of mitotic figures. The Ki- -67 proliferation marker shows a
proliferation rate that is consistent with the diagnosis of low grade
adrenocortical carcinoma. In addition. research innmnostains show a similar
proliferation rate using topoisomerase 2 alpha. Furthermore the tumor shows
diffuse nuclear immunoreactivity for cyclin E which is also consistent with a
diagnosis of carcinoma. (These research stains are not performed by a
certified lab and therefore are not billed to the patient

1. ”Left adrenal” Received fresh in a medium container is a 110 gram adrenal

with a scant amount of attached yellow adipose, 7. 9 x 6. 2 x 5. 7 cm. The cut

surface is remarkable for a 6.2 x 5.3 x 6. 0 cm, tan- brown, faintly- nodular,

soft, uell- circumscribed tumor. The tumor has focal areas of bright yellow

necrosis occupying approximately 15% of the cut surface. Tumor abuts the

margin. A 1.1 x 2. 3 x 0.5 cm segments of normal adrenal gland is present. no

other abnormalities are noted. Photographs have been taken.
