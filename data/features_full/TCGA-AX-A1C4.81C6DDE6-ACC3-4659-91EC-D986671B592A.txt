examination of the slides (and/or other material) and that I have
reviewed and approved this report.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Endometrial adenocarcinoma

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. The specimen is received in formalin with proper patient
identification, labeled "anterior abdomen" and consists of three
pieces of soft tan tissue measuring 1.6 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm in aggregate.
The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.

8. The specimen is received in formalin with proper patient
identification, labeled "colic gutter is" and consists of four pieces
of soft tan tissue measuring 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm in aggregate. The
specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.

C. Specimen is received in formalin with proper patient
identification labeled "omentum" and consists of an omentectomy
specimen measuring 15 x 10 x 1.8 cm. The specimen is sectioned to
reveal unremarkable fibroadipose tissue. No nodules or mass lesions
are identified. The specimen is representatively submitted in four

labeled "Uterus, cervix, tubes, and ovaries". The specimen weighs
1990 grams and measures 19 x 17 x 16 cm. The external surface of the
uterus is distorted by multiple firm fibroid nodules. The ectocervix
measures 2.9 cm in diameter with 0.8 cm patent The ectocervical
mucosa is smooth, glistening and unremarkable. The endocervical canal
measures 3.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter with a smooth
glistening mucosa. The endometrial cavity measures 4.5 cm in length
and 2.9 cm in width. The cavity is distorted by multiple nodules.
There is a mass extending from the endometrium into the myometrial
wall. The tumor measures 3.5 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm (with 3.0 cm representing
depth from endometrial surface to tumor base). It is friable and has
a white-tan cut surface with hemorrhagic areas. It extends from the

to within 1.6 cm of the peritoneum over the anterior portion of the
uterus. The mass extends to within 2.1 cm of the anterior peritoneal
surface of the uterus _-,_ Sectioning through the myometrium
reveals numerous tan—white whorled, well circumscribed nodules without
areas of hemorrhage, necrosis, or degeneration. The largest of these
nodules measures 10 cm in greatest dimension. The right fallopian
tube measures 7.2 x 0.6 cm with an unremarkable serosa and a pinpoint

lumen. The right ovary measures 2.6 x 2.4 x 2.0 cm and has an
unremarkable granular whiteetan appearance both on the external and
internal aspects. The left fallopian tube measures 4.5 x 0.6 cm and
is distorted by sutures. There is no obvious ovarian tissue on the
left side (patient underwent left salpingo—oophorectomy in J.
Pieces of fresh tumor are saved for study. The specimen is
representatively submitted in 22 cassettes.

1- anterior cervix

2- anterior LUS

3-4 anterior full thickness section of the uterus

5- posterior cervix

6— posterior LUS

E. The specimen is received in formalin with proper patient
identification, labeled "pelvic sidewall" and consists of 4 pieces of
soft tan tissue measuring 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm in aggregate. The
specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.

F. The specimen is received in formalin with proper patient
identification, labeled "cul—de—sac" and consists of 4 pieces of soft
tan tissue measuring 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm in aggregate. The specimen is
entirely submitted in one cassette.

G. The specimen is received in formalin with proper patient
identification, labeled "bladder peritoneum" and consists of 4 pieces
of soft tan tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm in aggregate. The
specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.

H. The specimen is received in formalin with proper patient
identification, labeled "left pelvic nodes" and consists of a piece of
fibroadipose tissue measuring 6.5 x 4.0 x 1.5 cm. Multiple pink—tan
firm lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.4 to 1.6 cm in greatest

shows unremarkable serosa. Serial sectioning reveals no lesions or
signs of inflammation. Representative sections are submitted in one
