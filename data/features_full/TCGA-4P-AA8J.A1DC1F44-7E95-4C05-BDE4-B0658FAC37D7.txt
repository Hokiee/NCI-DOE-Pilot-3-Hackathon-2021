I. "Right hemiglossectomy, stitch at tip of tongue", received unfixed and
placed in formalin on Mia a right hemiglossectomy specimen,
6.5 x 4.5 x 3.2 cm in dimension. The surgeon has marked the tip of the tongue
with a black suture. The right half of the deep aspect is marked with black
ink, and the left half of the deep aspect is marked with blue ink. The

peripheral mucosal and tongue resection margins are shaved and submitted in a
clockwise fashion.

Sectioning through the tongue reveals a tanegray, well—circumscribed tumor
mass which focally ulcerates the mucosal surface of the tongue. The tumor
mass is 1.9 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm in dimension and extends into the attached floor of
mouth. The central aspect displays a central hemorrhagic area. The tumor
comes to 0.1 cm from the deep resection margin of the specimen. Representative

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
