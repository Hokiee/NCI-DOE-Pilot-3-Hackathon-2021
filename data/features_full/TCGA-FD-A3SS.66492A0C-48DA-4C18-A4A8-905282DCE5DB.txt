(8/ 12). £0
- Extranodal tumor extension present.

Surgical Pathology Report

FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS
A. Left pelvic lymph nodes; dissection:

B. Right pelvic lymph nodes; dissection:

- Two of two lymph nodes, positive for metastatic urothelial carcinoma
(2/2).

— Largest lymph nodal tumor measures 3.5 cm, with extranodal extension.

C. Right pelvic lymph nodes; dissection:

- Ten of eleven lymph nodes, positive for metastatic urothelial carcinoma
(10/ l 1).

- Extranodal tumor extension present.

D. Urinary bladder and prostate; cystoprostatectomy:

- Invasive high grade urothelial carcinoma, with mixed conventional,
micropapillary features and squamous differentiation, see pathologic parameters.
- Tumor diffusely inﬁltrates the bladder wall, involving all bladder subsites,
invades thru the muscularis propria, extends into the perivesical fat, involves
bilateral seminal vesicles, and prostatic stroma.

- Tumor involves the margin at posterior perivesical soft tissue adjacent to
prostate.

- Distal urethral margin, free of tumor.

E. Pre-sacral lymph nodes; dissection:

— One of two lymph nodes, positive for metastatic urothelial carcinoma
(1/2).

- Extranodal tumor extension present.

F. Right common iliac lymph nodes; dissection:

— One of one lymph node, positive for metastatic urothelial carcinoma
(1/ 1).

G. Left distal ureter; excision:
— Porion of ureter, no tumor.

H. Right distal ureter; excision:
- Portion of ureter with multiple microscopic tumor foci present within
lymphovascular spaces in ureteral wall and pen'ureteral fat.

7. Soft tissue margin or serosa: Positive for tumor, at posterior perivesical
soft tissue adjacent to prostate (slides D7 and D10).

8. Lymph nodes: Positive for tumor (22/28), largest lymph nodal metastasis 3.5
cm, with extranodal extension.

9. pTNM: pT4,N3,MX, R1.

Clinical History:
This is a year-old male with bladder cancer undergoing cystectomy.

Specimens Received:
A: Leﬂ pelvic lymph nodes
B: Right pelvic lymph nodes

C: Right pelvic lymph nodes

D: Bladder/ prostate

E: Pre-sacral lymph nodes

F: Right common iliac lymph nodes
G: Left distal ureter

H: Right distal ureter

Gross Description:
The specimens are received in eight containers each labeled with the patient‘s
name and medical record number.

A. The ﬁrst container is additionally identiﬁed as, "left pelvic lymph
nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 5.5x5.5x1.5cm yellow
lobulated fatty tissue. Multiple lymph nodes are identiﬁed, ranging in size
from 0.3 cm to 5 cm. They are submitted as follows:

A1: 5 nodes

A2-3: 3 nodes in each cassette

A4-6: 1 node, bisected in each cassette

A7-9: 1 node, serially sectioned

B. The second container is additionally identified as, "right pelvic lymph
nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 3.5 x 2.5x 2.5 cm yellow
lobulated fatty tissue. 2 lymph nodes are identiﬁed, measuring 3.5x 2.5x 1.5 cm
and 3.5x 1.0x 1.0 cm in size. The nodes are submitted as follows: B1 -7: bigger
node, 889: small node

C. The third container is additionally identiﬁed as, "right pelvic lymph
nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 5.5x5.5x1.9 cm yellow
lobulated fatty tissue. Multiple lymph nodes are identified, ranging in size
from 0.3cm -6.6cm. They are submitted as follows:

C 1-4: 2 nodes in each cassette

C5-6: 1 node, bisected

C7: 1 node, bisected

C8-9: 1 node, serially sectioned

ClO-l 1: 1 node, serially sectioned

D. The fourth container is additionally identified as, "bladder/prostate".

Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 433.] gram, 12.5 x 9.5 x 6.5 cm
cystoprostatectomy specimen with attached mesenteric fat. The bladder measures
7.5 x 7 x 6 cm. The right ureteral stump measures 2.1 cm and the left 2.0 cm,

and both probe patent with resistance. The prostate measures 5.1 x 4.2 x 3.8 cm.
The seminal vesicles and vas deferens are severely adhesed to the dome of the
bladder. The right seminal vesicle estimates 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm and the length

of right vas deferens cannot be determined due to severe adhesions. The left
seminal vesicle estimates 4.5 x 2 x 1.4 cm and the left vas deferens 11.5 cm

long by 0.2-0.4 cm in diameter. The right half of the prostate and bladder is

inked blue and the left half is inked black. The prostate is opened anteriorly
along the urethra and continued superiorly and laterally through the bladder.
The prostate is serially sectioned from apex to base to reveal unremarkable,
yellow parenchyma.

The bladder is diffusely involved by polypoid (0.1-0.5 cm) lesions, covering 9.0
by 6.5 cm surface area. Serial sectioning reveals tumor invasion into the
adipose tissue to a depth of 2.5 5 cm, abutting the inked margin. Right seminal
vesicle is involved by tumor. No normal mucosa is present.

Gross photographs are taken.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

D1: Left ureter margin

D2: Right ureter margin

D3: Urethral margin

D4: Prostate apex

D5-8: Representative prostate through verumontanum

D9— 12: Representative prostate above verumontanum

D13-l4: Right and left Seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia

DIS-l7: Multiple surface polypoid lesions

D18-29: Deepest invasion (Dl 8-20: One full thickness section involving seminal
vesicle, D21: Tumor involving serosa, D22 and D23: Tumor involving fat, D24-27:
One lull-thickness section tumor involving fat, D2 8-29: One full-thickness
section tumor involving fat)

E. The ﬁfth container is additionally identiﬁed as, “pre-sacral lymph nodes".
Received fresh and placed in formalin are 4 pieces of nodular tissue. 3 of them
are submitted in E1, the fourth one is bisected and submitted in E2. Remaining
specimen is entirely submitted in E3.

F. The sixth container is additionally identiﬁed as, "right common ileac".
Received fresh and placed in formalin are two nodules, measuring 2cm and 1 cm
respectively. The nodes are bisected and submitted in F l and F2.

G. The seventh container is additionally identiﬁed as, "left distal ureter,

stitch on nonmargin side". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 0.4cm in
length by 1.0 cm internal circumference segment of ureter, which is received
opened longitudinally. A stitch is present at one side of the specimen,
designating the non—margin side. The margin side is inked blue. The specimen is
sectioned longitudinally and entirely submitted in G1.

H. The eighth container is additionally identiﬁed as, "right distal ureter,

stitch on margin side". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 0.9 cm long
by 0.6 cm in diameter segment of ureter, with a stitch designating the marginal
side. This side is inked blue. The specimen is opened longitudinally and no

gross lesions are identiﬁed. The ureter is entirely submitted as H1.
