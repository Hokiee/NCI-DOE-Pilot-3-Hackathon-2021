hual Diagnosis:
Brain, left frontal lobe, excision: Grade 2 (of 4) oligodendroglioma (WHO grade II of 111).

Immunohistochemical stains for MIB—i was performed on a parafﬁmembedded sections of the brain lesion. The
MIB—l labeling index is low, supporting the above diagnosis.

Results of FISH for 1p19q will be reported in an addendum.

 

ADDENDA:

1p and 19g FISH studies were performed on cells within parafﬁn sections from tumor. Two hybridizations were
performed: one with a 19q probe/control 19p pair and one with a 1p probe/control Iq pair. The 19:11 and 1p probes
mapped to the regions that are commonly deleted in gliomas. The 19q to 19p probe ratio was 0.60. The 1p to Iq
probe ratio was 0.57 . For both probes, the normal ratio is approximately 1. Any ratio less than 0.80 is consistent

with deletion of the chromosomal region of interest.

The results are abnormal and consistent with deletion of 1p and 19g. Similar results have been observed in glioma
specimens, especially oligodendrogliomas.
