1.5 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm firm white stellate mass. A short suture designates the
superior and a long suture the lateral margin. The deep margin is inked blue,
superior black, and inferior red. The firm mass is 0.8 cm from its closest
margin (the superior-inferior border on the anterior surface) and 1 cm its
next nearest margin, the deep margin. Lateral to the mass and distinct from
it is a region of extensive rubbery, white fibrous tissue. A portion of the
mass is submitted for ER/PR. The entire tumor and its surrounding tissue, and
representative sections of the fibrous region are submitted sequentially from
medial to lateral in Blocks Al—A14. with the tumor in Blocks A2—A8.
