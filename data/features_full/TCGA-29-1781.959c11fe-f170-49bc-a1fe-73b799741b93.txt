CLINICAL HISTORY:
History of breast cancer—new pelvic mass CA 125 =1625.

GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. "Omentum (AF1)". Received fresh for frozen section is a 14.5 x 9.9 x 3.8 cm

aggregate of yellow lobulated adipose tissue. There are multiple tanuwhite
firm nodules ranging from 0.4 cm to 2.9 cm in greatest dimension comprising
approximately 55% of the specimen. Fecal areas of central softening and
hemorrhage are identified. A representative section is submitted as frozen
section AFl. The frozen section remnant is submitted in block A1. An
additional representative section is submitted in block A2.

8. “Omenturn”. Received fresh and placed in formalin on — is i

a 18 x 13.5 x 4'cm aggregate of yellow lobulated adipose tissue. There are

multiple tan-white firm nodules ranging from 0.2 cm to 3.5 cm in greatest ;
dimension comprising approximately 40% of the specimen with focal areas of '
softening, hemorrhage, and necrosis are identified. Representative sections

are submitted in blocks Bl—BZ.

C. "Appendix". Received fresh and placed in formalin on—

is a 7 cm long x 0.6 cm in diameter intact vermiform appendix. Upon
sectioning, the lumen is patent with an average wall thickness of 0.3 cm. The
distal tip is questionable for wall thickening. The mesenteric fat {1.5 cm) is
remarkable for multiple tan—white firm nodules ranging from 0.2 cm up to 1.6
Cm in greatest dimension.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Cl- proximal margin (inked blue), appendiceal cross sections and tip
(longitudinal). '
C2— nodules.

D. “Right tube and ovary". Received fresh and placed in formalin on F
—is a 42.1 gram, 2.8 x 2.1 x 1.5 cm right ovary and attache 1 me.

No portion of tube is grossly identified. The ovary is focally disrupted with
with adherent tan—white firm nodules ranging from 0.2 cm to 1.1 cm in greatest
dimension. Sectioning reveals complete effacement of the ovarian parenchyma by
tan—white nodules with marked areas of necrosis and hemorrhage, which are
contiguous with the aforementioned surface nodules.

Attached to the ovary is a 9 x 3 x 1.6 cm fragment of soft tissue. There are
multiple firm tan—white nodules ranging from 0.4 cm to 1.9 cm in greatest
dimension. Sectioning of the nodules reveal a tan-white cut surface with
central areas of softening and hemorrhage.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

D1~ ovary with adjacent disruption (capsule and disruption— blue).
D2— ovary with overlying capsule (capsule—blue).

03— ovary with overlying capsule,(capsule—blue).

D4~ fimbria

D5— soft tissue nodules.

" tube and ovary”. Received fresh and placed in formalin on
is a 31.3 gram, 4 x 3.4 x 2.7 cm left ovary with an attached portion
of fallopian tube (1.9 cm long x 0.4 cm in diameter} and fimbria. The ovary is
intact with multiple tan—white firm nodules adherent to the surface.
Sectioning reveals complete effacement of the ovarian parenchyma by tan—white

nodules with areas of frank necrosis, hemorrhage and cystic spaces.

Also attached is a 3.9 x 2.5 x 1 cm fragment of soft tissue. There are
multiple firm, tan—white nodules which upon sectioning reveals a homogenous
white cut surface with areas of focal hemorrhage. a

#15 a 55.2 gram, 6.8 x 4 x 1.8 cm hysterectomy specimen.

mu 1p e firm, tan—white nodules on the anterior serosa ranging from 0.3 cm to

0.9 cm in greatest dimension. The remainder of the serosa is focally

erythematous. The ectocervix (2.5 x 2.4 cm) is tanmwhite, smooth and

glistening with a central patent cs (1.2 cm). The specimen is opened to reveal

a 2.1 x 3.6 cm endometrial cavity lined by a 0.2 cm endometrium which overlies

a 1.8 cm thick myometrium. One of the nodules on the anterior surface invades

into the myometrium 0.4 cm from the endometrium, and has a tan—white cut

surface with central softening.
BLOCK SUMMARY:

Fl— anterior endo and ectocervix.

F2— posterior endo and ect0cervix.

F3— anterior endomyometrium with invading nodule.
F4- anterior endomyometrium.

F5—F6- posterior endomyometrium.

FT—FB— soft tissue nodules.

G. "Mesenteric nodule". Received fresh and placed in formalin on
is a 2.4 x 2.2 x 0.5 cm aggregate of tan-white firm tissue. The

specimen is entirely submitted in blocks Gl—G2.

H. "sigmoid colon". Received fresh and placed in formalin on
is a 20.7 cm long x 3.8 cm in circumference segment of unoriented colon
attached mesenteric fat. The serosa is remarkable for diffuse firm,
tan—white nodules ranging from 0.2 cm to 2.9 cm in greatest dimension. There
is no gross invasion of the nodules through the muscularis. The colonic mucosa

is tan—brown and grossly unremarkable.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Hl-3— margins, tangential.
H4HH5- serosal nodules adjacent to colonic mucosa.

I. ”sigmoid donut". Received fresh and placed in formalin on—

- is a 3 x 2.1 x 0.6 cm aggregate of two fragments of tissue consistent
with colon. The specimen is unremarkable and submitted entirely in blocks

Il~I3.

That tumor was reported to be weakly positive for
, nega 1ve for progesterone receptor, and negative for

HERZ/neu overexpression (repeat receptor analysis here has been requested, and
will be reported separately}. As described above, there are multiple areas of
metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma. Immunoperoxidase stains of the
tumor in block D1 are positive for cytokeratin 7, CA125, and WTl and are
negative for BRST—Z, CK20, mamoglobulin, TTF—l, CDXZ, and calretinin. This
pattern of staining, along with the light microscopic appearance of the tumor,
are most consistent with a primary ovarian adenocarcinoma, very poorly
differentiated, presumably serous type. .

In the tip of the appendix, there is an adenocarcinoid tumor ("goblet cell
carcinoid“). This tumor is morphologically quite distinct from the much more
extensive metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Immunostains of the
adenocarcinoid tumor in block Cl of the appendix are positive for
chromogranin, synaptophysin and cytokeratin 20 and are negative for
cytokeratin 7.
