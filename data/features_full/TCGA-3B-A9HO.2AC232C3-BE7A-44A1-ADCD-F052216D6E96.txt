Tumor measures ‘25 x 15 x 8 cm.

Tumor focally involves the distal pancreas and approaches to the adrenal gland and

Surgical margins (renal artery and vein margin, ureteral margin, pancreatic margin,

Comment

The turner is composed of well-differentiated liposarcoma component and dediﬂerentiated component.
The dedifferentiated portion is of seindle cells with marked nuclear pleomorphism and frequent mitotic
activity in the background of inﬂammation. Tumor necrosis is present-

Gross Description

A. The specimen is labeled ”gonadal vascular margin.“ The specimen consists of an unoriented
fragment of blood vessel measuring 9.? cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. There is a moderate

amount of adipose tissue attached to the blood vessel. The specimen is serially sectioned and
Submitted entirely in 4 cassettes, A1 -A4.

B. The specimen is labeled "left radical resection of retroperitoneal sarcoma, left nephreclomy,
distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, adrenalectomy, stitch marks pancreatic margin.“ The specimen
consists of a left total nephrectomy {it x 6 x 4.5 cm weighs 160 9}, left adrenalectomy {5.5 x 2 x 6.3
on}, distal pancreatectomy (4.5 x 4 x 1.5 cm), splenectomy B x 6 x 3 cm weighs 182 g). Adjacent to
the splenic hilum, there is a portion of greater omentum, which measures 15 x 12 x. 1 cm. The. kidney
and adrenal gland are surrounded by a large amount of retroperitoneai lobulated adipose tissue
ranging from 1 to 3.5 cm in thickness. The specimen measures in overall dimension 25 x “$5 at 8 cm
and weighs 1889 9. Vascular, ureteral and pancreatic resection margins are stapled. Prior to
sectioning, the specimen is inked as follows:

Anterior aspect of the distal pancreas: Green

Stapled pancreatic resection margin: Black

The remainder of the retroperitoneal adipose tissue resection margin and peritoneum:
Blue.

Orr sectioning, the perinephric adipose tissue adjacent to the superior pole of the kidney reveals an
irregular-to-roughly ovoid, rubbery, solid, ill-deﬁned tumor, which measures 4.8 x 4.5 x 3.? cm. The
tumor focally involves the cortex of adrenal gland, distal pancreas, and extends to within 1 cm of the
closest pancreatic stapled resection margin and 1.5 cm of the closest retroperitoneal adipose tissue
resection margin. The tumor bulges but does not appear to extend through the peritoneum covering
anterior aspect of the specimen. The tumor is 1 cm from the renal capsule of the superior pole of the
kidney. Cut section of the tumor is tan, homogenous without evidence of necrosis or hemorrhage.
The remainder of the adrenal gland and pancreatic parenchyma are grossly unremarkable. On
sectioning, the remainder of retroperitoneal adipose tissue reveals a pale yellow, tabulated, grossly
unremarkable cut surface. On sectioning, the kidney reveals a single subcapsular cystic lesion, which
is located in the inferior pole measuring 2 cm in diameter. The cyst is filled with a moderate amount of
tau-brown fluid- Inner wall of the cyst is ten, smooth, and glistening. The remainder of the renal
parencbyma is grossly unremarkable. Attached to the kidney is 4 cm length of ureter, which is grossly
unremarkable. tipon opening the renal pelvis and color exhibit tan, smooth, glistening urothelium.
The renal artery and vein and their branches are grossly unremarkable- There are portions of splenic
artery and vein attached to the spleen averaging 3 cm in length. The resection margins of the splenic
artery and vein are stapled and located 2.5 cm from the tumor. On sectioning, the spleen reveals a
single, irregular, subcapsular hematoma, which measures 2.5 x 3 x 0.5 cm. The remaining splenic
pulp is dark red—brown, and grossly unremarkable. No lymph nodes are identified within the hilum of
the spleen and the kidney. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted to the Tissue
Procurement Laboratory. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted in 30 cassettes as
follows:

Bl: Renal artery and vein-

BE: Resection margin of the ureter.

83-84: Tangential sectioo of the pancreatic parenchyrnal resection margin.

BS.

Resection margins of the sptenic artery and vein.

86-312: Tumor involving adrenal gland-

313—815:Additionai sections of the tumor with overlying peritoneum.

3:17.321: Tumor involving distal pancreas.

822823: Retroperitoneal adipose tissue resection margin closest to the tumor,

perpendicular section.

824: Tumor in relation to the superior pole of the kidney.

325—826: Subcapsular renat cyst.

BET-328: Subcapsular splenic hematoma.

329-830: Additional sections of the perihephric adipose tissue, posterior aspect.
C. The specimen is labeled additionai retroperitoneal margin.“ The specimen consists of

multiple irregular unoriented fragments of pale-yeilow tabulated focally hemorrhagic adipose tissue
measuring 8 x 6 x 2. 5 cm in aggregate. There are foot of hemorrhage ranges from 0 i to t 5 cm in
greatest dimension. No residual tumor or other lesions are grossly identified. Representative sections
of the specimen are submitted in 4 cassettes, 01-04.

D. The specimen is labeled "lateral margin.“ The specimen consists of an irregular, enoriented
fragment of tabulated adipose tissue measuring 3 x t .5 x 0.6 cm. Prior to sectioning, the specimen is
inked black- The specimen is serially sectioned and is submitted entirety in 4 cassettes, 01434.
