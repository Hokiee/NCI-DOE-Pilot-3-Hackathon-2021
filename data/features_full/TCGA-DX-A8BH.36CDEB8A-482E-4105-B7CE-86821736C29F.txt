DIAGNOSIS: 64/6, I
1. Radical resection right flank; resection:
- High grade malignant fibrous histiocytoma (undifferentiated
pleomorphic sarcoma). pleomorphic type, infiltrating skeletal muscle and

d
fibroadipose tissue, morphologically similar to previous material WIND I5

 

- There is a focal myxoid component present composed less than 10% o!
the tumor.

- Tumor size: 9.7 x 3.0 x 4.0 cm

— Tumor shows about 10% necrosis.

- Vascular invasion is not identified

- Surgical margins are free of tumor; but focally < 0.1 cm microscopic
clearance on the inferior margin, posterio-lateral margin and deep margin.

Note: Imunostains for 3100 and M45 have been ordered, since were not done
on the initial biopsy immo-work-up and the results will be reported as an
addendum.

Gross Description:

1) The specimen is received fresh, labeled “Right flank. long stitch
postero—lateral: short stitch superior“ and consists of an oriented, 9.7 x
8.0 x 4.0 cm soft tissue mass with partially overlying. 9.0 x 7.0 x 3.2 cm
smooth tan-white skin ellipse. The specimen is oriented as follows: long
stitch postero-lateral, short stitch superior. The specimen is inked as
follows: Superior -- blue, inferior -- green, postero— lateral -- orange.
anterior -- yellow, and deep -- black. The specimen is sectioned to reveal
a 6.7 x 6.0 x 3.3 cm, multinodular, firm, diffusely building, well tan-white
nodule, located <0.l cm from both the deep margin and the postero—lateral
margin, 0.1 cm from both the superior and inferior margins, 0.2 m from the
skin surface, andl.2 cm from anterior margin. The remaining specimen
consists of meaty red muscle surrounded by adipose tissue. Representative
sections are submitted to TPS and for permanent. Photographs are taken.

Summary of sections:

SM -- superior margin. perpendicular
IM -- inferior margin, perpendicular
AM -- anterior margin, perpendicular
