SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Patient: Specimen #:

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY:
—year—old with diagnosis of breast cancer, 1.0 cm spiculated mass right

breast.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, , I ,
designated "RIGHT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE" consists Of a 2.0 x 1.6 x
1.0 cm piece of fatty tissue containing a 1.0 cm lymph node. The node is
bisected and a 1.0 mm thick section of one of the halves is submitted for
the CBCP protocol.

Cassette key:

A1: Bisected lymph node.
A2: Remainder of the fatty tissue.

B. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, a,
designated "RIGHT BREAST MASTECTOMY" consists of a 950.0 gram simple
mastectomy specimen, measuring 22.5 cm medial to lateral, 21.0 cm superior
to inferior, and 3.8 cm anterior to posterior. The overlying ellipse of
nipple bearing skin measures 15.0 x 7.5 cm and is notable for a
well-healed, curvilinear scar 4.3 cm in length, near the superior lateral
edge. The specimen is oriented with sutures. The anterior margin is inked
blue, the posterior margin is inked black. Sectioning reveals a 2.0 cm
area of indurated area in the lower inner quadrant at the 5:00 position,
abutting the anterior medial margin. The remaining tissue is predominantly
fatty and unremarkable. Multiple tissue sections taken for the '—
protocol; matching paraffin sections are as follows:

B1: Skin, lateral tip.

B2—B4: Tumor.

B5: Fibrofatty tissue, 2.0 cm from tumor, lower inner quadrant.

B6: Fibrofatty tissue, 14.0 cm from tumor, lower outer quadrant.
B7: Fibrous tissue, 15.0 cm from tumor, upper outer quadrant.

B8: Fibrofatty tissue, 9.0 cm from the tumor, upper inner quadrant.
B9—B10: Nipple. 10C16

C. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient’s name,

designated "RIGHT BREAST INFERIOR TISSUE" consists of a 6.5 x 6.0 X
3.5 cm fragment of fatty tissue. The surface is inked in black. Sectioning
reveals predominantly fatty tissue with a minimal fibrous component.
Representative sections from throughout the lesion are placed in cassettes
Cl through C5.

D. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name,
designated "LEFT BREAST MASTECTOMY" consists of a 1540.0 gram simple
mastectomy specimen measuring 24.5 cm medial to lateral, 19.0 cm superior

Patient: Specimen #:

GROSS DESCRIPTION (continued):

to inferior, and 5.0 cm anterior to posterior. The overlying ellipse of
nipple bearing skin measures 21.0 x 11.5 cm. The specimen is oriented with
sutures and inked as follows: Blue=anterior, black=posterior. Sectioning
reveals predominantly fat and admixed patches of white, fibrous tissue. No
discrete masses are identified. One section of skin and one section of
fibrofatty tissue from each quadrant is submitted for the protocol.
Matching paraffin sections are as follows:

D1: Skin.

D2: Upper outer quadrant.

D3: Upper inner quadrant.

D4: Lower inner quadrant.

D5: Lower outer quadrant.

D6: Nipple.

D7: Upper outer quadrant.

D8: Upper inner quadrant.

D9: Lower inner quadrant.

D10: Lower outer quadrant.
