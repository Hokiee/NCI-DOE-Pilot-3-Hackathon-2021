apex, and right midgland (up to 0.2 cm).
Extraprostatic extension: Present, left base.

Margins: Negative. Tumor very close (less than 1 mm) to inked margin in sections from left mid and left base.

Lymph-vascular invasion: Present, left mid.
Perineural invasion: Present, left mid and left base.
Seminal vesicle invasion: Not identified.
Treatment effect on carcinoma: Not applicable.

Lymph nodes: Eight lymph nodes, negative for malignancy (0/8).

Additional pathologic ﬁndings: None.

Ancillary studies: DNA ploidy will be performed and results REPORTED IN AN ADDENDUM.

Pathologic staging: pT3a.
Biorepository sample (if applicable): Tumor present.

Block(s) containing malignancy suitable for additional testing: A9, At 1, A13.

The cancer cells are DNA aneuploid.

DlA ploidy test results have been validated by our laboratory for fonnal'n-ﬁxed, parafﬁn embedded tissue sections. Analysis was performed using the
instrument , which determined DNA ploidy status by comparing the DNA content of tumor cells and control cells (selected by operator). This
test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by This test has not been cleared or approved

by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Proliferation index Ki-67 (MlB-l) = 4.68%.

Method: lmmunohistochemical staining of the Ki-67 antigen in formalin-ﬁxed paraffin-embedded tissue sections has been validated by our laboratory, using the
MlB~l clone and n nroorietary detection system. All controls show appropriate reactivity. Image collection and analysis is performed using the

instrument. , The .' renders the percentage of positive staining tumor nuclei (tumor selected by operator). This test was deveIOped and
