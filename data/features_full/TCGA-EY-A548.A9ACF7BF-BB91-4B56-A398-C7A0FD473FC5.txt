into

anterior and posterior lower uterine segment and involving
mucosa of posterior

endocervix

endocervix. No

cervical stromal invasion is identified.

carcinoma

(0/12), see additional sections

Other pathologic findings:

— Uninvolved cervix with Nabothian cyst, hyper— and
parakeratosis and acute and

chronic cervicitis

— Leiomyoma with hyalinization , size ranging from 4 mm to 3.2
cm

— Adenomyosis with involvement by carcinoma (see comment)

— Scant uterine serosal adhesions

— Background atrophic endometrium

AJCC Pathologic Stage: pTla pNO
FIGO (2008 classification) Stage grouping: IA

These stages are based on information available at the time of
this report, and

are subject to change pending additional information and
clinical review.

Ovary, right, oophorectomy:

— Atrophic with surface inclusion glands and cysts, and scant
adhesions

- No malignancy identified

Ovary, left, oophorectomy:

- Atrophic with endosalpingiosis, Leydig cell hyperplasia and
scant adhesions

— No malignancy identified

Fallopian tube, right, salpingectomy:
— No significant pathologic abnormality

Comment:
Immunohistochemistry (CD10) is performed on A8 and demonstrates
endometrial

glands and stroma within adenomyosis involved by carcinoma. No
invasive
carcinoma is identified.

Clinical History:
-year-old with endometrial cancer.

Gross Description:

Specimen A is received in one appropriately labeled container,
additionally

labeled "uterus, tube, ovaries, cervix."

Block Summary:

A1 — anterior cervix

A2 — perpendicular of anterior lower uterine segment
A3,A4 — each contains full thickness anterior corpus, A4
contains intramural

nodule

A5 - posterior cervix

A6 - perpendicular of posterior lower uterine segment
A7,A8 — posterior corpus, full thickness, bisected
A9 — mass with uninvolved endometrium

A10 — intramural nodule

All — left ovary

A12 — right ovary

A13 — right fallopian tube

A14 - right fimbria, longitudinally sectioned

Specimen B is received in a formalin-filled container labeled
"left pelvic lymph

node" and consists of a 3.0 x 1.7 x 0.6 cm portion of adipose
tissue that is

bisected for lymph node candidates. Three lymph nodes are
identified ranging

from 0.3 cm in greatest dimension up to 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm in
greatest

dimension. The largest node has a speckled gray/white cut
surface.

Block Summary:

81 — two lymph nodes

B2 ~ one lymph node, serially sectioned

B3-B4 — remainder of specimen for potential lymph node
candidates,

Specimen C is received in a formalin—filled container labeled
"right pelvic

lymph node" and consists of two fragments of adipose tissue (5.1
x 2.5 x 1.2 cm)

in aggregate that are bisected for lymph node candidates. Eight
lymph nodes are

identified ranging from 0.5 cm in greatest dimension up to 3.2 x
1.7 x 0.9 cm in

greatest dimension. Three of the lymph nodes have a gray/white
speckled cut

surface.

Block Summary:

Cl — two lymph nodes, each bisected, one inked blue, the non
inked lymph

node has the gray/white speckled cut surface

C2-C3 - one lymph node, serially sectioned, containing
gray/white speckled

cut surface

C4—C6 — one lymph node, serially sectioned, containing
gray/white speckled

cut surface

C7 — four lymph nodes

C8—C9 - remainder of specimen for potential lymph node
candidates,

For cases in which immunostains are performed, the following
applies:
Appropriate internal and/or external positive and negative

controls have been
evaluated. Some of the immunohistochemical reagents used in this
case may be
classified as analyte specific reagents (ASR). These were
developed and have
performance characteristics determined by the Anatomic Pathology
Dep rtment . These reagents have not been cleared or
ap roved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA

5 determined
that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests
are used for
clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as
investigational or for
research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical
Laboratory
Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform

clinical laboratory testing.
