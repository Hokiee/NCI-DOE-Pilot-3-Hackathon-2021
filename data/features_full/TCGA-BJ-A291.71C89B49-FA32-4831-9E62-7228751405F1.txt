COMMENT:

As Indicated above. we have demonstrated two foci of papillary carcinoma in the right lobe which measure 0.3 cm
(follicular variant I and 1.5 cm.( encapsulated with oncocycytic features: no capaular invasion is seen) Both of those foci
are conﬁned to the thyroid gland with no angiolymphatlc or extrathyroidal extension. Marglna are free of tumor.

Few of the lymphold folllcloe aeaoclated with due Iymphocytlc thyroldltie ehow atypical features, hence the
hematopathologleta were consulted for thelr opinion. The general consensus is that the folliclee are reactive.

Molecular studlea are being performed on both the fool and the results will follow in an addendum.
