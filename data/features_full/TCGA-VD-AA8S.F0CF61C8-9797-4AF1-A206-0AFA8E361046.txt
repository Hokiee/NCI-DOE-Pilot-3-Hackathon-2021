MICROSCOPY

Histologically, the enucleated eye demonstrates a normal
anterior segment with an unremarkable cornea, a deep
anterior chamber and open angles. The iris leaves are
unremarkable. The ciliary muscles are moderately atrophic.
There is mild hyalinisation of the ciliary processes. The
lens shows moderately advanced cataractous changes.

In the posterior segment, close to the optic nerve head, a
choroidal melanoma can be seen. This is dome—shaped with a
small accompanying exudative retinal detachment. The retina
overlying the tumour is atrophic with degenerative changes.
Focally, at the apex of the tumour, there is retinal
invasion.

The tumour is partially pigmented and consists predominantly
of spindle cells. The melanoma cells are immunoreactive for
MelanA, CD117 and ESP—27 (score 3).

The number of mitoses is approx. 2/40 high power fields.

The microvasculature of the melanoma is not prominent, and
closed loops are not present in the tissue planes evaluated.
Occasional "vascular lakes” can be observed; in these tumour
cells can be see located within the lumen. The lymphocytic
infiltrate within tumour is minimal. Macrophages are
scattered throughout the tumour in a mild density.There is
no evidence of scleral invasion or of extraocular growth.
The optic nerve is tumour free, and demonstrates mild
atrophic changes. The examined vortex veins are free of
tumour .

FINAL DIAGNOSI S

Choroidal melanoma of spindle cell type.

COMMENT

In the meantime, molecular genetic analysis of tumour DNA
extracted from the fresh uveal melanoma tissue was performed
using the technique termed multiplex ligation—dependent
probe amplification (MLPA). These investigations were
performed in the

The kit P027 from , which examines for gains or
losses in 31 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8, was used.
The DNA concentration was measured using and the
quality assessed using multiplex-PCR prior to the MLPA
reaction.

The DNA concentration was high and of good quality on
assessment. The MLPA reaction was run at least twice on
differing occasions, resulting in similar results.

The results of the sequence analysis of the MLPA products is
printed on a separate report. In summary, sequence analysis
demonstrated :

normal chromosome 1r

three borderline losses of chromosome 3,
gains of chromosome 6

and gains in chromosome 8.

These molecular data require correlation with the clinical
and morphological data for metastatic risk assessment.
