INTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:

 

 

AFS: Right ureter:
— no tumor identified

BFS: Left ureter:
- hydroureter, no tumor identified

GROSS DIAGNOSIS:

Bladder/prostate:
— margins grossly free of tumor

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Right ureter." It
consists of a segment of ureter that measures 1 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is
totally submitted for frozen section in cassette AFS.

B: The specimen is received fresh from the 0.R. and labeled "Left ureter." It
consists of a segment of ureter that measures 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The Specimen is
totally submitted for frozen section in cassette BFS.

C: The specimen is received fresh from the 0.R. and labeled "Bladder/prostate."

It consists of a cystoprostatectomy specimen measuring overall 25 x 16 x 6 cm.

The attached peritoneal fat measures 20 x 15 x 0.1 cm and is smooth and glistening.
The bladder itself measures 9 x 10 x 5 cm. The resection margins are inked black.
The bladder is opened along the anterior prostatic urethra and bladder wall to

Show the bladder to be filled with clotted blood measuring 8 x 5 x 3 cm. In

addition, there is a fungating tumor mass measuring 10 x 8 x 3 cm at the level to

the left trigone extending into the midline and disrupting the ureterovesical
junction. A second tan—pink flat granular mass is located in the bladder neck
measuring 1.5 x 1 x 1 cm. A diverticulum is located adjacent to the primary tumor
mass measuring 2.5 x 3 cm. Opening the ureters bilaterally shows the right distal
ureter to measure 8 cm in length and 0.8 cm in circumference. The left distal
ureter measures 4 cm in length and 1.5 cm in circumference, shows mild hydroureter,
and is surrounded by tumor that does not extend into the mucosa. Serial sectioning

through the tumor shows an underlying submucosal globular structure measuring 1.5 x

1.5 cm. In addition, the tumor extends grossly to the muscularis propria to

involve the surrounding perivesical fat. Sections through the second mass shows it

to appear to be limited to the mucosal surface. The prostate measures 5 x 3 x 3

cm. The prostatic urethra is 4 cm long and 3.5 cm in circumference. The

verumontanum is 1 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm. The left seminal vesicle is 4 x 1.5 x 1 cm and

the right seminal vesicle is 4 x 2 x 1 cm. Sections through the prostate reveals a

tan, firm nodular cut surface. No discrete lesions are identified grossly.

Representative sections are submitted in 34 cassettes.

D: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right pelvic lymph nodes."

It consists of multiple fragments of fat measuring 8 x 4 x 1 cm. Two lymph nodes
are identified within the fatty tissue measuring 7 x 2 x 0.8 cm and 1.5 x 1 x 0.4
cm. The largest lymph node is quadrisected and placed in cassettes D1 through D3,

the second lymph node is also placed in cassette D3, and remaining tissue is placed
in cassette D4.

 

   
 
 
 

   
   

‘1 3.: - 4 . "'3 3.1: mivj- " w" ‘ ~ ~ '7.
The specimen is receivggsin formalin and labeled "Lt pelvic LN.“ It consists
of multiple fragments of fatty tissue measuring 7.8 x 5 x 1.2 cm in aggregate.
Seven possible lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.2 to 3.5 cm in greatest
dimension. The largest lymph node is bisected and placed in cassette E1 and
remaining tissue is placed in cassettes 32 through E4. four cassettes total.

 

F: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Left ureteral margin." It
consists of a tan tubular segment of tisSue with attached fat measuring 6.5 x 2.5 x
0.4 cm. The ureter itself measures 1.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter. A
clip and black suture is located off center, therefore, the end closest o the clip
is inked black and the other end is inked red. The specimen is serially sectioned
and entirely submitted in two cassettes.

G: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Rt proximal ureter." It
consists of a segment of tan tubular tissue with attached fat with two clips placed
equidistance from either end measuring 1 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. Both

ends are inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in
one cassette.

C: Sections of the bladder show high—grade invasive papillary transitional cell
carcinoma, grade 3—4/4 with extensive necrosis, extending through the muscularis
propria to involve the perivesical soft tissue (C5,ll,14). Carcinoma in situ is
also identified (c12). Lymphovascular invasion is identified (C6). The bilateral
ureter margins of the specimen, radial and apical margins are negative for tumor.
The uninvolved bladder shows reactive urothelial atypia as well as an acutely and
chronically inflamed diverticulum. The left ureter shows mild hydroureter (C3).
Sections of the prostate show benign prostatic glandular and stromal
hyperplasia without dysplasia or malignancy. The distal prostate, apical and
radial inked margins are negative for tumor. Extensive vascular calcifications are

identified within the perivesical fat. One lymph node is identified and is free of
tumor.
