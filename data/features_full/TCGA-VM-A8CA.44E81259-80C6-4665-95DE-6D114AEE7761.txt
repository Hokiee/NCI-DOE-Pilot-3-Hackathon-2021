Frozen Section Diagnosis

Frozen section diagnosis per

lFA: "Low grade infiltrating glioma'
Gross Description

This case has two parts, each of which is received labeled with the patient's name
and medical record number. '

Specimen one is received fresh for intraoperative frozen section labeled '#1 left
frontal tumor", and consists of a 2.5 x 1.9 x 0.6 cm aggregate of tan—pink,
irregular soft tissue fragments. Touch preps are performed and approximately half
of the specimen is submitted for frozen section and subsequently for permanents in
cassette lFA. The remainder of the specimen is entirely submitted in cassette 1A.

Specimen two is received in formalin labeled 'left frontal tumor", and consists of
a 4.0 x 3.1 x 1.4 cm aggregate of tan—white, faintly hemorrhagic brain matter. The
specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes 2A—2C.

Microscopic Examination
Performed.
The frozen section diagnosis is confirmed on permanent sections.

Addendum Discussion

This addendum is issued to report the results of lp/lSq FISH on the patient‘s
previously reported oligodendroglioma. -

i
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for deletions of 1p and/or 19g
are performed on sections from block 'ZC'.

Calculated 1p/lq ratio = 0.50 (< 0.74 is deleted)
Calculated 19q/19p ratio = 0.56 (< 0.88 is deleted)

The results are interpreted as deleted for 1p and 19g. The results are interpreted
as deleted for 1p and 19q. This assay was read by

A result of a deleted 1p and 19q suggests a favorable prognosis.

Analyte Specific Reagents (ASR) are used in many laboratory tests necessary for
standard medical care and generally do not require U. S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approval or clearance. This test was developed and its
performance characteristics determined by ‘ It has not been
approved or cleared by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. This test should not
be regarded as investigational or for research use.

Appropriate controls were performed at _ , and stain
