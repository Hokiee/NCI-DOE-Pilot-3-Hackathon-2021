COPIC DESCRIPTION: ==============

AIAPC. Five indes are examined. SIide 1 shows tissue from the region of the
stapie Iine. There is infiammation but no tumor is identified Sections of
tumor appear on indes 2 through 5. This is non smaII ceii carCinoma ‘
ameasuring -about 2. 2 cm in_ maXTmaI dimenSTon The morphoiogy is that of
.pooriy differentiated adenocarCTnoma with predominantiy soiid areas. but
occasionai giand formation is identified. Foci consistent with Iymphovascuiar
invasion are present, seen on inde 3. Emphysematous Iung is present on siide
5.

8. Six indes are examined. The bronchiai margin shows no evidence of tumor
invoivement. The vascuiar margin is aIso free of tumor. Patchy emphysema is
present in the remaining Iung tissue.

C. One inde is examined. Sections of anthracotic-Iung tissue are present.
without evidence of metastatic carcinoma.

D. One inde is examined. A section of anthracotic Iymph node is

' ' No evidence of metastatic tumor is present.
