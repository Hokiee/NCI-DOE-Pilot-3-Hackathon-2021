DIAGNOSIS
(A) LEFT RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY:
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (11.5 CM MAXIMUM DIMENSION), CONVENTIONAL TYPE
(100% CLEAR CELLS),
FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 2, FOCALLY INVASIVE INTO PERINEPHRIC ADIPOSE
TISSUE AND
RENAL PELVICALYCEAL SYSTEM. (SEE COMMENT)
Margins of resection free of tumor.
Adrenal gland, no tumor present.

COMMENT

The renal cell carcinoma in the left kidney shows focal invasion into
the perinephric adipose tissue. The tumor also invades into the renal
pelvlcaiyceal system. The renal sinus adipose tissue and the renal vein
are free of tumor. Multiple additional deeper sections were examined.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY - A left radical nephrectomy specimen
(23.0 x 13.0 x 7.0 cm) including kidney (18.0 x 6.0 x 6.0 cm), adrenal

gland (4.5 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm) and perinephric adipose tissue (ranging in
thickness from 0.7 cm to 4.5 cm) present around the kidney.

A tumor (11.5 x 10.5 x 7.0 cm) is present, involving the loWer pole
of the kidney. It is well circumscribed, bright-yellow with centrat
area of hyalinized, white-gray, gelatinous scarring measuring 5.0 cm in
diameter. Focal areas of hemorrhage are noted within the tumor. The
tumor is separated from the perinephric fat by capsuie and does not
grossly infiltrate it. The tumor pushes against the renal sinus, but
does not appear to grossly invade the renal sinus adipose tissue. The
renal vein Is free of tumor.

The adjacent kidney is congested. but otherwise unremarkable. The
adrenal consists of brightâ€”yellow cortex and unremarkable medulla,
devoid of any nodules.

Representative material is submitted for possible electron microscopy,
and for the vaccine protocoi.

INK CODE: Biack- Gerota's fascia closest to the tumor.

SECTION CODE: A1, vascular and ureteral resection margin; A2-A13,
tumor, including sections with perinephric fat; A14-A17, tumor with
renal pelvis and renal sinus; A18, A19, unremarkable kidney; A20,
adrenal gland, representative section. _

CLINICAL HISTORY
None given.
