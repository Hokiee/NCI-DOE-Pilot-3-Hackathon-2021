FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

PART 'I:

RIGHT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND. RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY -—
A. RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR CELL) TYPE WITH AREAS OF HEMORRHAGE AND

NECROSIS AND FOCAL SARCOMATOID DEDIFFERENTIATION (SECTION 1H}, FUHRMAN’S NUCLEAR GRADE 4

OF 4 IN HIGHESTCRADE AREAS (14 CM EN MAXIMAL DIMENSION). CARCINOMA EPICENTER IS IN THE UPPER

POLE OF THE KIDNEY.

CARCINOMA INVADES INTO THE PERINEPHRIC ADIPOSE TISSUE AND INVOLVES THE RENAL PELVIS I SINUS.

CARCINOMATOUS ANGIOL-YMPHATIC INVASION OF SMALL VESSELS IS IDENTIFIED (SECTIONS IC,1E).

EXTRA-RENAL RENAL CELL CARCINOMA CLOSELY APPROACHES BUT DOES NOT INVOLVE THE ADRENAL

GLAND (SECTION 1H).

PROXIMAL URETER, MAIN RENAL ARTERY AND MAIN RENAL VEIN SEGMENTS ARE BENIGN.

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA IS; PRESENT AT THE PERINEPHRIC SURGICAL RESECTEON MARGIN IN THE

REGION OF THE UPPER POLE (parts 2 and 3).

NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY SHOWS NO SIGNIFICANT PATHOLOGIC CHANGES.

PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: prI N): Mx (see comment).

PART 2:
UPPER POLE MARGIN, EXCISION -— _
A. RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR CELL) TYPE WITH FOCAL SARCOMATOID DE-

DIFFERENTIATION. CARCINOMA INVOLVES MOST OF THE TISSUE SUBMITTED.
B. SMALL FRAGMENT OF SKELETAL MUSCLE WITH DEGENERATIVE CHANGES.

PART 3:
PERI-DIAPHRAGMATIC TISSUE, EXCISION —
A. RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR CELL) TYPE WITH FOCAL SARCOMATOID DE‘
DIFFERENTIATION. CARCINOMA INVOLVES MOST OF THE TISSUE SUBMITTED. r’
B. SMALL FRAGMENT OF SKELETAL MUSCLE WITH DEGENERATIVE CHANGES, ADJACENT TO THE TUMOR.

COMMENT:
Part 1: The assigned pathologic T stage ls based on the presence of contiguous renal cell carcinoma Outside the

Gerota’s fascia, adjacent to skeletal muscle.
