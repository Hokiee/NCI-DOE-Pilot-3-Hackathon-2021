GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received fresh in six parts, each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.

Part A, “#1. Mesenteric mass, small bowel X2, left colon PS", consists of a
tan/yellow soft tissue mass (32.0 x 27.8 x 14.3 cm) with two adhered unoriented
segments of small bowel (28.0 cm in length x 3.0 cm in diameter, adheres to
superficial/anterior aspect of the mass; and 24 cm in length x 4.2 cm in
diameter, adheres to posterior aspect of the mass) and an oriented adherent
large bowel (25 0 cm in length x 4.5 cm in diameter, adhere to posterior aspect
of the mass). Most of the mass are covered by fascia/peritoneum except one
area (5.0 x 4.0 cm) with exposed tumor and is labeled as deep per surgeon.
Serial section of the mass revealed a large necrotic cavity (17.0 x 14.0 x 8.0
cm) at the center of the mass that is filled with tan/pink/green/yellow
necrotic material and is communicating posteriorly with one (the 24 cm long
one) segment of small bowel along most of its length (17.0 cm). This necrotic
cavity focally erodes through the overlying fascia/peritonea at the central
anterior aspect of the mass with tan/green exudate. Representative section of
the tumor is submitted for cytogenetics, EM, quick fix. Representative section
of normal colon is also submitted for tissue banking.

communicating with the small bowel, 2 frags, 1 frag in each block,

Micro A5: Representative section of the segment of bowel that communicates with

(proximal inked black and distal inked blue), 2 frags, .

Micro A15: Representative section of the large bowel, l frag,

Part B, "#2. Omentum", consists of two fragments of tan/yellow/pink adipose

tissue (8.0 x 6.0 x 1.5, 8.0 x 5.0 x 1.0 cm) with focal tan/white fibrotic
area.

Micro Bl+BZ: Representative section of the fibrotic area of omentum, 4 frags, 2
frags in each block,

Micro BB: Uninvolved omentum, 2 frags,

Part C, #3. Left kidney“, consists of a 426 gram nephrectomy specimen (20.0 x
8.0 x 7.0 cm), including left kidney (12.0 x 6.0 x 5.5 cm0, part of the left
adrenal gland (2.0 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm) at upper pole and the surrounding perirenal
fat (measuring in thickness from 0.2 to 1.5 cm). Extending from the renal
pelvis is a.short segment of ureter (0.5 cm in length X 0.3 cm in diameter),
renal vein (0.5 cm in length x 1.0 cm in diameter), and two renal arteries (0.5
cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter each). There is no growth lesion
identified except three cortical cysts (one 2.0 cm at the upper pole, one 2.0
cm at mid—lateral side and one 0.5 cm at mid—anterior). The renal cortex is
tan/brown with a well—defined corticomedullary junction. The pelvis and
calices are covered by smooth glistening mucosa. The adrenal gland consists of
normal medulla and cortex without focal lesion. The adipose tissue is serially
sectioned and no lymph nodes are found.

ADDENDUM:

C. LEFT KIDNEY, RENAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION OF KIDNEY PARENCHYMA:

EXTENSIVE ACUTE TUBULAR INJURY WITH PROMINENT DISTENSION OF THE LUMEN
(SEE NOTE)

MODERATE CHRONIC CHANGES OF THE PARENCHYMA, INCLUDING:

— FOCAL GLOBAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS (10% OF GLOMERULI)

— TUBULAR ATROPHY AND INTERSTITIAL FIBROSIS (20% OF PARENCHYMA)
- ARTERIAL AND ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS, MODERATE

NOTE:

The kidney parenchyma shows universal tubular damage with luminal distension
and moderate chronic parenchymal changes. The pattern of tubular injury is

non-specific and can be associated with obstruction or acute tubular injury,
either toxic or ischemic in nature. In this patient it is very likely that

distal obstruction is an important contributing cause. The parenchyma also
shows moderate chronic changes most likely related to vascular damage

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:

Sections oﬁ formalin—fixed. paraffin-embedded tissue (block C4) were evaluated
using HeE, PAS, Jones' methenamine silver, and AFOG (trichrome) stains

The sample consists of cortex and medulla. There are 238 glomeruli present.
Twenty—three (23) glomeruli are globally obsolescent (sclerosed), which are
located primarily in the subcapsular cortex. Occasional hypoperfused glomeruli
are also seen. The remaining glomeruli show mild expansion of the mesangial
matrix; otherwise, the glomerular architecture is well-preserved. The
peripheral capillary walls appear normal in thickness and texture. No craters
are seen. There are widespread signs of tubular injury, characterized by
marked distension of the lumen, attenuation of the tubular epithelium, blunting
of the brush border, and cytoplasmic vacuolization. Patchy tubular atrophy is
seen and is associated with a mild—to—moderate collection of PAS—positive
hyaline and granular casts in distal segments. A patchy interstitial
lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate is also seen in association with the atrophy.
Occasional calcium phosphate deposits are present. Approximately 20% of the
sample shows tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, as demonstrated by the
trichrome stains (AFOG). Arteries and arterioles show moderate sclerosis of

the vessel walls. A vein in the corticomedullary junction exhibits muscular
hyperplasia.
