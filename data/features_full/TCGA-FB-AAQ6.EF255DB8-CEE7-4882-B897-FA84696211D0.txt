Gross Description: Distal pancreas with spleen: Received IS a 188 gram distal pancreatectomy and

spleen measuring 14.5 (ML) x 11.5 (SI) x 5.8 (AP) cm, the pancreas measures 12 (ML) x 3 (5|) x 2.5 (AP)
cm, the spleen measures

10.5 (Sl) x 5.8 (AP) x 3.5 (ML) cm. There is an indurated white-yellow

lesion in the body of the pancreas [2 (ML) x 2 (AP) x 1.4 (SI) cm], and
pancreatic tissue distal to this looks atrophic. lt is located

approximately 1 cm from the distal pancreatic margin. The tumor nodule is
greater than 5 cm from the spleen and does not grossly involve the splenic
artery or splenic vein. The spleen is serially sectioned and is grossly

normal. The splenic hilar fat and peripancreatic fat are searched for

[@330

lymph nodes. [mam WWMQLJWLWOJ 9503*?)
