SLIDE DISPOSITION:

DIAGNOSIS:

A. Abdomen, panniculectomy: Skin and subcutaneous
tissue, 1590.0

grams, identified grossly. Gross examination only.

B. Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and

bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Invasive endometrial
adenocarcinoma, endometriqig type, FIGO grade I (of III)
13 I

identified forming a mass (10.7 x 7.8 x 2.1 cm)
circumferentially

involving the endometrial cavity. The tumor invades 0.6
cm into the

myometrium (total myometrial thickness, 3.2 cm) but does
not involve

the endocervix. Lymphovascular space invasion is not
identified.

All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.
The

bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes are not involved and
are

histologically unremarkable. Selected slides seen with

C. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(24) right
pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

0. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(22) left
pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

E. Lymph nodes, additional right pelvic, lymphadenectomy:
Multiple
(3) right pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

PRELIMINARY FROZEN SECTION CONSULTATION:

B. Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and

bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Invasive endometrial
adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, invading 0.6 cm into
the

myometrium (total myometrium thickness of 3.2 cm). Hold
over to

evaluate further on permanent sections.

C. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(24) right
pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

D. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(22) left
pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

E. Lymph nodes, additional right pelvic, lymphadenectomy:
Multiple
(3) right pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled "abdominal pannus" is a 1590.0
gram

portion of skin and subcutaneous tissue without umbilicus.
No

lesions identified. Gross examination only.

B. Received fresh labeled "uterus, right and left
fallopian tubes

and ovaries" is a 460.0 gram uterus with attached
bilateral tubes

and ovaries. The uterine serosa is smooth. There is a
10.7 x 7.8 x

2.1 cm exophytic mass filling the entire endometrial
cavity. The

myometrial thickness is 3.2 cm. There are no leiomyomata.
There is

a 3.0 x 2.4 x 1.5 cm right ovary with a smooth outer
surface and a

cystic and solid cut surface with a 7.5 x 0.6 cm right
fallopian

 

 

 

tube which is unremarkable. There is a 3.4 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm
left

ovary with a smooth outer surface and a cystic and solid
cut surface

with a 7.4 x 0.5 cm left fallopian tube which is
unremarkable.

Photograph taken. Representative sections are submitted.

C. Received fresh labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes" is a
9.5 x 7.0

x 2.4 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. Lymph
nodes

submitted.

D. Received fresh labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes" is a
7.8 x 4.7

x 1.6 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. Lymph
nodes

submitted.

E. Received fresh labeled "additional right pelvic lymph
nodes" is

a 3.0 x 1.6 x 0.4 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic
tissue.

Lymph nodes submitted.
