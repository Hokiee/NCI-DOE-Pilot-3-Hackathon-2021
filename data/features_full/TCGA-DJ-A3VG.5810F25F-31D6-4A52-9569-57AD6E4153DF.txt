Gross Description: ._.__
no.
1. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "left thyroid lobe and isthmus". it consists of a left thyroid lobe and portion of isthmus
measuring 4.6 x 2.9 x 0.7 cm and weighing 7 g. The surface is smooth. The lobe is inked black posterior, blue anterior, and the
area of the isthmus yellow. Serial sectioning reveals two nodules 0.3 cm away from each other in the mid to lower thyroid
measuring 1.1 x 0.8 x 0.7 (arbitrarily designated N1) and 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm (arbitrarily designated N2). The ﬁrst nodule appears
well-circumscribed, solid, tan, firm, and bulges out of the surrounding thyroid parenchyma. 0.1 cm away from the anterior thyroid
surface. 3 submitted from the first nodule (N1). Cut section of the second nodule shows a non-descript pale appearance.
resembling nodular thyroid parenchyma. The remaining thyroid parenchyma is red and beefy. The specimen is entirely submitted.
A photograph is taken of Nodule 1.

2. The specimen is received fresh. labeled "Right thyroid lobe". it consists of a right thyroid lobe measuring 5.4 x 2.3 x 1.3 cm and
weighing 9 g. The surface is smooth. The lobe is inked black posterior, blue anterior, and the area of the isthmus yellow. Serial
sectioning reveals a tan- red, well-circumscribed nodule in the mid thyroid measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm which is 0.3 cm from the
