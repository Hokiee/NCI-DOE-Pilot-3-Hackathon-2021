Pathology Report for Date of Surgery:

Diagnosis:

Right frontal lobe tumor

Anaplastic oligodendroglioma, grade III
- MlB-l LI = 12.7%

Discussion:
Numerous MlB-l reactive cells are throughout the tumor. in the most proliferative area,
a labeling index of 12.7% is calculated.

Microscopic Description:

Sections reveal a hypercellular glial neoplasm. The tumor cells exhibit round to oval,
hyperchromatic nuclei with moderate nuclear atypia. On the frozen material, most of
the cells exhibit perinuclear halos. Foci of significant microvascular proliferation are
seen. Scattered foci of necrosis are encountered. Dystrophic calcification is noted. Up to
3 mitotic figures per 10 high power fields are encountered. These features are
consistent with high grade glioma. nib-0'3
