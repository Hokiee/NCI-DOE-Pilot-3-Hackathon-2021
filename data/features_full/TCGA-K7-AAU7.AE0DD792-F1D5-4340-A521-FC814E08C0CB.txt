FINAL DEAGNOSIS:

SEGMENT 2 & 3 LIVER--

COMBINED HEPATOCELLULARsCHOLANGIOCARCINOMA, MODERATELY
DIFFERENTIATED.

TUMOR LOCATION: SEGMENTS 2 AND 3'OF LIVER.
TUMOR FOCALITY: UNIFOCAL.
TUMOR SIZE (LARGEST FOCUS, IF MULTIFOCAL): 3.8 CM‘

LYMPH~VASCULAR INVASION:
MACROSCOPIC VENOUS INVASION: NOT PRESENT.

MICROSCOPIC SMALL VESSEL/LYMPHATIC INVASION: IS PRESENT,
EXTENSIVE.

INVASION OF MAJOR BRANCH OF PORTAL OR HEPATIC VEINS: NOT
PRESENT.

TNM STAGE: pT‘2a, pNX, pMX.
LYMPH brooms) INCLUDED IN ALL PARTS: N/A

SATELLITE LESION: IS PRESENT.

from the primary tumor, and <50% of the primary tumor's

diameter)

TUMOR NECROSIS: NONE.
SPECIMEN TYPE: SEGMENTECTOMY.

THE TUMOR IS FOCALLY PRESENT AT THE CAUTERIZED INKED PARENCHYMAL
RESECTION MARGIN.

TUMOR IS ALSO SEEN IN VASCULAR SPACES WITHIN 2—3 MM TO THE
RESECTION MARGIN.

HILAR STRUCTURES NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

SPECIMEN SIZE: 18u0 X 10.0 X 6.0 CM.

TIPS: NO

OTHER FINDINGS:

CIRRHOSIS WITH MILD TO MODERATE STEATOSIS CONSISTENT WITH
CHRONIC HEPATITIS C, GRADE 2/4, STAGE i/4.

BILE DUCT HAMARTOMA.

IRON STAINING : MILD IRON DEPOSITION IN KUPFFER CELLS AND
FOCALLY HEPATOCYTES.

Note: By immunohistochemistry, the majority of the tumor cells
are positive for CK? and CK19. Heppar,.Arginase—1 and glypican
-3 are focally positive.

These findinge support the above diagnosis.

Internal positive elements were examined and/or appropriate
positive controls were stained along side sections from this
case. The control tissue was examined and judged to be
technically acceptable.

Case Clinical Information

Gross Description

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
“segment 2 and 3 liver" is a portion of liver labeled as
segments 2 and 3 weighing 550 grams overall measuring 18 x 10 x
6 cm in dimensions with a parenchymal resection margin

measuring 12 x 4 cm, previously inked black. The exterior of
the liver has a finely uniformly nodular appearance. The
specimen has previously been partially serially sectioned
revealing a pale-brown nodular parenchyma together with a single
firm white tumor abutting the capsule measuring 3.8 x 2.5 x 1.2
cm in greatest dimension. The nodule focally approaches the
inked parenchymal margin. A 4 mm nodule is also present
separated from the main tumor by 3 mm of grossly benign liver.

A cluster of sutures is identified in the parenchyma 2 cm remote
from the tumor. Section code: Al—A2= complete cross section of
tumor in relationship to inked parenchymal resection margin;
A3—A4: tumor in relationship to small satellite nodule; A5~A11=
extensive sampling of tumor in relationship to inked parenchymal
resection margin, extensively submitted; A12: shaved, sutured
tubular structures at resection margin; A13: representative

section of hepatic parenchyma remote from tumor. No additional
tumors
