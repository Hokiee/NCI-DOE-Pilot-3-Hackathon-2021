GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. LEFT BREAST WLE NEEDLE LOCALIZATION
Received fresh with accompanying radiogram is an oriented 41 g lumpectomy specimen with
localization needle. The specimen is oriented with a single suture designating anterior, double lateral,
triple superior. The specimen measures 5.8 cm from anterior to posterior, 5.2 cm from superior to
inferior, and 2.8 cm from medial to lateral. Specimen is inked as follows: inferior-orange, superior-red,
lateral-yellow, anterior-blue, medial-green, posterior-black. Specimen is serially sectioned from superior
to inferior, there is a ﬁrm well-circumscribed white—tan nodule measuring 1 cm located 1 cm from the
nearest posterior and anterior margins, 1.8 cm from the lateral margin, 3.1 cm from the medial margin.
and greater than 3 cm from the superior and inferior margins. A gross diagnosis is conveyed to O. R. A

is submitted entirely in cassette E1.

DIAGNOSIS: /_,..
A. BREAST, LEFT. WIDE LOCAL EXCISION:
- IN¥A§IV§ DUCTAL CARCINOMA. SBR GRADE 1, MEASURING 1.2-CM
- INVASIVE TUMOR PRESENT WITHIN 0.15-CM FROM MEDIAL SURGICAL

- Low TO INTERMEDIATE NUCLEAR GRADE. DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU,
CRIBRIFORM TYPE
- DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA INVOLVING INTRADUCTAL PAPILLOMA

-METASTAT|C CARCINOMA TO ONE OF ONE LYMPH NODE (1/1),
MEASURING 0.6-MM (MICROMETASTASES) WITH NO EXTRANODAL

D. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #3, BIOPSY:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1).

«METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE OF ONE LYMPH NODE (1/1),
MEASURING 2.0-MM (MICROMETASTASES) WITH NO EXTRANODAL
EXTENSION, SEE NOTE.

E. LYMPH NODE. SENTINEL #4. BIOPSY: .

NOTE: Two foci of intraductal papilloma with usual ductal hyperplasia are identiﬁed. one adjacent to the
invasive tumor and one at the posterior surgical resection margin. p63 and calponin mark the
myoepithelial cell layer in the papilloma. Dr. concurs on this interpretation.

Micrometastases are identiﬁed in sentinel lymph nodes#1, #2 (AE 1/3 positive) and #4. The largest
tumor metastasis measures 2-mm. The touch preparations were reviewed, no tumor cells identiﬁed.
Therefore, this discrepancy is due to sampling error.

SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS
Specimen: Surgical Excision
Block Number: A18

 

ER: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3
PR: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3

 

COMMENT:

The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the
proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of
cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak
intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring
range from 0 to 8.

ERIPR positive is deﬁned as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is deﬁned as an Allred score
of less than or equal to 2.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
lmmunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 105, 1:100) and PR (PGR
136, 1:100) provided by Dako Illowing the manufacturer s instructions. This
assay was not modiﬁed. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published
results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal
review of staining performance.
