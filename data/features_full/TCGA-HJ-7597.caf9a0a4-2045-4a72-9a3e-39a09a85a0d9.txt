GROSS DESCRIPTION:
SMALL BOWEL NODULE
Received fresh for frozen section, labeled with the patient's name, unit number and “small bowel
nodule” is a 0.3 cm in diameter fragment of yellow soft tissue. The specimen is entirely submitted for
frozen section and now resubmitted in cassette labeled FSA1.

B. RIGHT OVARY AND TUBE

Received fresh for frozen section, labeled with the patient's name, unit number and “right ovary and
tube” is a 16 gm right salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The ovary is 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.7 cm and has a
yellow smooth surface. The cut surface of the ovary is yellow, firm, smooth, and partially calcified. The
right fallopian tube is 4.0 cm long, and 0.4 cm in diameter. The fallopian tube contains multiple
paratubal cysts along its length. It is loosely attached to the right ovary by soft tissue and is grossly is
unremarkable. A portion of the ovary is submitted for frozen section and resubmitted in a cassette
labeled FSB1. Representative sections of the ovary and fallopian tube are submitted in cassettes B2
and B3. Block summary:

FSB1: frozen section control of ovary
B2-B3: representative sections of ovary and fallopian tube

LEFT OVARY AND TUBE
Received fresh for frozen section, labeled with the patient's name, unit number and “left ovary and tube”
is a 5 gm left salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The ovary is 2.5 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm with a yellow smooth
surface. A 2.2 cm in diameter cyst is adjacent to the ovary. The cut surface of the ovary reveals yellow
ovarian tissue. The left fallopian tube is 3.5 cm long, and 0.4 cm in diameter. It is attached to the ovary
by soft tissue and is grossly unremarkable. A portion of the ovary is submitted for frozen section and
resubmitted in a cassette labeled FSC1. Representative section of the ovary and fallopian tube are
submitted in a cassette labeled C2. Block summary:

FSCf : frozen section control of ovary

C2: representative sections of ovary and fallopian tube

REPLACED LEFT HEPATIC ARTERY LYMPH NODE
Received in a container labeled with the patient's name and “replaced left hepatic artery LN” is a 0.5 cm
tan lymph node. The specimen is completely submitted in a cassette labeled D1.

RIGHT CARDIA LYMPH NODE

Received in a container labeled with the patient's name and “right cardia LN” is a 2.5 x 2.0 x 0.3 cm
portion of adipose containing a lymph node. The specimen is completely submitted in a cassette
labeled E1.

LEFT CARDIA LYMPH NODE

Received in a container labeled with the patient's name and “left cardia LN” is a 2.2 x 1.6 x 0.7 cm
portion of adipose containing a lymph node. The specimen is bisected and completely submitted in a
cassette labeled Fl.

POSTERIOR LEFT GASTRIC LYMPH NODE

Received in a container labeled with the patient's name and “posterior left gastric LN” is a 2.4 x 1.5 x 1.0
cm portion of adipose containing a lymph node. The specimen is bisected and completely submitted in
a cassette labeled G1 .

NODULE ON STOMACH GREATER CURVATURE

Received fresh for frozen section, labeled with the patient's name, unit number and “nodule on stomach
greater curvature” is a 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm portion of soft tissue containing cysts that have cloudy yellow

fluid. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section and resubmitted in a cassette labeled FSH.

LESSER CURVATURE AND PROXIMAL STOMACH
Received fresh for frozen section, labeled with the patient's name, unit number and “lesser curvature
and proximal stomach” is a 18 x 10 x 5 cm partial gastrectomy specimen. The specimen is oriented
with a suture designating the proximal margin. The lesser curvature is 12 cm long and has an attached
7 x 4 x 3 cm portion of adipose tissue. The greater curvature is 19.5 cm long and has an attached 33.5
x 15 x 3 cm portion of adipose tissue. A 6.5 x 5.5 x 2.0 cm ulcerated tumor with raised edges is present
in the lesser curvature. The tumor is 3.0 cm from the proximal margin and 7.5 cm from the distal
margin. The tumor extends through the muscularis propria and approaches the serosal surface. The
remaining gastric mucosa contains normal rugal folds and is grossly unremarkable. Dissection reveals
24 possible lymph nodes. The portion of the distal and proximal margins were shaved and submitted
for frozen section and are resubmitted in cassettes labeled FS|12 and FSl13. Representative sections
are submitted in 28 cassettes labeled FSl1-l28. Block summary:

FSl12: proximal shaved margin

FSl13: distal shaved margin

|1-|2: proximal margin

l3: distal margin

l4-l6: tumor from proximal to distal

l7-l9: tumor from proximal distal

I10, I11: random stomach

I12: 1 lymph node

l14-l18: 1 lymph node in each cassette, lesser curvature

I19: 5 lymph nodes, lesser curvature

l20-l26: 2 lymph nodes in each cassette, greater curvature

l27-l28: tumor

RIGHT HEPATIC NODE
Received in a container labeled with the patient's name and “right hepatic lymph node” is a 3.0 x 2.4 x
1.5 cm portion of adipose containing lymph nodes. Four possible lymph nodes are identified.

J1: 1 node, bisected

J2: 1 node, bisected

J3: 2 possible nodes

GALLBLADDER

Received in a container labeled with the patient's name and “gallbladder” is a 9.0 x 3.5 x 3.2 cm
gallbladder. The serosal surface is smooth and slightly green. The gallbladder contains thick green bile
and a single 2.0 cm in diameter stone. The mucosa shows patchy attenuation and is bile stained. The
cystic duct ranges up to 0.3 cm in diameter. The thickness is focally up to 0.4 cm, but it is largely 0.2
cm in thickness. Representative sections of body, fundus and cystic duct are submitted in cassette K1 .
