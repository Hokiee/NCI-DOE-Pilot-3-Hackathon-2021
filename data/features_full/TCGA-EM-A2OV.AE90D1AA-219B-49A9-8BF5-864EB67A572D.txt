Gross Description
The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "Subtotal thyroidectomy; stitch marks upper

pole left side", consists of a left hemithyroidectomy specimen that weighs 65.2 g. The lobe
measures 7.6 cm SI x 4.4 cm ML x 3.1 cm AP and the isthmus measures 4.1 SI x 1.9 cm ML x
2.5 cm AP. No parathyroid glands or lymph nodes are identiﬁed grossly. The isthmus and left
lobe contain multiple delineated nodules that measure from 0.5 to 2.5 cm in maximum dimension.
Several of the large nodules demonstrate partial calciﬁcation of the capsule. Very little grossly
normal thyroid tissue is identiﬁed. Sections of nodule and normal tissue are stored frozen.
Representative sections of the remainder of the specimen are submitted as follows:

1A-H lobe, superior to inferior
1l-L isthmus
