DIAGNOSIS
(A) RIGHT KIDNEY:

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (10.5 CM MAXIMUM DIMENSION), CONVENTIONAL TYPE

(50% CLEAR CELLS,

50% EOSINOPHILIC CELLS), FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 4, INVASIVE

INTO RENAL VEIN AND

RENAL SINUS ADIPOSE TISSUE, TUMOR IN LUMEN AT RENAL VEIN
MARGIN. (SEE COMMENT).
(B) LEFT ADRENAL GLAND:

METASTATIC CONVENTIONAL RENAL CELL CARCINOMA IN ADRENAL GLAND.

COMMENT

The renal cell carcinoma is mainly composed of cells with Fuhrman
nuclear grade 3 features, with few foci of Fuhrman grade 4 tumor. Tumor
extensively invades into the renal sinus adipose tissue. The renal vein

is ﬁlled with tumor, and tumor protrudes from the lumen at the renal

vein margin. However, there is no tumor in the wall of the renal vein

at the margin. The perinephric adipose tissue appears to be free of
tumor. No lymph nodes were grossly identiﬁed.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
(A) RIGHT KIDNEY - An 18.0 x 13.0 x 7.0 cm radical nephrectomy specimen
with attached grossly unremarkable portion of ureter (3.0 cm in length
and 0.4 cm in diameter).

A 10.5 x 10.0 x 6.0 cm renal mass is identified at the upper pole
of the kidney. The cut surface of the mass is yellow-tan with areas of
necrosis, hemorrhage, and focal solid ﬁrm areas. Grossly, the tumor
involves the renal vein and protrudes 1.2 cm beyond the renal vein
resection margin. The tumor also involves the renal sinus adipose
tissue, but does not involve the renal calyces. The tumor is grossly
0.1 cm from the resection margin of Gerota's fascia.
The remainder of the renal parenchyma is unremarkable. No lymph nodes
were identiﬁed in the renal hilum or adjacent adipose tissue.

INK CODE: Green - resection margin of Gerota's fascia.

SECTION CODE: A1, renal artery resection margin, en face; A2,
renal vein margin with tumor, en face; A3, renal vein tumor thrombus;
A4-A6, tumor with resection margin of Gerota's fascia; A7-A15,
representative sections from the tumor; A16-A18, tumor with adipose
tissue of renal sinus and calyx; A19, A20, uninvolved renal parenchyma.

(B) LEFT ADRENAL GLAND - A 3.7 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm adrenal gland with
attached ﬁbroadipose tissue.

A 3.2 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm mass is identiﬁed within the medulla. The cut
surface of the mass is red-brown and soft with no hemorrhage or
necrosis. The adrenal cortex is atrophic. A portion of the adrenal
mass is submitted for possible electron microscopic study. The
remainder of the tumor is submitted in B1-B6. The uninvolved adrenal

parenchyma is submitted in B7. -
