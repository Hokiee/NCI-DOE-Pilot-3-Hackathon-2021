Diagnosis:

This is a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon of histopathological
differentiation grade G3, with erosions of the inner tumor surface, with peritumorous chronic
recurrent secondary inﬂammation with an acute inﬂammatory ﬂare, with tumor infiltration of the
colon wall layers as far as the pericolic fatty connective tissue, with carcinomatous lymphangitis,
with tumor-free lymph nodes (0/16) with moderate chronic lymphadenitis and tumor-free
overview slices from all other parts of the resection material described.

According to the section preparations available, the tumor spread of the sigmoid carcinoma
corresponds to the tumor stage pT3, pN0 (0/16), MX, L1, R0

with regard to the so-called radial resection margin, this shows a mature, predominantly fatty
connective tissue,

with regard to the lymph nodes, these show a metastasis (1 of 13) of the carcinoma described.

Summary tumor classification:
ICDO-DA M-8140/3
G3
