Specimen (Received _ _
A. SEGMENT 6 WEDGE RESECTION OF LIVER-FOR FROZEN

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Segment 6 liver mass

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Segment 6 liver mass

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh and consists of an 8.5 x 5.0 x 5.0 cm
resection of liver. Externally, the capsule is tan—red and shiny.
However, a 3.0 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm firm nodular growth is identified which
is still covered by capsule. On sectioning, the growth is
encapsulated and is tan—yellow to brown with area of hemorrhage and
necrosis. The tumor is 2.3 cm away from the closest hepatic margin.
A touch preparation slide is prepared from the mass.

Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1- closest tumor
margin: 2-5- representative sections of tumor.
