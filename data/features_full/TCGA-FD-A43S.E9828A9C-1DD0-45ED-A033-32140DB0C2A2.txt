FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS (JV/V

A. Right pelvic lymph node; dissection:
- Fifteen lymph nodes, no tumor (0/15).

B. Left pelvic lymph node; dissection:
- Eleven lymph nodes, no tumor (0/1 1).

Clinical History:
This is a -year-old woman with a history of papillary urothelial carcinoma,
high grade invading into the muscularis propria, now undergoing cystcctomy.

Specimens Received:

A: Right pelvic lymph node
B: Left pelvic lymph node
C: Bladder

D: Distal left ureter

E: Distal right ureter

Gross Description:
The specimens are received in ﬁve containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.

A. The ﬁrst container is additionally identiﬁed as, "1. Right pelvic lymph
node". Received ﬂesh and placed in formalin is a lobulated yellow and brown,
5.7 x 4.8 x 2 cm tissue from which multiple lymph node candidates measuring
0.2-2.5 cm are identiﬁed.

A1: 4 candidate lymph nodes

A2: 5 candidate lymph nodes

A3: 4 candidate lymph nodes

A4: 1 candidate lymph node, biseted
A5-A6: One candidate lymph node, bisected

B. The second container is additionally identiﬁed as, "2. Left pelvic lymph
node". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a lobulated yellow and dark
brown 7 x 4.5 x 1.5 cm tissue from which multiple lymph node candidates are
identiﬁed measuring 0.3-3.3 cm.

B1: 5 candidate lymph nodes

82: 4 candidate lymph nodes

B3: One candidate lymph node, bisected
B4—BS: One candidate lymph node, bisected

B6: Section of ﬁbroadipose tissue

C. The third container is additionally identiﬁed as, "3. Bladder". Received

fresh and place in formalin is a 150 g cystectomy specimen with overall
measurements of 13.5 x 12 x 3.8 cm. The right ureteral stump measures 2.5 x 0.5
cm, and the left measures 1.8 x 0.4 cm. The right ureter is patent to the

surgical margin. The serosal surface shows yellow lobulated ﬁbroadipose tissue
with focal cautery artifact. The urethral margin is inked black, and the

bladder is inked blue on the right half (including right ureteral stump) and
black on the left half. The specimen is opened anteriorly to reveal a 2.5 x 2.0
cm centrally ulcerated mass occupying the posterior wall and left lateral wall
extending to within 0.5 cm from the left ureter oriﬁce. The left ureter oriﬁce

is only patent in the most proximal 0.5 cm. On cut section, the mass is ﬁrm

and displays tan-yellow cut surface with focal hemorrhagic discoloration. The
mass extends into and through the muscularis propria and is close to the black
ink. The surrounding bladder mucosa is wrinkled and pink-tan with a wall
thickness of 1.6 2.1 cm.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Cl: Distal urethral margin

C2: Right ureter resection margin (blue) and left ureter resection
margin

C3-C6: Closest extension of mass to ink

C7: Mass in trigone

C8: Section of mass and adjacent left ureteral oriﬁce

C9: Uninvolved anterior wall

C10: Uninvolved dome

Cl 1: Uninvolved right lateral wall

D. The fourth container is additionally identiﬁed as, "4. Distal left ureter,

suture on non-margin side". Received fresh and placed in formalin is an oriented
square shaped 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm portion of tissue with dark brown and yellow
tissue on one surface and pale tan-pink apparent mucosa on the other surface. A
lumen is not identiﬁed. The margin side is trimmed and submitted as D1. The
remaining tissue is free of tumor involvement grossly.

E. The ﬁfth container is additionally identiﬁed as, "5. Distal right ureter,

suture on non-margin side". Received fresh and placed in formalin is an

oriented, dark brown and yellow segment of ureter measuring 2.1 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm.
The margin side is trimmed and submitted as E1. The remainder of the specimen is
sectioned revealing maximal wall thickness of 0.2 cm and a pinpoint lumen with
no gross involvement by tumor.
