Surgery Date: Surgical Pathology : ) i wW’rwwm MES) 22] 4.16/5

DIAGNOSIS: 5911 'I

A. Pancreas, neck margin, biopsy: Negative for tumor.

B. Pancreas, spleen and omentum, distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy
and partial omentectomy: Invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma,
forming a 2.2 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm mass within the body of the pancreas.
The tumor extends beyond the pancreas to involve peripancreatic soft
tissue. Perineural invasion is identified. The pancreatic ducts
demonstrate pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN -1A). The
distal pancreas shows chronic pancreatitis. The surgical resection
margins, including the separately submitted pancreatic neck, are
negative for tumor (2.0 cm to pancreatic neck margin). Multiple (6
peripancreatic, 2 omental) lymph nodes are negative for tumor. The
spleen parenchyma is unremarkable.

This ﬁnal pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic
examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of the
specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are
reviewed to conﬁrm these ﬁndings. Any substantive changes
identiﬁed on permanent section review will be reﬂected in a

revised report.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received fresh labeled "pancreatic neck margin - margin up" is a

2.5 x 2.2 x 0.7 cm portion of pancreatic tissue with orientation.
Margin submitted. Grossed by

B. Received fresh labeled "distal pancreas, spleen" is a distal
pancreatectomy specimen consisting of 10.5 x 3.1 x 1.8 cm portion of
pancreas, 140.0 gram, 14.0 x 10.5 x 3.6 cm spleen, and a 13.0 x 9.0

x 3.5 cm omentum. A 2.2 x 2.0 X 1.8 cm white, solid mass is present
within the body of the pancreas, 2.0 cm from the proximal pancreatic
margin and obstructing the main pancreatic duct. The mass does not
grossly appear to be conﬁned to the pancreas. The distal pancreas
shows features suggestive of chronic pancreatitis. Peripancreatic

and omental lymph nodes are identiﬁed. The spleen is grossly
unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted. Grossed by
