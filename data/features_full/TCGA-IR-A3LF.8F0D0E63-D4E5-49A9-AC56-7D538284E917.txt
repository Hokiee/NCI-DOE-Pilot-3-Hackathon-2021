DIAGNOSIS:

1) UTERUS. BILATERAL ADN'EXAI HYSTERECTOHY AND BILATERAL
SALPINGO -OOPHORECTONY :
- INVASIVE ADENOCARCINOMA OF UTERINE CERVIX, WITH ENDOKETRIOID FEATURES
(SEE NOTE) , MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED.
— THE MAXIHAL THICKNESS OF THE CERVICAL STROMAL INVASION IS 5 MN.
- THE THICKNESS OF THE CERVIX IN THE AREA OF MAXIMAL TUMOR INVASION IS 20
M.
NO EVIDENCE OF TUMOR NULTICENTRICITY IS IDENTIFIED.
IN SITU ENDOCERVICAL DENOCARCINOMA IS ALSO PRESENT.
NO VASCULAR INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.
NO PERINEURAL INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.
NO VAGINAL EXTENSION IS IDENTIFIED.
THE TUMOR EXTENDS INTO THE LOWER UTERINE SEGMENT (MUCOSA AND STROMA) .
ALL SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR.
THE ENDOMETRIUM SHOWS THE FOLLOWING ABNORMALITY: ATROPHY.
THE MYOMETRIUN SHOWS THE FOLLOWING ABNORMALITIES: ADENOM'YOSIS AND
LEIOKYOMA.
- ALL ADNEXAE ARE UNREMARKABLE.

NOTE: IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINS SHOW THAT THE TUMOR CELLS ARE POSITIVE FOR
CEA AND NEGATIVE FOR VIMENTIN, ER, AND PR, SUPPORTING A CERVICAL ORIGIN.
