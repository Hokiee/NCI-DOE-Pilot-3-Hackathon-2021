Gross Description:

A Received fresh labeled “Uterus cervix, tubes and ovaries" is a hysterectomy weighing 160 grams. The specimen
Includes an unopened uterus that measures 5. 5 x 6.0 x 3.0 cm with attached cervix (3.0 x 3.0 x 2 5 cm), right fallopian tube 7 5 cm
in length by 1 0 cm In diameter, right ovary (3 5 x 2. 0 x 1. 0 cm). left fallopian tube (7. 0 cm in length by 1. 0 cm in diameter) and left

ovary (2.5 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm). The external 03 is slit-like and measures 0.3 cm in diameter. The endocervical canal 2.8 cm in
length) has a tan herring-bone mucosa. The endometrial cavity (4.0 cm from cornu to cornu and 4.4 cm in length) has a tan
endometrial lining. There is a 4.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm polypoid tan mass that is located on the posterior wall. There appears to
be invasion of the underlying mucosa involving the inner half of the myomehium (0.9 out of 2.1 cm). The mass is located 2.8
cm from the lower uterine segment. A 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm of mass was taken for tissue bank. The myometrium measures 2.1
cm in maximum thickness. Multiple intramural and subserosal white, whorled nodules are present ranging from 1.0 up to 1.5 cm.
The endometrial thickness not involved by the tumor is 0.1 cm. The right fallopian tube has multiple paratubal cysts
ranging from 0.1 up to 0.4 cm. Fallopian tubes are patent and have flmbriated ends. The right ovary has a multi-nodular
white outer surface. Cross section shows a ﬁrm, white stroma. The left ovary has a multinodular white outer surface. Cross
section reveals a white, ﬁrm parenchyma. Sections submitted as follows:

Cassette #1 Anterior cervix
