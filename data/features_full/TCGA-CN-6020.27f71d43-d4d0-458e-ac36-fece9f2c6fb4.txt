My s1gnature 1s attestation that I have personally reviewed the submitted
material(s) and the final diagnosis reﬂects that evaluation.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in 7 parts.

Part 1 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and

"anterior ﬂoor of mouth". Received are multiple, irregular, soft, tan,

tissue biopsies ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. A frozen
section is performed with an intraoperative diagnosis completed. The specimen
is entirely submitted for processing in a cassette labeled 1A FS.

Part 2 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and

"left neck dissection level 1". Received is an irregular portion of yellow
lobulated adipose tissue consistent with a neck dissection, 7.5 X 5 X 1.5 cm.
The specimen is subdivided into two equal parts. Segment one (Level 1B) has 6
possible lymph nodes identified ranging in size from 0.2 to 1.5 cm with a
salivary gland, 3.8 X 2.4 X 1.6 cm and a separate portion of similar glandular
tissue, 1.8 X 1.5 X 1.5 cm. The salivary gland on cut section has a light tan,
lobulated cut surface, without tumor. The larger lymph nodes are hemorrhagic
on cut section. Digital images of the glandular tissue are taken. Segment two
has two recognizable lymph nodes measuring 0.8 and 0.7 cm in greatest
dimension. The smaller lymph node appears suspicious. The lymph nodes and
submandibular gland are submitted in the following cassettes.

Section code:

Segment one

2A - two smallest possible lymph nodes

2B - 2E - bisected possible lymph nodes

2F - bisected smaller glandular tissue

2G - 2H - representative sections (90% submitted) of salivary gland

Segment two

21 - single possible lymph node

2] - single bisected possible lymph node.

Part 3 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and

"right neck dissection level 1". Received is an irregular portion of yellow
lobulated adipose tissue consistent with a neck dissection, 6.5 X 3.5 X 1.5

cm. The specimen is subdivided into two equal parts. No lymph nodes are
identiﬁed within segment one, however, a salivary gland, 4.2 X 2 X 1.6 cm, is
identiﬁed. The salivary gland on cut section has a light tan, lobulated cut
surface, without tumor. Digital images of the glandular tissue are taken.
Segment two (Level 1A?) has 4 possible lymph nodes identified ranging in size
from 0.3 to 1.3 cm The largest lymph node is hemorrhagic on cut section. The
lymph nodes and salivary gland are submitted in the following cassettes.
Section code:

Segment one

3A - 3B - representative sections (80% submitted) of salivary gland

Segment two

3C - bisected lymph node

3D - 3 possible lymph nodes

Part 4 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and
"anterior composite". Received is an anterior composite resection measuring 7
X 4.5 X 3.5 cm and consisting of anterior tongue, 4 X 6 X 2 cm, a marginal
anterior mandibulectomy, 6 X 1.1 X 1 cm, and ﬂoor of mouth soft tissue
including lacerated sublingual glands, overall, 3.5 X 2.5 X 1.1 cm. A poorly
circumscribed, ﬁrm, left and midline tumor 3.8 X 3.2 X 2.7 cm, involves the
inferior tongue and ﬂoor of mouth. It extends to within 0.7 cm of the
gingival/mandibular resection margin, and 0.8 cm from the deep tongue
resection margin. The tumor is approximately 1 cm from the mandibular
horizontal resection margin, approximately 0.7 cm from the left mandibular
resection margin and 0.6 cm from the right mandibular resection margin. Tumor
involves the alveolar ridge and possibly the mandibular cortical bone. Bone
resection margins appear free of tumor. No teeth are present. The sublingual
glands appear grossly unremarkable. Three frozen sections are performed with
intraoperative diagnoses completed. Digital images are taken. The specimen
is representatively submitted.

Additional studies:

Digital images are taken.

Tissue is banked (normal and tumor).

Ink code:

Black - deep tongue resection margin
Blue - right shaved marginal mandibular resection margin
Green - left shaved marginal mandibular resection margin
Yellow - inferior marginal mandibular resection margin
Section code:
4AFS - left posterior ﬂoor of mouth shave resection margin
4BFS - anterior left gingival shave resection margin
4CFS - right posterior ﬂoor mouth shave resection margin

4EDR - left marginal mandibular resection margin
4FDR - inferior marginal mandibular resection margin
4GDR - left alveolar ridge
4H - left lateral tongue/tumor

5A - level 2A - 2 largest lymph nodes
5B - level 2A - 8 possible lymph nodes
5C - level 2A - 8 possible lymph nodes
5D - level 2A - single minute possible lymph node

Part 6 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and
"right neck dissection 2, 3, and 4, suture level 11". Received is an
irregular oriented 10 X 7.5 X 1.5 cm right neck dissection consisting of lymph
node levels 2 through 4. A portion of vein is identified, 3 cm in length and
0.8 cm in diameter. Also received is a single separate portion of yellow
lobulated adipose tissue, 2 X 1.8 X 0.8 cm. Specimen is oriented by a suture-
zone 11. The following lymph nodes were identified:
Level 2 - 11 possible lymph nodes are notified and ranging
in size from 0.1 to 1.7 cm in greatest dimension.
Level 3 - 9 possible lymph nodes are identified and ranging
in size from 0.3 to 1.3 in greatest dimension

Level 4 - 8 possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed measuring

0.3 and 1.9 cm in greatest dimension

Separate tissue - single possible minute lymph node, 0.2 cm in
greatest dimension.
Lymph nodes are entirely submitted in cassettes labeled:
6A - Level 2 - bisected largest lymph node
6B - Level 2 - 5 possible lymph nodes
6C - Level 2 - 5 possible lymph nodes
6D - Level 3 - 3 largest lymph nodes

segment of grossly unremarkable marginal tongue, 2 X 2 X 1.2 cm. The
periphery of tongue excision shows minor cauterization effects. The specimen
is representatively submitted for processing in a cassette labeled 7A - shaved
true margin.
