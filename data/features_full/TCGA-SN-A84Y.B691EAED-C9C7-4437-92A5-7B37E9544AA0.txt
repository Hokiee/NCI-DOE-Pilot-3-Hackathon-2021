Comment 4)

Approximately equal portions of yolk sac tumor and embryonal carcinoma are
present with a very small amount of immature teratoma (less than 2%) and
isolated syncytiotrophoblast cells. The presence of intratubular- germ cell
neoplasia is supported by strong staining with CD117. The control is
appropriate. Multiple foci of lymphovascular invasion are seen.

Intradepartmental consultation: has been consulted on
representative sections and concurs with the interpretation.

Pertinent Clinical Information
History of testicular mass

Gross Description
Specimen Material: Testicle

Received in formalin labeled "TESTICLE" is an 80 gram testicle (7.5 x 4.5 x
2.5 cm) with attached spermatic cord (1 1.5 cm in length, 1.2 cm in diameter)
and epididymis (4 x 1 x 0.7 cm). The spermatic cord margin is inked violet.
The tunica vaginalis is inked black. The tunica albuginea is gray—white

and smooth. The opened testicle reveals a 4.5 x 4 cm well-circumscribed,
bulging heterogeneous tan-white mass with hemorrhage which appears conﬁned
to the testis. The mass is located 2 cm from the tunica vaginalis and 0.8
cm from the tunica albuginea. Representative sections are submitted as
follows: 1 upper spermatic cord margin

2 middle spermatic cord

3 distal spermatic cord

4 epididymis

5-6 mass and tunica albuginea

7-8 mass with tunica albuginea and epididymis

9-10 mass, tunica vaginalia and tunica albuginea

12-16 mass in relationship to tunica albuginea
