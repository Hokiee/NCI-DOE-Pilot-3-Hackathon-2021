lnterphase FISH analysis is equiva for HER-ZINEU gene ampliﬁcation.
RESULTS:

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed on a formalin-ﬁxed Block 3A (left breast total mastectomy) using
the DNA probe for the HER-ZINEU gene ( An adequate number of invasive tumor cells were present and
evaluated by two independent observers. The ratio of HER-ZINEU signals (ERBBZ) to chromosome 17 centromere signals
(D1721) was determined to be 1.93. A ratio of greater than 2.2 is considered to be ampliﬁed with ratios of 1.80 to 2.20 in the
equivocal range; therefore. this specimen is equivocal for HERZINEU gene amplification. The average number of

HEBQINEU signals per cell was 4.25. The average number of signals for the chromosome 17 centromere was 2.20. Concurrent
posrtlve and negative control specimens showed the expected results.

This FISH testis performed using a modiﬁcation of the Vysis FDA approved Patthsion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit (1 :2 LSI HER-Zineu
I‘CEP17 probe :_T-denhyb-2 buffer). This FISH test was developed and its performance determined by the ’

Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA '88. this laboratory has established and veriﬁed the test's
accuracy and precision.
