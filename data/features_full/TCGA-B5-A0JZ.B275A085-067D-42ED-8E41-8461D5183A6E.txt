CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neocorpus uteri 182.0.

GROSS EXAMINATION: »

A. "Right tube and ovary", received fresh for gross consultation diagnosis is
a 154-gram, 8 x 7 x 7 cm serous filled cyst with no residual ovary (Al—2). The
attached tube (4 cm in length x 0.8 cm in diameter) and fimbria are grossly
unremarkable (A3).

B. "Uterus and cervix (BF1)", received is a 257 gram, 11 x 7.5 x 7.5 cm
hysterectomy specimen with attached cervix (2.5 cm). The anterior and
posterior cervix (3 cm long x 1 cm in diameter) is tan—brown and has a
herringbone appearance and is submitted in blocks Bl-2, respectively. The
endometrial cavity (9.5 x 6 cm) is entirely covered by a white-tan, friable
mass which grossly comes within 0.5 cm of both the anterior and posterior
cervix. Sectioning reveals an endometrium with the average thickness of 3 cm
and a myometrium of 2 cm. The deepest invasion is grossly 1.4 cm into a 2 cm
myometrium (BB-BFl).

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Bl- anterior cervix
B27 posterior cervix
B3- BFl
B4—5— anterior endomyometrium, full—thickness deepest invasion
”“ 86— posterior endomyometrium -
. . B7— representative section of tumor

C. "Left tube and ovary", received is a 36 gram, 4.5 x 3.5 x 3 cm thin—walled
clear fluid—filled, uniloculated ovarian cyst with no residual ovary (Cl—2).
The fallopian tube (3.5 cm long x 0.5 cm in diameter) has attached fimbria and
both are grossly unremarkable (C3). ,

D. "Right round ligament", received is a 2.8 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm aggregate of
fibrofatty tissue. The specimen is sectioned and submitted in its entirety in
D1—2. -

E. "Right pelvic lymph node", received is a 7.8 x 4 x 1.8 cm aggregate of
fibrofatty tissue which is dissected for nodes and submitted as follows:

F. "Right obturator", received is a 5 x 3 x 2.8 cm aggregate of fibrofatty
tissue which contains one 2.5 cm lymph node, submitted in toto with
surrounding tissue, in F1-F7.

G. "Left external iliac node", received is a 5 x 4.5 x 2 cm aggregate of
fibrofatty tissue which is dissected for lymph nodes and submitted as follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY:

tissue which is bisected and submitted in its entirety-in J1.

tissue which is dissected and submitted as follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY:

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: HYSTEROSALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY AND NODE DISSECTION

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 6th Edition): pTlc le pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with.nor substituted for it:
The exact operative procedure is available in the Surgeon's operative report.
