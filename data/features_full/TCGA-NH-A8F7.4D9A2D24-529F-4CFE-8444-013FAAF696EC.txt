The subtotal colectomy contained two separate but histologically indistinguishable.
moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas. Tumor #1 was located in the cecum and appeared
more advanced with numerous metastasis to regional lymph nodes. Tumor #2 was located in
the sigmoid colon without regional lymph node metastasis. In completing the synoptic
reports below, I judged the metastatic tumor to be associated with the more advanced cecal
adenocarcinoma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

Specimen A is received in the fresh state labeled ”subtotal colectomy with left tube and
ovary". The specimen consists of the following:

s 15 cm of terminal ileum measuring 2 cm in diameter

— Vermiform appendix measuring 5 cm in length by 0.7 cm in diameter

— 65 cm of large intestine measuring approximately 5 cm in diameter

— Attached omentum measuring 20 x 14 by up to 2 cm in thickness

— An ovary and fallopian tube attached in the area of the sigmoid colon

— Mesentery measuring up to 9 cm in radial dimension at the ileocecal junction and
up to 9 cm in radial dimension at the sigmoid colon

Adhesions are noted at the ileocecal junction and between the ovary and sigmoid colon,
There are firm tumorous nodules in the mesentery at the ileocecal junction and in the
omentum. The omental tumor nodule measures 2 cm in greatest dimension. There are multiple
mesenteric nodules at the ileocecal junction measuring up to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension.
The bowel is opened to reveal a circumferential fungating tumor in the cecum approximately
2 cm from the ileocecal valve. This tumor measures 4 5 cm along the length of the bowel.
The bowel is narrowed in this area. A second circumferential fungating mucosal tumor is
identified 5 cm above the distal margin. This second tumor measures 5.5 cm along the
length of the bowel and again the bowel appears narrowed in this area. The attached ovary
appears enlarged, measuring 5 x 4.5 x 3 cm. It has a smooth tan surface. Its cut surface
reveals soft tan tumorous tissue replacing 90% of the ovary. The fallopian tube with
fimbriated and measures 4.5 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter. The initial gross features
are reported to Dr in the O.R. at The specimen is allowed to
fix overnight prior to sectioning. RepresentativC sections are submitted as follows:

A1 — terminal ileum

A2 — vermiform appendix

A3—6 — cecal tumor

A7—12— lymph nodes in mesentery regional to cecal tumor
A13 - apex of ileocecal mesentery

A14 — omental tumor nodule

A15.16- left ovary and tube

A17—20~ distal tumor

A21 - distal margin

A22—25— lymph nodes and mesentery regional to distal tumor

NOTE: The tumors invade the full thickness of the bowel wall, likely extending through the
bowel wall.

Specimen B is received in formalin labeled "right tube and ovary" This is an ovary with
