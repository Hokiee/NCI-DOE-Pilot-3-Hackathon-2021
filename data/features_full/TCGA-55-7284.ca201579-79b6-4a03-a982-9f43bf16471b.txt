Diagnosis:

A. - K. LUNG, RIGHT, MIDDLE AND LOWER LOBES, INTERLOBAR (N11R X5), HILAR
(N10R), PERI-ESOPHAGEAL (N8R), SUBCARINAL (N7), AND LOWER
PARATRACHEAL (N4R) LYMPH NODES, BI-LOBECTOMY WITH REGIONAL
LYMPHADENECTOMY:
- INVASIVE ADENOCARCINOMA, WITH PREDOMINANT BRONCHIOLOALVEOLAR
PATTERN, MULTIFOCAL, INVOLVING THE MIDDLE AND LOWER LOBES.
- MIDDLE LOBE:
- Tumor 2 cm in maximum dimension.
-Viscera| pleural invasion: NOT IDENTIFIED.
- LOWER LOBE:
- 15 cm in maximum dimension.
- Visceral pleural invasion: NOT IDENTIFIED.
- MARGIN STATUS (BOTH FOCI): NEGATIVE.
- SIXTEEN LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (0I16).
- NON-NECROTIZING GRANULOMATOUS INFLAMMATION.

PATHOLOGIC STAGING SUMMARY (MIDDLE LOBE):
- Type and grade: Adenocarcinoma, well differentiated.
- Primary tumor: pT1 a.
- Regional lymph nodes: pNO (0/16 total lymph nodes).
- Distant metastasis: pMX.
- Pathologic stage: IA.
- Lymphovascular invasion: Not identified.
- Margin status: R0.

PATHOLOGIC STAGING SUMMARY (LOWER LOBE):
- Type and grade: Adenocarcinoma, well differentiated.
- Primary tumor: pT3 (15 cm in maximum dimension).
- Regional lymph nodes: pNO (0/16 total lymph nodes).
- Distant metastasis: pMX.
- Pathologic stage: "3.

ion: Not identified.

    

 

 

FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

4 Margin status: R0.

COMMENT: Elastic stain, performed with adequate control on the lower and middle
lobe specimens (parts 'F' and 'I') confirm the absence of visceral pleura invasion.
Special stains for acid fast bacilli (AFB), and fungi (GMS, PAS), performed on parts 'F'
and 'I' with adequate controls, are negative. The granulomas see in these specimens
are most likely secondary to etravasated mucin.
