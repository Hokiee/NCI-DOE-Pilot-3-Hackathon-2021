INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:
Gross Exam A Left breast, modiﬁed radical mastectomy: Tumor is grossly 0.1 cm for posterior margin
and >05 cm from other margins.
By Dr., called to Dr. at

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

margin is inked black, the anterior is inked orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to
medial. Cut section shows a beige-tan firm. slightly necrotic mass which demonstrates a thick amber
colored mucoid ﬂuid. The mass lies just beneath the deep margin at a distance of 0.1 cm. The mass

photographs are taken. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
A1-A2: sections of lesion and closest margin, posterior, and skin
A3-A4: one full thickness section from skin to deep margin with lesion
A5-A11: sections of lesion from upper-outer quadrant through mid portion

A12-A13. sections of lower-outer quadrant

A14-A15: representative sections lower-inner quadrant
A16-A17: representative sections upper-inner quadrant
A18-A19: sections of nipple

A20-A24: axillary lymph nodes, 2 sections from each

B. LEFT AXlLLARY CONTENTS LEVELS 1&2
Received fresh are multiple tan-pink fragments of ﬁbrofatty tissue aggregating to 6.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm.
Dissection reveals 13 possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm to 3.5 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm.
