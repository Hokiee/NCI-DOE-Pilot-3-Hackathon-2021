GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. TERMINAL ILEUM AND RIGHT COLON
Received fresh is a curved segment of colon measuring approximately 24cm in length with a diameter
up to 9.5cm. The serosal surface is unremarkable and there is an attached appendix measuring 6 cm
in length with a diameter of 1.0cm. The appendix shows no gross abnormalities. The specimen is
opened and the ileum measures 7.3 x 4.2 cm with the ascending colon measuring 19.5 x 8.2 cm. There
is a 3.1 x 2.5 cm oval sessile firm mass present in the ascending colon which is located 6.2 cm from the
ileocecal junction, 10.0 cm from the distal colonic margin and 14.0 cm from the proximal margin. The
mesocolonic fat is inked black and on sectioning the mass, it appears to invade into the submucosa.
There are additional polyps located in the ascending colon, ranging in size from 0.3 to 0.6cm.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

A1: proximal margin

A2: distal margin

A3: appendix

A4: polyps

A5-A9: mass including the deep margin

A10-A15: possible lymph nodes, ranging in size from 0.2 to 1.0cm.
A16: representative section of normal colon and normal ileum
A17: representative section of ileocecal junction

B. GALLBLADDER

Received in formalin and labeled as "gallbladder" is an opened pink-tan gallbladder, measuring 7.5 x
4.0 x 1 .2cm. The serosal surface is smooth and is grossly unremarkable. The mucosal surface has a
pink-tan coloration and a slightly granular/polypoid appearance. The gallbladder walls measure up to
0.2cm. No masses or lesions are seen. Also submitted is an irregularly shaped black-gold stone
measuring approximately 7.0 x 5.0 x 4.2cm. Representative sections are submitted in blocks Bf -B2.
