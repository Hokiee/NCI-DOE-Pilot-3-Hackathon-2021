Gross Description
The specimen container labelled with the patient's name and as "right and left periaortic lymph nodes"

contains 3 pieces of an unoriented ﬁbroadipose tissue received in 10% buffered formalin. The tissue
measures from 1.6 x 1.0 x 0.5 to 3.5 x 2.2 x 0.9 cm. Within the fatty tissue, multiple lymph nodes are
identiﬁed grossly ranging in size from 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1 to 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm.

1A multiple lymph nodes

1B multiple lymph nodes

1C one node and the rest of the fatty tissue submitted in toto

2. The specimen container labelled with the patient's name and as "right pelvic lymph nodes" contains
multiple pieces of an unoriented ﬁbroadipose tissue received in 10% buffered formalin. The tissue
measures 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.6 to 4.5 x 2.5 x 0.8 cm. Within the fatty tissue, multiple lymph nodes are identiﬁed
grossly ranging in size from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 to 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm.

 

2A multiple lymph nodes
ZB two lymph nodes
2C the rest of the fatty tissue submitted in toto

3. The specimen container is labeled with the patient's name and as "omentum" contains a single piece of
an unoriented ﬁbroadipose tissue received in 10% buffered formalin. The tissue measures 22.3 x 9.2 x 1.4
cm and weighs 71.6 g.

On serial sectioning, the cut surface is predominantly fatty with no nodules identiﬁed grossly.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

3A-3Erepresentative section submitted

4. The specimen container is labeled with the patient's name and as "uterus hysterectomy BSO" contains a
uterus, cervix, bilateral ﬁmbriated fallopian tube and bilateral ovaries received in 10% buffered formalin.
The uterus measures 8.5 SI x 5.0 ML x 3.6 cm AP and the cervix measures 3.0 cm. with a 0.7 cm ovoid
shaped os. The right and left ﬁmbriated fallopian tube measures 4.0 x 0.6 cm and 4.5 x 0.5 cm

a

smooth and grossly unremarkable. Both the anterior and posterior uterine serosa is intact, and has presence
of focal areas of hemorrhagic ﬁbrous adhesions. On sectioning, a polypoid brown-tan lesion is identiﬁed
predominantly seen on the superior aspect of the anterior endometrium extending to the inferior aspect

S. The specimen container labelled with the patient's name and as "left pelvic lymph nodes" contains
multiple pieces of an unoriented ﬁbroadipose tissue received in 10% buffered formalin. The tissue
measures 0.4 x 0.6 x 0.6 to 1.8 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm. Within the fatty tissue, one lymph node is identiﬁed
measuring 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.
