GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) RESECTION RECURRENT MELANOMA OF LEFT BREAST WITH PREVIOUS SCAR (SHORT
SUPERIOR, LONG LATERAL) - A tan-white skin ellipse. 10.8 x 4.7 cm, excised with subcutaneous
tissue up to a depth of 3.5 cm. A short suture designates the superior margin and the long suture
designates the lateral tip. The central portion of the skin shows an irregular scar, 5.0 x 1.1 cm. The nipple
is identified midportion of the specimen close to the inferior margin. Serial sectioning reveals a tan-white
well-circumscribed nodule, 1.4 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm, focally adherent to the overlying skin. The nodule is about
1.5 cm from the nearest margin which is the superior margin. The entire scar together with the underlying
nodule is submitted for examination.

lNK CODE: Superior half—blue; inferior half-yellow.

SECTION CODE: A1, lateral tip; A2-A13, scar with underlying lesion (A4-A6, mass lesion, A2,
A3, A10-A13, remainder of the scar without obvious lesion); A14, medial tip; A15, superior margin, en
face; A16, inferior margin, en face; A17, deep margin, en face; A18, A19, entire nipple with adjacent inked
margin (the nipple is grossly unremarkable). NOTE: margins not included in sections A2 to A13. MN1/beg
(B) LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS WITHIN CONTINUITY SUBSEQUENT TISSUE LEFT BREAST - One
piece of axillary contents with a large mass. The specimen measures 15.0 x 14.0 x 4.0 cm. The largest
metastatic tumor measures 6.0 x 5.0 x 5.0 cm. The cut surface of the largest mass is white-tan and firm.
Multiple small lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 to 2.0 cm are identified. Sections from the largest metastatic
lesion are submitted in cassette B1-B6 to evaluate possible extranodal extension.

The remainder of the pink-tan fibrosis adipose tissue is serially sectioned. Twelve lymph nodes
are identified ranging in size from 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm to 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm.

size from (0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 to 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm).
