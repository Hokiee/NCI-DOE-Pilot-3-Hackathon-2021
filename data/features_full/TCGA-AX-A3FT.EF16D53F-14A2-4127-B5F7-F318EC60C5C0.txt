The specimens are received In seven lormelin-litied containers. each labeled ? The first container is
labeled "uterus. BSD and cervix.' It contains a previously opened uterus consisten wt the lntraoperetlve
nonmlcroscoplc consultation (weighing 141 grams and measuring 4.1 x 3.5 x 8.6 cm). The uterine serose is dull.
ian~brown. The cervix measures 2.8 x 2.5 cm and has a glistening white-ten mucosa with local hemorrhage. The
uterus has been blvalved to show a tan-white herringbone mucosa within the endooervical canal (3.3 cm in length).
The transformation zone is unremarkable. The endometrial cavity (4.0 cm Irom comu lo comu x 4.5 cm In length) ls
tilted by a large. exophytlc. tan mass, measuring 4.5 x 3.5 x 1.7 cm. The mass appears to be involving predominantly
the posterior aspect ol the endometrlum as well as the superior iundus. The tumor appears to Invade Into the wall at
the uterus with a depth oi 1.7 em out ol 2.2 cm at Its thickest point. however. the malorlly ol the wall at the uterus is
thinned. measuring 0.8 cm at its thinnest area. The tumor appears to invade to within 0.1 cm at the serosa at the left
cornu. The tumor also appears to invade deeply near the tail cornu as well. There Is llrm, well-circumscribed.

white-tan. whoried appearing nodule within the anterior myometrlum which measures 1.0 cm. The bilateral tubes and
ovaries are attached and consistent with the measurements in the nonmlcroscopic consultation. The right fallopian
tube has areas of cystic lesions titled with mucoid material. measuring up 1.5 x 0.5 cm. The right ovary has a
bosselated tan suriace with no gross lesions seen. The ovary is sectioned to show a pink-tan. mottled parenchyma
with no gross lesions seen. The left fallopian tube has multiple cystic lesions along the length filled with mucoid
material, measuring up to 1.5 cm. The left ovary has a bosseiated tan-white surface with one firm, white. plaque~like
area consistent with a corpora alblcens. The ovary is sectioned to show an mottled. tan-white parenchyma with no
gross lesions seen The specimen is submitted labeled A1 - anterior cervix; A2 - anterior lower uterine segment; A3
and A4 - anterior endomyometrium (A1 to A4 are contiguous sections); A5 - posterior cervix; A5 - posterior lowar
uterine segment: A7 and A8 - posterior endomyomelrlum (A5 to A8 are contiguous sections); A9 and A10 - anterior
endomyometrlum near lundus; A11 and A12 - tumor near the right comus: A13 to A18 - tumor In the posterior

endomyometrium; A17 and A18 - tumor near left cornu: A19 - right laiiopisn tube: A20 - right ovary; A21 - leh fallopian
tube; A22 - left ovary. Jar 2.

The second container is labeled 'left external lilac lymph nodes.‘ it contains multiple tabulated yellow fragments of
tissue. measuring 6.0 x 5.0 x 2.5 cm in aggregate. Multiple putative lymph nodes are identified ranging from 1.0 x 0.5 x
0.5 cm to 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm. The largest lymph node is bisected to show a llrm. tan. mottled parenchyma. The lymph

nodes are submitted as follows: 81 and 32 - largest lymph node. trlsectad and entirely submitted: 33 - two additional
lymph nodes: B4 - two additional lymph nodes. Jar 1.

The third container is labeled 'left obturator lymph nodes.‘ It contains multiple irregular. yellow and brown fragments of
tissue. measuring 5.0 x 3.5 x 1.8 cm, in aggregate. Multiple putative lymph nodes are identified. ranging from 0.4 x 0.3
x 0.2 cm to 2.8 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. The largest lymph node is bisected to show a tan, mottled parenchyma. The specimen

is submitted, labeled Ct - largest bisected lymph node; 02 - two additional lymph nodes; CS ~ multiple putative smell
lymph nodes. Jar 1.

The fourth container ls labeled 'rlght external lilac lymph nodes.“ it contains multiple. irregular, yellow and brown
fragments of tissue. measuring 4.5 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm. in aggregate. Multiple putative lymph nodes are identllled within the
a tissue. ranging irom 0.7 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm to 1.5 it 1.0 x 0.4 cm. The largest lymph node is bisected to show a white-tan.

mottled parenchyme. The specimen is submitted, labeled D1 - largest bisected lymph node; 02 - lour additional
putative lymph nodes. Jar 1.

The fifth container is labeled 'rlght obturator lymph nodes.‘ ttcontalns a yellow-brown fragment of tissue. measuring
6.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. Multiple putative lymph nodes are Identified. ranging from 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm to 2.8 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm.
The larger lymph nodes are bisected to show fatty infiltration of the largest lymph node. and the remainder of the lymph
nodes have a tan-white. mottled parenchyme. The specimen is submitted as follows: El ~ largest lymph node
bisected. and submitted entirely; 52 - one bisected lymph node; ES - one bisected lymph node; E4 - one bisected
lymph node; ES ~ two additional lymph nodes. Jar 1.

The sixth container is labeled 'rlght perlaortlc lymph nodes.“ It contains a brown fragment tissue. measuring 4.0 x 0.8 x
0.8 cm. There appears to be two putative lymph nodes within the tissue. Both are of similar size. measuring 1.5 x 0.7
x 0.5 cm and 1.8 x 0.8 It 0.5 cm. The lymph nodes are bisected to show a mottled. tanobrown parenchyma. One

bisected lymph node is submitted as F1. and the remainder of the tissue (one bisected lymph node) is submitted as F2.
Jar 0.

The seventh container is labeled 'left perlaonlc lymph nodes.‘ it contains multiple irregular, yellow and brown
fragments of tissue. measuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. Two putative lymph nodes are identified. measuring 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.5

cm and 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. The two lymph nodes are submitted as a whole in G1. The remainder of the specimen is
