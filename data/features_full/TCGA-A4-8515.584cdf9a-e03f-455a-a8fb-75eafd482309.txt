Right Renal Mass On Native Kidney.Right Hydronephrosis Of
Kidney, Right

GROSS EXAMINATION:

The specimen is received fresh in a container labeled with
the name of the patient and labeled as kidney, right. The
specimen consists of a kidney and attached perinephric fat.
The kidney measures 6 x 3.8 x 2.2 cm and weighs 47 g. The
ureter and vascular margins of resection are submitted in
block 1. The renal sinus/hilar margin is submitted in block
2. Sectioning shows an oval tan mass in the mid lateral
aspect which measures 3.1 cm in greatest dimension. The mass
bulges against the capsule but is not grossly adherent to
the capsule. A section of capsule overlying the mass is
submitted in block 3. The mass does not grossly involve the
renal sinus. Sections of the mass are submitted in blocks
4—7. The pelves and calyces are not grossly dilated. The
cortex averages 0.1 cm. A random section of kidney is
submitted in block 8. Sectioning through the attached fat
shows no lymph nodes or adrenal tissue. This case was
reviewed with

DIAGNOSIS BASED ON GROSS AND MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

Kidney, right, nephrectomy:
— Papillary renal cell carcinoma, type I, Fuhrman grade 2,
3.1 cm, confined to kidney with negative margins (see cancer

case summari checklist belowl.
KIDNEY: Nephrectomy, Partial or Radical (Version 3.1.0.0)

PROCEDURE: Radical nephrectomy

TUMOR SITE: Middle
TUMOR SIZE:
Greatest dimension: 3.1 cm
TUMOR FOCALITY: Unifocal
MACROSCOPIC EXTENT OF TUMOR: Tumor limited to kidney
HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Papillary renal cell carcinoma, type I
SARCOMATOID FEATURES: Not identified
HISTOLOGIC GRADE (FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE): Grade 2: Nuclei
slightly irregular, approximately 15 microns, nucleoli
evident.
MICROSCOPIC TUMOR EXTENSION: Tumor limited to kidney.
MARGINS: Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.
LYMPH—VASCULAR INVASION: Not identified.
PATHOLOGIC STAGING (pTNM):

Primary Tumor (pT): pTla: Tumor 4 cm or less in
greatest dimension, limited to kidney.
Regional Lymph Nodes (pN): pNX: Cannot be assessed, no
nodes submitted or found.
Distant Metastasis (pM): Not applicable.
PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS IN NONNEOPLASTIC KIDNEY: End Stage
renal renal disease with numerous sclerotic glomeruli,
thyroidization of tubules, fibrosis, and chronic
inflammation.

COMMENT:

This case was delayed to perform a panel of immunostains
which shows the tumor cells to be positive for CK7, EMA,
pankeratin, vimentin, CD10, RCC, PAX8, and P5048. They are
negative for WT1. Positive and negative controls stained
appropriately. Based on the histologic appearance and
immunoprofile, this neoplasm is best interpreted as
papillary renal cell carcinoma, type I.

A fragment of tumor is associated with the edge of the soft
tissue on the section of the ureteral and vascular margins.
Multiple step sections are examined. Based on the very
peripheral location of the tumor with no macroscopic
evidence of involvement of the medulla or renal sinus, this
tumor focus is best interpreted as a knife carry—over or a
floater.

Intradepartmental consultation obtained.
