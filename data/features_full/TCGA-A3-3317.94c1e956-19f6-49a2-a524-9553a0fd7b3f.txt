Frozen Diagnosis

Report : GROSS EXAMINATION.
The specimen is received in a container labeled with the
name of the patient and labeled as kidney, left. The
specimen consists of a kidney and attached perinephric fat
which measures en bloc 24 x 14 x 10 cm and weighs 1709 g.
The ureter and vascular margins of resection are submitted
in block 1. The lower pole and midportion of the kidney
shows a large golden yellow mass measuring 12.0 x 9.0 x 7.0
cm. The mass grossly bulges against the capsule and is
focally adherent to the capsule. Sections of the capsule
adjacent to the mass are submitted in block 2. The kidney
stripped of capsule and fat measures 13.5 x 11.0 x 7.0 cm
and weighs 542 g. Sections of the mass are submitted in
block 3—8. Sections of the renal sinus are submitted in
blocks 9—10. The pelvis and calices are not grossly
dilated. The cortex averages 0.7 cm. A random section of
kidney is submitted in block 11. Sectioning through the
attached fat shows an adrenal gland measuring 8.0 X 2.5 x
a Representative sections are submitted in block 12.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

Multiple sections of kidney shows a renal cell carcinoma
with clear cell features, moderately wellndifferentiated
consistent with a Fuhrman grade 2 forming a tumor mass that
by description measures up to 12 cm greatest diameter.
Sections of the capsule Show no apparent adherence of the
tumor to the capsule or in the surrounding pericapsular
adipose tissue. Both the ureter and vascular margins are
free of tumor. No definite blood vessel invasion by the
tumor could be seen. Section of the area of the renal sinus
is negative for tumor and the pelvis of the kidney and
bordering ureter is also negative.
