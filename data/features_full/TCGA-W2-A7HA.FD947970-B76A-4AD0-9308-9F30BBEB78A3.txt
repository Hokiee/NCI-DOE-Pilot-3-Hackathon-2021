Pheochromocytoma. Fresh tissue (specimen A) saved for
tissue bank.

Diagnosis:
A. Right adrenal:
~ Pheochromocytoma.
Note: the tumor is well-circumscribed and
encapsulated. There is no evidence of infiltration
of the capsule into the surrounding
structures. There is no evidence of increased mitotic
activity or tumor cell necrosis. There
is one focus of vascular invasion noted (slide A6).
Clinical follow-up is recommended as
histologic features may not always correlate well
with biologic behavior.

E. Gallbladder:
~ Chronic cholecystitis with cholesterolosis.

Gross:

A. The specimen is labeled "right adrenal." Received fresh
in is a 96.0 gm, 7.0 x 6.5 x 4.5 cm adrenal gland

with a scant amount of attached fibroadipose tissue. The
adrenal appears well-encapsulated with a smooth tan—orange
outer surface. The specimen is marked with black ink and
serially sectioned to reveal the majority of the specimen
composed of a well-circumscribed mass, 6.5 x 5.5 x 4.5 cm.
The mass exhibits a soft red-tan hemorrhagic cut surface
with a faint lobulated pattern. The mass is focally
surrounded a thin rim of orange-tan cortical tissue. The

uninvolved adrenal exhibits a rim of cortical tissue with a
central thin tan-brown medulla. Photos of overall and cut
specimen are taken. Portions of the mass and unremarkable

adrenal are submitted for tissue bank.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

B. The specimen is labeled "gallbladder." Received fresh

and placed in formalin is an 8.0 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm intact
gallbladder with a small amount of attached cystic duct, 0.4
cm in diameter. The serosa is smooth and pink-tan. The
specimen is opened to reveal a lumen filled with brown—red
bile. No stones are present. The mucosa is velvety and
dark brown with diffuse yellow speckling. The wall
thickness is 0.1 to 0.2 cm. Representative sections,
including cystic duct margin, are submitted in cassette B.

Microscopic:
Histological examinations have been performed on specimens A
and B.
