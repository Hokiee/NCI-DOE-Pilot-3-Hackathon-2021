*** Report Electronically Signed Out *"

Gross Description:

1) The specimen is received fresh labeled "biopsy right thigh" and
consists of gray-tan fragments of soft tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm
in aggregate. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section.

Summary of sections
EEC-frozen section control

2) The specimen is received fresh labeled "eloquet node right groin' and
consists of a pink-tan soft tissue fragment (apparent lymph node) measuring
2.2 x 2.2 x 0.7 cm. A portion of the specimen is submitted for frozen
section and the frozen tissue is submitted for histologic examination. The
remaining tissue is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections
Fsc-frozen section control
U-undesignated

3) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled "Proximal
margin of right psoes muscle'l and consists of a flattened to irregularly
shaped unoriented piece of red-tan somewhat friable skeletal muscle
measuring 5.7 x 4.5 x 0.5 cm. The specimen has been previously incised and
the external surface is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned to
reveal homogenous red-tan tissue, with no discrete abnormalities identified.
A representative section is submitted for frozen section. the remaining
tissue is serially sectioned and submitted entirely.

Summary of sections:

ssc -- frozen section control
SS serial sections remaining tissue

4) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled "Deep
margin' and consists of an irregularly shaped unoriented fragment of

pink—tan soft tissue measuring 2.0 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted for
frozen section.

Summary of sections:
Fsc -- frozen section control

5) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled "Medial
deep margin" and consists of a fragment of brown-tan soft tissue measuring
1.0 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm. Entirely submitted for frozen section.

Summary of sections:
PSC at frozen section control

6) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled 'Margin
of profunde' and consists of a fragment of soft tissue measuring 0.6 x 0.3 x
0.2 cm. Entirely submitted for frozen section.

Summary of sections:
FSC -- frozen section control

7) The specimen is received fresh labeled 'Right thigh mass. right
stitch deep margin, black stitch distal margin. green stitch proximal psoas
tendon“. It consists of a segment of skeletal muscle and attached
yellow-tan fatty tissue measuring 17 x 15 x 7.5 cm. The anterior skeletal
muscle measures 14 x 7.5 x 1.7 cm. There are three stitches attached to the
specimen. The white stitch marks the deep margin, the black stitch marks
the distal margin, and the green stitch marks the proximal psoas tendon.

The specimen is inked as follows: deep margin black, proximal margin blue,
distal margin green, superficial and medial margin red, lateral
marginyellow. The specimen is bivalved to reveal a well circumscribed,
faintly lobulated fleshy hemorrhagic white-tan tumor measuring 12.4 x 8.4 x
7.9 cm. The tumor is located 2 cm from the distal soft tissue margin, 0.4
cm from the superficial soft tissue margin, 0.3 cm from medial soft tissue
margin, and shuts the lateral, deep, and proximal soft tissue margins. The
tumor is located 6 cm from the psoas tendon margin, which is shaved and
submitted entirely. Representative perpendicular sections of the remaining
soft tissue margins are submitted. Representative sections are submitted.
A sample of the tumor is given to TPS. The specimen has been photographed.

Summary of sections:
LM—lateral margin

MM-medial margin

DM—deep margin

AM—superficial margin
SM—proximal soft tissue margin
IM-distal margin
