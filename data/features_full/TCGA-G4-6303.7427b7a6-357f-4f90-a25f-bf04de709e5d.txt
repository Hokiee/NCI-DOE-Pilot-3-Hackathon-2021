GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. PERITONEAL IMPLANT:
Received fresh is a 1x0.8x0.7 cm. tan-red piece of tissue with tan-white solid cut surface. Half is
submitted for frozen section and the other half is submitted in cassette A2.
B. SMALL BOWEL IMPLANT:
Received fresh is one fragment of tan-pink soft tissue measuring 1x0.5x0.4 cm. The specimen is
submitted in toto in one cassette.
C. SIGMOID COLON:RESECTION
Received in fresh state is a resected segment of sigmoid colon with attached indurated pericolic fat
measuring 17 cm in length. There is a firm, palpable mass with overlying indurated mesocolic fat in the
mid segment of the specimen, which when opened shows an ulcerated exophytic circumferential tumor
situated 10.5 cm and 9.0 cm from margins of resection. The tumor measures 5 x 3.5 x 1.6 cm. Cut
section shows a tan dirty white granular firm surface infiltrating the full thickness of the colonic wall
with extension into the subjacent adipose tissue. The remainder of the colonic mucosa shows
prominent mucosal fold with hyperemia. Approximately 25 lymph nodes are identified ranging in size
from 0.1 to 0.8 cm in diameter Multiple sections are submitted as follows:
Cf -C5: en bloc section of tumor with pericolic fat
CG-C7: sections from the resecte margins
08-10- sections form tumor areathe colonic wall and area of tumor

Cf 1-C24: sections from lymph nodes

C25-C31: additional more sections tumor and adjacent areas.
D. RECTAL DONUT:
Received in formalin is a piece of donut tissue measuring 2.5x1.8x0.8 cm. Specimen is bisected and
submitted in toto in cassette D1 and D2.
E. COLON DONUT:
Received in formalin is a donut shaped tissue measuring 2.0x1.7x0.6 cm. The specimen is bisected
and submitted in toto in cassette E1 and E2.
Also included is a n umbrella shaped like metallic object ,(rod measures 3.0cm.in length and head
measures 3.0 cm in diameter.. Gross exam only.
