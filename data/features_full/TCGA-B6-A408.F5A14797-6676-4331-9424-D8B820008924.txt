CLINICAL HISTORY:
Left breast cancer. Per E browser, invasive ductal carcinoma with lobular

features in the left axillary tail.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A- "Left breast with axillary contents", received unfixed and placed in
formalin is a 842 gram, 24 x 18.5 x 7 cm mastectomy specimen with a 20 x 10 cm
attached skin ellipse and a 1.1 cm nipple. The specimen is received with
incisions in the lateral aspect of the breast and in the axillary tail. The
specimen is oriented with a long suture at the lateral edge. Per requisition
there is also a short stitch to indicate superior, but no short stitch is
present on the specimen.

There is a 2.1 x 2 x 1.2 cm firm, tan mass at lateral 3:00. The mass is 0.3 cm
from the closest deep margin, 2 cm from the superior margin, 5.8 cm from the
inferior margin, 3.5 cm from the lateral margin and 20 cm from the medial
margin. The mass is 0.2 cm from the overlying skin, which is slightly
puckered. The remainder of the breast consists of grossly unremarkable
fibroadipose tissue. Multiple lymph nodes are identified in the axillary tail,
1 , 7 cm in greatest dimension.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

A1—8— entire mass with the closest approach to skin in A1 and closest
approach to deep margin in A2
A9” superior margin nearest to tumor, tangential

A10-13— intact lymph node candidates
A14-16- one lymph node, bisected in each

A17- representative upper inner quadrant
AlB- representative lower inner quadrant
319— representative upper outer quadrant
AZO- representative lower outer quadrant
A21- nipple

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

NOTE! Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is

transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for 7,2"?
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely ’Co
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate

information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,

past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative

findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining

the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.

The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.
