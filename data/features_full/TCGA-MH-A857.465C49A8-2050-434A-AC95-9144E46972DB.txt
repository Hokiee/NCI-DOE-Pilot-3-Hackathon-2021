POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
left renal mass

Surgeon/physician:

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. The specimen is received fresh for intraoperative consultation and
consists of a 1.2 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm tan— yellow irregular tissue fragment

that is submitted in toto for frozen and permanent section in cassette
FsA.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:

FsA. Base of left renal tumor, biopsy:
— NO TUMOR SEEN

B. The specimen consists of a 173 gm, 11.2 x 6.5 x 3. 2 cm tan— yellow
aggregate of fatty soft tissue partially surfaced by a tan- pink smooth
glistening peritoneal surface. No discrete lesions are identified.
Sectioning reveals a tan~ ~yellow unremarkable fatty cut surface.
Representative sections are submitted in cassettes Bl—B6.

C. The specimen consists of a 54.7 gm, 5.5 x 5.2 x 3.8 cm partial
nephrectomy specimen partially surfaced by a tan- brown scabrous renal
resection margin. The capsular margin is partially surfaced by tan
yellow lobulated fat. The renal resection margin is inked blue and
the capsular margin is inked black.

The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 4.6 x 3.8 x 3.2 cm
tan—yellow to brown to red variegated poorly demarcated mass that
grossly extends less than 1 mm from the renal resection margin and 0.4
cm from the overlying Gerota's fascia/capsular margin. There is a
minimal amount of uninvolved renal parenchyma at the renal resection
margin.

Representative sections of the majority of the mass, to include the
capsular and renal resection margins, are submitted sequentially in

cassettes Cl—Cl7. (Please note that a representative portion is taken
for

MICROSCOPIC EXAM
DIAGNOSIS:

A. Base of left renal tumor, excision:
— NO TUMOR IDENTIFIED

B. Left renal peritumor fat, excision:
— FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NO TUMOR IDENTIFIED

C. Left renal tumor, partial nephrectomy:
— PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA
— CHROMOPHOBE RENAL CELL CARCINOMA
(SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT)
SYNOPTIC REPORT:
PROCEDURE: Partial nephrectomy
SPECIMEN LATERALITY: Left

TUMOR SIZE:
Greatest dimension:

1.8 cm (chromophobe renal cell carcinoma)
1.6 cm (papillary renal cell carcinoma)

TUMOR FOCALITY: Multifocal
MACROSCOPIC EXTENT OF TUMOR: Tumor limited to kidney

HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Papillary renal cell carcinoma
Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma

SARCOMATOID FEATURES: Not identified
TUMOR NECROSIS: Present

HISTOLOGIC GRADE:
62 (papillary renal cell Carcinoma)
Not applicable (chromophobe renal cell carcinoma)

MICROSCOPIC TUMOR EXTENSION: Tumor limited to kidney
MARGINS: Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma

(Closest margin: Papillary renal cell carcinoma
1 mm from capsular margin;

Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma 1 mm from renal
parenchymal margin)

LYMPH-VASCULAR INVASION: Not identified

PATHOLOGIC STAGING: ‘
Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma: pTl,pNX,pMX
Papillary renal cell carcinoma: pT1,pNX,pMX

COMMENT: By immunohistochemistry the chromophobe RCC is positive for
CK7, and negative for CD15, vimentin and 5045. The papillary RCC is
positive for 504s.

_ concurs with the diagnosis. Physician was notified at the
time of frozen section and via on
