UNREMARKABLE SKIN AND FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE (gross diagnose only.)

 

PART 2: LEFT ADNEXA, SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY - .

geometrial invasion is present but is superﬁcial (less than 50% for staging purposes). Myometrial thickness ranged from .
1.1 to 3.0 cm. Although the gross impression was that the thinnest myometrial area represented deep Invasion, the 5p)“

presence of both tumor and uninvolved endometrium in that area better supports that there is minimal invasion there.

Patient’s history of BRCA1 mutation is noted; the remainder of the adnexa (Parts 2 and 3) were totally submitted for

histological evaluation. Please cross refer the pelvic wash specimen .— which was negative for malignant
cells. Patient’s previous diagnosis of endometrioid adenocarcinoma Is noted—

 

CASE SYNOPSIS:
SYNOPTIC - PRIMARY UTERINE ENDOMETRIAL TUMORS: HYSTERECTOMY SPECIMENS

Anterior endomyometrium: 100 %, Posterior endomyometrium: 100 %

DEPTH OF INVASION“: Less than 1/2 thickness of myometrium

MARGINS OF RESECTION: Vaginal margin is negative for tumor. Parametrium margin is negative for tumor
ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION: No

OTHER: (epithelial, smooth muscle, others), Leiomyoma, Others endometriosis

LYMPH NODES EXAMINED: Total number of lymph nodes examined: 0

T STAGE. PATHOLOGIC: pT1b

N STAGE, PATHOLOGIC: pNX

M STAGE, PATHOLOGIC: pMX

FIGO STAGE: lB

Comment: Grossly the tumor was felt to involve the entire endometrial surface-microscopically,

uninvolved endometrium is present in areas involved by tumor.

Immunostains were used in the interpretatlon of Part 4 (see microscopic description).
