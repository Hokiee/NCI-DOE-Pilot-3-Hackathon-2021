GROSS DESCRIPTION: .

The specimen is received in the fresh state from the operating room for immediate gross
evaluation for tumor banking and consists of a right colectomy specimen. The colon
measures 27 cm in length x 10 cm in circumference. Present in the distal portion of the
colon is a iungating. red tumor which measures 9 x 6 x 3 cm. located 6 cm from the distal
margin and 3 cm from the radial margin. The terminal ileum measures 14 cm in length x 4 cm
in circumference x 1 cm in wall thickness and appears unremarkable. The appendix appears
to be surgically absent. A representative section of the tumor is removed by aseptic
technique. and the tumor obstructs the lumen. infiltrates the subserosa but does not appear
to penetrate the visceral peritoneum. The following sections are submitted:

Block 1 ~ proximal margin

Block 2 — distal margin

Blocks 3-6 — colon tumor

Blocks 7-9 - whole lymph nodes

Block 10 — one lymph node trisected
Block 11 — one lymph node bisected
Block 12 — one lymph node trisected

Regional adipose tissue resected with the specimen measures 30 x 4 x 2 cm. A relatively
small number of lymph nodes is present. These are soft and measure up to 1 cm.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
IMMEDIATE GROSS EVALUATION:
— ADENOCARCINOMA PRESENT IN COLON. PROCESSED FOR TUMOR BANKING
