Side of specimen: right

Size and weight of specimen: 281.4 grams, 14.5 X 8.0 X 5.0
cm overall dimensions composed of a 13.3 x 6 X 3.5 cm
kidney with a small amount of attached perinephric fat and
a 3 cm length of ureter.

No adrenal gland is identified.
Orientation: The external surface is marked with blue ink.
Presence/absence of adrenal gland: absent

Tumor description/site: The tumor is located in the
superior/medial pole of the kidney and is a solitary
circumscribed, orange/red soft nodule.

Description of kidney away from tumor: Dark red/brown,
homogeneous with an average cortical thickness of 0.6 cm.
The pelvic urothelium is velvety, red/tan and of normal
caliber. The ureter is patent.

Lymph nodes (hilar): No hilar lymph nodes are identified,
but representative from the hilar fat is submitted for
evaluation.

Other significant findings: none

Tissue submitted for special investigations: Tumor and
normal are given to Tissue Procurement
