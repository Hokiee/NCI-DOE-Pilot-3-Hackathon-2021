PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:

SPECIMEN DESIGNATED “LEFT KIDNEY (323.5g)~
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, clear cell ( nventional) type (5.6 cm),
Fuhrman nuclear grade 2 (of 4).
Soft tissue, ureteral, and vascular margins are negative for tumor.
The tumor extends into the renal vein.
The tumor does not invade renal capsule.
No lymphovascular invasion identified.
Adrenal gland, negative for tumor.

The non—neoplastic kidney will be evaluated by Renal Pathologyr and the
findings will be reported in an addendum.

Clinical Diagnosis: Renal 'cell CA...“

TISSUE SUBMITTED:
A/l . Left kidney.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh, labeled with the patient’s name, unit number,

and "#1. Left kidney", consists of a left kidney {323.5 g, 16.7 x 8.8 x 5.1
cm), to include a ureter {7.8 x 0.2 cm}, artery (0.7 x 0.4 cm), and vein (0.5 x
0.7 cm). The kidney is encapsulated by Gerota‘s fascia consisting of
tan/yellow lobulated adipose tissue. Sectioning of the specimen shows a
tan/pink to tan/yellow, interpolar, irregular mass (5.6 x 5.0 x 5.0 cm} that is
partially encapsulated. The mass is 2.5 cm to the arterial margin, 2.5 cm to
the renal vein margin, and 10.5 cm to the ureteral margin. The mass disrupts
twenthirds of the renal parenchyma, and abuts the kidney capsule, coming to
within less than 0.1 cm of the inked margin. The tumor also grossly extends
into the renal vein. The unremarkable urothelium is tan/gray smooth and
glistening and unremarkable. The remaining renal parenchyma is tan/brown and
has a focally well defined corticomedullary junction. Sectioning of the
perirenal adipose tissue (2.0 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm) shows a centrally hemorrhagic
medulla, surrounded by a tan/yellow cortex. Further sectioning of the
perirenal adipose tissue shows no lymph nodes.

METAPHASES COUNTED: 5 ANALYZED: 5 SCORED: O BANDING: GTG

INTERPRETATION:
All metaphases contained the clonal aberrations described above. Loss of the

short arm of chromosome 3 is a characteristic finding in renal cell carcinoma,
clear cell type.

COMMENTS:
Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the

standard methods employed. Chromosome analysis was performed at a level of 400
bands or greater. ‘ -
