A. Received fresh labeled with the patient’s name and "prostate" is a 68 gram prostate measuring 5.2 cm from right to left. 5.7 cm
from anteriorto posterior, and 3.9 cm from superior to inferior. The right seminal vesicle measures 3.8 x 1.9 x 0.9 cm, the right
vas deferens measures 4.3 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter, the left vas deferens measures 3.9 cm in length and 0.5 cm in
diameter and the left seminal vesicle measures 3.0 x 1.4 x 0.7 cm. The external surface of the prostate is tan-pink and primarily

ragged. The right side of the prostate is inked black and the left side is inked orange. The prostate is serially sectioned to reveal a
tan-brown nodular cut surface. The specimen is submitted as follows:
A1 Right bladder neck margin.

A2 Left bladder neck margin.

A3 Right distal urethral margin.

A4 Left distal urethral margins.

A5 Right seminal vesicle and vas deferens margin.

A6 Left seminal vesicle and vas deferens margin.

A7 Representative section from the right mid-anterior prostate.
A8 Representative section from the left mid-anterior prostate.

A9-A16 Every other section from the posterior right lobe from apex to base (A12 and A13 is one section bisected; A14 and A15 is
one section bisected).

A17—A24 Every other section from the posterior left lobe from apex to base (A21 and A22 is one section bisected: A23 and A24 is
one section bisected).

B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "right external iliac lymph node" is a 4.9 x 4.6 x 1.1 cm aggregate of
yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue that is palpated to reveal six possible lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm to 2.0 x
1.0 x 0.6 cm. The specimen is submitted as follows:

B1 Two possible lymph nodes.

B2 Three possible lymph nodes.

BB One possible lymph node, bisected.

C. Received in formalin labeled with the patient‘s name and "right obturator lymph node" is a 6.9 x 2.2 x 1.4 cm aggregate of

yellow-tan ﬁbroadipose tissue that is palpated to reveal two possible lymph nodes measuring 2.1 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm and 2.3 x 1.4 x 0.8
cm. The specimen is submitted as follows:

C1 One possible lymph node. bisected.
C2 One possible lymph node, bisected.

D. Received in formalin labeled with the patient‘s name and "right hypogastric lymph node" is a 3.4 x 2.8 x 0.7 cm aggregate of
yellow-tan ﬁbroadiposetissue that is palpated to reveal two possible lymph nodes measuring 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm and 1.9 x 1.1 x 0.6
cm. The specimen is submitted as follows:

D1 One possible lymph node.

D2 One possible lymph node.

E. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "left external iliac lymph node" is a 5.2 x 3.1 x 0.9 cm aggregate of
yellow—tan ﬁbroadipose tissue that is palpated to reveal six possible lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm to 1.3 x
1.2 x 0.7 cm. The specimen is submitted as follows:

E1 Three possible lymph nodes.

E2 Three possible lymph nodes.

E3 One possible lymph node, bisected.

F. Received In formalin labeled with the patient‘s name and "left obturator lymph node" is a 5.7 x 4.2 x 1.0 cm aggregate of
yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue that is palpated to reveal four possible lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm to 1.7 x
1.0 x 0.9 cm. The specimen is submitted as follows:

F1 Three possible lymph nodes.

F2 One possible lymph node, bisected.

G. Received in forrnalln labeled with the patient's name and "left hypogastric lymph node“ is a 3.9 x 3.5 x 1.3 cm aggregate of

yellow-tan ﬁbroadipose tissue that is palpated to reveal two possible lymph nodes measuring 2.0 x 1.4 x 0.6 cm and 3.4 x 1.4 x 0.6
cm. The specimen is submitted as follows:

G1 One possible lymph node.
62—63 One possible lymph node, bisected.

H. Received in formalin labeled with the patient‘s name and "hernia sac" is a 4.2 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm irregular piece of tanibrown

tissue. The tissue is serially sectioned and no gross abnormalities are identified. Representative sections are submitted in
cassette H1 .
