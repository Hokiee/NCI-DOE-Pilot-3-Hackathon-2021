A: The specimen is received fresh from the O. R. and labeled "Right distal ureter —

F/S“. It consists of a single fragment of ten tissue dimensions are not provided.
The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in AFS.

 

B: The specimen is received fresh from the 0. R. and labeled "Left distal ureter -

F/S". - It consists of a single fragment of tan tissue dimensions are not provided.
The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in BPS

C: The specimen is received fresh from the 0. R. and labeled "Bladder uterus,
bilat. tubes & ovaries“. It consists of a radical cystectomy, hysterectomy with
bilateral salpingo oophorectomy specimen measuring overall 18 x 15 x 5 cm. A flap
of peritoneal fat is present and measures 10 x 5 x 1 cm Attached is a bladder
measuring 7 x 6 x 3 cm and the uterus measures 6 x 3.5 x 2 cm. The outer surface
of the specimen is inked black. The bladder is opened longitudinally. Opening the
specimen reveal multiple masses attached to the dome of the bladder, right lateral
wall, left lateral wall, anterior wall and the right ureterovesical junction. The
largest mass measures 3 cm in greatest dimension. The outer surface of the masses
is tan, irregular and slightly lobulated. The different tumor does not appear to
invade the underlying soft tissue and the fat grossly. Also sectioning through the
tumor reveal predominantly mural involvement with a freely mobile, grossly
unremarkable perivesical fat. The surrounding retroperitoneal margin is grossly
free of tumor. The adjacent urethral surfaces show tan, urethral mucosa with no
other discreet nodule grossly identified. The right distal ureter is dilated and
measures 4 cm in length x 1.8 cm in circumference. The left distal ureter measures
3.5 cm in length x 0.5 cm in circumference and is grossly unremarkable. The
urethral mucosa of both the right and left ureters are grossly unremarkable.
Attached to the posterior bladder is a large strip of vaginal mucosa measuring 7 x
2.8 x 0.2 cm. The vaginal mucosa is tan, smooth and grossly unremarkable. The
attached uterus and cervix measures overall 6 x 3.5 x 2 cm. The uterine cavity
measures 2.5 x 2 x 1 cm and is grossly unremarkable. The endometrium is tan,
smooth and measures 0.2 cm in thickness. The myometrium is tan and measures 0.8 cm
in thickness. No intracavitary lesion is identified. The cervix measures 2 cm in
length x 1 cm in diameter. The endocervical canal measures 1.5 cm in length x 1 cm
in circumference. The endocervical mucosa is tan, smooth and glistening. The
right fallopian tube measures 2 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter and is grossly
unremarkable. The right ovary measures 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and is grossly
unremarkable. The left fallopian tube measures 2 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter
and is grossly unremarkable. The left ovary measures 1.2 x 0.5 x x 0.5 cm and is
grossly unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted in 30 cassettes.

D: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Umbilical hernia sac". It
consists of multiple fragments of yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue measuring in
aggregate 3 x 2 x 1 cm. Representative sections are submitted in two cassettes.

E: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "R node of cloquet". It
consists of a single fragment of ten fibroadipose'tissue measuring 1 x 1 x 1 cm.
The specimen is dissected and a single lymph node is identified measuring 1 cm in

greatest diameter. The lymph node is bisected and entirely submitted in one
cassette.

F: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled 9R. external iliac lymph
nodes". It consists of multiple fragments of yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue
measuring in aggregate 3 x 2 x 1 cm. The specimen is dissected for lymph nodes, a

few lymph nodes are identified. The specimen is entirely submitted in four
cassettes.

G: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "R obturator/hypogastric L.
nodes". It consists of multiple fragments of yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue
measuring in aggregate 7 x 4 x 3 cm. The specimen is dissected for lymph nodes,
several lymph nodes are identified. Representative sections are submitted in five

 

cassettes.
