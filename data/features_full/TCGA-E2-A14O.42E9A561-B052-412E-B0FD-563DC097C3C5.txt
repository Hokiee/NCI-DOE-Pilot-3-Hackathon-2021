INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:
TPA: Sentinel lymph node #1, biopsy: Positive for carcinoma
Gross exam 8: Left breast, mastectomy: Multiple tumors identified; closest is 1.5 cm from inferior/anterior aspect
By Dr called to Dr at

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 LEFT AXILLA
Received fresh is a tan-pink fragment of ﬁbrofatty tissue (4.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm). Dissection reveals a ﬁrm presumptive
lymph node (1.4 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm). The specimen is serially sectioned and touch preps are taken. Submitted in toto in
A1.
8. LEFT BREAST
Received fresh labeled "left breast" is a 1,184-gram simple mastectomy specimen (27.0 x 25.0 x 6.5 cm) with a
stitch on the axillary tail. The specimen is partially surfaced with a tan-pink ellipse of skin (15.0 x 10.5 cm) with a 1
cm centrally located, partially ﬂattened nipple and 3.5 cm areola rim. The skin surface is remarkable for a grey-white,
well-healed scar in the upper outer quadrant measuring 1 cm that is 8.0 cm from the nipple. The specimen is inked
and serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 14 slices; slice 1 being most medial, slice 14 being most lateral. The
nipple is located in slice 8. The cut surface reveals a grey-white, ﬁrm, stellate mass (6.0 x 5.5 x 4.0 cm) located in
the upper central and upper outer quadrants and present in slices 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. This mass measures 1.5 cm
from all margins. A second lesion is located in the 7 o’clock position (0.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm) in slice 6. Lesion #2 is
located 0.6 cm from lesion #1, and measures 1.5 cm from the closest inferior margin. An ill-deﬁned nodular area
(lesion 3) is located 4.5 cm superior to lesion #2 in slice 6 and more than 2.0 cm from the deep margin. A portion of
the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Gross examination did not reveal distinct 12:00 and 10:00 lesions
as designated on the request form. Lesions 2 and 3 may correspond to the 10:00 lesions as they did appear grossly
separate from the main tumor mass, although very close. The main mass appeared conﬂuent grossly and may
encompass the 12:00 lesion. The remaining cut surfaces reveal predominantly yellow lobulated adipose tissue
interspersed with grey-white ﬁbrous tissue. Inked code: Superior anterior — blue, orange — inferior anterior, black —
posterior. Section code:

ER: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion score: 5 + Intensity Score 3
PR: Positive Allred Score: 7 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 2
COMMENT:

The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the proportion score (0
= no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining. 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of cells staining, 4 = 31—60% of
cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate
intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring range from 0 to 8.
ERIPR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ERIPR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than or
equal to 2.
Methodology: Fixation Type and Length: Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin i

for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Antibody and Assay Methodology: Mouse anti-human ER and

METHODOLOGY
Methodology: Fixation Type and Length: Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (

‘) for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Antibody and Assay Methodology: Rabbit anti-human HER2,
HerceptestTM (FDA-approved test kit), ”,. Control Slides Examined: External kit—slides
provided by manufacturer (cell lines with nrgn, low and negative HER2 protein expression), and in-house known
HER2 ampliﬁed control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. These control slides run along side of this
patient's sample showed appropriate staining. Adequacy of Specimen: Adequate, well preserved. clear-cut invasive
carcinoma identiﬁed for HER2 evaluation.

Scoring Criterion and Scoring System:

Equivocal Category for HER2 IHC results: A HER2, 2+ staining result that is interpreted as equivocal may not
indicate gene ampliﬁcation. A FISH test for HER2 gene ampliﬁcation will be ordered for all HER2 IHC 2+ results.
COMMENT

This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for‘ I (Hereptin) therapy (1,2). Clinical
Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective response and overall
survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of whether HER2 tumor status was
determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase
disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2
protein over-expressed or gene ampliﬁed invasive breast cancer (3).

HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved Dako HercepTest
(TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This assay was not modiﬁed, and

adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical
staining characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (4), information provided by the
reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department.

HER2 TEST VALIDATION

This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised recommendations and
guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the jointly issued recommendations and
guidelines from A300 and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC
as outline above and interpreted as, negative (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without
knowledge of the previous reported results.

These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as ampliﬁed or non~amoliﬁed and the
HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance between the IHC
and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were
interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-ampliﬁed by FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be
ampliﬁed.

The Pathology Department lmmunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests performance
and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of HER2 assays. The
laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including the CAP proﬁciency testing
program.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
A year-old female with left multicentric disease. large 4.5 cm mass in upper outer quadrant 10 o‘clock + IDC with
3 small masses; 12 o’clock + IDC 5 mm mass

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
None given

ADDENDUM:

Patthsion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit
Case No

Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED

Clinical Interpretation of results

Ampliﬁcation of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase ﬂuorescence in-situ

hybridization (FISH) on formalin—ﬁxed parafﬁn embedded tissue sections using a chromosome

17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the

'- by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed mild polysomy 17 with 2

to 3 chromosome 17 signals and 2 to 5 HER—2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0,

consistent with no ampliﬁcation of the HER2/neu gene.

Block used 820 Source of case:

Tissue ﬁxation formalin-ﬁxed tissueOutside Case No: NA

Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes

HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.65
This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of
CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic
mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded.

Method of ratio enumeration: manual count
Limitations
The Vysis Patthsion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is
intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free
and overall survival in stage II. node—positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding
adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into
consideration. such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. No
treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-2/neu
gene ampliﬁcation status alone.
Overview of this test
FDA APPROVED REAGENT

Patthsion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of
patients for whom Herceptin® therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the
I, under the direction

of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the
clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.
