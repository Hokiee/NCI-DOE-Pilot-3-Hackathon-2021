Lymph Nodes:
Number with metastasis: 11
Total number examined: 40

Tumor Staging (AJCC 7th Edition):
pT3 (Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into
pericolorectal tissues)
Lymph Node Stage (AJCC 7th Edition):
N2b (Metastasis in seven or more regional lymph nodes)

NOTE: IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINS SHOW THAT THE TUMOR CELLS ARE POSITIVE FOR
CK20, CDX2, AND VERY FOCALLY POSITIVE FOR CK7, WHILE NEGATIVE FOR
SYNAPTOPHYSIN, CHROMOGRANIN, ER AND PR. THE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH A
PRIMARY COLON CARCINOMA.

Some of the immunohistochemistry and ISH tests were developed and their
performance characteristics were determined by the Department of Pathology.
They have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is
not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not
be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified
under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of as
qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

 

1. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right colon" and consists of a
segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and ascending colon.
The terminal ileum measures 11.5 cm in length and 3.3 cm in circumference

at the proximal resected margin. The remaining colon measures 46 cm in
length with a circumference of 7.5 cm at the distal resected margin. The
attached appendix measures 5 cm in length and averages 0.8 cm in diameter.
The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth. Focally

hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the
specimen measuring up to 2.0 cm in thickness. The specimen is opened to
reveal a partially fungating and partially infiltrating lesion measuring 8.5
cm in length and 7 cm in width. The mass is located in the cecum, 11.5 cm
from the proximal margin and 39 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning shows
that the tumor invades possibly subserosal fibroadipose tissue. The depth of
invasion is 1.1 cm grossly. The remaining mucosa shows 3 polyps measuring
0.2 to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. The attached adipose tissue is
thoroughly examined and all identified lymph nodes are submitted.
Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for permanent sections
and for TPS.

Summary of sections:

P - proximal margin shave

D - distal margin shave

T - tumor

A - appendix representative sections
RSC -representative sections of colon
RSI - representative sections of ilium
POY - polyps, representatives

LP - largest polyp, serial sections
LN - lymph nodes

BLN - bisected lymph nodes
