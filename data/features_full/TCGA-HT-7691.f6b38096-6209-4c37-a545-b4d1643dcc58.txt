Addendum Discussion:

Sections demonstrate benign cerebellum with degenerative changes including neuronal
loss and gliosis. There is moderately cellular neoplasm composed of cells that resemble
modestly atypical fibrillary astrocytes. In general, the tumor appears to have an expanded
interface with the adjacent cerebellum. Scattered Rosenthal fibers are present, primarily
at the periphery of the tumor. The tumor has a solid growth pattern. Vascular
hyalinization is seen and there are numerous microcalcifications. In some areas the
calcifications predominate over the tumor cells. No atypical ganglion cells are seen and
no eosinophilic granular bodies are noted. Perivascular pseudo rosettes are not noted.

Diagnosis:
CP Angle/Cerebellar Tumor
Well differentiated Astrocytoma (Grade 2)
