Enucleation of the right eye. Q40 Qj/ 6/] 9’

Macroscopy:

The eyeball measures 28X20 mm and the posterior optic nerve segment 7 mm. At
the section, it presents a black tumor measuring 13 mm main line. The piece has
been ﬁxed and included entirely.

Microscopy / ”(W and 5% MW.

The specimens observed present a cell proliferation with the histological features of a
melanoma. This tumor is mainly composed of fusiform cells (97%) which present
moderate nuclear atypias and a large cytoplasm frequently loaded with melanin. The
mitotic index is low (three mitoses per 10 high power ﬁeld).

The tumor size is 13 mm main line.
The lesion invades the ciliary body . The sclera is free.

The optic nerve on its entire course as well as its cut end and the meningeal sheath
are free of tumor.

Conclusion:

Uveal melanoma composed of fusiform cells (97%).
Epithelioid cells: <3%

Tumor size: 13 mm.

Tumor extension of the ciliary body.

The sclera is free.

No extrascleral extension.

Optic nerve in its entire course, cut end of the optic nerve and meningeal sheaths
free of tumor.
