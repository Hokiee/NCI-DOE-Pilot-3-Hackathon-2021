:l!!i!.!!!!!!!!I-!!!l!!lon

GROSS EXAMINATION:

The specimen is received fresh in a container labeled with
the name of the patient and identified as colon segment,
right colon.
Length of Terminal Ileum: 10.5 cm
Circumference of Terminal Ileum: 4.9 cm
Length of Colon: 36.5 cm
Circumference of Colon: 9 cm
Margins: Stapled
Serosa: A 2.5 x 1.8 cm puckered area in the ascending colon
located 12 cm from the distal margin.
Mass #1:
Size: 6.4 X 4.5 x 1.2 cm
Type: Infiltrative with raised edges
Region: Cecum
Distance from proximal margin: 10.5 cm
Circumference: 50%
Depth of Invasion: 0.6 cm
Distance from Radial Margin: 2.2 cm

Distance from distal margin: 9.7 cm
Circumference: 90%
Depth of Invasion: 0.3 cm
Distance from Radial Margin: 0.9 cm
There is a 1.2 cm pink polyp located 1.7 cm distal to the
cecal mass and a 0.4 cm tan polyp located 1.6 cm from the
ascending mass.
Appendix: Absent.

additional sections of cecal mass; 5, ascending mass and
radial margin; 6, ascending mass and serosa (black ink);
7-8, additional sections of ascending mass; 9, proximal

polyp; 10, distal polyp; 11, rgin; 12, distal
margin; 13—15, lymph nodes.

DIAGNOSIS BASED ON GROSS AND MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

Extended right hemicolectomy (36.5 cm):

- Colonic adenocarcinoma, 6.4 cm, high-grade, with extension
through the muscularis propria (pT3) involving the cecum
(see summary template).

— Colonic adenocarcinoma, 7.8 cm, low—grade, with extension
through the muscularis propria (pT3) involving the ascending
colon at the hepatic flexure(see summary template).

- Lymphovascular invasion identified.

— Tubular adenomas x 2.

- Margins of resection are free of carcinoma.
