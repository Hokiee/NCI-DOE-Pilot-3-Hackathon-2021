PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:

A. AND B. BRAIN, LEFT, EXCISIONAL BIOPSIES: OLIGODENDROGLIOMA,

MIB-l LABELING INDEX < 1.0%.

SEE MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION AND COMMENT.

Operation/Specimen: Brain.

Clinical History and Pre—Op Dx: year old woman with diagnosis 6
months ago of oligodendroglioma. For extensive resection.

GROSS PATHOLOGY: ‘

A. "left tumor“, received fresh, one fragment, 0.8 cm. across.
Semifirm, pinkish-gray. In total #1.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, left: glioma, low grade,
consistent with oligodendroglioma.

B. "left tumor", one fragment, 0.7 cm. across. Soft, pinkish—gray. In
total #2.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, left: glioma, low grade,
consistent with oligodendroglioma.

MICROSCOPIC: A. and B. Portions of a moderately cellular neoplastic
glial proliferation, in which the cells display uniform round nuclei.
There is moderate nuclear pleomorphism and nuclear hyperchromasia. The
background is finely fibrillary, and the vascular network consists of
capillary—type vessels. Gliofibrillary oligodendrocytes and
minigemistocytes are rarely observed. There are no mitotic figures,
and areas of necrosis or microvascular cellular proliferation are not
observed.

SPECIAL STAINS: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP, synaptophysin, and
MIB—l are performed on block #2.

With the GFAP the tumor cells are not immunoreactive. No tumor cells
immunoreact with synaptophysin. With the MIB—l a labeling index of
less than 1% is determined.

COMMENT: The neoplasm is a low grade glioma with uniform round
neoplastic nuclei, absent features of anaplasia, and a low MIB—l
labeling index of less than 1%. The nuclear pleomorphism is moderate
and consistent with a Smith's grade B.
