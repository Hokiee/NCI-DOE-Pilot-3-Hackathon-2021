The senior physician certifies that he/she personally conducted a gross and/or
microscopic examination of the described specimen(s) and rendered or confirmed
the rapid diagnos(es) related thereto.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received fresh, in eleven parts, each labeled with the
patient's name and medical record number.

Part A, "#1. Port site #1", consists of multiple soft tissue fragments (4.6 x
4.5 x 1.6 cm) consisting of skin (3.2 x 0.7 cm) with underlying soft tissue up
to a depth of 4.4 cm. There are no masses or lesions identified.

Micro A1: Skin with underlying soft tissue, 3 frags.
Micro A2: Soft tissue fragments, 3 frags,

Part B, "#2. Rib", consists of two segments of rib (12.8 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm, 6.4 x
1.6 x 0.9 cm) with scant attached fragments of red/brown ragged skeletal
muscle. A rib bone marrow squeeze is submitted for histologic examination.

Micro B1: Rib bone marrow squeeze, multi frags,

Part C, “#3. Level 9“, consists of two tan/pink/brown soft tissue fragments

(1.2 x 0.9 x 0.6 cm in aggregate). The specimen is entirely submitted for
histologic examination.

Micro C1: Soft tissue fragments, 2 frags,

Part D, "#4. Level 8", consists of a tan/pink soft tissue fragment (1.5 x 1.5 x
0.8 cm). The specimen is entirely submitted for histologic examination.

Micro D1: Soft tissue fragment, bisected, 2 frags,

Part E, "#5. Right lung, diaphragm, peritoneum, pericardium", consists of a
750—gram right extrapleural pneumonectomy specimen (23 x 17.3 x 4 cm) including
lung (20 x 11.1 x 6.5 cm), open bronchial resection margin (2.3 cm in length x
1.8 cm in diameter), parietal pleura, pericardium (14 x 7.4 cm) and
hemidiaphragm (31.8 x 19.5 x 11 cm). The parietal pleura contains greater than
a hundred tan/white nodules (up to 4 cm in greatest dimension), is disrupted,
and adherent only to the apex of the lung. All parietal pleural disruption
margins are positive for tumor. The visceral pleura contains greater than two
hundred tan/white surface nodules (up to 1.8 cm in greatest dimension) that are
present on all lobes. The hemidiaphragm is disrupted and connected only to the
anterior parietal pleura. Both surfaces of the hemidiaphragm are covered by
greater than one hundred tan/white surface nodules (up to 10 cm in greatest
dimension). All diaphragmatic margins are grossly positive for tumor. The
bronchial margin is grossly free of tumor and entirely frozen en face for
frozen section analysis as FSA. The pericardium contains three full thickness
tan/white nodules (up to 2.4 cm in greatest dimension). The tumor extends into
the lung parenchyma in the lower lobe and thickens the entire length of all of
the intralobular septae. The uninvolved lung parenchyma shows mild
emphysematous changes. Gross photographs are taken.

adipose tissue (13.5 x 12 x 0.3 cm) with few scattered firm tan/white nodules
(up to 0.3 cm in greatest dimension) and focal hemorrhage. A representative

section of soft tissue and nodules is submitted for frozen section analysis as
FSB.

Micro F2: Soft tissue and nodules, 2 frags, RSS.

Part G, "#7. Level 7", consists of two tan/brown soft tissue fragments (1.3 x

1.1 x 0.7 cm in aggregate). The specimen is entirely submitted for histologic
examination.

Part H, "#8. 4R", consists of a tan/yellow soft tissue fragment (2.5 x 1.4 x
0.8 cm) containing one potential lymph node. The specimen is entirely

submitted for histologic examination.
