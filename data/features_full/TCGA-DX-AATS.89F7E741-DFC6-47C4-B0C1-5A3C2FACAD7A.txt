Clinical Diagnosis & History:
Retroperitoneal mass.

Specimens Submitted:

1: SP: Radical resection of retroperitoneal mass, left iliac and distal
aorta left nephrectomy adrenal glands

2: SP: Aortic margin

DIAGNOSIS:

1) SOFT TISSUE, RETROPERITONEAL MASS, LEPTIILIAC ARTERY, LEFT
KIDNEY AND LEFT ADRENAL GLAND; EXCISION:

- SIGN GRADE SARCOMA WITH MYXOFIBROSARCOMA-LIKE FOCI AND OSSEOUS
DIFFERENTIATION (SEE COMMENT).
- TUMOR INVOLVES FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, SKELETAL MUSCLE, ADVENTITIA OF SEGMENT
OF LARGE ARTERY, AND MUSCULARIS PROPRIA OF URETER.
- TUMOR MEASURES 12 CM GREATEST DIMENSION AND EXTENDS TO ANTERIOR,
POSTERIOR, SUPERIOR, AND INFERIOR MAROINS.
— TUMOR SHOWS 5% NECROSIS.
— LEFT KIDNEY SHOWS INTIMAL THICKENING OP INTERLOBULAR ARTERIES, MICROSCOPIC
CORTICAL ADENOMA, AND A SIMPLE CYST.
— ADRENAL GLAND SHOWING NO SIGNIFICANT HISTOPATEOLOGIC CHANGE.
— THO BENIGN RENAL HILAR LYMPH NODES.

COMMENT: IMMUNOSTAINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR CDKA, MDMZ, AEl/AE3, 343E12, EMA, CAM
5.2, DESMIN, AND MYOGENIN. FINDINGS RAISE THE POSSIBILITY OF
DEDIFFERENTIATED LIPOSARCOMA, BUT NO HELL DIPFERENTIATED ADIPOCYTIC TUMOR IS
SEEN AND IMMUNOSTAINS DO NOT SUPPORT THIS POSSIBILITY. UNSTAINED SECTIONS
WILL BE SUBMITTED TO ASSESS FOR CHOP GENE AMPLIFICATION.

2) BLOOD VESSEL, AORTA, MARGIN; BIOPSY:
- ARTERY WITH CALCIFIED ATHEROMA, NO TUMOR SEEN.

I ATTEST THAT TNE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

Gross Description:

1) The specimen is received fresh and labeled "radical resection of
retroperitoneal mass, left iliac and distal aorta, left nephrectomy and left
adrenal gland". It consists of a large multi—lobulated circumscribed firm
mass measuring 12 x 10.5 x 9.8 cm; a segment of muscle is attached to the
mass (muscle measures 6 x 4.5 x 2.5 cm). The mass is connected to the left
kidney and perirenal fat, (kidney and fat measure 24 x 12 x 6.5 cm);
previously lacerated left adrenal gland measures 4 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm. The
distal margins of the renal artery and vein are identified and the left
renal artery measures 5 cm in length and 0.8 cm in diameter. The left renal
vein measures 5.5 cm in length and 0.9 cm in diameter. A proximal segment
of left ureter is dilated and encased/obstructed by the mass. The left
ureter measures 5.5 cm in length and 0.9 cm in diameter. A short segment
of artery (abdominal aorta) measures 2.1cm in length and 1.2 cm in diameter;
the artery is adherent to the mass and cut surface of artery shows atheroma.
The surgical margins are inked black and cut surface reveals a 30%
lobulated white areas intermixed with 10% hard ossified areas; there is no
necrosis identified. Grossly tumor not appear to invade into muscle or
artery. Left kidney measures 12.5 x 5.3 x 3.5 cm; a 2.5 cm subcapsular cyst
containing clear fluid is identified in the lower pole of the left kidney;
the renal cortex, medulla and renal pelvis appear unremarkable. Two lymph
nodes are identified in the renal hilum (0.9 and 1.5 cm). Representative
sections are submitted, TPS is given and photograph is taken. Additional
sections from the myxoid area of the tumor and peri—renal fat are submitted.
Grossly ossified tissue is decalcified.

Summary of sections:

AM —— anterior margin of mass
Pu—— posterior margin of mass
In -- inferior margin of mass

su—- superior margin of mass

MM-- medial margin of mass

LM—- lateral margin of mass

T—— soft fatty areas of the tumor

TA-- tumor with adjacent encasing artery
TU-- tumor with encasing/obstructing left ureter
To—- tumor with osteoid areas

RVM-- left renal artery and vein margin
RC-- left renal cortex

RM-- left renal medulla

c—«renal cyst

LR-- hilar lymph nodes

A—left adrenal gland

PF—peri—rensl fat

2). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled as "aortic margin“, and
it consists of an unoriented fragment of arterial intima showing
stherosclerotic change with focal calcification measuring 3.1 x 1.5 x 0.2
cm. Entire specimen is submitted. Part of the specimen is decalcified.
