COMMENT:

A high percentage of tumor cells (greater than 20%) immunostaining for MGMT has been reported to be
associated with a relatively diminished response to—. Hence,
the low 5% result in this case suggests a likelihood of this tumor being responsive to _

Recent studies have shown that co-expression of EGFRvIll and PTEN as detected by immunostaining
was si ntﬁcantl correlated with a clinical response of glioblastomas to EGF R kinase inhibitor!
Wanna the preserved expression of PTEN in this case, when combine

w

v mu a ton, perm: s a possibility of this tumor being responsive to EGFR-kinase inhibitors.

Retained expression of PTEN was found to be associated with a more favorable ro nosis in atients
with hi h rade liornas

subclasses of high-grade gliorna predict prognosis, delineate a pattern of disease progression, and
resembie stages in neurogenesis. Cancer Cell. —

Recent studies indicated an adverse prognostic signiﬁcance of increased expression of laminln beta 1
and decreased expression of laminin beta 2 predicting a worse survival of patients with gliomas.
Association between laminin-8 and glial tumor grade, recurrence, and patient survival.

    

Accordingly, elevated expression of ﬁt and ti2 in this tumor suggest the tumor aggressiveness
intermediate between the BIU (or normat)lt32 normal (or It) (the most favorable prognosis) and [31m [5211
(least favorable prognosis).

Presence of activated (phosphorylated) p42144 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (pMAPK) often is

indicative of an upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. it has been shown to be associated
with a relative resistance to radiation there in liobtastoma multiforme

Correspondingly, presence 0! a large 'raction of cells Immunonegative to pMAPK antibody in this case

suggests a likelihood of this tumor being responsive to radiation therapy.

    

The use of these tests in guiding therapy has timitations. Review of the relevant literature and ciinical
correlation is advised. These test results do not obligate or preclude use of the relevant therapeutic
agents.
