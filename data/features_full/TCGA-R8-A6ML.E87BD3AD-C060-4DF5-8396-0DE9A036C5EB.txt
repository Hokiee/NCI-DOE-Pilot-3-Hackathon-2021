There is early microvascular proliferation. Combined with areas of high cellularity and brisk mitotic activity, this is best considered
an anaplastic (grade III) tumor.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

ADDESDHM
Fiorescence in situ hybridization was performed for markers on chromosomes 1 p and 19q and shows loss at both chromosomal

arms. Combined 1p/19q loss has been shown to correlate with the oligodendroglial lineage and may predict a more favorable
response to adjuvant therapy compared with tumors showing Intact 1p/19q.
