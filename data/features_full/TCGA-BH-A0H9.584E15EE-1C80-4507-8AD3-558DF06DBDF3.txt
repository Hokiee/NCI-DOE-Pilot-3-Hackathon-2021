 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

PART 1: BREWSEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY, NEEDLE LOCALIZATION -
A. I NOTTINGHAM GRADE 3 (TUBULE FORMATION 3, NUCLEAR

Wm
. . POLYMORPHISM 3, MITOTIC ACTIVITY 3, TOTAL SCORE 9/9).

INVASIVE TUMOR MEASURES 2.1 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION (GROSS MEASUREMENT).

DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), SOLID PATTERN, NUCLEAR GRADE 3, ADMIXED WITH INVASIVE
CARCINOMA, CONSTITUTING ABOUT FIVE PERCENT (5%) OF TOTAL TUMOR VOLUME.

RESECTION MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA; INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS 1.5 MM TO THE
CLOSEST ANTERIOR MARGIN .

NO DEFINITIVE LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION NOTED.

FOCI OF MICROCALCIFICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH INVASIVE CARCINOMA.

FIBROCYSTIC CHANGE.

THE INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS ER POSITIVE. PR POSITIVE, HERZINEU WEAKLY POSITIVE AND NO
