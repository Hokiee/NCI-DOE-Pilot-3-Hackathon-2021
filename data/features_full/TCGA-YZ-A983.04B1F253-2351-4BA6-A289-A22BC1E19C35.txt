——— Clinical History ---

Neovascular glaucoma of right eye [365.63]. Intraocular tumor [239.89].

Total retinal detachment of right eye [361.05]. Medical history:
-year—old with large choroidal malignant tumor. Blind painful eye with

NVG. Gross photos. Evaluate malignant tumor. Differential diagnosis
includes metastasis and uveal melanoma.

——-Final Pathologic Diagnosis-——

A. Right eye, resection:
- Choroidal melanoma (amelanotic), see synoptic report
- Iris neovascularization with partial angle closure
- Retinal detachment . . ,,

Pathologic Staging (pTNM) pT3a NX MX

Additional Pathologic Findings (select all that apply)

Mitotic rate (number of mitoses per 40X objective with a field area of
0.152 mmZ): 1/40 high power fields

Microvascular patterns: poorly formed vascular mimicry patterns present
Vascular invasion (tumor vessels or other vessels): negative

Degree of pigmentation: none

Inflammatory cells/tumor infiltrating lymphocytes: present/mild
Drusen: none

Retinal detachment: present

Invasion of Bruch‘ a membrane: yes

Nevus: negative

Hemorrhage: negative

Neovascularization: yes

Other: fibrous plaque overlying tumor

Comment(s): PAS stain was used to evaluate for possible vascular mimicry
patterns. Cytokeratin AE1/3 is negative (ruling out carcinoma/metastasis);
and HMS-45 and melanA are strongly positive, consistent with melanoma.

All controls show appropriate reactivity.
