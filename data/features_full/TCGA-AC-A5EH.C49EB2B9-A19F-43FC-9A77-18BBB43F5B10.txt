FlNAL SURGiCAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Diagnosis:

LEFT BREAST, MODIFIED RADlCAL MASTECTOMY:

- Two foci of invasive ductai carcinoma, Nottingham grade 2 (see comment).
~ Size: 2.3 cm and 0.7 cm. ‘
~ Location: lower outer (4:00) and inner, (7:00) quadrants, respectively.

~ Associated ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), intermediate nuclear
grade, cribriform and micropapiliary patterns with punctato necrosis
and without calciﬁcations.
~ Size: DCIS spans a region measuring approximately 3.8 cm and

comprises 10% of tumor.

~ Margins of resection are widely free of invasive and insitu tumor (at least 1.2 cm
away). .

~ Focus suspicious for lymphovascular invasion identiﬁed. '

~ Miorometastatic carcinoma (1.? mm) identiﬁed in one of fourteen axillary
lymph nodes (1114); no extranodal extension identified.

- Prior biopsy site changes present.

~ Uninvoived breast parenchyma with ﬁbrocystic changes and vascular
caiciﬁcations.

~ Benign skin and nipple.

COMMENT: The two foci of invasive ductal carcinoma are similar histologically.
Although there was little tubule formation identified on prior needle biopsy of the 7:00
lesion, tubule formation is more apparent on excision (>10%). Thus, the overall
histologic grade is Nottingham grade 2 for both lesions.

PATHOLOGJC TUMOR STAGiNG SYNOPSlS:
Type and grade (invasive): invasive ductai carcinoma, Nottingham grade 2.
Type and grade (in situ): DCiS, intermediate nuclear grade.
Primary tumor: pT2(m).
Regional lymph nodes: pN1(mi).
Distant metastasis: NIA.

Clinical History/Operative Dx:

Breast cancer

Gross. Description:

Single specimen designated left breast radical masteclomy. initially received in a fresh state for
Oncogonotyping tissue harvest is a leaf! modiﬁed radical mastemomy weighing 809 grams. and measuring
20.8 x 17.3 x 58 cm (not including axillary extension). and the axillary wing extending 10.5 x 9.0 x 4.0
cm. The overlying ellipse of lan~brown skin is 22.8 x 11.3 cm, with a paracenlral darken brown. wrinkled
areola, 3.2 cm in diameter and a ﬂattened 1.“! cm nipple. A palpable mass is appreciated in the lower

outerquadranl. A suture marks the medial apex of the specimen. The surgical margins are now
differentially inked as follows:

Superior—superficial is marked blue.
lnferionsuponimal i3 marked orange.
Deep is marked black.

The breast is serially sectioned perpendicularly through iho medial-lateral long axis. to reveal a partially
circumscribed. dense piniogray, tumor mass measuring upwards of 2.3 x16 x 1,3 cm (slabs 4—6, from
lateral). This mass is placed in the lower outer quadrant. approximating the 4:00 position and grossly
approaching within 1.8 cm of the deep, 2.3 cm of the inferior Superficial, 5.6 cm of the lateral extension of
breast (not including axillary) and greater than 12.0 cm from the most «radial extension of breast. The

tumor includes an embedded hoolvshapect metallic clip. Representative portion ofthe tumor,
pen—neoplastic. and normal breast parenchyma is submitted for Oncogenotyping studies.

A second, discrete, poorly visualized glistening tan lesion, is within the lower inner quadrant,
approximating the 7:00 position, and measuring up to 0,? x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and placed within 2.3 cm of the
interior superﬁcial, 2.4 cm of the deep, and greater than 5.0 cm from the most medial extension of breast,
A second biopsy site clip is not appreciated.

The cut sections of the remainder of the breast demonstrate prominent ductal tracts in the subareotar
lesion, up to 0,5 cm in diameter, exuding yellow-gray cheesy material, and bluish purulent fluid. Several
blue dome cysts are up to 0.6 cm.

initial examination of the axillary extension of fat reveals ﬁfteen lymph node candidates, ranging from 0.2

evaluation.
