Comment:

A high percentage of tumor celis (greater than 20% immunostainin for MGMT has been re orted to be
associated with a relatively diminished response to Hence,
the low 5% result in this case suggests a likelihood o t is umor eing responsrve 0

Recent studies have shown that co-expression of EGFRvIII and PTEN as detected by immunostaining
was signiﬁcantly correlated with a clinical response of glioblastomas to EGFR kinase inhibitors

ence the preserved expression of PTEN in this case, when combined
with EGFRVIII mutation, permits a possibility of this tumor being responsive to EGFR—kinase inhibitors.

Retained expression of PTEN was found to be associated with a more favorable prognosis in patients
with bi h rade Iiomas

subclasses of high-grade giioma predict prognosis, delineate a pattern of disease progression, and
resemble stages in neurogenesis. Cancer Cell.

Recent studies indicated an adverse prognostic signiﬁcance of increased expression of laminin beta 1
and decreased expression of Iaminin beta 2 predicting a worse survival of patients with gliomas.
Association between laminin-B and gliai tumor grade, recurrence, and patient survival.

Accordingly, elevated expression of beta 1 and suppressed expression of beta 2 in this tumor predict
more aggressive behavior.

Presence of activated (phosphorylated) p42/44 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (pMAPK) often is
indicative of an upregulatton of receptor tyrosine kinase signaiing. It has been shown to be associated

with a relative resistance to radiation therapy in glioblastoma multiforme —

Correspondingly, a high percentage of tumor cells immunoreactive to pMAPK antibody in this case may
predict a relative resistance to radiation therapy.
