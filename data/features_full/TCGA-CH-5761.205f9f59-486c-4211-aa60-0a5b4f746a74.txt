CGAuCH—ﬁiﬁ‘l

 

I. Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate in the left rectolateral and basal
peripheral zone. Maximum tumor spread 2.6 cm. Extensive perineural inﬁltration and
extraprostatic tumor growth in the left rectolateral and basal region. Inﬁltration of the left seminal
vesicle. Infiltration of the surgical margins in the left rectolateral and basal resection.

2. Tumor—free fatty connective tissue with vessels and nerves
3. Fatty tissue with two tumor—free lymph nodes.

4. Fatty tissue with three tumor-free lymph nodes.

Remark

The tumor classiﬁcation to date is as follows:

pT3b; Gleason 5+4 = 9 with small tertiary Gleason 3 portion (approx. 95% Gleason 5/4).

In the left lateral and basal region, carcinoma cells extend in a multifocai and elongated pattern
the preparation margin (blue labeling, contact surface max. 8 mm and about 17 mm wide
altogether).

To be on the safe side, additional immunohistological studies will follow to establish whether
there is any invasion of the vessels and any lymph node metastases that could not yet be
detected. The results will be presented in a follow-up report.

Follow—up report

Diagnosis already reported
Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate

Immunohistology (CD31) also showed no evidence for invasion of the vessels. in the
submitted lymph nodes mentioned under 3. and 4., immunohistology also showed no
metastases and no disseminated tumor cells.

Concluding tumor classiﬁcation
pTBb, pNO (0/3), L0, V0; Gleason 5+4=9.

At the request of the clinician, an additional immunohistologieal investigation will be carried
out to settle the question of chromatin expression. The results will be presented in a follow—
up report.
