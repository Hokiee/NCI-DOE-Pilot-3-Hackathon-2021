Final Diagnosis:
Procedure: Radical prostatectomy and bilateral pelvic dissection.
Histologic type: Prostatic adenocarcinoma.
Histologic grade:
Primary pattern: 5, Secondary pattern: 4, Tertiary pattern: Not applicable.
Total Gleason Score: 9 of 10.
Tumor quantitation and location: Tumor is identiﬁed in both lobes of the prostate for a total of 12 out of 16
sections of prostate and seminal vesicle being involved by carcinoma. The largest focus of carcinoma measures at
least 2.2 cm, (measured, however, in a single slide with tumor extending to the edges of the section). Areas involved
are identified in sections from the proximal urethral margin to the apices of prostate.
Extraprostatic extension: Present in left mid and right mid of the prostate, in the left base and the right base of the
prostate, and around the left and right seminal vesicles.
Margins: Surgical margin involved by prostatic adenocarcinoma in the left apical area (17 mm involvement), in the
left bladder neck margin (8 mm length of involvement of margin).
Lymph-vascular invasion: Present.
Perineural invasion: Present.
Seminal vesicle invasion: Present, bilateral.
Treatment effect on carcinoma: Not recognized.
Lymph nodes: Seven lymph nodes retrieved, all negative for malignancy (0/7).
Additional pathologic ﬁndings: None of additional relevance.
Ancillary studies: Not performed.
Pathologic staging: pT3b, pNO, pM not applicable.
Blorepository sample (if applicable): The sample obtained is completely involved by carcinoma (100% of nuclei are
malignant).

Bloek(s) containing malignancy suitable for additional testing: A7 through A16.
