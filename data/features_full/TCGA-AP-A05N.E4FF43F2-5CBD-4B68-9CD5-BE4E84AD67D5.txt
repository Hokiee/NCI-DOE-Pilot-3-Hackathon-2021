Specimens Submitted:

1: Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries, hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy

2: Sentinel lymph node. right hypogastric, excison

3: Sentinel lymph nodes, left hypogastric, excision

DIAGNOSIS:

1. Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries, hysterectomy and bilateral

salpingo-oophorectomy:

Adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type
with squamous differentiation

Grade 1 A ﬁt WW WK/ﬁ/H

Myometrial Invasion:

(=<50%)

see note
Endocervical Invasion:

Not identified
Lymphovascular invasion:

Suspicious for lymphovascular invasion
Endometrium:

Exhibits complex hyperplasia with atypia
Myometrium:

Exhibits adenomyosis

Exhibits multiple leiomyomata

 

Unremarkabl e

Note: A large portion of the tumor is exophytic. Myometrial invasion is
identified and does not exceed more than 4-5 m (out of a 22 mm myometrial
well), however, due to the marked irregularity of the endomyometrial

junction and the involvement of adenomyosis, the exact depth of invasion
cannot be determined with certainty.

2. Sentinel lymph node, right hypogastric, excison:
Lymph Nodes:
Number of nodes examined:l
Number of metastatic nodes:0
Additional H/E stained sections and immunohistochemical stains for
cytokeratins (AE1:AE3) show no evidence of metastatic tumor.

3. Sentinel lymph nodes, left hypogastric, excision:
Lymph Nodes:
Number of nodes examined:1
Number of metastatic nodes:0
Additional H/E stained sections and immunohistochemical stains for
cytokeratins (AEl:AE3) show no evidence of metastatic tumor.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.
