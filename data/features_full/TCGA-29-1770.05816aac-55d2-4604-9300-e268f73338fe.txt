CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm of the ovary.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. ”Left tube and ovary (AFl)". Received fresh is a 13 gram, 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.3
cm ovary and a 4 x 0.5 cm fimbriated fallopian tube. The ovarian serosa
exhibits 0.3 cm mucinous papillary fronds which also involve the parenchyma.
The fallopian tube is grossly unremarkable. A portion of the ovary is frozen

as AFl.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

A1~ frozen section remnant AFl.

A2— ovary with tumor (60% of ovary submitted)
A3— fallopian tube.

B. "Right tube and ovary". Received fresh is a 3.4 x 2 x 2 cm ovary and a 4 x
0.6 cm fimbriated fallopian tube. The ovarian serosa exhibits friable,
exophytic tumor (up to 0.6 cm) which involves the ovarian parenchyma. The
fallopian tube is studded with multiple loosely adherent fragments of tumor,
the largest of which is 1.3 cm in greatest dimension. The tubal interial is

uninvolved.

BLOCK SUMMARY:
Bl—BZ— ovary with tumor (75% submitted).
83- tube with serosal implant

C. “Uterus and cervix". Received fresh is a 66.5 gram uterus (7.5 x 5 x 2.8
cm}. The serosa discloses multiple subserosal leiomyomata (1.3 cm). No tumor
implants are noted. The endometrial cavity (1.7 cm from cornu to cornu and 2.7
cm in length) contains an atrophic endometrium (0.1 cm thick). The cervix (2.8
cm) contains a patent cs, a tan herring bone mucosa and is unremarkable. The
myometrium contains several leiomyoma (1.1 cm).

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Cl- leiomyomata.

C2- anterior cervix and anterior endomyometrium.

C3" posterior cervix and posterior endomyometrium with leiomyoma.

D. "Omentum". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 26 x 12 x 10 cm
aggregate of fibrotic omental tissue which is diffusely involved with tumor
with nodules up to 2.6 cm. The cut surface of the nodules are fleshy.
Representative sections are submitted in blocks D1—D5.

 
 

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
A. "Left tube and ovary": AFl—adenocarcinoma

 

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
MicroSCOpic examination is performed.

PROCEDURE: HYSTERECTOMY & OOPHORECTOMY
