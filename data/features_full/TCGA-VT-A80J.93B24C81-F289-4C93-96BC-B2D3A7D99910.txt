Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name " "
medical record number, and designated "left thigh mass" is a

25.06 g ovoid—shaped portion of soft tissue measuring 5.1 x 3.8 x 2.5
cm.

There is a 2.5 x 2.0 cm area of puckered, thin transparent membrane
with

suture that has previously been inked in blue, indicated as not true
margin. No other orientation to the specimen is provided. The external
surface is covered by a thin transparent membrane surrounding lobulated
yellow fibroadipose tissue. The area previously inked blue is over—
inked in

yellow and the remainder of the external surface is inked black. The
specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a well—circumscribed firm,
white

mass measuring 3.0 x 2.4 x 3.8 cm. There is a eccentrically located
cavity

located within the mass measuring 1.0 cm in greatest dimension;

possibly
consistent with previous procedural site. There is a thin rim of yellow

fibroadipose tissue separating the mass from the inked surface ranging
from

0.3 to <0.l cm. No other areas of hemorrhage or necrosis are
appreciated.

Representative sections are submitted. A portion of mass is retained in
—80

degrees for further possible studies. The remainder of the specimen is
retained in formalin within its original container.

Summary of sections:
1A, perpendicular section, 1 end, l/l;

lB—C, l full—thickness cross section with closest approximation to
inked surfaces, bisected, l/l each;

lD, representative mass with close approximation to inked surface,
1/1;

1E, representative section of designated not true margin, 2/1;
1F, perpendicular section of opposite end, l/l.
