CLINICAL DATA: <1 Mfg 9/62
eyear-old man with history of floor of mouth carcinoma (squamous cell
carcinoma).

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A) Received in formalin designated "left mandibular tumor" is a composite
resection specimen that includes an 11 x 8.5 cm ellipse of medium tan,
hair—bearing skin with a central 2.5 cm in diameter ulcer and 8.5 cm in
diameter region of induration of the skin which extends focally to within 0.3
cm of the anterior cutaneous margin. A smaller, 4 x 0.9 cm ellipse of skin
is sutured to the main specimen at the left superior region. Partially
embedded in the attached 12 x 8 x 6 cm aggregate of deep soft tissue and
skeletal muscle is a portion of the mandible spanning from right anterior
premolar region to body of the left mandible. Seven teeth, including a right
premolar (with dental restoration), two incisors (one intact, one
fractured/decayed), two canine teeth (intact), a portion of the first left
premolar (fractured) and a premolar or molar with crown fractured or decayed
off at the root: The diagonally transected mandibular cut surfaces appear
grossly unremarkable, consisting of cortical and cancellous bone. Left floor
of mouth and the attached, approx. 2.5 x 3 cm portion of tongue are largely
replaced by an ill—defined, pale tan, firm, exo- and endophytic tumor mass
that has eroded through the mid—segment of the included left mandible (bone

@ appears grossly essentially dissolved). Anteriorly, the skin and soft tissue
is partially peeled off and sutured back on the mandible (this presumably
does not represent a true surgical margin). The medial, right and anterior
margin is inked blue and the left lateral, inferior and posterior black.
Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1 — anterior midline
cutaneous margin; A2 — left anterolateral; A3 — left posterior/inferior
cutaneous; A4 - right inferior; A5 - right anteroinferior; A6 - right
inferolateral; A7 - right superolateral cutaneous, A8 — right anteromedial
gingival/tongue (shave margin, taken immediately posterior to transected
right mandible); A9 — tongue and right (medial) margin; A10 — mid—medial
margin; All - posterior soft tissue, lateral aspect; A12 — posterior soft
tissue, medial aspect. Bisection of the specimen across the extensively
eroded mandible now reveals a 3 cm diameter soft, red—brown, friable cavity
and demonstrates that the firm, pale tan tissue grossly consistent with tumor
extends essentially to the medial soft tissue margin, grossly. Submitted in
A13 - region of destroyed mandible (mid—segment) and closest adjacent margin;
A14 and A15 (decal) - mandible end margins. All margin sections are
perpendicular unless stated otherwise.

B) Received in formalin designated "left neck level II" is a 5 X 4 x 1 cm
aggregate of fibroadipose tissue containing multiple lymph nodes of up to 1.5
cm in diameter. The largest node is bisected and submitted in cassette Bl,
the remaining smaller nodes intact in 82.

C) Received in formalin designated "left neck level III" is an 8 x 1.5 x
0.8 cm strand of fibroadipose tissue containing multiple lymph nodes of up to
g 1.0 cm diameter. All are submitted intact in cassette C1.

D) Received in formalin designated "teeth" are three teeth and six {3
fragments of unoriented tooth material. The largest tooth, molar, measures V
1.8 x 1 x 0.7

cm and has calculus material attached, and the neck of the tooth has dark

brown discoloration. The next largest tooth is a 2.2 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm incisor.

Its crown appears to be a restoration of porcelain and silver—colored metal

crown. The root is discolored at the junction with the crown. The third is a

2 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm incisor which appears intact. The remaining fragments of

dentin, and tan—gray material range up to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

A) Left mandible, composite resection:
1. Squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing, moderately to poorly
differentiated

a. Size: est. at least 8 cm

b. Involving floor of mouth, tongue, anterolateral skin (ulcerated) and
parotid gland, and penetrating the mandible.

c. Carcinoma present at margin of resection in left inferoposterior and
right inferior subcutaneous soft tissue;

— within 0.03 cm of (if not at) the right medial and left posterolateral
(parotid region) soft tissue margin,

— within 0.1—0.2 cm of medial posterior soft tissue,

— other visualized margins clear by at least 0.3 cm.

— Decalcification of the mandibular end margins is pending — see subsequent
addendum.

d. Perineural invasion present.

e. Focally suspicious for angiolymphatic invasion.

2. Chronic sialadenitis. {g
B) Left level II, neck dissection: Squamous cell carcinoma present in one I
of 8 lymph nodes (1/8)

C) Left level III, neck dissection: No carcinoma identified in 6 nodes

(0/6).

D) "Teeth", extraction: One molar, two incisor teeth, and multiple

fragments of tooth material. (Gross evaluation only).

COMMENT:

The minimum pathologic stage is pT4a, le, pMX (AJCC TNM Classification, 6th
ed., 2002).

ADDENDUM COMMENT:

After decalcification, the mandibular margins of the part A specimen (A14 and
A15, both en—face sections) are examined:

A14 — Right mandibular margin - free of carcinoma.
A15 — Left mandibular margin (posterior~superior) — carcinoma present within
bone, soft tissue and perineural space.
