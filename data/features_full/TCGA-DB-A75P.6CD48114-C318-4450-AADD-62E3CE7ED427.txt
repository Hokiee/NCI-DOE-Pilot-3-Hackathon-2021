E Final Diagnosis:

A —8. Brain, hippocampus mass and left temporal lobe, biopsies: Low-grade diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade II).
(Sec comment).

immunoperoxidase studies were performed on parafﬁn sections (block A2) using antibodies directed against the
following antigens: GFAP, IDHl-Rl32H. p53, EMA, neuroﬁlament protein, and 16-67.

rm 0 ,3
(vFAP: Positive.

Neuroﬁlament protein: Highlights axons within the tumor. ’ 7 ,

K i—67: Low proliferative index. 6.412, 36mm 9430/3 . NC
IIJHI -Rl32H: Negative. I 47/3)
pi}: Low to moderate iabeling. '

liMA: Negative. 944) 3>//°7//3

(.‘umment: The lesion has a relatively high level of cellularity in areas; however. the Ki-67 labeling index is low
and mitotic activity is not apparent.
