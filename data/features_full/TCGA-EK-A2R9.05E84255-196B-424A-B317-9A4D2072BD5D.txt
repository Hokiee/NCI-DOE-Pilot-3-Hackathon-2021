a 1.0 x 0.0 x 0.6 an aggregate of yellow adipose tissue. No lymph nodes are greatly
identified. The specimen is entirely submitted as I.

J. The specimen is received fresh labeled Wright external iliac' and
consists of a 5.0 x 0.0 x 3.0 cm aggregate of yellow adipose tissue. The out surfaces
demonstrate seven rubbery pink to tan lymph nodes which vary from 0.5 to 2.2 cm. The nodes
are entirely submitted as follows: 01 four nodes, intact: 0’2 one node. trisected; Jl one
node, trisectod; 04 one node serially sectioned.

K. The specimen is received fresh labeled uterus, cervix and fallopian
tubes” and consists of a uterus and cervix with attached bilateral adnsxa. Upon removal of
the adnexa, the uterus weighs 153 gm, measures 10.5 cm in length, 6.5 on between the
cornua, and 4.0 cm anterior to posterior. The posterior half of the margins are
black-inked and the anterior half are blue-inked. The across is pink and smooth. The
ectocervix measures 4.6 on and is surrounded by an annular strip of pink smooth vaginal
mucosa. The cervix demonstrates a 0.0 x 3.2 by up to 2.3 on firm, tan-gray to red,
granular. fungating mass which is located between the 2 and 0 o‘clock position. The mass
is located 1.0 cm from the vaginal cuff margin in the area of 3 o'clock. The cut surfaces
of the mass show extension within 0.6 cm. of the peripheral radial margin. The cut
surfaces of the mass are gray and granular. The remainder of the cervix is pink and
smooth. The 1.6 cm slit-like as is otherwise pink and smooth. The sndocervix demonstrates
a 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm soft pink smooth sessile polyp. The uterine cavity is slightly
distorted. The sndometriwn measures 0.1 on throughout and is tan and smooth. The
myomstrium measures up to 3.0 cm and demonstrates multiple. rubbery. gray-white,
well-circumscribed, intramural subseroeal and submuccssl nodules. The parametrial tissue
is grossly unremarkable. The right fallopian tube measure 2.0 x 0.5 cm and has a
fimbriated end. The tube shows evidence of ligation. The attached ovary measures 3.3 x
1.0 an and has a pink to tan smooth intact surface. The cut surfaces are ten and
homogenous. The left fallopian tube measures 2.9 x 0.6 and has a fimbristed end. The tube

smooth intact surface. The cut surfaces are ten and homogenous with a Le cm firm solid,
gray-white, moderately circumscribed nodule. There is also a 0.8 cm smooth-walled cyst
containing soft brown material. The case is discussed with Dr. and the specimen
is sampled per his direction. Tissue from the cervical mass is submitted for the !

study. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows: Kl serous; K2

negative for metastatic carcinoma.

K. Histologic sections of the uterus demonstrate an invasive poorly differentiated
carcinoma of the cervix. Immunohistochsmical stains for cytokeratin 5/‘, PG: and
synaptophysin are performed. The tumor is positive for cytokerstin 5/6 and PS], and
negative for synaptophysin. The findings are consistent with an invasive poorly
differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The tumor has basaloid features. The tumor shoWs
focal psrineural invasion and focal lymphovascular invasion. The sndocervix shows a benign
endocervical polyp. The endometrium is flat and atrophic. The myomstrium contains
multiple small leiomyomts. The seresel surface is unremarkable. Both ovaries are
atrophic and contain corpora albicantis. The left ovary contains a fibrotic nodule with
focal calcification and ossification consistent with a benign fibroma. Both fallopian
tubes are unremarkable. The vaginal cuff margins demonstrate chronic inflammazion and
areas of mild acute inflammation of the vaginal surface epithelium. Or. has
v-m'M-Ied this case and concurs with invasive poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
