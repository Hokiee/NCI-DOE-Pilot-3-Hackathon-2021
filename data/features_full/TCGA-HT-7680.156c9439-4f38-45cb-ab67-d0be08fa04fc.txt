Microscopic

Permanent section of frozen section demonstrates mildly hypercellular white
matter. The hypercellularity appears due to cells with mildly atypical angular
nuclei with out apparent processes. No mitotic figures are seen. There is no
microvascular proliferation or necrosis

Addendum

Sections demonstrate a modestly cellular glial neoplasm, a dense glial fibrillary
stroma. The tumor cells tend to be modestly clustered and sometimes oriented
around vessels but well formed pseudorosettes are not seen. There is no
myxoid or microcystic change and no calcifications are present. Nuclei are
consistently round with modest atypia. No mitotic figures are seen.

The neoplastic cells are diffusely immunoreactive for GFAP as is the fibrillary
background. There is no punctate cytoplasmic standing for EMA, strong
evidence against ependymal or subependymal lineage. Neurofilament stain
demonstrates a gradation from normally filamentous at the periphery to only rare
neurofilament positive axons centrally. Nevertheless, this pattern does suggest
an infiltrative process. MlB-1 demonstrates only a very rare positive cell with an
estimated labeling index of less than 0.1%. Overall, this immunophenotype
confirms the histologic impression of a very low grade but diffusely infiltrating
astrocytic neoplasm

Diagnosis

Consistent with well differentiated astrocytoma grade II
