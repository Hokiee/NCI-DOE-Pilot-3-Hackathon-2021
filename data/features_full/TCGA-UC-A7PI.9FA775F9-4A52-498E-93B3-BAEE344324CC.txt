Reason for Revision #1 (Addendum): Diagnosis Revised

CLINICAL DATA:
Cervical carcinoma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: I

A) Received in formalin designated "right pelvic lymph nodes" are multiple
fragments of yellow Iobulated adipose tissue admixed with lymph node candidates
measuring 4 x 4 x 1 cm in aggregate. Specimen bluntly dissected and entirely
submitted as follows: A1- two lymph node candidates; A2-one lymph node
candidate; A3-one lymph node candidate; A4— four lymph node candidates; AS- two
lymph node candidates; A6— two lymph node candidates; A7- two lymph node
candidates; A8- two lymph node candidates.

B) Received in formalin designated "right common iliac and para-aortic lymph
nodes" is a 6 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm fragment of yellow Iobulated adipose tissue admixed
with lymph nodes. Specimen entirely submitted as follows: 31 - one bisected
lymph node; 32 - two bisected lymph nodes; B3 - one bisected lymph node; B4—BS -
two bisected lymph nodes.

C) Received in formalin designated "left pelvic lymph nodes" are multiple
fragments of yellow Iobulated adipose tissue admixed with several lymph nodes
measuring 4.5 x 4 x 1.5 cm in aggregate. Specimen entirely submitted as

follows: C1 - two lymph node candidates; C2 ~ two lymph node candidates; C3 -
two lymph node candidates; C4 — two lymph node candidates; C5 - two lymph node
candidates; C6 - two lymph node candidates; C7-C8 — one bisected lymph node
candidate; C9 — one lymph node candidate ; C10 — two lymph node candidates; C11
- three lymph node candidates; C12-C13- two lymph node candidates, bisected.

D) Received in formalin designated "left common iliac and para-aortic lymph
nodes" is a 2.5 x 1 x 0.5 cm portion of yellow Iobulated adipose tissue admixed

with two lymph node candidates. Specimen bisected and entirely submitted in two
cassettes.

E) Received fresh designated "uterus and cervix, bilateral tube ovaries" is a
141 gm radical hysterectomy bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen which
includes uterus (141 gm, 5.5 cm CC x 7.3 cm SI x 3.5 cm AP) and attached cervix
and vaginal cuff, right ovary (3 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm), right fallopian tube (7.5 cm

long x 0.5 cm in diameter), left ovary (2.5 cm x 2.5 cm x 1.8 cm), and left

fallopian tube (6 cm long x 0.5 cm in diameter). The surgical margin is inked
black. The serosa is glistening with no masses identiﬁed. The entire exocervix
is distorted by an irregular, well demarcated friable white mass that measures
2.6 x 2.4 cm AP located mostly on the anterior surface,1.6 cm from the anterior
vaginal margin and 1.5 cm from the posterior vaginal cuff margin.. The cervical
05 is distorted by the mass, measuring approximately 0.3 cm in diameter and
appears patent. The anterior vaginal cuff margin is inked green and the
posterior vaginal cuff margin blue and the uterus is bisected to reveal a 3 cm
long cervical canal with a tan herringbone mucosa. The distal cervical canal

(1.2 cm long posterior and 0.7 cm long anterior) appears involved by the tumor,
however, the proximal aspect of the cervical canal as well as the lower uterine
segment appear grossly unremarkable. The cervical canal is serially sectioned
into approximately 0.4 cm thick slices to reveal a 2.6 x 2.4 x 1.4 cm white-tan
ﬁrm tumor. The endometrial cavity has a pink endometrium measuring 0.1 cm
thick with no masses or lesions identified. The myometrium is white rubbery
measuring 1.5 cm thick and contains one submucosal leiomyoma (0.5 cm in greatest
dimension) that has a tan white whorled appearance without hemorrhage or
necrosis. The parametrium is serially sectioned and no lymph nodes are

identified. The left ovary appears yellow, cerebriform

with a 2 x 1.3 x 0.7 cm pale tan nodule. No papillary excrescences are

identiﬁed. The ovary is bisected to reveal multiple physiologic cysts. The
previously described nodule appears to be a cyst with hemorrhagic contents. The
cyst lining is smooth with no papillary excrescences identified. The left

fallopian tube is serially sectioned to reveal a stellate patent lumen with no
masses identiﬁed. The right ovary appears yellow Iobulated with smooth and
glistening external aspect with no papillary excrescences identiﬁed. The ovary

is bisected to reveal a few physiologic cysts with no masses identiﬁed. The

right tube is serially sectioned to reveal a stellate patent lumen with no

masses identiﬁed. Representative sections are submitted as follows: E1 -
anterior vaginal cuff; E2 - left parametrium; E3 - right parametrium; E4—E5 -
composite anterior cervical canal and lower uterine segment (E4 cervix, E5 mid
section, E6 lower uterine segment); E7-E9 - composite section posterior cervical
canal and lower uterine segment (E7 cervix, E8 mid section, E9 lower uterine
segment); E10-E11 - section of tumor anterior; E12 - section of tumor posterior;
E13-E14 - composite endomyometrium anterior; E15 — endomyometrium posterior; E16
- left ovary; E17 - left fallopian tube; E18 — right ovary and fallopian tube;

E19 — right fallopian tube, ﬁmbriated end.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
A) Right pelvic lymph nodes, dissection: Nineteen lymph nodes with no evidence
of carcinoma (0/ 19).

B) Right common iliac and para-aortic lymph nodes, dissection: Six lymph nodes
with no evidence of carcinoma (0/5).

C) Left pelvic lymph nodes, dissection: Sixteen lymph nodes with no evidence
of carcinoma (0/16).

D) Left common iliac and para-aortic lymph nodes, dissection: Two lymph nodes
with no evidence of carcinoma (0/2).

E) Uterus, cervix and bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes, radical
hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy:

1. Papillary (villoglandular) adenocarcinoma of the cervix. See Summary Cancer
Data below.

2. Foci of adenomyosis.

3. Bilateral tubes and ovaries with no diagnostic alteration.

4. 4 parametrial lymph nodes with no evidence of carcinoma.

5. See comment.

ADDENDUM REASON:

This addendum is issued to correct the histologic classification of the
carcinoma in part E.

The carcinoma is well differentiated, but is clearly invasive, is not exophytic

and does not meet criteria for well differentiated papillary villoglandular
carcinoma. I would interpret it as well differentiated endometrioid carcinoma.
In addition, the closest inked margin is approximately 1.4 cm. The remainder of
the diagnosis is unchanged.
