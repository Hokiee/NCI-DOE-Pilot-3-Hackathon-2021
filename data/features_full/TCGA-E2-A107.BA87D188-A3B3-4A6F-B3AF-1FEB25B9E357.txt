lymph node is submitted entirely in cassette C1.
D. RIGHT BREAST

5 cm mastectomy with 11.5 x 7 the skin ellipse and 1.7 cm everted nipple. Ink code: anterior/superior-
blue, anterior/inferior-orange, posterior-black. The specimen is serially sectioned into 12 slices from
medial to lateral with nipple and slice 5 revealing an area of dense nodular ﬁrm ﬁbrous tissue, 10 x 8 x 4
cm, extending/ from the upper inner quadrant” to the mid outer quadrant at is closest to the
posterior/deep/ margin at ”175 cm. Representahvely sumetted

E. SLN #3

Received fresh is a lymph node, 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm. A touch prep is performed and the lymph node is
submitted entirely in cassette E1.

F. ADDITIONAL SENTINEL LYMPH NODE RIGHT AXILLA

Received fresh is a piece of yellow-tan tissue 2.5 x 2.1 x 1 cm. Two lymph nodes are identiﬁed
measuring 1.4 and 1.8 cm. Lymph nodes are submitted separately in cassettes F1-F2.

G. RIGHT AXILLARY CONTENTS LEVELS 1 AND 2

Received fresh is an aggregate Of adipose tissue, 7 x 5 x 1.5 cm. Multiple lymph nodes are identiﬁed
ranging from 0.1 to 2.1 cm; they have a variegated pink-tan cut surface. Lymph nodes submitted as
follows:

G1-G2: 4 lymph nodes each

G3: 6 lymph nodes

G4: 2 lymph nodes

G5-G8: 1 lymph node each

DIAGNOSIS:

A. BREASTIﬁﬂEET, WIDE LOCAL EXCISION:

- USUAL DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA WITHOUT ATYPlA, MICROCALCIFICATIONS IN BENIGN DUCTS
AND FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES WITH FIBROSIS

- FOCAL FAT NECROSIS AND MILD ACUTE INFLAMMATION, @MM/IQ’RMSEEN.

B. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #1, EXCISION:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1).

C. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #2, EXCISION:
- METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE OF ONE LYMPH NODE (1/1),

MEASURING 0.8-CM WITH NO EXTRANODAL EXTENSION.

D. BREASLJRIGHT, SIMPLE MASTECTOMY:

h MULWTIFOCAL, INVASIVE LOBULAR CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 2, MEASURING 10—CM
— INVASIVE TUMmEP‘SURGICAL RESECTION MARGIN

- METASTATIC CARCINOMA To ONE OF TWO AXILLARY LYMPH NODES (1/2)

- SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT AND SEE NOTE.

E. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #3, EXCISION:
- METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE OF ONE LYMPH NODE (1/1),
MEASURING 0.7-CM WITH FOCAL EXTRANODAL EXTENSION.

F. LYMPH NODE, ADDITIONAL SENTINEL, RIGHT AXILLA, BIOPSY:
- METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE OF TWO LYMPH NODES (1/2).

G. LYMPH NODES, RIGHT AXILLARY CONTENTS, LEVELS 1 AND 2, DISSECTION:
- TWENTY LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/20).

NOTE: Extensive and multifocal invasive Iobular carcinoma is identiﬁed. The tumor grossly measures
10-cm. Microscopic examination reveals that the tumor extends from slice #1 to slice #8 (predominantly
in the inner half, central and subareolar region, with extension to outer quadrants.

SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS
Specimen: Surgical Excision
Block Number: D1

 

ER: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3
PR: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0

 

COMMENT:

The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the
proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1°/o of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of
cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak
intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring
range from O to 8.

ER/PR positive is deﬁned as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is deﬁned as an Allred score
of less than or equal to 2. '

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
lmmunohistochemistry was nerfnrmeri Ilsinn the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR
136, 1:100) provided by g , . , following the manufacturer 3 instructions. This
assay was not modiﬁed. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published
results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal
review of staining performance.
