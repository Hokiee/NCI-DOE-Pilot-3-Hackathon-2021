CLINICAL HISTORY:
Abdominal/pelvic swelling,

 

arge pelvic mass with history of breast cancer.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. ”Omental nodule (AF1)". Received fresh is a 7.8 x 4.9 X 2.1 cm fragment cf
yellow—tan lobulated fibroadipose tissue that contains a 2.2 x 2.1 x 1.4 cm
well circumscribed, tan—white, firm nodule (AFl Frozen section; remnant in Al;
additional A2}.

B. "Piece of omentum". Received fresh is a 16.9 x 10.6 x 3.2 cm aggregate of
two fragments of yellow—tan lobulated fibrofatty tissue that discloses no
masses (Bl—2).

C. "Right tube and ovary". Received fresh is a 650 gram, 15.0 x 11.0 x 9.0 cm
ovarian tumor with an attached 10.2 x 0.7 cm expanded pink-tan fallopian tube.
The external surface of the ovarian tumor is tan—white, focally erythematous,
intact without excrescences or eVidence of rupture. The specimen is serially
sectioned to exhibit a predominantly solid cut surface which is variegated
tan—yellow to gray—tan and which varies in consistency from very firm to
friable and fleshy. Interspersed throughout the cut surface are multiple
smooth walled cysts, maximally 4.6 cm,-filled with clear tan fluid. The cut
surface also exhibits inter twining bands of whitewtan fibrous tissue and
focal areas of degeneration and necrosis.. The fallopian tube exhibits a 0.1
cm in diameter patent lumen and two 6 mm paratubal cysts

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Cl— fallopian tube with adjacent ovarian mass

C2- fibromembranous adhesion with adjacent ovarian mass
C3—5— ovarian mass with capsule

C6—B— representative ovarian mass

D. "Left tube and ovary". Received fresh is a 300 gram, 9.9 x 8.4 x 6.6 cm '
ovary with an attached 3.2 x 2.2 x 0.9 cm portion of adhesed, fimbriated
fallopian tube. Adjacent is a 7.3 x 5.7 cm area of tan-yellow to tan—pink
fibrofatty adhesion which is inked blue} The external ovary is smooth,
glistening, tan—white to tanﬂpink and is intact. The ovary is serially
sectioned to exhibit the predominantly solid variegated tan~yellow to
gray-pink cut surface with inter twinning bands of firm tan-white fibrous
tissue and multiple smooth walled cyst up to 1.1 cm in greatest dimension
filled with clear tan fluid. The cut surface varies in consistency from very
firm to somewhat friable. The portion of fimbriated fallopian tube present
is adhesed upon itself, and upon sectioning, a 0.2 cm in diameter lumen is
identified.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

D1" tube with adjacent ovary, and additional tube
D2— ovary with blue—inked adhesion

D3; ovary with capsule

D4— ovary

E. "Uterus". Received fresh is a 97.1 gram, 8.5 x 5.2 x 2.0 cm uterus. The
serosa is pinkwtan, glistening and exhibits multiple red—brown hemorrhagic
adhesions both anteriorly and posteriorly. The 2.7 cm cervix exhibits a
pink—tan, focally erythematous ectocervix with a 0.2 cm 05 which opens into a
yellow—tan trabeculated endocervical canal. The Opened Specimen reveals a 3.8
x 2.2 cm endometrial cavity with two broad based endometrial polyps up to 1.9
x 1.7 x 0.6 cm in the posterior cavity. The smaller polyp is in the fundus,
while the larger polyp is near the posterior lower uterine segment. The

'iuninvolved endometrium is tingixmn and 0.1 cm thick.- The 1.7 cm thick
pink—tan myometrium exhibits a single white—tan, whorled, well circumscribed

. intramural leiomyoma up to 0.6 cm in greatest dimension in the anterior half

tzof the specimen. a? ;;a

BLOCK SUMMARY:

E1" anterior cervix
E2" posterior cervix
E3— anterior endomyometrium with leiomyoma

Eé—S— posterior endomyometrium with fundic endometrial polyp, bisected
E6~ additional endometrial polyp in serosal adhesions

 

F. "Cul de sac tumor", received fresh and placed in formalin. A 5.1 x 3.5 x
3.1 cm nodular fragment of tan—white to pink—tan tissue which is somewhat
encapsulated. However there is a 2.3 x 1.1 cm focal disruption which exposes
the underlying tan—white, friable tumor. Upon sectioning, the cut surface is
pink—tan; glistening and soft. Representative in F1H2.

G. "Left aortic node", received fresh and placed in formalin. A 3.1 x 0.9 x
0.9 cm fragment of gray—tan tissue is sectioned and is entirely submitted in
G1.

NOTE: Information on pathology staging and the operative procedure is being
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation purposes by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology staging is based
solely upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not
incorporate information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology
section, past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Anatomic pathology staging is only a component to be considered in
determining the clinical stage, but should not be confused with nor
substituted for it. The exact Operative procedure is available in the
