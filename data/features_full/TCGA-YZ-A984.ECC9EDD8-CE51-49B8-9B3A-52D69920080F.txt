Cytogenetics Case Number:

Karyotype:
46,XX,t(3;6)(q27;q15)[4]/46.XX[16]

Interpretation:

This is a tumor from the left eye of a patient with ocular melanoma.
Cytogenetic analysis of this sample shows an abnormal clone of cells with a
translocation between chromosomes 3 and 6. The most common recurring
abnormalities seen in uveal melanomas are nonrandom changes of chromosomes
1, 3, 6 and 8. More specifically, deletions of 1p, monosomy for chromosome
3, gains of 6p, losses of Sq, and i(8q). Structural rearrangements of
chromosomes 3 are rare in uveal melanomas, most often seen with unbalanced
translocations resulting in deletions of 3q. The significance of the
rearrangement of chromosomes 3 and 6 in this sample is not known.

-~-MICROSCOPIC:---

Specimen A shows sections of a globe with a large choroidal tumor (1.5cm
diameter and 1.4 cm height) composed predominantly of a cohesive spindle
cell proliferation. Focal areas with cells having an epithelioid appearance
are also noted. Mitotic figures are rare. The tumor is partially
pigmented.The ciliary body is not involved by the tumor. Also, scleral or
extrascleral extension is not identified. The optic nerve is not observed

on the sections taken. These findings are consistent with a spindle cell
malignant melanoma arising from the choroid.

Specimen B shows a vascular channel not involved by malignant melanoma.

---SPECIMEN(S) RECEIVED:---

A: Eye, enucleation
B: Neuropathology, BX, NOS

---GROSS DESCRIPTION:~‘-

The specimens are received in two properly labeled containers with the
patient‘ 3 name and accession number.

A. The specimen is designated "enucleated left eye" and consists
of a 2.8 x 2.4 x 2.6 cm globe with a clear cornea measuring 1.1 x 1.0 cm in
diameter. The optic nerve stump is 0.2 cm in length. The specimen is
trisected revealing a brown-black, partially fragmented mass measuring 1.5
cm in maximum diameter and 1.4 cm in maximum height. The mass is in the
inferior aspect of the posterior chamber. RS 2

Summary of Cassettes: Al, lower calotte with tumor; A2, central eye
slab

B. The specimen is designated "vortex vein left eye" and consists
of a 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.05 cm portion of tan—red soft tissue. TE 1
