- LEIOMYOSARCOMA (3.5 X 3.3 X 1.4 CM), INTERMEDIATE TO HIGH GRADE
- TUMOR IS 0.2 CM TO THE CLOSEST DEEP MARGIN
- SURGICAL MARGINS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. POSTERIOR RIGHT THIGH SARCOMA
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "posterior right thigh sarcoma" is an oval
shaped piece of tan skin. 10 x 8 cm excised to a depth of 2 cm with a suture designating the proximal
position (specimen is also oriented by Dr.). There is a ﬁrm tan nodule, 3.2 x 3 cm located 2.5 cm from
the medial and lateral margins, 4 cm from the proximal position. and 2.8 cm from the distal position. The
posterior aspect is covered by fascia. Ink codes: Lateral-blue, medial-orange, posterior- black. On
sectioning, there is a pink-tan ﬁsh-ﬂesh nodule, 3.5 x 3.3 x 1.4 cm which is 1.1 cm from the distal
margin and grossly does not appear to invade the fascia. A photograph is taken and tissue is procured;
representatively submitted:
A1: shave of proximal margin

A2: cross section immediately proximal to nodule uum: cmssac-sm-475c-sssa-3226962r51ee-1d

A12: perpendicular section of medial margin nearest nodule

A13: cross section immediately distal to nodule

A14: shave of distal margin

B. ADDITIONAL PROXIMAL MARGIN

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "additional proximal margin" is a
triangular shaped, piece of tan skin, 6 x 3 cm excised to a depth of 1 cm with a suture designating the
proximal tip. The lateral margin is inked blue, medial margin-orange, and deep margin—green. Serial
sectioning reveals no discrete lesions; representatively submitted:

B1: proximal tip

82: shave of lateral and medial margins

BB: cross section including deep margin

C. ADDITIONAL DISTAL MARGIN

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and ”additional distal margin" is a triangular
shaped piece of tan skin, 3.4 x 1.4 cm excised to a depth of 1.5 cm with a suture designating the distal
tip. Proximal portion has surgical staples. The lateral margin is inked blue, medial margin-orange, and
deep margin-green. Specimen is serially sectioned revealing no discreet lesions; submitted entirely:
C1: distal tip

02-03: cross section submitted from distal to proximal
