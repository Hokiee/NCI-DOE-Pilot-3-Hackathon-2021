Comment:

The patient has a history of previous oligodendroglioma. Neither the
patient' s previous pathology slides nor pathology report was available
for review at the time of case signout.

This diagnostic report has been personally interpreted by the signatory

P53: POSITIVE STAINING OF SCATTERED TUMOR CELL NUCLEI IN
HYPERCELLULAR
AREAS OF THE TUMOR (SLIDE 2B).

Microscopic Description:

Most of specimen #1 (”temporal lobe") shows a low grade
oligodendroglioma. In contrast to specimen #1, specimen #2 contains
areas of increased cellularity, focal brisk mitotic rate, cytologic

atypic and focal microvascular proliferation. The Ki67 proliferation
index of the tumor in the hypercellular areas of specimen #2 ranges
from 4% to 9% with an average of 5.8 % (32,882 cells counted). The
histologic features identified in specimen#2 are sufficient for the
diagnosis of Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma, WHO grade III. The features
of anaplastic oligodendroglioma are best identified on slide 2B. Case
reviewed in conference with

 

A separate report with the results of FISH analysis of 1p19q status
will be issued.

Frozen Section Diagnosis:
1. Temporal lobe: Infiltrative glioma

2. Insula: Infiltrative glioma. Cellularity greater than #1.
No obvious anaplastic features-

Clinical History and Diagnosis:
Right temporal brain tumor. History of previous biopsy of
Oligodendroglioma, ”low grade".

Source of Specimen:
1 : Temporal lobe
2: Insula

Gross Descri tion:

1. Temporal lobe: Received fresh for frozen section in a specimen
container labeled with the patient's name and ”#1 temporal lobe" is a 4

X 3.5 X 1 centimeter fragment of tan-yellow soft tissue. A

representative sample comprising about 5% is frozen for intraoperative
consultation and touch prep were done. The entire specimen is submitted
as follows:

A. Frozen section control

B.-F. Remainder of specimen

2. Insula: Received fresh for frozen section a specimen container
labeled with the patient's name and "2 insula" are multiple pieces of
tan-pink soft tissue measuring 3.0 X 2.8 X 0.5 cm in aggregate. A
representative sample is used for touch preps and frozen for
intraoperative consultation. The entire specimen is admitted as
follows:

A. Frozen section control

B. Remainder of specimen
