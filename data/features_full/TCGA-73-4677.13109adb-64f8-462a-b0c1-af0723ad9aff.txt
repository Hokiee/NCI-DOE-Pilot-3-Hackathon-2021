GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. 4R LYMPH NODE
Received fresh labeled With the patient's identification and designated "4R lymph node" are four

fragments cfred-tan soft tissue measuring 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm in aggregate. Entirely submitted for
frozen section, FSA.

B. 4L LYMPH NODE
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "4L lymph node" are

multiple fragments of red—tan soft tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.3 x 0.7 cm in aggregate. Entirely
submitted for frozen section, FSB.

C. LEVEL 7 LYMPH NODE
Received fresh labeled with the patient‘s identiﬁcation and designated "level 7" are multiple

fragments of redwtan soft tissue measuring 1 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. Entirely submitted for

frozen section, FSC.

D. 2R LYMPH NODE
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated “2R lymph node" are

multiple fragments of anthracotic soft tissue measuring 1.3 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm in aggregate. Entirely
submitted for frozen section, FSD.

E. 4R ADDITIONAL
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated “4R additional" are

multiple anthracotic fragments of soft tissue measuring 2 x 1.8 x 0.3 cm in aggregate. Entirely
submitted for frozen section, FSE.

F. RIGHT UPPER LOBE
Received fresh labeled with the patient’s identification and “right upper lobe” is the product of a

lung lobectomy, 202—gm and 18.5 x 11.0 x 3.5 cm overall. The pleura is anthracotic to tan-pink
with interspersing diffuse subpleural ﬁbrosis. On sectioning, within the anterior segment along
the posterior aspect, and 2.5 cm from the bronchial margin, an inﬁltrative, peripheral gray—white,
3.0 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm tumor is identiﬁed. It invades into, but not through the pleura (inked black).
The tumor also invades the surrounding bronchioles. The remaining parenchyma is diffusely
anthracotic and deﬂated. The bronchial margin is entirely submitted for frozen section and
(approximately 76%) of tumor is submitted for procurement. There are multiple black lymph
nodes identiﬁed, ranging from 0.5 cm to 1.3 cm. Representative sections:

F1~ﬁ'ozen section, bronchial margin

F2—tumor to closest pleura

F6—subpleural ﬁbrosis, superior to tumor
F7—anthracotic lung, inferitir to tumor

G. 4R LYMPH NODE
Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and “4R LN” are 3 pieces of tan and

black soft tissue in aggregate, 2.7 x 1.6 0.6 cm; submitted entirely in cassette Gt.

H. 2R LYMPH NODE
Received in formalin labeled with the patient‘s identification and “2R LN” is a piece of yellow—

tan soft tissue, 1.9 x 1.7 x 0.5 cm containing a 0.5—cm lymph node; submitted entirely in cassette
H 1.

I. MEDIASTINAL' BIOPSY
Received in formalin labeled with the patient’s identiﬁcation and “mediastinal bx” are 3 pieces of

tan and black soft tissue in aggregate, 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm; submitted entirely in cassette 11.

J. PARIETAL PLEURAL PLAQUE (1)
Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and “parietal pleural plaque (1)” is a

piece of calciﬁed tissue, 1.8 x 1.1 x 0.7 cm submitted entirely after further ﬁxation and
decalciﬁcation in cassette J l.

K. PARIETAL PLEURAL PLAQUE (2)
Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and “parietal pleural plaque (2)” are

two pieces of pink—tan ﬁbrous tissue, 1.7 x 1.1 x 0.5 ein in aggregate; submitted entirely in
cassette K1.
