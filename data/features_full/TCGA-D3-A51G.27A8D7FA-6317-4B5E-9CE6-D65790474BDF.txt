DIAGNOSIS

(A) LEFT iNGUINAL SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1, BLUE, COUNT 120, EXCISION:
Dense fibroadipose tissue, lymph node or melanoma not identified.

(B) LEFT THIGH, SKIN ELLIPSE:

METASTATIC MELANOMA INVOLVING DERMIS AND SUBCUTANEOUS SOFT TISSUE, INKED TISSUE EDGES
APPEAR FREE. (SEE COMMENT)

TUMOR SIZE: 15 x 13 x 10 MM (PER GROSS DESCRIPTION).

Tumor borders focally infiltrative.

Skin and subcutaneous tissue with scar and changes consistent with previous biopsy/surgical procedure site.

Incidental melanocytic nevus, predominantly junctional type, with moderate architectural disorder and mild cytologic
atypia of melanocytes (“dysplastic”), present at lateral peripheral tissue edge.

incidental melanocytic nevus, compound type, with moderate architectural disorder and mild cytologic atypia of
melanocytes (“dysplastic”), inked tissue edges appear free.

incidental melanocytic nevus. predominantly junctional type, inked tissue edges appear free.

COMMENT:

(B) At the request of the clinician (per the protocol), an immunohistochemical study is performed here (on B5) and shows that
the tumor cells are positive (focal, strong) for a pan-melanocytic cocktail (anti-MART1, anti-tyrosinase, HMB45), which supports
the above diagnosis.

The tumor nodule is present within the dermis and subcutaneous fibroadipose tissue. A focal rim of associated lymphoid tissue is
seen. The tumor may represent a metastasis to soft tissue from the patient's known primary melanoma of the left calf or left

lateral knee (see case or it may represent a lymph node which has become completely replaced by metastatic tumor.
Clinical — pathologic correlation is recommended.

GROSSDESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT iNGUINAL SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1, BLUE, COUNT 120 — One portion of fibroadipose tissue (1 .8 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm),
from which one possible lymph node is dissected that measures up to 1.8 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is serially
sectioned and entirely submitted in A.
(B) WLE OF METASTATIC MELANOMA OF THE LEFT THIGH, SHORT STITCH PROXIMAL, LONG STITCH LATERAL, FOR
PROTOCOL - An ellipse of tan skin with underlying subcutaneous tissue (8.5 x 5.8 x 1.6 cm), which is oriented by the surgeon

with a short suture stitch to denote proximal and a long stitch to denote lateral. The specimen is inked and serially sectioned to
reveal a pink, fleshy nodule (1.5 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm) that grossly measures 0.7 cm from the closest medial and deep tissue edges.
Approximately 80% of the specimen is submitted for research purposes per the protocol. The remaining specimen is
submitted for permanent evaluation in B.

INK CODE: Blue - lateral half; orange - medial half.

SECTION CODE: Bl, proximal tip; 82, distal tip; BS-BS, skin and subcutaneous tissue with tumor relative to closest
medial and deep tissue edges; 86. lateral tissue edge, en face.

CLINICAL HISTORY
None given.
