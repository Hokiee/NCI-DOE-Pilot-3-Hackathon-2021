PROCEDURE
Bilateral simple breast mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy left
breast.
A. Right breast. 8. Left breast with attached sentinel nodes.
HISTORY

Left breast cancer.

GROSS
A. Received in formalin in a container labeled “right breast" is a
mastectomy (22 x 18 x 5 cm). Orientation of the specimen is not
provided. The skin ellipse (20 x 15 cm) has a central unremarkable
nipple and areola. The posterior margin is composed of thin fascia
without attached skeletal muscle. The margins are marked with black
ink.

The specimen is serially sectioned. The parenchyma has discrete and
ill—defined areas of soft white fibrous tissue. A suspicious lesion
is not palpated.

1. Nipple and areola. 1N3
2. Subareolar parenchyma. 283
3-6. Representative sections from four quadrants. -

B. Received fresh in a container labeled "left breast" is a
mastectomy (23 x 17 x 5 cm) with a 7 cm axillary tail. The skin
ellipse (20 x 12 cm) has a central unremarkable nipple and areola.

The parenchyma is serially sectioned. The medial hemisphere has a
2.6 cm in greatest dimension hard gray—white sclerotic neoplasm with
an ill-defined radially infiltrating border measuring approximately
1 cm from the posterior margin, 2.2 cm from the skin surface and 1
cm from the nearest (inferomedial) radial margin. A representative
portion of the tumor along with normal parenchyma away from the
neoplasm is submitted for TCGA/ . The remaining
parenchyma has scattered areas of ill-defined fibrous tissue without
a palpable mass. The axillary tail has numerous fatty lymph nodes
up to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension.
