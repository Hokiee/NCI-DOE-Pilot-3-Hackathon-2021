Microscopic Description:

Sections demonstrate a variably cellular glial neoplasm that diffusely infiltrates the gray
and white matter. The majority of the tumor is only mildly hypercellular but some areas
having conï¬‚uent hypercellularity are seen. The tumor cells have mildly atypical,
enlarged, round nuclei and either perinuclear halos or microgemistocytic cytoplasm. Only
a single mitosis is seen after extensive examination. There is no microvascular
proliferation or necrosis.

Addendum Description: Scattered MIB-l reactive cells are present in the most
proliferative areas with a calculated labeling index of 0.6%

Addendum Diagnosis: Low grade Oligodendroglioma (Who Grade II)
MIB-l Labeling Index: 0.6%
