FINAL DIAGNOSIS
A) Left thyroid lobe and Isthmus. Iobectomy:
1) Multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma; the largest measures 3.0
cm In maximum dimension.
2) All three tumor nodules appear conﬁned within the thyroid
without extra-thyroid extension.
3) No deﬁnitive evidence of lymphovascular invasion.
4) Uninvolved thyroid with no signiﬁcant pathological change.
5) A piece of parathyroid tissue is identiﬁed.
6) Metastatic papillary carcinoma Involving one of two regional
lymph nodes (1/2). No evidence of extra-nodal extension.

B) Left central compartment lymph nodes, dissection: Metastatic papillary
thyroid carcinoma involving total slx (616). No evidence of extra-nodal
extension.

C) Right thyroid lobe, lobectomy: Benign thyroid tissue with no signiﬁcant
pathological change.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A) Received fresh for frozen section labeled ”left thyroid lobe and isthmus" is a
9.7-9 lobe of thyroid with isthmus. measuring overall approximately 5.3 x 3.5 x 2.0
cm. The specimen is subsequently inked on its surgical margins. Sectioning
reveals an orange/brown nodule measuring approximately 3.0 cm in greatest
dimension. Touch preps are made. A representative section is submitted for frozen
section as A1. Sectioning through the remainder of the specimen reveals two
additional nodules, measuring 0.6 cm and 0.7 cm in greatest dimension,
respectively. Permanent sections are submitted as follows: largest nodule A2
through A5, smaller nodule A6. smallest nodule A7, and random thyroid A8. Tissue

is collected for _

B) Received fresh for frozen section labeled "left central compartment lymph nodes”
is an aggregate of approximately six lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.5 cm up to
1.8 cm in greatest dimension. The largest shows an orangelyellow to yellow/tan cut
surface. A representative section of the largest is submitted for frozen section as
B1. Permanent sections are submitted as follows: remainder of largest lymph node
candidate 32, and remaining lymph node candidates 83. Tissue is collected for

W

C) Received' In fonnalln labeled “right thyroid lobe" is a 6. 5-gram ”right thyroid lobe

 

to posterior. The capsule is disrupted and has multiple ﬁne ﬁbrous adhesions. The
entire surface IS inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal dense,
red/brown, unremarkable thyroid parenchyma. The specimen is entirely submitted as
follows: C1 through 05 entire lobe serially and sequentially submitted from superior
to inferior, C6 additional inferior lobe and perpendicular sections of the inferior lobe.
