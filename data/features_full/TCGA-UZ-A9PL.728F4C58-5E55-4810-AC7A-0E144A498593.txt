Clinical HIsto
The patient is a year-old man with a left renal mass.

Gross Description

The specimen is received in formalin in one part. labeled with the patient‘s name, medical record number,
and "left kidney." It consists of a nephrectomy specimen, weighing 1078 gm and measuring 19.0 cm from
superior to inferior, 13.0 cm from medial to lateral, and 7.0 cm from anterior to posterior. The specimen is
received bisected, with the external fatty surface marked with black ink. Additional sagittal sections of the
specimen are also noted upon manipulation. The cut surface of the sectioned specimen shows a ragged,
soft, yellow, necrotic tumor, measuring 10.0 cm, which appears to be circumscribed; this is situated at the
superior pole of the kidney. On further inspection, the tumor appears to abut on the renal cortex and does
not involve the adjacent renal medulla, renal pelvis or calices. Cut section of the renal pelvis and renal
sinus shows no tumor involvement in this area. Search for lymph nodes is performed within the renal
hilum / renal sinus area, and no lymph nodes are identified. Gross inspection of the sagittal sections of this
tumor shows that the nearest approach to the external inked surface of the perirenal adipose tissue is 0.3
cm at the superior-anterior region. The ureter is identiﬁed and measures approximately 3.5 cm in length
and 0.5 cm in diameter. The renal vessels are also identiﬁed. The ureter and vascular resection margins
are grossly free of tumor. The adrenal gland is identiﬁed and measures 5.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. The tumcr does
not involve the adrenal gland grossly. The kidney is red-brown and normal in shape; it measures 12.0 x 5.0
x 3.0 cm and the renal capsule strips with ease. Additional transverse sections of the specimen shows no
other tumor lesions. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows:

Cassette A1: Ureteral margin (en face).

Cassette A2: Vein and artery surgical resection margins (en face).

Cassette A3: Adrenal gland.

Cassette A4: Tumor at its nearest approach to the perirenal fat at the anterior-superior area.
Cassettes A5-A6: Sections of tumor in relation to the kidney cortex, medulla, and calices.
Cassette A7: Superﬁcial cortex and tumor interface.

Cassette A8: Additional cortex and tumor interface at mid kidney.

Cassettes A9, A10: Full thickness section of kidney with tumor interface (bisected)

Cassette Al 1: Full thickness section of kidney with tumor interface (bisected)

Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. Final diagnosis made by attending pathologist
following review of all pathology slides.
