Diagnosis:

2. Resected section of colon (sigmoid) with an ulcerated colon carcinoma characterized
histologically as a moderately differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma, clearly extending
up to 11 cm to the oral resection margin, measuring a max of 3 cm in diameter. Invasive
spread of the tumor within all intestinal wall layers to the adjacent mesocolic fatty tissue.

Otherwise the intestinal wall has several pseudodiverticula with chronic scarring
peridiverticulitis. The preparation has a tumor-free seminal vesicle attached aborally. Oral
and aboral resection margins are tumor-free.

The tumor stage of the colon carcinoma described in (2) is therefore pT3, G2, R0.
