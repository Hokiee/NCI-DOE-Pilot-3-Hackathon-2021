Focal mild chronic inﬂammation.

B. Liver. "n'ght hepatic lobectomy—tumor bank“, partial hepatectomy:
Poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. See comment.
Minimal steatosis (1%) and focal portal inﬂammation.

lmmunohistochemical studies are performed. The tumor cells are positive for glypican 3, CK? (focal and weak), MOO-31 and they
are negative for CK20, pCEA, and hepatocyte. Reticulin special stain shows loss of reticulin ﬁber.

The pathologic stage assigned here should be regarded as provisional, as it reﬂects only current pathologic data and does not
incorporate full knowledge of the patient's clinical status and/or prior pathology.

Pursuant to the , . this case has been concurrently reviewed by the following

Attestation:

By this signature, I attest that l have personally formulated the ﬁnal interpretation expressed in this report and that the above diagnosis is based
upon my examination of the slides and/or other material indicated in this report.

MElectronically Signed Out By‘“
Interpreted by:

A. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient’s name and “gallbladder" is a 6.9 x 2.5 x 1.4 cm cholecystectomy specimen.

The serosa is tan-purple and wrinkled. The gallbladder is opened to reveal a red-brown velvety mucosa with multiple yellow-gold

flecks. No calculi are grossly identified within the gallbladder or accompanying specimen container. The gallbladder wall ranges

in size from 0.2 to 0.4 cm. The cystic duct remnant contains a metallic staple and appears to be patent. Representative sections
from the gallbladder body and fundus, and a shave of the cystic duct remnant (inked black) are submitted in cassette A1.

B. Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and "right hepatic lobectomy" is a partial hepatectomy specimen weighs 1180
grams and measures 20.0 x 13.5 x 9.1 cm in dimension. The external surface is tan-brown and glistening with a white tumor
nodule measuring 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm. On the inferior surface, the serosa is focally bulging with an underlying mass. The area of
firmness and protrusion measures 10.0 x 9.0 cm. The liver is serially sectioned at 0.5 cm intervals to reveal a smooth, glistening,
tan—brown cut surface. There is a tan-yellow, well circumscribed and encapsulated mass measuring 12.0 x 11.0 x 9.0 cm in
dimension and is 3.2cm from the parenchymal resection margin. The surface of the tumor is tan-yellow, ﬁrm with focal areas of
hemorrhage. The mass extends to the inferior capsule of the right hepatic lobe. The perviously described nodule on the superior

aspect of the liver upon sectioning measures 0.8 x 0.8 x1.1 cm. Both the large described mass and smaller described mass are
encapsulated and extend to the liver capsule.

B1 Representative section of the vascular margin.

52 Representative section of the intrahepatic portal vein.

BS Representative section of grossly unremarkable hepatic tissue.
B4 Tumor to inferior liver capsule (larger tumor).

B5 Tumor to liver capsule (larger tumor).

BG Representative section of the smaller tumor to tumor capsule

B7—BQ Representative sections of tumor to normal appearing hepatictissue.
B10 One possible lymph node, bisected. '
