By Pathologist:

My signature is attestation that I have personally reviewed the
submitted

material(s) and the final diagnosis reflects that evaluation.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in nine parts.

Part 1 is received fresh labeled with the patient‘ 5 name, initials XXX
and

"stomal skin". It consists of a 5.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm skin with
subcutaneous

tissue. No lesions are identified grossly. Representative section is
submitted in cassette 1A.

Ink code:

Black deep margin

Time in formalin: 37 hours.

Part 2 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX
and

"right neck levels 2, 3, 4". It consists of an 11 x 8 x 2 cm yellow
lobulated

fibroadipose tissue. Lymph nodes are dissected out and submitted
entirely as

follows:

2A—2C level 2 lymph nodes

ZD—ZF level 3 lymph nodes

ZG—ZJ level 4 lymph nodes.

Time in formalin: 37 hours.

Part 3 is received fresh labeled with the patient‘ s name, initials XXX
and

"left neck levels 2, 3, 4". It consists of a 15 x 6 x 4 cm tan—yellow
lobulated fibroadipose tissue. Lymph nodes are dissected out and
submitted

entirely as follows:

3A-3C level 2 lymph nodes

30—3? level 3 lymph nodes

3G-3J level 4 lymph nodes.

Time in formalin: 37 hours.

Part 4 is received fresh labeled with the patient' 8 name, initials XXX
and

"total laryngectomy". It consists of an 8 X 9 x 5.5 cm total
laryngectomy

specimen. There is pedunculated, filiform, friable and ulcerated tan—
white

firm mass at right supraglottic area (4.5 x 3.0 x 0.4 cm) that focally
permeates the adjacent aryepiglottic fold submucosa with a pushing
border.

Anterior commissure is involved. Tumor is 2 cm deep, abuts thyroid
cartilage,

but does not involve it. The tumor grossly extends to pre—epiglottic
space.

Right vocal cord is not involved. The tumor crosses midline to left
supraglottic region, within 0.5 cm from left aryepiglottic fold. The
tumor

involves right pyriform sinus. The surface of the epiglottis appears
ulcerated and the ulceration is within 0.3 cm from superior mucosal
edge of

epiglottis. The tumor is within 4.5 cm from inferior tracheal margin
and

within 2 cm from stoma site. The mucosa and area of the stoma appears

slightly nodular. The mucosa is uninvolved by the tumor. No thyroid
tissue

is grossly identified. Photographs are taken.
Ink code:

Red tissue banked

Blue— pre-epiglottic space

Black anterior soft tissue margin

Orange hyoid bone area.

Cassette code:

4A anterior soft tissue, shaved

4B — vertical epiglottis and pre-epiglottis space
4C — vertical left aryepiglottic fold with tumor
4D — vertical right aryepiglottic fold with tumor

4J tumor in relation to right vocal fold

4K potential lymph nodes in anterior soft tissue
4LDR tumor and thyroid cartilage.

Time in formalin: 37 hours.

Part 5 is received fresh labeled with the patient' 5 name, initials XXX
and

"post cricoid margin". It consists of a 2.5 x 0.3 x 0.4 cm tan soft
tissue

for intraoperative consultation. The remainder of the frozen section
specimen

is submitted in cassette SAPS.

Time in formalin: 37 hours.

Part 6 is received fresh labeled with the patient' 5 name, initials XXX
and

"left lateral pharyngeal margin". It consist s of a 4.0 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm
tan

soft tissue for intraoperative consultation. The remainder of the
frozen

section specimen is entirely submitted in cassette 6AFS.

Time in formalin: 37 hours.

Part 7 is received fresh labeled with the patient' 5 name, initials XXX
and

"right lateral pharyngeal margin". It consists of a 2.2 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm
tan

soft tissue for intraoperative consultation. The remainder of the
frozen

section specimen is entirely submitted in cassette 7AFS.

Time in formalin: 37 hours.

Part 8 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX
and

"right base of tongue margin". It consists of a 2.3 X 0.2 x 0.3 cm tan
soft

tissue for intraoperative consultation. The remainder of the frozen
section

specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes 8AFS.

Time in formalin: 37 hours.

Part 9 is received fresh labeled with the patient' 3 name, initials XXX
and

"left base of tongue margin". It consists of a 2 X 0.3 x 0.4 cm tan
soft

tissue for intraoperative consultation. The remainder of the frozen
section

specimen is entirely submitted in cassette 9AFS.

Time in formalin: 37 hours.

MICROSCOPIC:

Microscopic examination substantiates the above diagnoses.

The following statement applies to all immunohistochemistry, Insitu
Hybridization Assays (ISH & FISH), Molecular Anatomic Pathology, and
Immunofluorescent Testing:

The testing was developed and its performance characteristics
determined by

the . Department of Pathology, as required by
the CLIA

'88 regulations. The testing has not been cleared or approved for the
specific use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA has
determined such approval is not necessary for clinical use. Tissue
fixation

ranges from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 84 hours.
This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments of 1988 ("CLIA") as qualified to perform high—complexity
clinical
testing. Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA, ASR‘s used in this
laboratory
have been established and verified for accuracy and precision.
Additional
information about this type of test is available upon request.
