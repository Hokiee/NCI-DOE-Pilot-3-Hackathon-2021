Source of Tissue: ll. Labeled # l l, "right middle and lower lobe of lung“
Frozen Section Diagnosis: llFS— NEGATIVE MARGINS.

Gross Description: Received fresh from OR. for frozen section

consultation in a container labeled ” patiehtname and medical number, right
middle and lower lobe of lung". It consists of a 440—gram right middle and
lower lobe of lung measuring respectiv'ely'lZﬂ x 7.0 X 6.0 and 16.0 X 16.0

x 7.0 cm. The bronchial margin was procured for frozen section and the
residue is in llFS. The bronchial tree is opened and is unremarkable.

The vascular margins are likewise unremarkable. Sections through the
lower lobe disclose a few ill-deﬁned tiny areas of fullness measuring no
more than 0.3 cm. Elsewhere the parenchyma is pink and spongy. The

 

middle lobe is ﬁrm. Sections disclose an 8.0 x 6.0 x 4.0 cm light brown
bosselated cut surface comprising 70% of the middle lobe. The middle and
lower lobes are well~delineated and the sulcus is intact with no gross
evidence of tumor extension however the aforementioned small lesions in
the lower lobe are suspicious for tumor. Lesional tissue comes within 0.7
cm of the resection margin. Representative sections are submitted in

l lA~G.

Designation of Sections: llFS- bronchial margin, 1 1A- vascular margins,
llB— lower lobe hilar node, 110— middle lobe hilar node, llD—l lE~ middle
lobe lesional tissue, llF-I lG— lower lobe lung tissue with possible

lesions

Source of Tissue: 12. Labeled # 12, ”4R lymph nodes"

Gross Description: Received fresh in a container labeled " patient name and medical number,
4R lymph nodes". It consists of fibroadipose tissue

measuring in aggregate 5.0 x 3.0 X 2.0 cm. Bisection through the tissue

discloses a few fatty yellow to soft gray-black lymph nodes measuring from

1.0 up to 1.5 cm. No suspicious areas are grossly identiﬁed. Entirely

submitted in l2A-D.

Designation of Sections: 12A—12C- single large fatty lymph node, 12D—

single lymph nodes

subcentimeter satellite lesiOns are similar.
