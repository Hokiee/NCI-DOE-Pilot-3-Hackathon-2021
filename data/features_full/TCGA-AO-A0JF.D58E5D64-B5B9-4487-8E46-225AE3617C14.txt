Comment: Controls are satisfactory. PATHWAY anti—HBR~2/neu is an
FDA—approved rabbit monoclonal primary antibody (clone 435) directed against
the internal domain of the c-erbB-2 oncoprotein (3332) for
immunohistochemical detection of HERZ protein overexpression in breast
cancer tissue routinely processed for histologic evaluation. The HER2 test
results are reported in accordance with the ASCO/CAP guideline
recommendations for HERZ testing in breast cancer (J Clin Oncol 2007;
25(1):118-l45). The HR and PR rabbit monoclonal antibodies are also FDA
approved.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF

'THE SLIDES'(AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED

THIS REPORT.

Gross Description:
)

1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen labeled, I'Sentinel node #1,

level 1, left axilla", and consists of one fatty lymph node measuring 2.5 x
1.5 x 1.5 cm, which is trisected and representatively submitted. A portion
of tissue sent to TPS. The remaining lymph node is submitted to permanent.

Summary of sections:
fsc -- lymph node frozen section control
Rs- remaining lymph node

L

2) The specimen is received fresh for frozen labeled, "Sentinel node #2,

level 1, left axilla', and consists of one fatty lymph node measuring 2.4 x
1.5 x 1.2 cm, which is trisected and representatively submitted. A portion
of tissue sent to TPs. The remaining lymph node is submitted to permanent.

Summary of sections:
fsc -- lymph node frozen section control
RS— remaining lymph node

3) The specimen is received unoriented and fresh, labeled "excision of
tumor, left breast two o' clock' and consists of a piece of fibrofatty
breast tissue measuring 5.2 x 5.0 x 2.3 cm. The specimen is entirely inked
black. Serial sectioning reveals a spiculated, white mass measuring 1.2 x
1.2 x 1.1 cm. Sectioning through the remaining breast tissue reveals yellow
adipose tissue. A clip is identified. The tumor is entirely submitted and
the remaining tissue is representatively submitted and a small portion is
given to TPS.

Summary of sections:

MT - tumor and closest tissue edge

T - tumor (clip was in block 2)

SS - serial sections remaining tissue

4) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "superior margin left breast" and
consists of a piece of fibrofatty breast tissue measuring 5.0 x 3.0 cm, and
1.3 cm thick. A stitch marks the new margin of excision, which is inked
black. The tissue is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.

black. The tissue is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.

9). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "posterior margin, left breast"
and consists of a piece of fibrofatty breast tissue measuring 4.2 x 3.0 cm,
and 0.5 cm thick. The specimen is unoriented, entirely inked black
sectioned and submitted in its entirety.

Summary of sections:
SS - sequential sections

10) The specimen is received fresh labeled "levels one and two left axillary
contents". It consists of a fragment of yellow adipose tissue measuring 12.5
