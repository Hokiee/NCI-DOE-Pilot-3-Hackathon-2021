COMMENT

The tumor shows varying histology including basaloid squamous carcinoma and portions with acinar/ rosette formation which
suggests a component of adenocarcinoma. Because of the nested growth pattern. lHC for neuroendocrine markers were
performed and show negative chromogranin and focal non-specific positivity with synaptophysin. CK34BE12 and p63 show patchy
positivity in the squamous component. The presence of squamous and glandular components also raises possibility of
mucoepidermoid carcinoma, but the high grade histology. lack of intermediate cell population excludes that. Mucin stains were also
performed (PAS-D and mucicarmine) and focal mucin can not be excluded.

In regards to specimen #2, tumor extends to the deep margin; however the ﬁnal deep margin in specimen #7 is negative for
carcinoma.

In regards to specimen #4, due to severe cautery artifact assessment of the invasive component is not possible but favor invasive
squamous cell carcinoma.

88305 X 6, 88307, 88331x5

Clinical Diagnosis and History:

Laryngeal tumor with TCGA study: probably RT candidate according to scrubbed surgical staff in OR subsequent to report of
positive and suspicious margins on F8 exam.

Tissuets) Submitted:

1: EPIGLOTTIC TISSUE BllOPSY

2: EPIGLOTTIS LONG STITCH SUPERIOR, SHORT STITCH LEFT LATERAL TCGA STUDY
3: ADDITIONAL INFERIOR EPIGLOTTIC MARGIN STITCH LEFT

Gross Description:
Specimen #1 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation: the specimen is labeled “epiglottic tumor-biopsy“. It consists of a 2.1
x 0.7 x 0.3 cm aggregate of tan, soft tissue. A representative section of the specimen is frozen.

Summary of Sections:
1A: remainder of the frozen section
1 B: remainder of the specimen

Specimen #2 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation including tissue harvesting and is labeled epiglottis (long stitch
superior, short stitch left lateral) and consists of a resection specimen measuring 2.8 (S-I) x 2.5 (L-M) x 1.1 (A-P) cm in overall
dimension. A polypoid irregular mass lesion extends from the mucosal surface and on sagittal cut sections invades at least to the
level of the epiglottic perichondrium. The S-l dimension of the tumor is largest. ~2.5 cm in extent. Grossly the superior and left
lateral margins are negative (up to 0.7 cm) however all remaining margins are grossly close. A mid-sagittal slice is harvested for
the genome project. The remainder is submitted right parasagittal full slice (2A), left parasagittal full slice (28). left lateral, superior
to inferior (ZC-ZE) and right lateral. superior to inferior (2F-2G). The specimen was inked superior-blue, inferior-green, left lateral-
yellow. right lateral-red and black-deep.

Specimen #3 is received in formalin; the specimen is labeled “additional inferior epiglottic margin stitch left". It consists of a portion
of tan. soft tissue with a stitch designating left. The specimen is remarkable for cautery on one side (deep margin). The left tip is

inked yellow and the right tip is inked red. The deep is inked green and the specimen is serially sectioned from one end to the
other. The specimen is entirely submitted.

Summary of Sections:

3A: left tip
SB: right tip
SC: mid sections

Specimen #4 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation, the specimen is labeled “pedicle of epiglottis margin". It consists of a
0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm portion of tan soft tissue. The specimen was entirely frozen and submitted labeled 4A.

Specimen #5 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation, the specimen is labeled “right false vocal cord”. It consists of a 0.4 x
0.3 x 0.2 cm portion of tan soft tissue. The specimen is entirely frozen and submitted labeled 5A.

Specimen #6 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation, the specimen is labeled “left false vocal cord”. It consists of a 0.5 x
0.4 x 0.2 cm aggregate of tan soft tissue. The specimen is entirely frozen and submitted labeled 6A.

Specimen #7 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation, the specimen is labeled “deep epiglottis margin". It consists of a 0.6
x 0.4 x 0.2 cm aggregate of tan soft tissue. The specimen is entirely frozen and submitted labeled 7A.
