DIAGNOSIS:
A. OMENTUM:
- METASTATIC HIGH GRADE SEROUS CARCINOMA COMPONENT. SEE NOTE:

B. OMENTUM:
- METASTATIC HIGH GRADE SEROUS CARCINOMA COMPONENT, SEE NOTE:

C. UTERUS, LEFT TUBEAND OVARY:
- MALIGNANT MIXED MULLERIAN TUMOR (11 CM), ARISING IN ENDOMETRIUM AND WITH LESS
THAN 50% DEPTH OF MYOMETRIAL INVASION WITH NECROSIS. SEE NOTE.
- UTERINE SEROSA AND PARA-TUBAL/PARA—OVARIAN SOFT TISSUE WITH METASTATIC
EPITHELIAL COMPONENT (HIGH GRADE PAPILLARY SEROUS CARCINOMA) OF THE TUMOR
- LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.
- UTERINE ANGIOMYOLIPOMA (1.4 CM)
- THE UNINVOLVED ENDOMETRIUM SHOWS FOCALLY CYSTIC ATROPHY
- SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT

D. TUBE AND OVARY, RIGHT, SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY:
- PARA-TUBAL/PARA—OVARIAN SOFT TISSUE WITH METASTATIC HIGH
GRADE SEROUS CARCINOMA COMPONENT

E. TUMOR ON BLADDER PERITONEUM:
. METASTATIC HIGH GRADE SEROUS CARCINOMA COMPONENT.

Note: The largely polypoid tumor arises in the endometrium. with superﬁcial myometrial invasion. The
malignant stroma is heterologous with prominent rhabdomyosarcomatous component. The malignant
epithelial component is mainly a high grade serous carcinoma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. OMENTUM
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and ‘omentum' is a tan pink —grey ﬁrm segment
of omentum 2.5 x 2 x 0.60m. The specimen is serially sectioned. A portion of the specimen is submitted
for tissue procurement. The remainder of the specimen is submitted in A1.
B. OMENTUM
Received in formalin labeled with the patient’s identiﬁcation and 'omentum’ is a tan yellow segment of
omentum 8.5 x 4 x 30m. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a tan white ﬁrm cut surface.
Representatively submitted in B1 -B3.
C. UTERUS, LEFT TUBE AND OVARY
Received fresh is a 4129 supracervical hysterectomy specimen with attached left tube and ovary. The
uterus is 12cm from fundus to lower uterine segment. 11cm from comua to comua and 8.3cm from
anterior to posterior. The serosa is tan pink and smooth. The specimen is bivalved into anterior and
posterior halves to reveal a tan pink friable mass 11 x 9.5 x 7.5cm, occupying 100% of the cavity and
attached to the posterior aspect of the specimen. The mass grossly appear to be conﬁned to the
endometrium. The uninvolved endometrium is 0.10m. The uninvolved trabeculated myometrium is
2.3cm and remarkable for a 1.4 x 1.3 x 1cm tan white ﬁrm well circumscribed mass. The mass is
sectioned to reveal a homogenous white whorled cut surface without areas of hemorrhage or necrosis.
The attached left tan pink cerebriform ovary is 1.3 x 0.9 x 0.70m. is bivalved to reveal unremarkable
parenchyma. The attached left ﬁmbriated fallopian tube is 4cm in length x 1cm in diameter. The
fallopian tube is serially sectioned to reveal a patent lumen. A portion of the specimen is submitted for
tissue procurement. Gross photographs are taken. Representatively submitted as follows:
01-02: anterior lower uterine segment
CS-C4: posterior lower uterine segment
C5-C6: anterior endomyometrium
C7: anterior mass
C8-C10: posterior endomyometrium where mass is attached
011: left ovary
C12: left fallopian tube
D. RIGHT TUBE AND OVARY
Received in formalin labeled with the patient’s identiﬁcation and 'right tube and ovary‘ is a 3g tan pink
ceribriform ovary 2.3 x 1.6 x 0.6cm with attached ﬁmbriated fallopian tube 4 x 1.2cm. The ovary is
bivalved to reveal unremarkable parenchyma. The fallopian tube is serially sectioned to reveal a patent
lumen. Entirely submitted:
D1: right ovary
D2-03: right fallopian tube
E. TUMOR ON BLADDER PERITONEUM
Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and ‘tumor on bladder peritoneum‘ is a 11 x
9 x 3.5cm ﬁrm tan white tissue fragment. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a homogenous
yellow white cut surface. Representatively submitted in E1—E2.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
year old female with uterine carcinoma on endometrial biopsy.
