DIAGNOSIS:

A. Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and

bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy: Invasive FIGO grade III
(of III)

endometrial adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated and Em.wu?a~hv; TKS,
endometrioid types, I Iii H ax,‘?
”is identified in a background of atypical complex 0
hyperplasia A.l0 2.
forming a mass (6.0 x 3.7 x 1.8 cm) located in the /L,

anterior uterine
wall. The tumor invades 1.8 cm into the myometrium (total

myometrial thickness, 2.1 cm). The tumor does not involve
the

endocervix. The cervix shows squamous metaplasia. The
bilateral

ovaries and fallopian tubes are not involved. The left
ovary shows

a corpus luteum cyst. The right ovary and bilateral
fallopian tubes

are without diagnostic abnormality. [AJCC pTlcNOMX]

B—E. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, excisions: Multiple left
pelvic

lymph nodes (1 external iliac, 2 internal iliac, 1 common
iliac, 8

obturator) are negative for tumor.

F—I. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, excisions: Multiple
right pelvic

lymph nodes (5 external iliac, 1 common iliac, 5
obturator) are

negative for tumor. Specimen F received as "right pelvic
lymph

nodes, internal" did not contain nodal tissue.

J, K. Lymph nodes, right and left para—aortic, excisions:
Multiple

para—aortic lymph nodes (6 right, 11 left) are negative
for tumor.

L. Omentum, omentectomy: Negative for tumor.

M. Appendix, appendectomy: Negative for tumor.

N—R. Peritoneum; right diaphragm, right para colic
gutter, left

para colic gutter, bladder peritoneum, and cul de sac;
staging

biopsies: Negative for tumor, all five specimens.

This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic

examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of
the

specimen(s).

ADDENDUM:

The endometrial cancer does not display angiolymphatic
invasion in

the myometrium.

Of note, there is focal squamous cell carcinoma in situ
present in

the cervix. This area, seen both on frozen section and
file slides,

arises in association with squamous metaplasia and was
initially

felt to represent a type of atypical reserve cell
hyperplasia at the

transformation zone. However, in immunostains (using
tissue block

A4), while p53 staining is minimal, there is "full
thickness" MIB—I

and p63 staining in the area of histologic concern
supporting the

diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma in situ. This
explains the

outside Pap smear findings of atypical squamous cells on

(see report.
