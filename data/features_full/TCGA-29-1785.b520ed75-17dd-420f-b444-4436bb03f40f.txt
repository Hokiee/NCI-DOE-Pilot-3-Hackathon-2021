CLINICAL HISTORY:
Abdominal/pelvic swelling.

GROSS EXAMINATION: . .
A. "Omental nodule (AF1)f, received fresh for frozen section is a 3.2 x 3 x 1
cm aggregate of tan—white nodular soft tissue fragments, a representative of
section of which is frozen as AFl; frozen section remnant in block A1. An
additional representative section is submitted in block A2.

B. "Omentum", received.fresh and placed in formalin is a 37 x 33.5 x 3.8 cm
aggregate of fibromembranous fatty tissue remarkable for numerous nodules
ranging from 0.4 cm diameter up to a confluence of nodules 14 cm in greatest
dimension. Serial sectioning of the nodules reveals a soft, circumscribed,
white~tan cut surface, with larger nodules demonstrating focal hemorrhage and
softening. Representative sections of smaller nodules are submitted in block
Bl and representative of larger nodules in block B2.

C. "Right tube and ovary", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 208
gram, 9 x 7.5 x 7.3 cm ovary with a 9 cm long, 0.3 cm diameter fallopian tube
adherent to and expanded over the surface. The surface of the ovary is
primarily smooth with focal granular and papillary excrescences comprising
approximately 10% of the surface. There is also a 2 x 2 cm fibrofatty

- adhesion. The ovary is serially sectioned to demonstrate a soft tan-yellow
primary solid cut surface with focal cystic areas (serous and serosanguineous
cysts) the largest of which is 2.1 cm in diameter. Representative sections are
submitted as follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY:

01- surface excrescences.
C2—C4- representative of cut surface cystic and solid components.

CS— fallopian tube.

D. "Left gutter", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 2.4 x 2.1 x 0.9
cm aggregate of pink—tan fatty tissue entirely submitted in-block 01.

E. "Left tube and ovary”, received fresh and placed in formalin is an 87 gram
specimen consisting of a 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm ovary with a corrugated, white—tan
surface and on cut section is soft, homogenous, and.white~tan. The fallopian
tube, 3.2 cm long x 0.6 cm in diameter, is fimbriated, purple—tan, and grossly
unremarkable. Representative sections‘of the left adnexa are submitted in
blocks E1—E2.

F. "Cul de sac nodule", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 2.4 x 1.1 x
1 cm tan-white nodular soft tissue fragment which is serially sectioned, with
representative section in block F1.

G. “Rectal/sigmoid", received fresh and placed in formalin are two lengths of
-bowel (18 cm long x 3 cm diameter, and 6.5 cm long x 2.5 cm diameter} with
attached mesanteric fat. The larger segment of bowel demonstrates a diffusely
adhesed serosa covered by innumerable tumor nodules from 0.5 cm in diameter up
to confluent nodules 6.5 cm in greatest dimension. The larger bowel segment is
opened to demonstrate a lumen focally distorted and narrowed by tumor
compression and focal dusky mucosa. Serial sectioning demonstrates that the
tumor does not arise in the mucosa.

The smaller fragment also demonstrates diffuse serosal adhesions and tumor
nodules. Serial sectioning demonstrates that the tumor does not narrow or

compress the lumen or appear to arise from the mucosa, which is diffusely
dusky but otherwise unremarkable.

Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Gl— mucosal margins, larger specimen.
62- G3- mucosa with respect to adjacent tumor., larger specimen.
84— representative serosal and mesenteric fat nodules, larger specimen.
G5- mucosal margin, smaller specimen.
G6 67— representative serosal and mesenteric fat nodules, smaller specimen.

H. "Right pelvic lymph node", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 3.9 x
3.3 x 1 cm aggregate of pink—yellow soft fatty tiSSue serially sectioned to
'demonstrate a 2.3 x 2.2 x l_cm soft tan—brown hemorrhagic nodule and three
lymph node candidates 0.4 cm in diameter each. A representative section of the
nodule is submitted in block H1 and the remaining three small lymph node
candidates are submitted in block H2.

I. ”Bladder flap mass", received fresh and placed in formalin iS'a 5.4 x 4.5 x
3.9 cm aggregate of brown hemorrhagic tissue serially sectioned_to demonstrate
a soft white to necrotic cut surface with focal hemorrhage, a representative
of which is submitted in block I1.

J. "Left pelvic lymph node", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 1.1 x
1 x 0.8 cm lymph node candidate which is bisected and entirely submitted in

block J1.

K. "Donut", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 6 cm long metal device‘
containing an annular fragment of mucosa and staple line, a representative
section of which is submitted in block K1.

L. “Spleen", receivad fresh and placed in formalin is a 212 gram, 13.6 x 8 x
4.4 cm red-brown spleen remarkable for 2.2 x-l.8 cm subcapsular hematoma and
two areas of torn/ disrupted capsule, the largest of which is 6.4 x 2.5 cm.
Serial sectioning demonstrates a grossly unremarkable parenchyma with no
masses identified. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

sLOCK SUMMARY:

Ll- subcapsular hematoma.
L2— capsule defect.
L3e normal peripheral and central spleen.
