canoes DESCRIPTiNO:
A. Container». is labeled _ Received in formalin, is a 3.0 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm slightly blue-dyed tan lymph node. The specimen is sectioned and
submitted in cassettes A1-A2 labeled

B. Container 3 is labeled .el't breast. Received in formeiin, is a 1.044 gram, 23.0 x 17.5 x 5.0 cm leﬁ simple mastectomy surfaoed on one
aspect by a 20.0 x 1 1.2 an ellipse or (en-white skin with e low-central 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm nipple which exudes no discharge. Surrounding the nipple, there
is a 6,0 cm diameter patch of intense blue-dyed discoloration. The specimen is oriented with a suture at the mid aspect of one long axis indicating
superior. The deep aspect of the specimen has been previously sectioned for collection of tissue for genomlm studies. At the previous incision site. the
cut surfaces give rise to a subareoiar, 1 1.0 x 10.0 x 6.0 cm indurated, well circumscribed, focally cystic and mucinous tumor. The tumor is 3.5 cm from
the nearest deep margin and 3.2 an from the nearest skin resection margin. The remaining breast pamnchyma is 20% ﬁbrous tissue. There are no
lymph nodes near the upper outer quadrant.

Sections are eubmitmd in two can “M '0' n-Win- «indies labeled and - . :epraeemative sections of the remaining tissue
are submitted in cassettes labeled as follows: 51 representative nipple; 32-37 representative tumor, BB—BQ representative uninvolved
upper outer quadrant; 810-31 1 representative of upper inner quadrant: 312-813 representative of lower inner quadrant: 314—315 representative of lower
