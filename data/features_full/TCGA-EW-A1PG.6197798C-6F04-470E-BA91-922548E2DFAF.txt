The keratin stain on the Iyrnph node shows metastatic carcinoma.
The keratin stains on the remaining sentinel lymph nodes ($8.6. F. G, and I) are negative.
Kerstin stains were also performed on all of the axillary content lymph nodes and they are negative.

Me patient has a previous history of inﬁltrating Iobular carcinoma ( ). The tumor cells on that spe men were
are positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors. but were negauve for Her? FISH. Two nodules of inﬂ ting
carcinoma are present. in addition there are multiple focal microscopic nodules of inﬁltrating carcinoma. K ratin stains
are pending on the negative sentinel lymph nodes. In specimen H. the metastasis to the lymph node is 0.4 cm in

greatest dimension.
