GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in three parts.

A. This specimen is received in the fresh state from the operating room for immediate
gross evaluation and consist of an excision of breast tissue which measures 8 x 6 x 4 cm.

A needle is present in the specimen. I have applied ink to the margins as follows: yellow
is superior; blue is deep; black is anterior; red is inferior. Sections reveal a firm, tan
tumor measuring 12 mm located 4 mm from the nearest margin, the anterior margin. A
representative section of the tumor is submitted for tumor banking. Additional sectioning
reveals fibrotic tissue associated with the biopsy site nearer to the anterior margin.
Fibrotic breast tissue is present near the inferior margin, also. Representative sections
are submitted as blocks A1 through A6.

B. This is a portion of adipose tissue which measures 4 x 4 x 2 cm. Two soft, tan and
yellow lymph nodes are present measuring up to 1.5 cm. The following sections are
submitted:

Bl — one lymph node totally submitted
82.3 — one lymph node totally submitted

C. This is a portion of adipose tissue which measures 3 x 3 x 1 cm. Within this are three

suspicious for tumor containing a firm area measuring 3 mm. A second lymph node measures 6

mm and contains a 6 mm area suspicious for metastatic tumor. A third lymph node measures 8
mm and is soft. The following sections are submitted:
