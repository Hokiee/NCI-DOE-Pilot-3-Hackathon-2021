I. "thi-l-l'l‘ :\Xl.l.|..:\R‘t' (‘I'NTEN'I‘S". The sections show in lymph nodes and adjacent adipose tissue.

Tu cl“: of the [ninth nodes are \ nriably replaced by a pleomorphic. mostly spindle cell tumour with focal
epithclinitl areas consistent with metastatic ntclanoma. There are focal large areas of necrosis. Two ot'tlte
nodes (.13 & K) show focal cstrauutlal spread (1.9 x 0.6mm and 1.0 x 0.2mm respectively). Innntttmstains for
3100 and lll\ HHS pcrt‘omncd on block lF show that the tumour cells are positive for both of these ntarkcrs
consistent \tillt ruclanonm.

2. "LIES ION RIGHT RING (Ft'll'lR'I‘I-I) FINGER STITCH PROXIMAL ". The sections show skin and
underlying subcutis with a superﬁcially ulcerated infiltrating carcinoma. It Show focal kcmtinisation and
mtcrccltutar bndgc fonnatiou consistonl with a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. It
extends into the (tennis 1.9mm beneath the surface. The tumour cxtcntls to within less than 0.1mm to
virtually abut the 9 o'clock margin (block D). It is 0.6mm clear of the black inked 6 o'clock margin. 1.2mm
clear of lllv: (lccp margin and 1.9mm cloar of the blue inked [2 o'clock man-gin. No lyntpltovaacular or
pcrinuural invasion by tumour is scen. Fibrosis consistcnt with dermal scarring is present deep to the
tumour. (I‘linicoputhologtcal correlation is suggested.

3. "LBS ION RIGHT TEMP’LE". The sections show skin with a nodular basal coll carcinoma. It shows focal
cystic change and extends to 2.5mm beneath the skin surface. It is 0.7mm clear of the ttcarost poriphcral
margin (black ink 9 o'clock margin) and is 1.5mm clear oflltc dccp margin.
