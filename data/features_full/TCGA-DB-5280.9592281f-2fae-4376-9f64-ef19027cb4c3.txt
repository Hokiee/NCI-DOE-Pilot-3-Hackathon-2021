 

T '1 Diagnosis:
Bram, right frontal lobe, excision: Grade 2 (of 4) oligoastrocytoma, astrocytic predominant (WHO, grade 11). See

comment.

Comment: The presence of areas of high cellularity and the cellular pleomoxphism are worrisome features for early
anaplastic transformation, however, proliferative activity is still low (mitotic index up to 2-3 mitoses per 10 HPF).
No endothelial vascular changes or necrosis are seen.

Immunohistochemical stains were performed on parafﬁn embedded tissue using antibodies to GFAP, p53 and
MEB-l. GFAP is focally positive in tumor cells. p53 protein is positive in tumor cells. MIB-l labeling varies from
low to moderate (up to 46%). The ﬁndings support the above diagnosis.

  
  

FISH studies for 113qu deletion will be performed and reported as an addendum.

ADDENDA:
1p and 19q FISH studies were performed on cells within parafﬁn sections from tumor. Two hybridizations were

performed: one with a 19g prohelcontrol 19p pair and one with a 1p probe/control lq pair. The 19q and 1p probes
mapped to the regions that are commonly deleted in gliomas. The 19q to 19p probe ratio was 0.98. The 1p to lq
probe ratio was 0.98. For both probes, the normal ratio is approximately 1. Any ratio less than 0.80 is consistent
Wm“ deletion of the chromosomal region of interest.

There was no evidence of deletion of 1p 0r l9q. The results are consistent with a tetraploid tumor karyotype or
additional copies of chromosomes 1 and 19. Similar results have been observed in other glioma specimens.

This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by Laboratory Medicine and Pathology,

has not been cleared or approved by the US. Food and Drug Administration, and is to
l sed as an adjunct to existing clinical and pathological information. This test does not rule out other
chromosome anomalies.
