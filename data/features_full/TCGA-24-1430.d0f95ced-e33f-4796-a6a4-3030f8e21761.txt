FSl: Omentum, mass, biopsy
— “Metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with Mullerian origin," by -

— Microscopic Description and Comment: Sections of both ovaries show

extensive involvement with a papillary serous adenocarcinoma with associated psammomatous
microcalcifications. Tumor also involves the fallopian tubes bilaterally. Metastatic tumor
is present diffusely in the omentum and the porta hepatis. Serosal involvement of the
appendix is present with penetration of tumor into the muscular layer of the appendix.
Metastatic tumor in the form of serosal implants is also present in the colon,small
intestine, and urinary bladder. The small intestinal segment shows focal mucosal necrosis,
consistent with ischemic necrosis. No metastatic tumor is identified in five lymph nodes

in the external iliac tissue. However, focal metastatic a illar serous adenocarcinoma is
present within the soft tissue from this region.

History: The patient is a—with omental cake. Mullerian primary vs other.
History of three to four week complaint of pelvic pain. Operative procedure: Examination
under anesthesia, exploratory laparotomy, omentectomy, tumor debulking, appendectomy, small
bowel resection.

Gross Description The specimens are received in nine containers, each labeled with the
patient‘s name. The first container is labeled "omentum." and "F31, X1“. It contains a
white cassette labeled "F31". The cassette contains a 1.5 x 1.5 x 6.2 cm piece of tan,
rubbery soft tissue. Labeled Al. Additionally, within the container is a mass of omental

fat measuring 15 x 11 x 3.5 cm. Much of the omentum has been replaced by multiple firm tumor
masses, which have coalesced into a larger tumor mass measuring 15 x 4 x 2.5 cm. The surface
of several of the masses have a subtle papillary architecture. Two additional sections
labeled A2. Jar 3.

The second container is labeled "R ovary and fallopian tube.“ It contains a 6 x 4 x 3.2

cm mass of tan to red tissue. The external surface of the ovary and the fallopian tube
contains disrupted tissues with fibrinous adhesions, and possible tumor. The anatomy of
both the fallopian tube and the ovary is difficult to identify because of the adhesions and
possible tumors. Multiple tumor masses are identified, which may be in continuity with each
other. One appears to be within or next to the fallopian tube, measuring 1.5 x 0.9 x 1.2
cm. A closely associated nodule appears to be within the paraovarian tissues measuring 1.0

x 1.0 x 1.2 cm. In addition, within the identifiable ovarian parenchyma itself, there is an
area of papillary excrescences, which is exposed to the surface, which may also represent
tumor. Labeled Bl - ovary with exposed tumor and adjacent fallopian tube with tumor, 82 -
section of ovary and paraovarian tumor; B3 — section of fallopian tube without gross tumor,
and second section of ovary with possible tumor; B4 — additional section of tumor possibly
within fallopian tube, and adjacent ovary with possible tumor. Jar 1.

The third container is labeled "large bowel nodule and serosal implant." It contains
multiple pieces of tissue measuring, in aggregate, 2.0 x 2.0 x 0.1 cm. The largest piece
appears to have fat, with a small, 0.6 cm in greatest dimension, firm, white, subserosal
nodule. There is a smaller piece of tissue also present containing tissue suspicious

for tumor. No orientation of the smaller specimens is possible. Labeled Cl — section of
subserosal nodule, and sections of firm tissue suspicious for tumor. Jar l.

The fourth container is labeled "L ovary." It contains three pieces of irregularly-shaped
tissue, which is not grossly identifiable as tube or ovary. The largest piece is 4.5 x
3.0 x 1.5 cm, and has firm, pink—tan tissue, grossly suspicious for tumor. A small amount
of adipose tissue is present on the specimen, as well. The surfaces are regular, with
a papillary gross appearance. One of the smaller pieces contains tissue which possible
represents residual ovary. No fallopian tube is identified. Labeled D1, DZ — sections of
tumor; D3
— possible residual ovary. Jar 1.

The fifth container is labeled “appendix." It contains a 5 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm vermiform
appendix, with a dark red, tan surface suspicious for tumor. Serial cuts through the
appendix reveal an intact appendiceal lumen, with a mass of firm, gray—tan tumor in the
adventitia, and focally involving the muscularis of the appendix. Labeled E1 — tumor in
adventitia and muscle: E2 - normalwappearing appendix. Jar 1.

The sixth container is labeled ”small bowel." It contains an 18 cm in length x 2.0

cm in diameter segment of bowel. The serosa of the bowel is dark brown, and possibly
ischemio appearing. The bowel is opened to show green-to—brown mucosa, with an area of
possible ischemia measuring approximately 7 cm in length, 6 cm from one of the stapled
ends. In addition, there is an area of constriction. Within the mesentery, several areas
are suspicious for involvement by tumor, with the largest measuring 1.0 cm in greatest
dimension. Labeled F1 — one staple margin; F2 — other staple margin; F3 — two sections from
possible ischemic region; F4 - possible tumor implants. Jar 3.

The seventh container is labeled “porta hepatis mass." It contains several fragments of
tissue, the largest representing a tumor mass measuring 3.6 x 2.5 x 1.7 cm. The tissue

consists entirely of tan, slightly papillary tissue, with an occasional cyst on the surface.

On cut section, a solid, tan—white tumor mass is present, with central necrosis. Two
sections labeled G1. The remaining pieces of tissue have a similar appearance to the larger
piece of tissue. Jar 1.

The eighth container is labeled "R external iliac in." It contains a 5.0 x 4.0 x 1.0 cm
aggregate of fat, and five possible lymph nodes. The largest lymph node measures 3.5 x 1.0
x 1.0 cm. Upon sectioning, this lymph node has multiple small lumens, and may represent a
large, fibrovascular cord. Labeled H1 — five lymph nodes; H2 - larger fibrovascular cord in
multiple sections. Jar 1.

The ninth container is labeled "vesicle wall mass." It contains a 2.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm piece
of tanmtporown tissue, with an identifiable serosal surface. Within the specimen there is
a firm, white nodule measuring 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is sectioned, and
labeled 11. Jar 0.
