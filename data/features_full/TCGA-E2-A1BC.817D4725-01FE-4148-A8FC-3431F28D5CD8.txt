GROSS DESCRIPTION:

“‘4“

4

Received fresh are three tan pink lymph nodes all 1cm in greatest dimension. Three touch preps are

taken.

A1: one lymph node

A2: one lymph node

A3: one lymph node

B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 RIGHT BREAST

Received fresh is a tan pink lymph node 2 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is sectioned. A touch prep is

taken. Toto B1.
C. RIgl-lT BREAST

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "right breast" is a 110 g, 13 x 10
x 3.5 cm, oriented (suture in axilla). mastectomy with pink-tan 10.5 x 5.4 cm skin ellipse with 3.2 cm
linear scar and everted 0.8 cm diameter nipple. lnk code: Posterior-black, anterior/superior-blue,
anterior/inferior-orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 9 slices revealing
a hemorrhagic ﬁrm biopsy cavity, 2.5 x 2 x 1.6 cm (slices 5-6) at 12:00, 0.1 cm from the deep margin
and 0.2 cm from anterior (superior). Located adjacent and superior to the biopsy cavity (12:00, slices 5-
6) is an 1.7 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm ill-deﬁned firm lesion that is 0.1 cm from the anterior margin and 0.3 cm from
the deep margin. Tissue is procured. Representatively submitted:

Received fresh are two tan pink lymph nodes 1.2cm and 0.4cm in greatest dimension. Two touch preps

are taken.

F. LEFT BREAST

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "left breast" is a 969. 15 x 11 x 2cm oriented
(stitch in axilla) simple mastectomy with attached 11 x 4cm tan pink skin ellipse and 0.6cm everted
nipple. The skin surface is remarkable for a well healed subareolar scar 1.80m, 20m inferior to the

TS

nipple in the LIQ-LC. lnk code: anterior-superior: blue, anterior-inferior: orange, posterior-black. The
specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 9 slices with nipple in slice 4, revealing a 1.6 x
1.1 x 1cm tan white ﬁrm ill deﬁned mass, 0.3cm from the anterior-inferior margin and 0.50m from the
deep margin corresponding to the scar on the skin surface in the LC of slice 4. Representatively
submitted:

F1: nipple slice 4
