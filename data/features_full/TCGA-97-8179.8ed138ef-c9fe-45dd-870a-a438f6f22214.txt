CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
- ex-smoker (60 pack-years) with a 1.3 cm RUL solid nodule and
multiple bilateral ground-glass nodules.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in seven parts, each labeled with the
patient's name.

1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'right upper lobe nodule'.

It consists of a pre-cut wedge biopsy of the lung measuring 7.5 x 2
x 1.6 cm. The staple line measures 7.8 cm, and is shaved. The
parenchyma around it is inked in black. Also noted, is a second
piece of tissue, which contains part of the nodule, measuring 1 x 1
x 0.3 cm. At the pre-cut opened area, there is a grey-pink nodule
measuring 1 x 0.9 cm. This mass is located 0.4 cm from the staple
line margin. Frozen section is performed on the nodule and
re-submitted for permanent section. Representative sections are
submitted.

2. Part two is received fresh, labeled 'deeper margin posterior
segment right upper lobe'. It consists of a pre cut wedge biopsy of
the lung, measuring 8.5 x 4 x 3 cm. The staple line measures 9 cm
which is shaved and the parenchyma around the staple line is inked
in black. At the pre cut area the pleura is gray pink thickened and
with a bleb. Beneath the thickened pleura the parenchyma is dark red
firm and no nodule is grossly identified. Representative sections

are submitted.

3. Part three is received in saline, labeled 'station #11, lymph

node'. It consists of four pieces of tan brown soft tissue, ranging

MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY
KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS

Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: Wild type gene.

INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of
the KRAS gene.

COMMENT:

Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor
prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS
mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly
associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.

This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of

the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for
use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh,
frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In particular
the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal
cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these
mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor
KRAS mutations (e. g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,
etc.).

Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide
additional information regarding this patient's probability of
response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if

clinically indicated. See references.

METHOD/LIMITATION:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

EGFR Mutation Analysis

Referring Physician: —

Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma
RESULTS: No mutation detected.

INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified in the sample provided
for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma

patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be

responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.

COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is optimal
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 30% tumor
cellularity upon pathologist review.

A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was
identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
significance.

Mutations in the tyrosine domain of the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with differential
responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (T KI)
therapies. The objective response rate among patients with a
sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.

This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell

lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change
during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this
result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation

in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.

This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.

METHOD/LIMITATION:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

 

DISCLAIMER:

The test was develo ed and its erformance characteristics

re lated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of
(CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical

testing. This particular test is not considered a stand alone test

and should be used only in the context of other diagnostic tests or

clinical work-up related to treatment decisions.

Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH)

S ecimen

 
  
 

MD
Body Site: Right upper lobe of lung
Specimen Type: Slides

Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma

INTERPRETATION:
Negative for a rearrangement involving the ALK gene.

Probe #Nuclei Examined % Positive Nuclei %
Control values

2p23(ALK) 100 0 <15.0

A total of 100 cells were scored.

FINDINGS:
FISH was performed on paraffin embedded tissue sections usin the
V sis ALK Break A art Probe for the ALK gene at 2p23

When a rearrangement involving ALK is
present, either inversion or translocation, one of the two fusion
signals separates as one red and one green signal. In this
specimen, separated signals were present in 0% of the nuclei scored.
This result is within the normal limits.

COMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were observed in 59.0% of
cells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals

represents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosome
2/2p ALK region. Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in

NSCLCs, although the significance of extra co ies of the ALK ene in
luni carcinoma is unclear at this timehg

 

ISCN RESULTS: nuc ish(ALKX3 4)[59/ 100]

The Vysis ALK Break Apart Probe FISH test— is FDA
approved for use in the detection of rearrangements involving the

ALK gene Via ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) tissue specimens.
