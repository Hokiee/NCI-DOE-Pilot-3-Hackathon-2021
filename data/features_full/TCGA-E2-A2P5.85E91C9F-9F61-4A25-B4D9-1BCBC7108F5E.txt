DIAGNOSIS:
A. BREAST, RIGHT, NEEDLE LOCALIZATION EXCISIONAL BIOPSY:
- DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), CRIBRIFORM TYPE, NUCLEAR
GRADE 2, WITH NECROSIS AND MICROCALCIFICATIONS.
- DCIS IS PRESENT AT THE MEDIAL MARGIN, IS WITHIN 0.1 CM
OF THE POSTERIOR AND SUPERIOR MARGINS, AND IS WITHIN
0.2 CM OF THE ANTERIOR MARGIN.
- ATYPICAL INTRADUCTAL PAPILLOMAS, 0.1 CM FROM THE MEDIAL
MARGIN.
- COMPLEX SCLEROSING LESION WITH EXTENSIVE LOBULAR CARCINOMA
IN SITU (LCIS), INTRADUCTAL PAPILLOMAS, SCLEROSING ADENOSIS,
APOCRINE METAPLASIA, AND MICROCALCIFICATIONS.

NOTE: DCIS is present in 3 of 10 slides. On a single slide, DCIS measures 0.8 cm. Immunostains were
performed with appropriate positive and negative controls. SMMHC, p63, and calponin are positive,
showing no evidence of invasive carcinoma.

B. BREAST, LEFT, AND AXILLARY CONTENTS, MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY:
- INVASIVE LOBULAR CARCINOMA, NOTTINGHAM GRADE 3.
- 3.3 CM IN SIZE.
- EXTENSIVELY INVOLVES THE NIPPLE DERMIS.
- LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU (LCIS), PLEOMORPHIC TYPE, WITH
FOCAL NECROSIS.
- MARGINS, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.
- ATYPICAL DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA.
- METASTATIC CARCINOMA IN 20 OF 24 LYMPH NODES WITH
EXTRANODAL EXTENSION, LARGEST METASTASIS IS 2.4 CM (20/24).

C. ADDITIONAL AXILLARY TISSUE, LEFT, EXCISION:
- METASTATIC CARCINOMA IN ONE LYMPH NODE AND TUMOR
IN FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE (1/1).

NOTE: There is a 0.4 cm focus of invasive carcinoma in the ﬁbroadipose tissue with no deﬁnite lymph
node adjacent to the focus and no breast parenchyma present. This focus is best interpreted as
extranodal extension.

SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS
Specimens Involved
Specimens: A: EXCISION RIGHT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION

Specimen: Surgical Excision
Block Number: A2

 

ER: Positive AIIred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3
PR: Positive AIIred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3

 

COMMENT:

The AIIred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the
proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of
cells staining. 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak
intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring
range from 0 to 8.

ER/PR positive is deﬁned as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is deﬁned as an AIIred score
of less than or equal to 2.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
lmmunohistochemistry was performed usind the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR
136, 1:100) provided by )following the manufacturer s instructions. This
assay was not modiﬁed. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published
results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal
review of staining performance.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. EXCISION RIGHT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "right breast needle localization" is an
oriented (short stitch-superior, long stitch-lateral, double stitch-deep), 35 g, 5.5 x 5.5 x 2.5 cm needle
localized lumpectomy with radiographs. Ink code: Anterior-yellow, posterior-black, medial—green, lateral~
red, superior-blue, inferior-orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 7 slices
revealing a 1.7 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm gritty, lobulated white tumor that is closest to the anterior margin at 0.1
cm. A clip Is identiﬁed in slice 2. No additional lesions are noted. Representatively submitted:
