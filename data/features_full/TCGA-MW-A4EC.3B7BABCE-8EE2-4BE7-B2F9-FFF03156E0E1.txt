AJCC Classification (7th edition): At least pTla, pNX, pMn/a. See note.

Comment:

Tumor fecally involves the inked capsular resection margin; because perinephric adipose
tissue is not present in this area, the AJCC Classification is best considered to be at
least pTla.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh and labeled "Right renal tumor margin" is a tan soft tissue with fat
attached and two small additional fragments of fat, 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm in aggregate.
Submitted in toto in one cassette.

B. Received in formalin and labeled "Right renal tumor" is a partial nephrectomy specimen
with fat attached. The renal resection margin is inked black. The tumor capsule and
perirenal fat are inked yellow. The specimen measures 3.2 x 3.0 x 2.9 cm. There is
attached perirenal fat, 3.2 x 1.5 cm. Upon sectioning, there is a golden~yellow,
pigmented tumor, 2. 5 x 2. 4 x 1 8 am. There are a few areas of hemorrhage groesly
identified There is also one cyst identified, 1. 0 cm in greatest dimension. Grossly,
the tumor appears to have a capsule that goes through the renal Capsule. The tumbr' m
does not appear to invade the perirenal fat. The tumor appears to be 1.0 cm from the
renal margin. Upon further sectioning, multiple small cysts are noted: some of which
are filled with clear, mucus—type material. The largest cyst is 1.0 cm in greatest
dimension. Representative sections are submitted in eight cassettes.
