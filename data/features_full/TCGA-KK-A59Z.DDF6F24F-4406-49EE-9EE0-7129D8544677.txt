ADDENDUM

This modified report is being issued to provide additional information/results.

DIAGNOSIS

(B) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 7 (4+3). (SEE COMMENT)
TUMOR CONFINED TO THE PROSTATE.
MARGINS OF RESECTION FREE OF TUMOR.
PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH-GRADE.
Right and left seminal vesicles, no tumor present.
Segments of right and left vasa deferentia. no tumor present.

COMMENT?

The prostate gland contains two foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma. Both tumor foci are located in the peripheral zone. The
dominant tumor focus is located in the left anterolateral, left lateral, left posterolateral, left posterior. mid posterior and right
posterior peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 2.0 x 1.5 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the
three cross sections of the prostate. extensively in the apex and focally in the base region. The second tumor focus is located in
the right lateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 0.2 x less than 0.1 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it
is present in one cross section. Both tumor foci are conﬁned to the prostate. The margins of resection are free of tumor.

j GROSS? DESCRI PTION

(B) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES —— A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles. and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (3.6 x 4.0 x 5.1 cm, 35 grams, post fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along left
posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the right side. A nodule is palpated on the left base
region. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate a firm area consistent with tumor in the left peripheral zone of the three
cross sections of the prostate.

The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

_ SECTION CODE: B1, B2, base of right seminal vesicle and right vas deferens; BS, B4. base of left seminal vesicle and
left vas deferens; BS, prostatic base, right border; BG-B8, prostatic base. right posterior border; 89-316. prostatic base, central
portion; B17, prostatic base, left border; 318—820, prostatic base, left posterior border; B21, B22, apex anterior; B23. BZ4,apex left;

radiograph; 831-842, sections of the three cross sections of the prostate according to the specimen radiograph.
The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green. left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in
black. Orange ink (BB3, 34, 37, 38 and 42) denotes surfaces that do not represent the true margin of resection.
