1. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right hemicolectomy" and
consists of a segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and
ascending colon. The terminal ileum measures 9.0 cm in length and 4.5 cm in
circumEerence at the proximal resected margin. The remaining colon measures
13.5 cm in length with a circumference of 8.3 cm at the distal resected
margin. The attached appendix measures 6.0 cm in length and averages 0.5 cm
in diameter. The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth.
Focally hemorrhagic lohulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of
the specimen measuring up to 4.0 cm in thickness. The specimen is opened to
reveal a mass lesion in the cecum, 0.5 cm distal to the ileocecal valve.
measuring 4.5 cm in length and 4.0 cm in width. Sectioning show that the
tumor invades into the muscle wall. The depth of invasion is 0.5 cm grossly.
The remaining mucosa is unremarkable. The specimen is submitted for lymph
node dissection. Multiple lymph nodes are identified in the attached adipose
tissue and are submitted. Representative sections of the specimen are
submitted for permanent sections and for THE.
