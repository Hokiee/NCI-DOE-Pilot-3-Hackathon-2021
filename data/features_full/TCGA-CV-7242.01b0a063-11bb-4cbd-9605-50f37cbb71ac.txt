COMMENT

(A) The balance of right transglotic region with subjacent cartilage and bone is pending decalciﬁcation (A5-A9). The
results will be reported in a separate addendum.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) TOTAL LARYNGECTOMY, BILATERAL NECK DISSECTIONS, LEVEL II, III AND IV AND RIGHT
HEMlTHYROIDECTOMY - A total laryngectomy specimen (7.8 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm) with attached soft tissue and muscle (8.0 x 6.0
x 1.2 cm and right thyroid (3.0 x 3.0 x 2.1 cm). There is a polypoid mass in the right transglottic region measuring 2.2 x 1.9 cm
and 1.6 cm in depth. The tumor has homogeneous yellow-tan cut surface with no grossly hemorrhage or necrosis. The mass
abuts the thyroid cartilage and it is 3.0 cm to the tracheal cartilage resection margin. The left transglottic mucosa is grossly
uninvolved by the mass. Sectioning of the right thyroid reveals spongy, brownish mucosa with no lesion grossly seen.
Multiple lymph nodes identiﬁed in the neck resection soft tissue and are entirely submitted.

Normal and tumor are submitted for Tumor Bank.
