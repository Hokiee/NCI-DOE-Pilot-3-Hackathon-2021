COMMENT:
Per conversation with “ (General Surgery) the sigmoid colon resection was
palliative. Thorough gross and microscopic evaluation discloses only one benign

pericolorectal (regional) lymph node (0/1).

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

1) Received in formalin, labeled with the patient‘s name and ”sigmoid colon (tattoo near
distal margin), is a 14.0 cm segment of sigmoid colon (measuring 3.5 cm in proximal
circumference, 3.5 cm in mid and 4.5 cm in distal circumference): Attached to the
colon is yellow-gold segment of mesocolon (5.5 cm in length and 1.9 cm in thickness}.
Upon opening the colon, there is a pink—tan, centrally ulcerated tumor with serpentine
borders (3.1 x 2.1 x 0.5 cm) that involves approximately 30% of the circumference.

The tumor is 2.5 cm from the distal margin and 9.7 cm from the proximal resection
margin. The remaining mucosal surface is pink«tan and grossly unremarkable. One
poseible diverticulum is identified in the mid portion of the bowel segment (0.9 x 0.4
cm). No polyps, ulcerations or perforations are identified. Thorough search for
possible lymph nodes reveals no nodes grossly suspicious for metastatic tumor.
Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows:

CASSETTE SUMMARY:

Cassette 1A: Distal resection margin, en face.

Caesette lB: Proximal resection margin, on face.

Received fresh. labeled with the patient's name and "uterus. bilateral tubes and
ovaries", is a lozwgram radical hysterectomy specimen including an unopened uterus _
(6.5 x 4.5 x 4.5 cm), with attached cervix and vaginal cuff (1.2 cm in length), right
fallopian tube (4.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter), right ovary (2.1 x 0.9 x 0.6
cm), left fallopian tube (4.3 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter), and left ovary
(2.2 x 1.6 x 0.6 cm). There is a white~tan, firm mass (1.5 x 0.9 x 0.9 cm) located on
the anterior surface of the exocervix (3.0 x 2.5 cm) that grossly extends to the
posterior cervix. The mass appears to invade to a depth of 0.7 cm and is grossly 1.2
cm from the vaginal cufﬁ margin. The external 03 is slightly distorted by the mass
and measures 0.3 cm in diameter. The endooervical canal (2.9 cm in length) has a tan
herringbone mucosa. The endometrial cavity (4.5 cm from cornu to cornu, 4.5 cm in
length has a tan~pink hemorrhagic endometrium (0.2 cm in average thickness). The
myometrium measures 1.1 cm in maximum thickness. The serosa is glistening and no
adhesions are identified. The fallopian tubes are patent and have ﬁimhriated ends.
The right and left ovaries each have smooth white outer surfaces and multiple corpora
albieantia on cut surface. The right and left parametrial soft tissue is pale pink to
yellow~tan, lobulated and grossly unremarkable. The anterior surface of the uterus is
inked blue, the posterior surface black. Representative sections of the specimen are
submitted as follows:
