Gross Description :

1) The specimen is received fresh. labeled 'Right breast. Stitch marks
axillary tail". It consists of: a breast measuring 18 x 17 x 5 cm overlaid
by white~tan skin, measuring 10 x 4.5 an. There is a centrally placed.
slightly inverted nipple, measuring 1.2 an in diameter, su:rounded by an
unremarkable areola, measuring 4 cm in diameter. Cross—sectioning of the
specimen reveals dense fibroid tissue in the central portion of the
specimen, but no discrete mass is identified. Representative sections are
taken.

2) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Left breast and axillary
contents, levels .1 and 2 (2 specimen tags attached) ". t consists of a
breast measuring 16 x 16 x 5.5 cm, with an axillary tail measuring 10 x 7 x
1.6 cm. The axillary tail has 2 tags designating levels 1 and. 2. The
Specimen is overlaid by white-tan, unremarkable skin, measuring 10.5 x 1.3
cm. The is a centrally placed, averted nipple, measuring 1.0 cm in
diameter, surrounded by unremarkable areola, measuring s cm in diameter.

Tl is surrounded by dense fibrous tissue. Approximately 5 cm lateral and 3
cm anterior to T1 is a mass measuring 1.0 cm in diameter and approximately 4

T2, has a central cavity filled with necrotic material grossly. The
remainder of the breast tissue consists of unremarkable fibroadipose tissue.
Examination or the axillary tail show several lymph nodes at level 1,
ranging from 0.5 cm to 2.0 cm and at level 2 ranging from 0.5 cm to 2.5 cm.
The smaller lymph nodes are submitted in toto. The largest lymph nodes are
bisected, alternatively inked and submitted entirely.

measuring 4 x 3 x 0.5 cm. Cross—sectioning of the specimen reveals grossly
