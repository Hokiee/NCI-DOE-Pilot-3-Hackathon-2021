Surgical Pathology

DIAGNOSIS:

A. Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and

bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy: Microscopic foci
(ranging in size

from 2.0 to 3.0 mm in greatest dimension) of superficially
invasive

FIGO grade I (of III) endometrial adengcarcinoma,
endometrioid type,
M arisin§~Tﬁ_a background of complex atypical hyperplasia
forming a

polypoid mass (5.0 x 3.8 x 1.5 cm) circumferentially
involving the

endometrium. The tumor invades superficially (0.1 to 0.2
cm) into

the myometrium (total wall thickness, 1.6 cm). The tumor
does not

involve the endocervix. Lymphovascular space invasion is
not

identified. The ovaries show bilateral corpus luteal

 

cysts

(right--1.7 cm in greatest dimension; left——l.3 cm in
greatest

dimension). The bilateral fallopian tubes are not
identified.

B. Soft tissue, umbilical region, herniorrhaphy: Hernia
sac with

chronic inflammation and two benign reactive lymph nodes
with

dermatopathic changes.

This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic

examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of
