DIAGNOSIS

#1. SOFI' TISSUE RESECTION, RIGHT CALF: UNDIFFERENTIATED PLEOMORPHIC SARCOMA (SEE
COMMENT).

Tumor type (WHO): Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (so called “MFH“); see comment
Tumor size: 18.8 cm
Tumor depth: Deep soft tissue tumor
Histologic grade (FNCLCC): lll
Type: 3 points (pleomorphic sarcoma)
Necrosis: 1 point (<50% necrosis)
Mitoses: 3 points (24 per 10 HPF: range from 16/1 OHPF to 24/1 OHPF)
Margins: Negative

Tumor at <O.5mm from lateral and posterior margins; ~1 mm proximal margin: all
remaining margins more widely negative

Ancillary studies: Negative MDM2 (on prior incisionai specimen
Negative desmin, caldesmon, myogenin & 5100 (this specimen)
Lymphovascular Invasion: None observed
Lymph nodes: None dissected
Treatment Effect: N/A
AJCC stage: Stage III (assuming “cMO” status)
pTNM status pT2b, pNx (with regional neural invasion, specimen #2; see comment)

#2. RIGHT TIBIAL NERVE NODULE, EXCISION: PLEOMORPHIC SARCOMA INVOLVING SEGMENT OF
PERIPHERAL NERVE (SEE COMMENT).

COMMENT ($41; $3 (’aﬂéuosﬁ (245i 2. 9); ”371,4

Although more than 90% of the tumor is undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (pleomorphic “MFH”) other portions of the tumor
resemble low grade myxofibrosarcoma (low-grade "MFH"). Still other ioci resemble pleomorphic liposarcoma with multivacuoiated
giant cells (suggesting the possibility of lipobiastic differentiation). 8100 immunostains however are negative in these vacuolated
pleomorphic giant cells (and are also negative in the spindle cell component).

With regard to the right tibial nerve nodule this constitutes regional neural/perineural invasion of the primary tumor (which does not
factor into assigning primary tumor staging). This does not constitute evidence of distant metastases.

Tissue(s) Submitted:
1: RIGHT CALF MASS
2: TIBIAL RIGHT NERVE NODULE

Gross Description:

Specimen #1 is received fresh and subsequently placed in formalin labeled right calf mass and consists of a 1,018 gram, 22.0 cm
proximal to distal by 11.5 cm lateral to medial by 7.3 cm superficial to deep resection. There is a 4.7 x 1.7 cm ellipse of tan skin
present on the superficial aspect of the specimen. The specimen is differentially inked proximal blue, distal green, lateral yellow,
medial red, superficial orange and deep black and serially sectioned from proximal to distal. There is an 18.8 x 9.9 x 8.6 cm tan
white focally necrotic mass identified which focally abuts the lateral and deep fascia coming to within less than 0.1 cm of the

proximal fascia. One representative section is submitted for TCGA study Gross photographs are taken. Representative sections
are submitted labeled:

1A-1B: mass to proximal margin
16-1 E: mass to lateral margin
1F-1 K: mass to deep margin

1L: mass to superficial (orange)

1M: mass to medial

1N-1 R: central sections

13: representative skin

1T—1 U: additional mass to deep margin

1V: representative distal margin (green)

Specimen #2 is received in formalin labeled tibial right nerve nodule and consists of two fragments of ten soft rubbery tissue
measuring 2.6 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm and 1.6 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm, respectively, which are submitted in toto labeled 2A.
