ast; left, wide local excision and simple mastectomy: Inﬁltratinggiictal carcinpma, Nottingham grade III (of III), [tubules 3/3,

 

nuclei 2/3, mitoses 3/3; Nottingham score 8/9], forming a 2.4 x 2.0 x 1.6“¢1ﬁ“ih'éiss (in the wide local excision specimen)
[AJCCpT2]. Extensive ductal carcinoma in-situ, high nuclear grade, present within (> 25%) and outside the invasive component
involving an area measuring at least 3.8 x 2.2 x 2.0 cm. Angiolymphatic invasion is absent. The non-neoplastic breast
parenchyma shows proliferative ﬁbrocytic changes and multiple small intraductal papillomas. Biopsy site changes present.
Multiple margins on the wide local excision specimen, including the separately submitted inferior margin, are positive for tumor.
There is residual in-situ carcinoma in the mastectomy specimen adjacent to the biopsy cavity which is located in the outer
quadrant. The tumor does not involve the nipple, overlying skin, or underlying chest wall. All surgical margins, mastectomy, are
negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 1.7 cm, deep margin).

Lymph nodes, left axillary sentinel, excision: Multiple (3) left axillary sentinel lwnph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma
[AJCC pNO (i-) (sn)]. Blue dye is identiﬁed in left axillary sentinel lymph nodes No. l and No. 2. Blue dye is not identiﬁed in
left axillary sentinel lymph node No. 3.

Lymph node, leﬁ axillary non-sentinel, excision: A single left axillary non-sentinel lymph node (adjacent to left axillary sentinel
lymph node No. l) is negative for metastatic carcinoma.

Estrogen and progesterone receptor analysis and Her-Z/NEU have been ordered on paraffin-embedded tissue.
