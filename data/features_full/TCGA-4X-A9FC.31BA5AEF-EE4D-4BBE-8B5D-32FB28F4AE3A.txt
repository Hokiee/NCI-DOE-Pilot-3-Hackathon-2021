1) THYMUS, EXCISION: 94/) (19/24/19

- THYMOMA, TYPE AB (SEE NOTE)
— RESECTION MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE
- THREE LYMPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (0/3)

2) SOFT TISSUE, "AP WINDOW", EXCISION:

- BENIGN THYMIC AND FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE
- NO NEOPLASM IDENTIFIED

NOTE: CDla, CD3, and CK19 immunostains were performed to better highlight
the component of this tumor. This is a heterogenous neoplasm with areas
showing predominantly spindled epithelial cells (type A areas). However,
the majority of the tumor is lymphocyte rich, and CDla staining confirms
that the vast majority of the lymphocytes are immature. These areas are
most consistent with a type 82 thymoma. Taken together, this is a type AB
thymoma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

1) Received fresh for frozen section, labeled with the patient's name and
"thymus" is 104 gm, 21 x 7 x 3 cm tan—red soft tissue with a well
circumscribed hard nodule measuring 5.5 x 4.5 x 3 cm. Serial sectioning
reveals homogenous tan cut surface in the nodule without evidence of
hemorrhage or softening. There is a suture indicating pericardial surface
which is inked blue and the opposite surface is inked yellow. One
representative section is submitted in one block. Frozen section remains are
submitted in cassette #1 labeled FSC. Additional representative sections of
the nodule is submitted in cassettes #2—6. Tumor to neighboring lobulated
fatty tissue is submitted in cassette #7 and flanking fatty tissue is
submitted in cassette #8. The tumor sections represent approximately 35% of
the entire nodule.

2) Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name and "AP window tissue" is
a 1.5 x 1 x 0.4 cm fibroadipose tissue which is inked black, bisected and
entirely submitted in one cassette.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS

1) "Thymoma: No margin involvement at the suture" (1 block)

This tumor is grossly well circumscribed. However, microscopically there is
invasion of the tumor into and focally through the capsule. Foci of
possible vascular involvement are also identified. These features
correspond to a Masaoka stage II lesion.
