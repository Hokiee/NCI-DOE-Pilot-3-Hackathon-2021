Gross Description
The specimens are received in 11 formalin—filled containers, each labeled "

:“ The first container is labeled "omentum, FSl/X" and holds a white
cassette labeled "FSl" that holds a piece of tan—brown soft tissue measuring 0.3
x 2 x 2.2 cm. It also contains a piece of fatty tissue measuring 1.5 X 4 X 8
cm. It has been sectioned previously to show a hard, tan—brown, diffusely
infiltrating tumor measuring 1.3 x 3.9 x 6.8 cm. Labeled Al - FSl; A2 —
additional sections from the tumor. Jar l.

The second container is labeled "pelvic mass“ and holds a cystic mass weighing
471 grams and measuring 14.5 x 12 x 12 cm. The surface is irregular and focally
covered by necrotic areas. On sectioning, the mass is multicystic, lined by
papillary, fungating projections that range in size from 0.2 to 2 cm in
diameter. The cysts are filled with serous fluid. There is a solid white
homogeneous area within the tumor wall, measuring 3 x 4 cm in diameter. Labeled
Bl—BB. Jar 3.

The third container is labeled "mesentery" and holds two pieces of tan—brown
soft tissue measuring, in aggregate, 1 x 4.5 x 7.8 cm. The mesentery appears to
be diffusely involved by a tan—brown tumor that measures 1 X 4 x 5 cm. On
sectioning, the tumor is gray—white, homogeneous, with no necrotic areas.
Labeled C. Jar l.

The fourth container is labeled "large bowel lesion" and holds multiple pieces
of tan—brown soft tissue measuring, in aggregate, 0.4 x 0.4 X 1.3 cm. Labeled
D. Jar 0.

The fifth container is labeled "omentum" and holds a piece of fatty tissue
grossly consistent with omentum, measuring 0.9 x 1.5 x 14.5 cm. No tumor is
grossly identified. Metallic staples are removed. Labeled El—ES. Jar l.

The sixth container is labeled "falciform ligament" and holds two pieces of
tan—brown soft tissue measuring 0.9 x 1.5 X 4 cm. There is a gray—white,
irregular area suspicious for metastasis, measuring 0.9 x 1.5 X 2.5 cm. Labeled
F. Jar l.

The seventh container is labeled "right hemidiaphragm peritoneum" and holds a
piece of tan—brown soft tissue measuring 0.3 x 8 X 9.5 cm. It is diffusely
infiltrated by lesions suspicious for metastasis, measuring 1.0 to 0.4 cm in
diameter. Labeled G. Jar l.

The eighth container is labeled “liver nodule" and holds a piece of tan-brown
soft tissue measuring 0.3 x 0.5 x 1.5 cm. Labeled H. Jar O.

The ninth container is labeled "uterus, cervix, left tube and right tube and
ovaries.“ It holds a uterus with cervix and adnexae that weigh 113 grams. The
uterus is severely distorted by the presence of surface adhesions and
intramyometrial leiomyomata. The uterus measures 4.5 cm in width, 1.7 cm from
anterior to posterior, and 8 cm from fundus to lower uterine segment. The
cervix measures 0.9 cm in length and 2.5 cm in diameter. The cervix is covered
by gray—white, unremarkable mucosa. The anterior and posterior uterine surface
has adhesions and areas suspicious for tumor implants. These areas are mainly
located at the right anterior uterine surface and fundus. They measure 2 x 1.5
cm in aggregate. The uterus is bivalved to show a distorted endometrial cavity
covered by unremarkable endometrium, with an average thickness of 2 mm. No
endometrial lesions are grossly identified. Multiple intramyometrial and
subserosal leiomyomas are identified, ranging in size from 0.3 to 1.5 x 2.7 x 3
cm. The leiomyomas are gray~white, with a whorled appearance. No areas of
necrosis or hemorrhage are identified. The average myometrial thickness is 1.3
cm. The right fallopian tube measures 4.5 cm in length and 1 cm in average
diameter. The surface is remarkable for the presence of adhesions. The right
ovary is gray—white and measures 0.9 x 2 x 2.5 cm. On sectioning, the stroma is
tan—brown and unremarkable. The left fallopian tube is not grossly identified.
There is an area, tan—brown, adhered to the uterine fundus, that may represent
the left ovary. This area is covered by hemorrhage and measures 1.5 X 2 X 2.5
cm. Labeled I1 — anterior cervix; 12 ~ posterior cervix; I3 — anterior
endometrium; I4 — posterior endometrium; I5, 16 — leiomyomata; I7 — serosa with
possible implants; I8 — right fallopian tube; I9 — right ovary; I10 — putative
left ovary. Jar 4.

The tenth container is labeled ”rectosigmoid colon" and holds a piece of large
intestine measuring 15 cm in length and 4.5 cm in average circumference. The

specimen is unoriented and is closed on one of the ends by a staple line
measuring 4.5 cm. Attached to the specimen is pericolic fat that is irregular
and appears to be diffusely infiltrated by tumor. The pericolic fat measures 14
cm in length and 3 cm in width. The areas suspicious for involvement by tumor
measures ~9 x 5 cm.in aggregate. The tumor appears to involve the mesenteric
fat only, without involvement of the colonic wall. The colon mucosa is
tan—brown, folded, with no mucosal lesions. Labeled J1 — large intestine .
margins; J2, J3 - tumor; J4 — unremarkable colon. Jar 4.

The eleventh container is labeled "donut ring bowel" and holds two unoriented
pieces of bowel grossly consistent with donut. The mucosa is tan~brown and
unremarkable. No lesions are identified. Labeled Kl. Jar l.

SYNOPTIC REPORTING FORM FOR MALIGNANT OVARIAN NEOPLASMS

HISTOPATHOLOGIC TYPE
The histologic diagnosis is serous adenocarcinoma

TUMOR LOCATION
The location of the primary tumor is the left ovary only

HISTOLOGIC GRADE
The histologic grade is poorly differentiated (G3)

TUMOR INVASION
Tumor is identified on the ovarian surface(s)
Tumor does invade the adjacent fallopian tube/peritubal soft tissue

TUMOR INVOLVEMENT

Tumor involvement of the pelvic peritoneum/soft tissue is present
Metastatic involvement of the extrapelvic peritoneum is present
Metastatic involvement of the omentum is present

TUMOR SIZE

The maximum dimension of tumor implants outside the true pelvis is greater than
or equal to 2 cm

PRIMARY TUMOR (T)

Based on the above information, the primary tumor is classified as macroscopic
peritoneal metastasis beyond pelvis more than 2 cm in greatest dimension or
regional lymph node metastasis (T3c/IIIC)

REGIONAL LYMPH NODES (N)

The regional lymph nodes are classified as regional lymph node metastasis (N1)
The total number of regional lymph nodes examined is l

The total number of metastatically~involved lymph nodes is 1

Extranodal extension by tumor metastases is absent

DISTANT METASTASIS (M)
The status of distant tumor site cannot be assessed (MX)

STAGE GROUPING
The Final AJCC/UICC/FIGO stage is T3C/Nl/M0 (Stage IIIC)

The pathologic stage assigned here should be regarded as provisional, and may
change after integration of clinical data not provided with this specimen.
