l) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right colon" and consists of a
segment of terminal ileum. cecnm with attached appendix and ascEnding colon.
The torminal ileum measures 3.5 cm in length and 4 cm in circumference at
the proximal resected margin. The remaining colon measures 28 cm in length

with a circumference of 8 cm at the distal resected margin. The attached
appendix measures 5 cm in length and measures 0.d cm in diameter at its
distal end; however dilated to 2.5 cm at the proximal end. The appendiceal
and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth. Focally hemorrhagic lohulated
yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the specimen measuring up to 1
cm in thickness. The specimen is opened to reveal an exophytic mass lesion
measuring 6.8 x 5.8 x 1.5 cm. The mass is Centered in the appendiceal
orifice. 3.5 cm from the proximal margin and 23 cm from the distal margin.
Sectioning shown that the tumor invades through muscularis propria to the
serosal surface. The depth of invasion is 1.2 cm grossly. The remaining

mucosa is unremarkable. The attached adipose tissue is thoroughly examined
and all identified lymph nodes are submitted. Representative sections of the
specimen are submitted for permanent sections and for TPS.

Summary of sections:

P — proximal margin shave

D - distal margin shave

A — appendix from distal to proximal including its orifice involved by the
tumor

TCE — tumor {cecuml

TCO — tumor {colon}

TIC» tumor {ileocecal valve)

LN - lymph nodes

2}. The specimen is received in formalin. labeled "Liver biopsy segment
three” and consists of two tan—brown fragments of soft tissue measuring 0.3x
0.3 x 0.2 cm and 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm. The larger wedge shaped fragment is
inked at the surgical margin and bisected. The entire specimen is
submitted.

$ummary of sections:
L—-larger tissue
S-—smaller tissue

3). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled ”heft fallopian tube and
ovary" and consists of a fallopian tube with attached ovary. The fallopian
tube measures 4.5 cm in length and averages 0.5 cm in diameter. The
external surface of the tube is pink tan and smooth with a normal fimbriated
end. multiple paratubsl cysts are identified averaging 0.1 cm. Cut section
through the tube reveals a pinpoint lumen. lhe attached ovary weighs 2.5 g
and measures 2.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The external surface is yellow and smooth.
Cut section through the ovary reveals yellow—white ovarian stroma. No
discrete lesions are grossly identified. Representative sections are
submitted.

Summary of sections:
F - fallopian tube
0 - ovary

4). The specimen is received in formalin. labeled ”Right fallopian tube and
ovary" and consists of a fallopian tube with attached ovary. The fallopian
tube measures 4.5 cm in length and averages 0.5 cm in diameter. The
external surface of the tube is pink tan and smooth with a normal fimbriated
end. Parstubal cysts are identified averaging 6.2 cm. Cut section through
the tube reveals a pinpoint lumen. The attached ovary weighs 2.5 g and
measures 3.1 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm. The external surfsCe is yellow and smooth

Cut section through the ovary reveals yellow-white ovarian stroma.
Representative sections are submitted.
