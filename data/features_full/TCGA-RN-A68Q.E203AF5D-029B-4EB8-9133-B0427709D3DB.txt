Microscopic Description:

Sections demonstrate a markedly hypercellular spindle cell neoplasm in a ﬁbrous stroma. Tumor cells
demonstrate only mild cytologic atypia. There is a rare focus of necrosis seen. Scattered mitotic figures
are seen with up to 3 mitoses per 10 high power ﬁelds. The neoplastic cells are immunoreactive for S-
100 but negative for EMA and CD-34. MlB-l labeling is patchy with large areas with <5% positivity, but
multiple smaller foci with a labeling index of up to 50%. Overall, the ﬁndings are more consistent with a
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, with the intratumor variability in cellularity, atypia and
proliferative activity suggesting recent transformation from a benign neuroﬁbroma. However, a spindle
cell melanoma remains to be excluded by additional special stains.

Diagnosis:
Lumbar lntradural Tumor—

Malignant spindle cell neoplasm, most consistent with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.

Addendum Discussion:

There is a high background positivity for the melanoma cocktail antibody, but the core cells, themselves,
are negative.
