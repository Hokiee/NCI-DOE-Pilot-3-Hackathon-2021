  

SPECIMEN LABELED "KIDNEY FOR TUMOR BANK":

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (20.6 cm), Chromophobe type,
II.

The tumor compresses the renal cortex, but does not invade the perirenal
adipose tissue.

No lymphovascular invasion identified.

The renal artery, vein, and ureter margins are negative for tumor.

Uninvolved kidney with no significant pathologic change.

Adrenal gland; no diagnostic abnormality recognized.

AJCC (6th Edition) Classification: T2 Nx Mx.

     

Fuhrman nuclear grade

NOTE: A modified Hale's colloidal iron stain is in progress to confirm they
Chromophobe features

SURGICAL ADDENDUM:
SPECIMEN LABELED "KIDNEY FOR TUMOR BANK":
The Hale's colloidal iron stain is positive, supporting Chromophobe
differentiation of RENAL CELL CARCINOMA

NOTE: Repeat iron stain (Hale's colloidal iron) and a CK7 impox were
performed on selected sections where oncocytoid and Chromophobe
features overlap. The immunostaining pattern for CK7 shows diffuse
positivity in both areas supporting the diagnosis with Chromophobe
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA. The diagnosis remains unchanged.

CLINIC

TISSUE SUBMITTED: #1. (L) kidney.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: by SANTAGATA,SANDRO,M.D.,PH.D.

The specimen was received fresh, in one part, labeled with the patient's name,
medical record number, "Kidney for tumor bank", and consists of a 2277.8 g
(12.5 x 12.0 x 11.0 cm) nephrectomy specimen with adrenal gland (12.4 x 2.3 x
0.4 cm). There is a renal vein (1.5 cm in length x 0.8 cm in diameter), a
renal artery (2.5 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter), and ureter (6.2 cm in
length x 1.0 cm in diameter proximaly X 0.4 cm in diameter at the margin).
There is a 20.6 x 14.0 x 11.0 cm yellow/golden brown and focally hemorrhagic
mass which protrudes from the kidney compressing the cortex into a thin rim in
the upper pole. The mass is incapsulated by a thin membrane (less than 0.1 cm
in dimension). The mass is 11.5 cm from the ureter, 7.0 cm from the renal vein
and 7.8 cm from the renal artery. Representative sections of the mass and
normal tissue are submitted to the tissue bank and cytogenetics. The tumor has
a large focus of hemorrhage and fibrosis (5.3 x 3.8 x 2.9 cm) as well as
multiple areas of necrosis.
