Primary Tumor (pT):

pT2a: Tumor greater than 3 em, but 5 cm or less in greatest
dimension surrounded by lung or visceral pleura without
bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more prOximal than the lobar
bronchus (i.e., not in the main bronchus); or Tumor 5 cm or less
in greatest dimension with any of the following features of extent:
involves main bronchus, 2 cm or more distal to the carina; invades
the visceral pleura; associated with atelectasis or obstructive
pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not inolve the
entire lung

CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Lung mass

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in ﬁve parts, each labeled with the
patient's name.

1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'right lobectomy, r/o

carcinoma'. It consists of a right upper lobe of the lung measuring

18 x 17 x 5 cm. The stapled line measures 11 cm and 7 cm in length.
The bronchial margin measures 2 cm and the vascular margin measures
1 cm at the hilar area. The pleura is gray pink glistening and

heavily mottled with ﬁne black streaks. There is a surgical cut
overlying a tumor mass. The serial sectioning reveals a gray white

ﬁrm tumor with ill-deﬁned borders measuring 3.7 x 3 x 3 cm,

located 1 cm from the overlying pleura and 1.5 cm from the bronchial

wuwﬁﬂmﬁoﬂﬁmargin‘mmmml unds the bronchus and w" y

vascular structure at the hilum. Also noted a pink nodular area
measuring 1.5 cm, located at the upper pole of the lung on the

pleural surface. The remainder of the parenchyma is pink red blotchy
and emphysematous. Representative sections are submitted.

2. Part two is received in saline, labeled ‘station #10 lymph node'.
It consists of one anthracotic lymph node measuring 1.2 x l x 0.5
cm. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

3. Part three is received in saline, labeled 'station #11 lymph
node'. It consists of four anthracotic lymph nodes, ranging from
0.5 cm to 1 cm in greatest dimension. Entirely submitted in one
cassette.

4. Part four is received in saline, labeled 'station #4 lymph node'.

It consists of three anthracotic lymph nodes, measuring from 0.7 cm
up to 1 cm in greatest dimension. Entirely submitted in one

cassette.

5. Part ﬁve is received in saline, labeled 'station #7 lymph node'.
It consists of two anthracotic lymph nodes, measuring from 0.5 cm up
to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. Entirely submitted in one cassette.
