Diagnosis:

1.: Tumor-free lipomatous atrophic lymph node.

2.: Right hemicolectomy specimen with tumor-free resection margins and under inclusion
ofan ulcerated, malignant, solid tumor in the cecum, conforming to the type ofa poorly
differentiated adenocarcinoma, with infiltration of the lamina muscularis propria and
without regional lymph node metastases (G3, pT2 L0 V0 R0 pNO 0/27).

Additional immunohistological investigations are being conducted due to the histological
peculiarities of the tumor. A follow-up report on this will be submitted at a later date.

 

Follow-up report:

From an immunohistological perspective, the tumor cells were positive for broad-
spectrum cytokeratins. Large numbers of CD3-positive and CD20-negative or T-
lymphocytes are also interspersed.

Based on the histology and immunohistology, this is thus a poorly differentiated
colorectal adenocarcinoma, or cecum carcinoma, with a dense lymphocytic stromal
inﬁltrate.

The poor tumor differentiation and the dense lymphocytic inﬂammatory inﬁltration may
be indicators of the presence of a microsatellite unstable (possibly HNPCC—associated)
colorectal carcinoma.
