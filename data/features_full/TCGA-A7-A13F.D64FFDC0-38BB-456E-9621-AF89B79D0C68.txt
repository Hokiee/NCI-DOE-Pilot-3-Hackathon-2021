FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS

A. Sentinel node 1, right axillary: No tumor seen. No definite
lymph node.

B. Sentinel node II right axillary, biopsy: two lymph nodes, both
positive for metatatic carcinoma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section

labeled "sentinel node #1 right axilla" and consists of a
3.0 X 2.0 x 1.0 cm. piece of fatty yellow tissue. The specimen is
sectioned to reveal a possible 0.6 cm. tan lymph node. No staining
is present. The possible lymph node tissue is frozen as frozen
section AFSl. The fatty tissue is entirely submitted in block 1 for
permanent sections.

B. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section

labeled "B. sentinel node #2 right axilla" is a 6.0 x 3.0
x 1.0 cm. piece of soft yellow fatty tissue. The specimen is
palpated and sectioned to reveal two possible lymph nodes. One
measures 1.5 cm. in greatest dimension and has a focally firm
white-tan appearance. The other measures 1.0 cm. in greatest
dimension and appears tan and soft. The larger lymph node is frozen
as frozen section BFSl and the smaller as frozen section BFSZ. Both
lymph nodes are bisected.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION
C. The specimen is received in formalin labeled "left
breast tissue" and consists of a V—shaped piece of white
skin with underlying yellow soft tissue, two additional pieces of
yellow soft tissue and an additional piece of white skin. The
entire
Specimen weighs 480 grams in the partially fixed state. On cut
section the breast tissue is unremarkable. RS-8
D. The specimen is received in formalin labeled "right
breast" and consists of a right breast resection specimen
measuring 35 x 21 x 6 cm. There is an overlying white ellipse of
skin measuring 21 x 9 cm. The skin ellipse has a central areola
measuring 4.5 x 4 cm. with a central nipple measuring 1.3 x 1 X 0.2
cm. An arrow has been incised in the skin ellipse. The deep surface
of the specimen has been inked and the breast has been partially

a

 

sectioned prior to my examination. There is a deep central tumor a
portion of which has been resected prior to my examination,
probably
for research purposes. The tumor measures 6 x 4 x 7 cm. The
specimen
is re—incised at 1 cm. intervals from the deep surface towards the
skin. Sections are taken as dictated in the block summary:

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 and 2 - nipple; 3 — deep margin; 4—7 - tumor; 8-
11

~ upper outer, upper inner, lower outer, lower inner quadrants.

Sections from the axillary portion of the specimen show 11 lymph

node—like structures. These are submitted in blocks 012—017.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

A. Fibrofatty connective tissue is present. The specimen is
negative

for malignancy.

B. Metastatic carcinoma is present in 2 of 2 lymph nodes. The

largest nodules measure 0.2 and 0.5 cm.

C. There is focal benign calcification.

D.

 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Mitotic index: 4 mitoses/10 HPFs (1 HPF = 0.196 sq mm)

Tumor size: 4 x 6 x 7 cm
Vessel invasion: Carcinoma is present in lymphatics in the
nipple.

Calcification: Absent

pTNM stage: T3 pN1a
Prognostic markers: See previous biopsy

Nipple: Carcinoma is present in lymphatics in the nipple
Skin over tumor: Negative for malignancy

Deep margin: Negative for malignancy

Total lymph nodes: 11 (including 2 sentinel nodes)

Lymph nodes positive: 3 (including 2 sentinel nodes)
Size of metastases: Up to 3.5 mm

Extranodal tumor: Absent

Matted lymph nodes: Absent

4x2,3,5,l4x2,15

 

DIAGNOSIS
A. Sentinel lymph node #1, right axilla, biopsy:
Fibrofatty connective tissue. No lymph node present

B. Sentinal lymph node #2, right axilla, biopsy:
Metastatic carcinoma is present in 2 of 2 lymph nodes.‘

C. Breast, left, plastic procedure: Negative for malignancy
D. Breast, right, resection:

DIAGNOSIS
Infiltrating ductal carcinoma with focal lobular features,

[Nottingham gradekz

Note: Metatstatic carcinoma is present in 1 of 9 axillary lymph
nodes.
