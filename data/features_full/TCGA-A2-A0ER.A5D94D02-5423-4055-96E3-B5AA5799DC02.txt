** Report Electronically Signed Out **

_____.__..._.—__.__.—_—._—__._.—__._.——_.—._—_—._-_.__._____.________._.——————__—_—_—_~_.—_..___

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY:
’ year old female with history of a right breast mass.

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right breast cancer

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 Received fresh is a 2.5 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm fatty
tissue fragment containing 2.2 x 1.4 x 1.4 cm lymph node. Half of the node
is submitted for the CBC protocol. The remaining half is submitted for
paraffin section in one cassette.

B. Received fresh is a 2.0 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm fatty tissue fragment containing
a 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm lymph node. Half of the node is submitted for the CBC
protocol. The remaining half is submitted for paraffin sections in a
single cassette.

C. Received fresh is a fibrofatty tissue fragment, oriented with sutures
(short—superior, long-lateral) measuring 7.5 x 5.5 x 1 cm. A needle
localization wire is in place. The accompanying radiograph is reviewed and
shows a well defined density alongside the locaation wire and about 1 cm
from a metallic clip. Inked: blue— superior—anterior, green- inferior—
anterior, b1ack-—posterior. The specimen is sectioned from lateral to
medial revealing a 1. 3 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm tumor with tan gritty cut surface in
the mid portion of the specimen. The tumor is located 0.3 cm from the deep
margin and 0.3 cm from the inferior anterior margin. The remaining tissue
is variably fatty and fibrous. Two tissue sections submitted for CBC
protocol with matching paraffin sections as follows:

C1: tumor
C2: fibrous area near lateral margin approximately 2 cm from tumor.

Additional sections are submitted as follows:
C3-C4: lateral to fibrous area paired cassettes
C5-C6: medial to fibrous area paired cassettes
C7—C8: paired cassettes
