MICROSCOPIC REPORT

Specimen i and 2 show features of Otigmtcmlmgiinnm “11012007; Grade Ii.

The tumour is inliilrative and is of moderate to dense eeliularily. It is composed ofmustly round to
oval eells displaying mild nuclear plcomomliism, perinuclear imios and set in a fibriiinry
background. Delicate branching vascular network is evident. In some areas, the tumour has a
demarcated pushing edge and the adjacent brain is severely gliotie with many gemistocytic
astroeytes and roscntlwl-likc ﬁbres are seen (block 21)). 'l‘here is perivaseulnr lymphocytie cutting.
There is adjacent brain cortex and leptomeninges seen in block 2A. Perinuelear satcllitosis is not a
feature in this biopsy. Mitotic ﬁgures are very infrequent with only two isolated mitosis identiﬁed in
all tumour blocks. There is no necrosis or enduthelinl proliferation.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT

RPM! GIJOMA FiSH RESULTS: This case was analysed for lip/19q [.011 using dual
colour probe sets _ 1936; 1:125 and . 19(1132’19p13. Cut-offvatucs: a lp/lq ratio and
19¢]! l9p ratio of 4:1).80 is taken as indicating LOH. Sixty cells wore t'onnnlly scored with each
pmhc pair.

The case was also liybriclisud with Emmi/Cop? dual colour FISH prahcsct to assess EGFR
gene ampliﬁcation.
