and consists of a single portion of tan lymph node measuring 0. 5x0. 3x0 20m. The entire
specimen is submitted 111 block FSC for frozen section diagnosis.

D. 4R LYMPH NODE

Received ﬁesh IS a single lymph node measuring 0. 3x0. 3x0. 20m. Entirely submitted in one
cassette

E. 4L LYMPH NODE

Received fresh are two fragments of pink tan lymphoid tissue measuring 0.4x0.2x0.2cm.
Entirely submitted in one cassette.

F. LEVEL 7 LYMPH NODE

Received fresh is a single lymph node measuring 0.3x0.2x0.lcm. Entirely submitted i

cassette. I“
G. LEVEL 5 LYMPH NODE

The specimen is received fresh in a singie container labele“ designated “level 5
lymph node” and consists of a single tan lymph node measuring l.lx0.7x0.50m. The entire
specimen is submitted in block FSG for frozen section diagnosis.

H. LEVEL 6 LYMPH NODE

The specimen is received fresh in a single container labeled _- designated “level 6
lymph node” and consists of a single tan lymph node measuring 0.8x0.7x0.4cm. The en ire
specimen is submitted in block FSH for frozen section diagnosis. —
I. LEVEL 6 LYMPH NODE

Received fresh IS a single lymph node measuring 1. 1x0. 4x0. 3cm. Entirely submitted in one

cassette

1. LEVEL X LYMPH NODE
Received fresh is a single lymph node measuring l.3x0.6x0.4cm. Entirely submitted in one
cassette.
K. LEFT UPPER LOBE WITH SUPERIOR SEGMENT OF LOWER LOBE
The specimen is received fresh in a container labeled with the patient name and designated “left
upper lobe with superior segment of lower lobe”. It consists of one lobe of the lung weighing
310gm. and measuring lel3x4.2cm. Serial sectioning of the specimen reveals a white and grey
tan tumor measuring 4.0x3.5x3.0cm. This tumor is 10111. from the hilar bronchial resection
margin and less than 0.1cm. from the pleural surface. Gross examination of the surface reveals a
l.5x0.6cm. induration area. One portion of tissue is submitted for frozen section examination.
Representative sections are submitted in ten cassettes.

K1: frozen section

K2: bronchial margin

KB—KS: tumor with bronchus

K6-K8: tumor with inked pleural surface

K9—K10: random sections of lung
L. LEVEL ELEVEN LYMPH NODE
Received fresh are two fragments of pink tau tissue measuring l.6x0.6x0.4cm. Entirel
submitted in one cassette. ‘
