Surgical Pathology

SLIDE DISPOSITION:

DIAGNOSIS:

A. Uterus, bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and

bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy: FIGO grade I (of III)
endometrial

adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, is identified forming a
mass (2. 9

x 2.5 x 1.1 cm) located in the posterior and left lateral
wall of

the endometrial cavity. The tumor superficially invades
0.3 cm into

the myometrium (total myometrial thickness, 2.2 cm). The
lower

uterine segment is uninvolved by tumor. Lymphovascular
space

invasion is not identified. The margins are negative for
tumor.

The cervix is unremarkable. There are multiple (2)
intramural

leiomyomas (0.5 cm and 0.6 cm in greatest dimension) and a
single

subserosal leiomyoma (0.5 cm in greatest dimension) in the
ﬁyaﬁatriﬁm. The bilateral ovaries and remnants of
fallopian tubes

are unremarkable.

With available surgical material, [AJCC (7th edition)
pleNX].

This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic

examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation
of the

specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent
sections are

reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive
changes

identified on permanent section review will be reflected
in a

revised report.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled "uterus and bilateral
tubes/ovaries" is a

110.0 gram uterus with attached bilateral fallopian tube
remnants,

ovaries and an unremarkable cervix. The uterine serosa is
smooth

There is a 2.9 x 2.5 x 1.1 cm polypoid mass in the
posterior and

left lateral wall of the endometrial cavity which grossly
appears to

invade 0.3 cm into the 2.2 cm thick myometrium. There are
multiple

(2) intramural leiomyomata (0.5 cm and 0.6 cm in greatest
dimension)

and a single subserosal leiomyoma (0.5 cm in greatest
dimension).

There is a 2.3 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm right ovary with a smooth
outer

surface and a solid cut surface with a 0.9 x 0.3 cm right
fallopian

tube remnant. There is a 2.1 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm left ovary
with a

smooth outer surface and a solid cut surface with a 0.7 x
0.3 cm

left fallopian tube remnant. Representative sections
submitted.
