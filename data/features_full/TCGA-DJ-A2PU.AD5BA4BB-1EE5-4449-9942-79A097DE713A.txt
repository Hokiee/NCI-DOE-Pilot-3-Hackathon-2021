Gross Description:

1) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "total thyroidectomy" and consists of a thyroid weighing 20.5 g. The suture is in place by
the surgeon to indicate the right lobe. The right lobe measures 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm, the left lobe measures 2.8 x 1.9 x 1.0 cm and the
isthmus measures 2.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The extemal surface is covered by a thin ﬁbrous capsule. The posterior surface of the
specimen is inked black, and the anterior is inked blue. Sectioning reveals a nodule in the right lobe that measures 2.8 x 2.5 x 2.2
cm. The nodule is partially solid and partially cystic. The solid area is ﬂeshy and brown and has a calciﬁed center. The left lobe
contains a well—circumscribed. solid nodule that measures 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm. The remaining thyroid parenchyma is red tan and
beefy. Representative sections of the specimen have been submitted for TPS. and a photograph has been taken. The remaining
tissue is serially sectioned and entirely submitted. A section with caicifications is decalcitied prior processing.

Summary of sections:

RNC— right thyroid lobe nodule with calciﬁcation
RL - right lobe

LL - left lobe

iS — isthmus

2) The specimen is received in formalin labeled "Pretracheal tissue" and consists of a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm piece of fatty soft tissue.
The specimen is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections: .
U - undesignated

3) The specimen is received in formalin labeled ”Right paratracheai nodes” and consists of a 1.1 x 1.1 x 0.3 cm piece of ten soft
tissue. The specimen is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
