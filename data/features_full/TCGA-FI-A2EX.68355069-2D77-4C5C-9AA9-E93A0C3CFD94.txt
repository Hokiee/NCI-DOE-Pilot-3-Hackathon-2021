Intraoperative Consultation: .
An intraoperative non—microscopic consultation was obtained and interpreted as:
"Called to pick up 'uterus, cerv1g, bilateral ovaries and tubes,‘ consisting of
mentioned parts. Uterus and cerVix measure 8 x 4.5 x 2.5 cm and weigh 84 grams.
The bilateral adnexae are unremarkable. Opened to show a tan lobulated mass
filling the endometrial cavity and mostly attached to anterior endometrium
measurin 2.3 x 2 x 0.8 cm. Tumor also seen on posterior endometrium measuring
1.3 x 0. x 0.5 cm, and 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm. The endocervical canal and lower
uterine seoment are unremarkable. The serosa is unremarkable. Tumor and normal
given to and tumor bank. Rest For permanents," by
