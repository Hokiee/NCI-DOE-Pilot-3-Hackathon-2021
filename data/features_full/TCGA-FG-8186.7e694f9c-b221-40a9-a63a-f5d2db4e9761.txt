FINAL DIAGNOSIS

 

A. POSTERIOR MARGIN, BIOPSY:
--|NF|LTRAT|NG GLIOMA, SEE NOTE.

B. POSTERIOR MEDIAL TUMOR, BIOPSY:
--CEREBRAL CORTEX, NO TUMOR IDENTIFIED.

C. LATERAL SUPERIOR MARGIN, BIOPSY:
--|NF|LTRAT|NG GLIOMA, SEE NOTE.

D. FRONTAL LOBE, BIOPSY:
--|NF|LTRAT|NG GLIOMA, SEE NOTE.

E. POSTERIOR MARGIN, BIOPSY:
--|NF|LTRAT|NG GLIOMA, SEE NOTE.

F. FRONTAL POLE, EXCISION AND G. TUMOR, EXCISION:
--ANAPLAST|C OLIGOASTROCYTOMA (WHO GRADE III), SEE NOTE.

Note: Greater than 90% of the tumor shows features of a WHO grade II oligoastrocytoma, however there is focally
increased cellularity and pleomorphism consistent with anaplastic transformation.

Gross Description:

A: Received fresh for intraoperative evaluation labeled with the patient's name, hospital number and "posterior margin
rule out infiltration" are multiple tan-pink soft tissue fragments, 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.1 cm in aggregate. The specimen was
entirely submitted for frozen section analysis. The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.

B: Received fresh for intraoperative evaluation labeled with the patient's name, hospital number and "posterior medial
tumor rule out infiltration" is a tan-pink soft tissue parenchyma 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The specimen was entirely submitted
for frozen section analysis. Specimen is entirely submitted one cassette.

C:Received fresh for intraoperative evaluation labeled with the patient's name, hospital number and "lateral superior
margin" are multiple tan-pink soft tissue fragments, 1 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm in aggregate. The specimen was entirely
submitted for frozen section analysis. The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.

D: Received fresh for intraoperative evaluation labeled with the patient's name, hospital number and "frontal lobe rule
out infiltration" is a single tan-pink soft tissue fragment, 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The specimen was entirely submitted for
frozen section analysis. The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.

E: Received fresh for intraoperative evaluation labeled with the patient's name, hospital number and "posterior margin
rule out infiltration" is a tan to pink soft tissue fragment that is 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted for
frozen section analysis. The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.

F: Received fresh, postfixed in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and number, and "A-frontal pole", is an
irregular fragment of opaque white to pink-tan, soft, cerebriform tissue measuring 5.3 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm. Representative
sections are submitted in 3 cassettes.

G: Received fresh, postfixed in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and number, and "B- tumor", is an irregular
fragment of opaque white to pink-tan, soft, cerebriform tissue measuring 5.0 x 4.8 x 3.8 cm. The specimen is serially
sectioned and submitted entirely in 25 cassettes.
