Microscopic

Sections demonstrate a markedly hypercellular glial neoplasm consisting of atypical cells
that resemble astrocytes. There is also a significant oligodendroglial component. The
neoplastic cells demonstrate pleomorphic and often bizarre nuclei. In some areas, there is
a predominance of gemistocytes. The neoplastic cells diffusely infiltrate adjacent gray
and white matter. Scattered mitotic figures are seen. Occasional foci of early
spontaneous necrosis as well as microvascular proliferation are identified. These
histologic features are consistent with an anaplastic oligoastrocytoma

The MIB-l labeling index ranges up to 10.2% in the most proliferative regions of tumor.
Diagnosis

Anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, astrocytoma predominant
