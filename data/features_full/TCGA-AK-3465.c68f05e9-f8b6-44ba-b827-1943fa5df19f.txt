Clinical l-Iistory/Diagnosis: Left Renal Mass

Source of Specimen(s):
Kidney resection

Gross Description:
Received in one part.
Source of Tissue: 1. Labeled #1, "left kidney"

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled ”,

left kidney". It consists of a kidney with attached perinephric fat

weighing a total of 262 grams and measuring 16.5 X 9.5 x 6 cm in greatest
dimension. The ureteral stump measures 1.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm in
diameter. The Specimen is bisected to show a 10.5 x 5 x 5 .5 cm kidney. An
ill-defined ﬂeshy brown tumor mid pole maSS is identified measuring 5.5 x
5.5 x 4 cm in greatest dimension. Grossly the mass abuts the capsule and
comes within 1 cm of the surrounding fat margin. It also obliterates
approximately 50% of the inferior pole. The adrenal gland is absent.
Representative sections submitted in 1A~1H.

Designation of Sections: lA— urethral and vascular margins, lBrlE— random
section of tumor with closest capsule, lF—IG— sun'ounding fat margin
closest to tumor, ll-I— tumor with adjacent uninvolved pelvis

Final Diagnosis:

1. Left kidney nephrectomy:

— Oncocytic chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, 5.5 cm.

— The tumor focally invades the renal capsule.

— No lymphovascular invasion is‘identified.

- Vascular and ureteral margins are uninvolved.

Abnormal karyotype,

INTERPRETATION:
Two mitotic cells examined were characterized by an additional copy of

chromosome 12. No abnormalities were evident in the remaining 19 cells.

Trisomy 12 has been seen both in solid tumor and lymphoproliferative
malignancies.
