PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:

1. A.ILEFT KIDNEY, NEPH ECTOMY:
CLEAR CELL RENAL ELL CARCINOMA, present as two separated nodules in the

posterior mid-to—upper pole (4.? cm) and at the anterior subcapsular
{1.0 cm).
Fuhrman nuclear grade 2.f
The tumor is confined to the kidney.
The vascular and ureteral margins are negative for tumor.
Adrenal gland not present.

AJCC Classification: le Nx MX.

f/PAPILLARY ADENOMA (0.3 cm), located in the subcortex.
Incidental microadenoma, 0.1 cm.

Focal global glomerulosclerosis.

Cortical scar.

Arteriolosclerosis, mild to moderate.

The renal parenchyma and special stains will be reviewed by Kidney
Pathology Service, and reported in an addendum.

CLINICAL DATA:

History: None given.

Operation: Left radical nephrectomy.
Operative Findings: None given.

Clinical Diagnosis: Left renal cell cancer.

TISSUE SUBMITTED:
A/l. Left kidney — Tissue Bank.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh, labeled with the patients name, unit number,

and "#1 Left kidney", and consists of a left radical nephrectomy specimen
(653.5 grams, 21 x 9.5 x 6.8 cm - Overall dimensions), to include left kidney
(13.0 x 8.0 x 5.8 cm), ureter (10.5 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter), renal
vein (0.6 cm in length x 1.3 cm in diameter), renal arteries (1-4 cm in length
x 0.3 cm in diameter and 2.2 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter), and abundant
perinephric fat. An adrenal gland is not identified. A small portion of red/tan
probable Gerota's fascia (6.2 x 3.7 x 0.1 cm) is present along the anterior
aspect. The specimen is inked black along the deep margin and bivalved. There
is a golden yellow/red; lobulated, hemorrhagic, encapsulated mass {4.7 x 3.6 x
3.0 cm) along the posterior aspect of the mid to upper pole, abutting the renal
capsule, coming to within 0.8 cm of the deep margin, 2.5 cm from artery #2, 3.2
cm from artery #1, 3.8 cm from the renal vein margin, 13.5 cm from the ureteral
margin, and does not grossly appear to extend in the perinephric fat. The renal
vein is grossly unremarkable. Representative tumor is submitted to
Cytogenetics, Electron Microscopy, and Tissue Bank for special studies.
Representative normal cortex is submitted to the Tissue Bank and Electron
Microscopy/Immunofluorescence for special studies. There is a second, grossly
encapsulated, golden yellowfred mass (1.0 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm) in the renal cortex,
abutting and distending the anterior renal capsule, coming to within 0.5 cm of
the black—inked deep margin, 14 cm from the ureteral margin, 5.5 cm from renal
artery margin #1, 7.2 cm from renal artery #2, and 5.3 cm from the renal vein
margin. There is a small < 0.2 cm nodule in the cortex. The medullary pyramids
are diffusely hyperemic at the periphery and the corticomedullary junction is
distinct. The pelvis diaplays an unremarkable tan urothelium. No lymph nodes

identified within the hilum.

RENAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION OF THE KIDNEY PARENCHYMA:
LEFT KIDNEY, NEPHRECTOMY:

IMMUNE COMPLEX MEDIATED GLOMERULONEPHRITIS, PREDOMINANTLY WITH
SUBEPITHELIAL AND INTRAMEMBRANOUS DEPOSITS, MOST SUGGESTIVE OF
A MEMBRANOUS PATTERN OF GLOMERULAR INJURY (SEE NOTE)

MODERATE CHRONIC CHANGES OF THE KIDNEY PARENCHYMA:
— FOCAL GLOBAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS {18 % OF GLOMERULI);
- MILD TUBULAR ATROPHY AND INTERSTITIAL FIBROSIS (10% OF THE
PARENCHYMA);
— ARTERIAL AND ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS, MODERATE (SEE NOTE)

NOTE:

The immunofluorescence and electron microscopic evaluation of the tissue
suggests an immune complex mediated glomerulonephritis. Electron microscopic
evaluation shows that the majority of the deposits are subepithelial and
intramembranous in location. This pattern of injury suggests a membranous
nephropathy, currently probably not very active. A systemic autoimmune disease
(SLE) or a remote post—infectious glomerulonephritis cannot be'ruled out with
absolute certainty.

 

 

 

 

Kidney Pathologist, performed the evaluation and
interpretation of this material.

DESCRIPTION:
Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffineembedded tissue (block All) were evaluated

using HE, PAS, Jones silver methenamine, and AFOG (trichrome) stains: an
HE—stained frozen section and semithin submitted for light microscopy.

The sample consists of renal cortex and medulla. There are up to 173 glomeruli
present in the sample. Thirty- two (32) glomeruli are globally obsolescent
(sclerosed). The preserved glomeruli show a mild increase in mesangial matrix
as seen on the PAS stain. The peripheral capillary walls reveal thick basement
membranes, with fine "spike"-like projections and many "craters". These changes
are best visible on the Jonesl silver methenamine stain. Tubules show normal
cellular details. There are isolated, PASupositive casts present in some
distal tubules. Focal tubular atrophy is seen in areas of interstitial
fibrosis. Significant interstitial inflammation is not evident in the sample
examined. Approximately 10 t of the tissue included in this biopsy shows
tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, as evidenced on the trichrome stains
(AFCG). Arteries show moderate sclerosis of the media, with focal replacement
of smooth muscle cells by connective tissue. Arterioles reveal moderate
subintimal hyaline accumulation toluidine blue-stained sections were also

evaluated by light microscopy.

IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY REPORT—
Sections of frozen tissue were incubated with antibodies specific for the heavy
chains of I-G, IgA, and IgM, kappa and lambda light chains, C3, Clq, albumin,

.1 and fibrin—related antigens.

The sample consists of kidney cortex and. medulla. There are four (4)
glomeruli present, of which three (3) are globally sclerosed. There is diffuse
granular deposition of IgM (trace), IgG (+/4+) and fibrinogen {+/4+) in the
mesangial areas and along the peripheral capillary walls. There is also diffuse
linear deposition of albumin (+/4+} along all basement membranes. Tubules
contain reabsorbed proteins (albumin; IgG, C3} in the form of cytoplasmic
granules. Tubular basement membranes reveal focal deposition of C3 (trees).
Few casts in distal tubules are reactive for polyclbnal 19A. The interstitium
reveals scattered fibrin deposits. There is no difference noted in the
intensity of the staining for kappa and lambda light chains in the casts, in
the deposits, or in the background of the tissue

ELECTRON MICROSCOPY REPORT F ‘
Blocks: 4; Blocks examined: 1c sections; I thin section.

The tissue examined at the ultrastructural level includes five {5) glomeruli.
The glomerular capillary walls are greatly distorted by the presence of
numerous subepithelial and intramembranous electron dense deposits and
thickening of the basement membranes. Individual deposits are often surrounded
by basement membrane material and “spikes". The electron dense deposits are
finely granular but they do not show organized substructures. There is
extensive effacement of visceral epithelial cell foot processes present and
widespread microvillous degeneration of the epithelial cell membrane. Several
epithelial cells also show prominent vacuoles and increased numbers of
lysosomes. Glomerular endothelial cells appear unremarkable and do not contain
tubuloreticular structures. Subendothelial electron dense deposits are not
seen. The mesangium shews normal cell elements and an extracellular matrix with

few irregular electron dense deposits.

METAPHASES COUNTED: 20 ANALYZED: 10 SCORED: 10 BANDING: GTG
INTERPRETATION:

Two different specimens were received from this tumor. Loss of one chromosome
8, as the sole chromosome abnormality, was seen in both specimens. This
aberration is not known to be characteristic of any particular type of tumor.

COMMENTS:

Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the
standard methods employed. Chromosome analysis was performed at a level of 400
bands or greater.
