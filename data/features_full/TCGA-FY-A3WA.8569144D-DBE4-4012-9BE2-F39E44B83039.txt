GROSS
Received fresh in a container labeled "right thyroid nodule" is a
portion of thyroid (4.5 x 3 x 1.8 cm, 10.3 g). The parenchyma has a
2.1 cm in greatest dimension discrete nodule with a uniform
hemorrhagic out surface. A portion of the nodule and adjacent inked
capsule is submitted for the The remaining firm,
red~brown thyroid parenchyma has additional small nodules up to 0.4
cm in diameter. The margins of excision are marked with black ink.
The tissue is submitted in its entirety in six cassettes.

MICROSCOPIC
See diagnosis.

DIAGNOSIS
Right thyroid lobe, right thyroid lobectomy (10.3 9):
Tiny incidental nodule (0.5 cm) worrisome for papillary thyroid
microcarcinoma (see comment).
Nodular hyperplasia (multinodular goiter).
One parathyroid gland.

COMMENT
A tiny 0.5 cm focus is composed of follicles lined by cells that
appear slightly enlarged, somewhat irregular, with pale chromatin,
small nucleoli, occasional nuclear grooves and a rare intranuclear
inclusion. There is no significant nuclear crowding. There is
prominent associated fibrosis and the cytologic features are
worrisome for a diagnosis of follicular variant of papillary thyroid
microcarcinoma. A CK19 immunohistochemical stain is focally
positive within this focus, however focal CK19 positivity is also

Incidental papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (0.5 cm), follicular 97 2 id/IW V11! /,A/
variant, confined to the thyroid and completely excised. P’”

Normocellular parathyroid gland.

COMMENT:

I have reviewed the slides from the above named -year-old who
underwent right thyroid lobectomy for a nodule. As indicated, I
entirely agree with your diagnosis. Sections from the right thyroid
lobectomy demonstrate multiple hyperplastic nodules. In addition,
there is a 0.5 cm nodule with associated stromal sclerosis
demonstrating nuclear changes of papillary thyroid carcinoma with
crowding, chromatin clearing, and nuclear contour irregularities.
This lesion is confined to thyroid and appears narrowly excised.
Finally, there is a cellular-appearing portion of parathyroid gland.
