SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

SPECIMEN

A. Lingula
Level 10 lymph node
Level 7 lymph node
Level 5 lymph node

U001

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Lung mass.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Part A is submitted fresh for tissue procurement,
labeled "lingula". It consists of an elongated portion of
lung tissue, measuring 18 x 4 x 2 cm. maximally. It has been
amputated along an entire edge, which has steel clips and paper tape
present. There is an area of pleural puckering opposite the tape,
which has drawn the pleura into a stellate-like area, with a
palpable mass deep to that. The pleura is focally torn along
another portion of the specimen. Black ink is applied over the area
of the scar and then the specimen is serially sectioned. This
reveals the presence of a nodular tumor mass immediately beneath the
pleura, in the region of the above-mentioned scar. That tumor mass
measures maximally 2 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm. Sections through the remaining
pulmonary parenchyma reveal a consolidated bloody red tissue,
without other focal nodules present. There is some adherent fat
present on the pleural surface. Representative tumor and normal
ions are submitted for tissue procurement, per request of
_ Sections after fixation.
Part B is submitted fresh, labeled "Level 10 lymph
node". It consists of multiple black and red tissue
portions. Three are present, each measuring 6 to 8 mm. in greatest
extent. AS—1
C. Part C is submitted fresh, labeled "Level 7 lymph
node". It consists of a single 7 mm. fragment of black and
red tissue. AS-1
D. Part D is submitted fresh, labeled "Level 5 lymph
node". It consists of two portions of fatty red and black
with an aggregate dimension of 1 cm. AS—1

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma.
Histologic grade: Moderate to poorly differentiated.
Primary tumor (pT): Tumor measures 2 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm and does not
involve the visceral pleural surface (pT1).
Margins of resection: Negative.
Direct extension of tumor: Absent.
Venous (large vessel) invasion: Negative.
Arterial (large vessel) invasion: Negative.
Lymphatic (small vessel) invasion: Negative.
Regional lymph nodes (pN): The level 5, 7, and 10 mediastinal nodes
are negative for metastatic carcinoma (pNO).
Distant metastasis (pM): Cannot be assessed (pMX).

Other findings: Emphysematous bullae. Pleural based fibrous scar
with old hemorrhage.

DIAGNOSIS
A. Lung, lingula, wedge resection:
Invasive moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
The visceral pleural surface and margin of resection are free
of tumor. Emphysematous bullae.
Pleural based fibrous scar with old hemorrhage.

B. Lymph node, level 10, resection:
Negative for metastatic carcinoma.

C. Lymph node, level 7, resection:
Negative for metastatic carcinoma.

D. Lymph node, level 5, resection:
Negative for metastatic carcinoma.
