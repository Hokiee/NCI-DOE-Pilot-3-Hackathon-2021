DIAGNOSIS:

A. Uterus, hysterectomy: Endometrial adengcarcinoma,
endometrioid "ﬂ
"?§S§?=fT66‘§rade 1 to 2 (of 3) is identified forming a
mass (2.5 x

1.5 x 1.0 cm) partially involving the polyp and adjacent
endometrium

located in the upper fundus. The tumor invades 0.3 cm
into the

myometrium (total myometrial thickness, 2.5 cm). The
tumor does not

involve the endocervix. Lymphovascular space invasion is
not

identified. The margins are negative for tumor. Multiple
(3)

intramural leiomyomata (ranging in size from 1.0 cm to 1.5
cm in

greatest dimension) are identified. [AJCC pleNOMX]

B, C. Ovary and fallopian tube, right and left, bilateral
salpingo—oophorectomy: Atrophic ovaries and unremarkable
fallopian

tubes.

D. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, dissection: Multiple (17)
right

pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor. Frozen section
histologic interpretation performed by:

E. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, biopsy: Multiple (12) left
pelvic
lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic

examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of
the

specimen(s).

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled "uterus" is a 200.0 gram uterus
with

attached unremarkable cervix. The uterine serosa is
smooth There

is a 3.5 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm polypoid mass in the upper fundus
of the

endometrial cavity with 2.5 cm myometrial thickness.
Grossly, there

is 3.0 mm of invasion. There are multiple (3) intramural
leiomyomas

(ranging in size from 1.0 cm to 1.5 cm in greatest
dimension).

Representative sections are submitted.

B. Received fresh labeled "right tube & ovary" is a 3.5 x
2.3 x

0.7 cm ovary with an 8.0 x 0.7 cm attached fallopian tube.
The

ovary has a smooth outer surface and a cystic (0.8 x 0.7 x
0.3 cm)

cut surface. There is a 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm white nodule

on the

surface. Representative sections submitted. 0
C. Received fresh labeled "left tube & ovary" is a 3.0 x
3.0 x

1.2 cm ovary with a 7.0 x 0.7 cm attached fallopian tube.
The ovary

has a smooth outer surface and a cystic (1.5 x 1.4 x 1.1
cm) cut

surface. Representative sections submitted.

D. Received fresh labeled "right pelvic nodes" is a 8.9 x
4.9 x 2.0

cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. A11
lymphatic tissue

submitted.

E. Received fresh labeled "left pelvic nodes" is an 8.0 x
3.0 x 2.0

cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. All
lymphatic tissue

submitted.
