Source of Tissue: 4. Labeled #4, "right upper lobe"

Mimi: BRONCHEAL MARGIN WITH NO TUMOR SEEN PER

Gross Description: ReCeived fresh labeled,

right upper lobe". It consists of a lobe of lung weighing 197 grams and
measuring 14 x 9 x 4 cm. A gray nodular indurated area is identified on
the pleura measuring 3 x 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. The bronchial and
vascular margins are grossly um'emarkable. The specimen is serially
sectioned to reveal a 4 x 3.2 x 2.1 cm ill-defined gray mass located
approximately 1.5 cm from the bronchial and vascular margins. The mass
grossly corresponds to the previously described pleural induration. The
remaining lung parenchyrna is red—brown, congested with no other masses
present. The bronchial margin is frozen in 4FS. Additional random sections
of the remainder of the specimen are submitted in 4A~4H.

 

 

Designation of Sections: 4FS— frozen section, 4A— vascular margins, 4B—4E—
random section of tumor with closest pleura, 4F- tumor with adjacent
normal uninvolved parenchyma, 4G- peribronchial lymph nodes, 4H—
uninvolved parenchyma

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled ",

level 7 lymph nodes”. It consists of multiple soft black—brown

anthracotic lymph nodes measuring from 0.1 up to 1.5 cm in greatest

dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted in SA—SB.

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled ",

level 10 lymph nodes". It consists of a soft black-brown anthracotic

lymph node measuring 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The lymph node is bisected and

entirely submitted in GA.

anthracotic lymph nodes measun’ng from 0.1 up to 0.7 cm in greatest

dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted in 7A—7C.
