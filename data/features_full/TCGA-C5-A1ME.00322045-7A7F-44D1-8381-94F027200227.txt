Microscopic Descrigtion and Comment
Histologic section of the cervical biopsy shows a well-differentiated adenocarcinome. The predominant pattern of this
tumor is villoglandular papillary adenocarcinoma with fibrovascular cores of variable lengths lined by neoplastic
epithelium that exhibits predominantly intestinal-type differentiation. Dispersed throughout the villoglanduiar
adenocarcinorna are areas showing complex cribriform architecture. These cribriform areas represent about 10-15%
of lesional tissue. Although stromai invasion is not definitively identiﬁed. there is essentially no normal stroma present
within the biopsy tissue to exclude an invasive component. Drmhas reviewed this case and concurs.
