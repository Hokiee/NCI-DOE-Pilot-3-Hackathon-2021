GROSS DESCRIPTION:

Specimen is received unfixed in eight parts.

Part 1 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and "right
tonsillectomy". It consists of an oriented 4.5 x 2.6 x 2.3 cm intact,
ovoid

palatine tonsil with a roughened, focally hemorrhagic and cauterized
surgical

resection margin. Stitch marks soft palate margin (superior). There is
a well

demarcated moderately firm, tan-gray, exophytic, papillary appearing
lesion

2.6 x 1.8 X‘I.5 cm, coming to within 0.2 cm of the superior aspect
(site of

attached stitch), 1.1 cm of the inferior aspect, abutting the anterior
aspect

and 0.6 cm of the posterior aspect. On cross section the lesion is
smooth,

tan—white and solid penetrating 1.5 cm in depth abutting the deep soft
tissue

aspect. The mucosa surrounding the lesion is soft and red-gray.

Digital images are taken. Representative tumor and normal is procured
for the

head and neck spore tissue bank.

Ink Code:

Yellow— superior aspect

Orange-inferior aSpect

Blue— anterior aspect

Green— posterior aspect

Black— deep aspect

Red- banked area

Section code:

lA— superior aspect, radial sections

1B— inferior aspect, radial sections

lC—II— full thickness cross sections of lesion anterior to posterior
from

superior aspect to inferior aspect

Part 2 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and "posterior

pharyngeal margin". It consists of a 1.2 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm tan to red—
brown soft

tissue evaluated intraoperatively. The remaining frozen section tissue
15

submitted labeled 2AFS.

Part 3 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and "right
pharyngeal

wall margin”. It consists of a 2.0 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm strip of tan-yellow
focally

cauterized soft tissue evaluated intraoperatively. The remainder of
frozen

section tissue submitted labeled 3AFS.

Part 4 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and "soft palate
margin". It consists of a 2.4 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm strip of gray-yellow
focally

cauterized soft tissue evaluated intraoperatively. The remainder of
the

frozen section tissue is submitted labeled 4AFS.

Part 5 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and "base of
tongue".

It consists of a 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm tan—red focally cauterized soft
tissue

evaluated intraoperatively. The remainder of frozen section tissue is
submitted labeled SAFS.

Part 6 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and "deep
margin". It

consists of a 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm tan—pink cauterized soft tissue
evaluated

intraoperatively. The remainder of the frozen section tissue submitted
labeled 6AFS.

Part 7 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and "right neck
dissection L 2—4". It consists of an unoriented 14.0 x 5.0 x 1.3 cm
portion

of soft, yellow—pink, lobular, focally hemorrhagic and cauterized
fibroadipose

tissue. The specimen is arbitrarily divided into three equal portions
and on

dissection multiple ovoid and elongated, smooth, soft to moderately
firm, tan

to pink-red lymph nodes ranging 0.2 cm to 2.8 cm in greatest dimension
are

identified.

Section code:

7A— (1) bisected lymph node, one end of specimen

7B-C- intact lymph nodes from one end of specimen

7D— intact lymph nodes, mid aspect of specimen

7E— intact lymph nodes, opposing end

Part 8 is labeled with the patient's name, initials XX and "new soft
palate

margin". It consists of 1.0 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm pink—grey soft tissue
entirely

submitted labeled 8A.

Time in formalin: 25 hours

MICROSCOPIC:

Microscopic examination substantiates the above diagnosis.

The following statement applies to all immunohistochemistry, Insitu
Hybridization Assays (ISH & FISH), Molecular Anatomic Pathology, and
Immunofluorescent Testing:
The testing was developed and its performance characteristics
determined by
the Department of Pathology, as required by
the CLIA
‘88 regulations. The testing has not been cleared or approved for the
specific use by the 0.8. Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA has
determined such approval is not necessary for clinical use. Tissue
fixation
ranges from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 84 hours.
This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments of 1988 ("CLIA") as qualified to perform high—complexity
clinical
testing. Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA, ASR's used in this
laboratory
have been established and verified for accuracy and precision.
Additional
information about this type of test is available upon request.
