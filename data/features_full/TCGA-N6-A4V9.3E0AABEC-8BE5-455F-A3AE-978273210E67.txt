COMMENT:

The typical bipheslc pattern of carcinoearcoma is seen In approximately 20']. of this tumor. The carolnomatoue
component forms gland with high-grade nuclei and focal squamous differentiation. The reminder 80% of the tumor Show:
a high-grade sarcomatoue component with areas of chondroid I myxoid matrht. Furthermore. although a few tumor cells
are seen in underIylng myometrlal blood vessels. they are Interpreted as "section artifact”: definite Iymphovaecular space
invasion Is not seen.

The companion pelvic wash Is negative for malignant cells-

CASE SYNOPSIS:
SYNOPTIC - PRIMARY UTERINE ENDOMETRIAL CARCINOMA a. CARCINOSARCOMA : HYSTERECTOMY
SPECIMENS
TUMOR TYPE: Carcinosarooma (malignant mixed Mullerian tumor)
TUMOR SIZE: Maximum dimension: 72 mm

PERCENT OF ENDOMETRIAL SURFACE INVOLVEMENT:
Anterior endomyometrium: 10 %. Posterior endomyometrium: 10 %

DEPTH OF INVASION: Less than 112 thickness of myometn‘um
ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION: No

LYMPH NODES POSITIVE: Number of lymph nodes positive: 0
LYMPH NODES EXAMINED: Total number of lvmnh nodes examined: 19
T STAGE, PATHOLOGIC: pT1a

N STAGE. PATHOLOGIC: pNO

M STAGE, PATHOLOGIC: Not applicable

FIGO STAGE: iA

Comment:

The tumor is large (7.2 cm) but is attached to the endometrium via a short pedicle and
therefore endometrial surface invoivementiiminimai.
