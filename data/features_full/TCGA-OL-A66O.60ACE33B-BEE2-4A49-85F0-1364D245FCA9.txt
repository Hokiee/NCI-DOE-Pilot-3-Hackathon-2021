Effective I this Checklist utilizes the 7th edition TNM staging
system for breast of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJ CC) and the
International Union Against Cancer (UICC).

Clinical History:
Right Breast Cancer

Comment
P63 and myosin heavy chain immunohistochemical stains are performed and show a
loss of myoepithelium associated with the invasive component.

Specimens Received:

A: Right breast implant

B: Right breast with axillary contents
C: Additional nodes right axilla

Gross Description:

The specimens are received in three containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.

A. The first container is additionally identified as, 'right breast implant'.
Received in container is a 14 x 14 x 4.5 cm white, round, plastic hardware
ﬁlled with liquid material. Gross photograph is taken. The specimen is for
gross evaluation only.

B. The second container is additionally identiﬁed as, 'right breast with

axillary contents‘. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 268 gm simple
mastectomy specimen. There is a 15 x 6.5 cm capsule pocket implant in posterior
inferior aspect of specimen. The specimen isoriented with a double short suture
designating the superior aspect and a double long suture designating the lateral
aspect. The breast measures 15.5 cm from medial to lateral, 14 cm from superior
to inferior, and 2.3 cm from anterior to posterior. On the anterior surface is

13.3 x 5.3 cm yellow—tan ellipse of skin with a 4.8 x 3.8 cm areola and a 1.3 x

1 cm raised nipple. The nippleoareolar complex reveals no evidence of

ulceration or retraction.

The specimen is inked as follows:

anterior—superior — blue;

anterior-inferior — green;

posterior — black.

The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral (slice #1) to medial into 13

slices to reveal a 2.8 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm grey—tan, irregular—shaped, rubbery lesion
(lesion #1) in slices #6 through #8, which is 0.3 cm from deep margin. There is

a 1.1 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm pink-tan, oval nodule (lesion #2) in slice #7, which abuts

the capsule pocket and less than 0.5 cm from lesion #1. There is a hemorrhagic
area of dense parenchyma measuring 2.8 x 1.5 x 1 cm in slices #9 through #10,
which is 1.2 cm from the deep margin. The remainder of the specimen consists of
approximately 30 % dense gray-white ﬁbrous breast parenchyma and 70 % lobulated
yellow adipose tissue. No additional masses or nodules are grossly identiﬁed.
Multiple gray-tan, rubbery axillary lymph nodes ranging from 0.3—1.2 cm are
dissected.

B3: Lesion #1, slice 6

B4: Lesion #1, slice 7

BS: Lesion #1, slice 8

B6: Lesion #2 and adjacent lesion #1, slice 7
B7: Lesion #3, slice 9

B8: Lesion #3, slice 10

B9: upper~outer quadrant slice 4
B10: lower-outer quadrant slice 5

Bl 1: upper-inner quadrant slice 8

B12: lower—inner quadrant slice 1 1

B1 3: 4 lymph nodes

Bl4-B15: 3 lymph nodes

B16: One lymph node, trisected

B17: One lymph node, bisected

Bl 8-B19: One lymph node, serial section
B20: 4 lymph nodes

C. The third container is additionally identiﬁed as, 'additional nodes right
axilla‘. Received fresh and placed in formalin are 2 yellow—tan, soft tissue

fragments measuring 0.5-1.5, which are entirely submitted as Cl.
