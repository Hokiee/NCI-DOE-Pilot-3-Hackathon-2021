microscopic examination of the described speciments) and rendered or confirmed
the rapid diagnostes) related thereto.

GROSS DESCRIPTEON: .
The specimen is received fresh, in four parts, each labeled with the patient's

name and unit number.

Part A, "left lobe liver wedge", consists of a 100.4—g liver wedge resection
(9.0 x 7.2 x 4.2 cm) with a cauterized parenchymal resection margin (9.0 x 4.2
cm, inked blue). On cut sectioning, there is a white/tan focally
(approximately 10%) necrotic tumor (5.0 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm) that grossly abuts the
liver capsule (inked black) and is located 1.0 cm to the parenchymal resection
margin. A representative section of the parenchymal resection margin is
submitted as FSA. A representative section of tumor and normal liver is
submitted for tissue banking. Representative sections are submitted for
histological examination. '

Micro A2: Tumor, quick fix, 2 frags,-

Micro A3: Tumor and capsule and tumor and uninvolved liver parenchyma, 2 frags,
RSS.

Micro A4: Uninvolved liver, 1 frag, -

Part B, "sigmoid colon", consists of an unoriented segment of colon (16.8 x 2.9
cm in diameter) with two stapled resection margins (4.9 cm and 3.6 cm, both
inked black). The specimen is open to reveal a centrally ulcerated mass (5.0 x
4.0 x 1.2 cm) with raised borders that is 5.0 cm to the 4.9 cm stapled
resection margin, 7.0 cm from the 3.6 cm stapled resection margin, and 2.6 cm
to the mesenteric resection margin (16.8 x 2.3 cm, inked orange). There are
two tan/black tattoos (#1 5.0 x 2.5 cm and #2 4.0 x 3.5 cm). Tattoo #1 is
located 2.6 cm to the 4.9 cm stapled resection margin and 1.2 cm from the
ulcerated mass. Tattoo #2 is located 4.1 cm to the 3.6 cm stapled resection
margin and 1.2 cm from the centrally ulcerated mass. Tattoos #1 and #2 are
located 7.2 cm from each other and are on opposite sides of the ulcerated mass.
Underlying the tattoo #1 is a submucosal firm nodule (0.8 x 0.8 cm} that is
located 0.8 cm from the 4.9 cm stapled resection margin and 4.0 cm to the
ulcerated mass. Underlying tattoo #2 is a submucosal nodule {1.0 x 0.8 cm)
located 6.1 cm to the 3.6 cm stapled resection margin and 2.5 cm from the
ulcerated mass. There is an area of serosal puckering immediately deep to the
centrally ulcerated mass (1.5 x 0.5 cm) that is located 4.0 cm.from the
mesenteric resection margin, 7.5 cm from the 4.9 cm stapled resection margin,
and 7.0 cm from the 3.6 cm stapled resection margin. GrOSs photos are taken
and representative sections are submitted for histological examination.
