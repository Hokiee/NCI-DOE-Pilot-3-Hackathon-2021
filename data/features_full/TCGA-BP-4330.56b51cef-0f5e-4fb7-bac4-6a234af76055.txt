DIAGNOSIS:

l) KIDNEY, LEFT; RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY:
H RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CLEAR CELL T¥PE, NUCLEAR GRADE
II/IV. THE PATTERN OF GROWTH IS ACINAR. THE TUMOR GREATEST
DIAMETER IS 12.0 CM. THE TUMOR EXTENDS THROUGH THE RENAL
CAPSULE BUT IS CONFINED WITHIN GEROTA'S FASCIA. NO INVASION
OF THE RENAL VEIN IS IDENTIFIED. ALL SURGICAL MARGINS ARE
FREE OF TUMOR. THE NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY SHOWS A SINGLE
CYST, 2.0 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION. THE ADRENAL GLAND IS
UNREMARKABLE.

2) LYMPH NODE, SUPERHILAR PERIAORTIC; EXCISION:
h THREE LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/3).

3) LYMPH NOSE, PARAwAORTIC; EXCISION:
H TEN LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/10) (SEE NOTE).

NOTE: SOME OF THE LYMPH NODES SHOW GRANULOMATOUS LYMPHADENITIS.
FEW OF THE GRANULOMAS SHOW NECKOSIS, SPECIAL STAINS FOR
MICROORGANISMS WILL BE REPORTED AS AN ADDENDUM. A BENIGN
VASCULAR LESION IS IDENTIFIED IN THE PERIRENAL ADIPOSE TISSUE.
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL EVALUATION TO FOLLOW.

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Gross Descri ﬁe": —

1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled,
”Left Kidney and Adrenal Gland". It consists of a product of a
left radical nephrectomy weighing 1,050 grams and measures 17.0
cm from superior to inferior, 14.0 cm from medial to lateral and
8.0 cm from anterior to posterior. The periadrenal adipose
tissue in the superior aspect is serially sectioned to reveal a
adrenal gland which measures approximately 3.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm.
Serial sectioning reveals unremarkable, cut surfaces.
Approximately, 3.0 cm medial to the adrenal gland is a perirenal
lymph node which measures 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. The renal vein is
patent, the attached segment of ureter measures approximately
10.0 cm and is patent throughout. The ureter is opened and
unremarkable. Serial sectioning reveals the mass measures 12.0 x
11.5 x 8.0 cm. Cut surfaces are yellow—orange and focally
hemorrhagic. Focal area of tanewhite, fibrous regions are
identified. In the superior pole is a simple renal cyst which
measures 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. It occupies approximately
80% of the kidney. The fibrous component represent approximately
20% of the tumor.
