Gross Descrigtion

Six specimens are received, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.

Specimen A is received fresh for intraoperative consultation and is labeled "10R lymph node." It consists of multiple fragments of

soft blacWe specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis in cassette
"A1FS."

Specimen B is received fresh for intraoperative consultation and is labeled as "right upper lobe." It consists of a lung lobe
measuring 4.5 x 13.0 x 3.0 cm and weighing 141.0 grams. There is a ﬂeshy tan mass with lobulated borders that puckers the
overlying pleura (inked blue) and measures 1.7 x 1.7 x 2.5 cm. It is 5.0 cm from the bronchial margin. The surrounding
parenchyma immediately adjacent to the mass is hemorrhagic. The uninvolved parenchyma is emphysematous. The bronchial
' ‘ ' ‘ n diagnosis in cassette "B1FS." Additional representative sections are submitted as follows.

Specimen C is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and as "right #11 lymph node." The

specimen consists of multiple fragments of black soft tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm in aggregate. The specimen is entirely
submitted in cassette "C1."

Specimen D is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and as "4R lymph node." The

specimen consists of multiple fra ments of black soft tissue measuring 1.6 x 1.3 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in
cassette "01-" *

Specimen E is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and as "#7 lymph node." The

specimen consists of multiple fra ments of black soft tissue measuring 1.6 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted entirely in

Specimen F is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and a "#9R lymph node." The

specimen consists of two fra ments of ft tissue measuring 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.1 cm. The specimen is submitted entirely in
