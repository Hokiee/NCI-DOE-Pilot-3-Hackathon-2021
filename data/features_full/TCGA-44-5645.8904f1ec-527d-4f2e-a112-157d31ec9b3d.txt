SPECIMEN
Left upper lobe

CLINICAL NOTES
CLINICAL HISTORY: Lung lesion.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS
AFS: Lung, left upper lobe, resection — Atypical glandular
liferation, suspicious but not diagnostic for malignancy.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
Received is a container labeled with the patient's name,
medical record number and "left upper lobe". The specimen
consists of a single stapled wedge biopsy of lung measuring 9.5 x
6.5 x 5 cm in greatest dimensions. The pleural surface is inked
and
the specimen is serially sectioned. On cut section there is a 3.2

2.2 x 1.8 cm tan rubbery mass which is adjacent to the pleural
surface. This mass is greater than 0.6 cm from the nearest stapled
margin. RS—AFSl, Al—A9 representative sect s of the mass; AlO
representative section of stapled margin.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Sections of the left upper lobe demonstrate a markedly
atypical glandular proliferation.

The slides were referred to the-. The final report was
generated: "The submitted slid ft upper lobe reveal
atypical epithelioid cells characterized by ample cytoplasm and
irregular nuclei with prominent nucleoli. These atypical cells are

growing in a glandular pattern and focally appear to grow along
alveolar septa. In addition to the cytologic atypia there is

 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
cellular crowding with nuclear overlap and focal
pseudostratification. I agree these morphologic features are
supportive of a well differentiated adenocarcinoma. The rather
compact architecture in some areas and fibrosis is suggestive of an
invasive process. It is difficult to assess for visceral pleural
invasion, and although there is a suspicious area (block 6), I

recommend to assess with an elastic stain.
