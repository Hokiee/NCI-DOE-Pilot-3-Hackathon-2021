SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Patient: Specimen #:

FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued):

** Report Electronicallv Siannd Out **

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY:
Left breast carcinoma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

Received fresh is a 167 gm modified radical mastectomy specimen with the
following measurements: breast 12.6 x 11.6 x 1.6 cm, overlying ellipse of
nipple-bearing skin 7.2 x 5.5 cm, attached axillary contents 12.5 x 3.5 x
0.9 cm. Ink code: blue = superior superficial, green = inferior
superficial, black = posterior. The skin is notable for a 2.0 cm well
healed scar near the lateral edge of the ellipse. Examination of the
axilla reveals multiple firm lymph nodes.A seperate mass is present in
the upper outer quadrant measuring 2.0 x 1.4 x 1.4 cm.

The breast is then serially sectioned revealing extensive white fibrous
tissue with a 1.2 cm multiloculated biopsy cavity with associated
hemorrhage and fat necrosis in the lower outer quadrant.

Sections of the tumor mass and skin and breast samples for

protocol with matching paraffin sections are follows: cassette A1 grossly
normal skin (medial tip), cassettes A2 and A3 2.0 cm tumor mass from upper
outer quadrant, cassette A4 1.7 cm lymph node, high axilla (grossly
positive), cassette A5 1.8 cm grossly normal lymph node, high axilla,
cassette A6 biopsy cavity site, lower outer quadrant, cassette A7 grossly
normal fibrous tissue, lower outer quadrant (approximately 2.0 cm from
biopsy cavity) cassette A8 grossly normal fibrous tissue, upper outer
quadrant, cassette A9 grossly normal fibrous tissue upper inner quadrant,
cassette A10 grossly normal fibrous tissue lower inner quadrant, cassette
A11 representative sections of nipple and scar from skin, cassette A12
biopsy cavity deep margin lateral, cassette A13 biopsy cavity superior
medial, A14 biopsy cavity inferior medial, A15 four additional lymph nodes
from axillary tail, A16 two additional lymph nodes from axillary tail,
cassette A17 one lymph node bisected from axillary tail. "
