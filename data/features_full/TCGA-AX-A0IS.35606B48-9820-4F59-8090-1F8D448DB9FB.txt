3.0 x 1.5 cm. The specimen is dissected for lymph nodes, there are six pink-tan ovoid
lymph nodes identified, ranging from 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm to 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. All
lymph nodes identified are submitted as follows:

CASSETTE SUMMARY:

Cassette 3A: Two lymph nodes.
Cassette 33: Two lymph nodes, hivalved, one inked black.
Cassette 3C: Two lymph nodes, bivalved, one inked black.

Received in formalin, labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes" and with the patient's name,
is an aggregate of irregular portions of yellow-tan lobulated adipoae tissue, 5.0 x
3.5 x 1.5 cm. The specimen is dissected for lymph nodes, there are four pink~tan
ovoid lymph nodes identified, ranging from 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm to 2.5 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm.
All lymph nodes identified are surndtted as follows:

CASSETTE SUMMARY:

Cassette 4A: One lynph node bivalved.
Cassette AB: Two lymph nodes bivalved, one ixksd black.
Cassette 4C: One lymph node.

Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and "uterus
with bilateral tubes and ovaries", is a 148 gram specimen including an unopened uterus
(8.5 x 6.5 x 4.7 cm), right fallopian tube (6.5 cm in length x 0.8 cm in diameter),
right ovary (3.3 x 2.8 x 1.2 cm), left fallopian tube (5.5 cm in length x 0.7 cm in
diameter) and left ovary (2.5 x 2.5 x 1.3 cm). The exocervix is tan brown and has a
rough granular appearing mucosa and measures 3.3 x 1.7 cm. The external 05 is narrow
and measures 0.2 cm in diameter. There is no attached parametrium. On bivalving the
uterus the endocervical canal is 1.0 cm in length and appears tan—white to focal
tan-brown. No gross lesions identified in the cervix. The endometrial cavity
neasures 5.3 cm in length and 3.0 cm from cornu to cornu. There is a polypoid,
friable tan pink tumor with a papillary surface seen to expand the endanetrial cavity,
4.0 x 3.0 x 1.6 cm. The tumor is grossly seen to extend more deeply, 1.6 cms in the
anterior myometrium. 2.0 cms thickness. Also identified are two leiomyomas in the
anterior body of the uterus, both leiomyomas are submucosal and measure 0.7 x 0.6 x
0.4 cm and 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm. Cut surface of both leiomyomas have a tan—white
whorled bulging appearance. No areas of hemorrhage or necrosis are identified. The
myomeLrium is tan—pink and measures 2.0 cm in maximum thickness. Both fallopian tubes
are patent and have fimbriated ends. No gross lesions identified. Both ovaries have
a smooth white outer surface and cut surface of bilateral ovaries shows multiple
corpora albicantia. No other gross lesions are identified. A portion of the left
fallopian tube and tumor were submitted for research purposes. The specimen is inked
as follows: anterior fundus and body of uterus — blue, posterior fundus and body of
uterus ~ black and entire cervix inked green. The cervix is amputated and the deep
endocervical margin is inked yellow. The specimen is representatively sampled and
submitted as follows:
