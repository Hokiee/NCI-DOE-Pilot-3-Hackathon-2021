Clinical Information
Hepatitis E, liver tumor

go 5/.21/14

 

Biagnosis
Liver, Resection:

- Combined cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma,
moderately to poorly differentiated, see synoptic report
- Maximum tumor dimension 3.5cm
- Small to medium—sized vessel vascular invasion identified
— Margins of resection are negative for carcinoma
- No lymph nodes submitted or identified
— Non—neoplastic liver shows features compatible with chronic viral
hepatitis B, with grade 1 inflammation and stage 3 fibrosis

(Betta-Ludwig)

— Non—neoplastic liver shows multiple/frequent von Meyenburg complexes
(bile duct hamartomas), see comment in synoptic

*ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS (select all that apply):
Chronic hepatitis (specify type): hepatitis B Virus (HBV)
ANCILLARY STUDIES:
Immunohistochemistry: neoplastic cells are positive for cytokeratin 7 (variable, strong
to moderate), cytokeratin AEl/AES (variable, strong to moderate), cytokeratin Cam5.2
(variable, strong to moderate), HepParl (focal, weak), CD10 (focal, canalicular pattern),
and pCEA (focal, canalicular pattern).
*CLINICAL HISTORY: '
Hepatitis B infection.
*COMMENT(S) :
The tumor shows morphologic features of combined cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular
carcinoma, in roughly equal proportions. Although immunophenotype is predominantly of
cholangiocellular type, cytokeratin staining is weaker in areas of morphologic ECG, and
focal CDlO/pCEA staining is present in these areas. In addition, many bile duct
hamartomas/von Meyenburg complexes (VMCs) are seen in non-neoplastic liver, as well as in
direct continuity with neoplasm (no definite in situ/dysplastic transformation of VMCs is
appreciated, however). Multiple VMCs is considered by many authors to represent a mild
form of ductal plate malformation (DPM). Likewise, there is a documented though rare
association of DPM/VMCs with cholangiocarcinoma. The significance of this finding, with
regards to potential causality for (or contribution to) neoplasia, is unclear in the
pathology literature. With regards to vascular invasion, scattered foci of tumor present
in medium-sized portal/septal type veins are identified. "Major" venous invasion, per
AJCC/CAP definition, cannot be assessed in this specimen.
Gross Description
Received is a single specimen cont-‘--“ "‘- "--"isirinn and specimen container are
labelled with the patient‘s name, . The cassette and identifiers
are labelled with the Surgical Number
A. Specimen is received fresh. The container is designated as "A. Liver tumor“. The
specimen consists of a portion of liver weighing 53.1 g and measuring 8.2 x 5.0 x 3.5 cm.
0n the capsular surface is an area of puckering measuring 1.7 x 1.5 cm. Area is dyed
orange. The resection margin is dyed blue. On sectioning a firm tan mass is identified
measuring 3.5 x 2.6 x 2.6 cm. This mass corresponds to the area of capsular puckering and
comes within 0.3 cm of the closest blue painted resection margin. The remainder of the
liver parenchyma is grossly unremarkable.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Al/z. sections the mass in relation to the area of capsular pucksring
A3. section of the mass relation to the blue painted resection margin
A4/5. further sections of the mass

A6. sections of grossly unremarkable liver parenchyma

A7—A11 additional sections of unremarkable liver parenchyma
