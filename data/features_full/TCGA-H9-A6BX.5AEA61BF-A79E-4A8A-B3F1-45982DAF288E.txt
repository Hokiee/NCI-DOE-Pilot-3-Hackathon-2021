Gross Description:

Received in formalin, labeled "prostate and seminal vesicles"

is a 47 g, 4.0 cm in length by 4.6 cm from right to left by 3.9 cm from anterior
to posterior prostate gland with attached bilateral seminal vesicles and
segments of vas deferens. The tan-pink. focally cauterized external surface is
inked as follows: right yellow, left black, posterior red. The base and apex
margins are coned and step-sectioned. Sectioning reveals a tan—pink,
heterogeneous, focally cystic parenchyma with minimal periurethral nodularity.
No definitive tumor is identified.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

1 apex margin;

2 base margin;

3-11 right posterior prostate sequentially from apex to base, entirely
submitted;

12-21 left posterior prostate sequentially from apex to base, entirely
submitted;

22 right anterior prostate, cross-section two;

23 left anterior prostate, cross—section three;

24 right anterior prostate, cross-section four;

25 left anterior prostate, cross-section five;

26 junction of right seminal vesicle and prostate gland;

27-28 right seminal vesicle sequentially from proximal to distal;

29 junction of left seminal vesicle and prostate gland;

30-31 left seminal vesicle sequentially from proximal to distal.

Microscopic Description:

The final diagnosis of each specimen incorporates the microscopic examination
findings.
