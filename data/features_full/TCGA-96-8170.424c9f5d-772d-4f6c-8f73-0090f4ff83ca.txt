CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
- with a RLL squamous cell carcinoma.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in three parts, each labeled with the
patient's name.

1. Part one is received in saline, labeled 'lung, superior segment,
right lower lobe'. It consists of a lobe of the lung measuring 9 x

5.5 x 3.5 cm. Two stapled lines are noted measuring 9 cm and 2.5
cm. The pleura is grey-pink, glistening and mottled lightly with

fine black streaks. The bronchial margin measures 2 cm and the
vascular margin measures 1 cm. Cut surface of the specimen reveals
a light tan firm nodule measuring 1.5 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm, located 1.5 cm
from the overlying pleura and 2 cm from the bronchial resection
margin. The remainder of the parenchyma is pink-red, crepitant

and blotchy. Representative sections are submitted.

2. Part two is received in formalin, labeled '5th rib right'. It
consists of a segment of rib measuring 10.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. Scant
blood and fibroconnective tissue is attached on the outer surface of
bone. The cut surface appears trabeculated and unremarkable.
Representative sections are submitted in one cassette following
decalcification.

3. Part three is received in saline, labeled 'station 12 lymph
node'. It consists of five irregular fragments of tan-brown soft
tissue ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 cm in greatest dimension and
measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm in aggregate. Entirely submitted in
one cassette.
