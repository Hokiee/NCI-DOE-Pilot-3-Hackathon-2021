GROSS DESCRlPTlON:

A. RiGl—lT PELVlC LYMPH NODES
Received in formalin are multiple tan-pink fragments of ﬁbrofatty tissue aggregating to 4.0 x 3.0 x 1.0
cm. Dissection reveals one tan-pink lymph node measuring 3.8 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. The specimen is
serially sectioned and submitted entirely in cassettes Al—AS.
B. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES
Received in formalin are multiple tan—pink fragments of ﬁbrofatty tissue aggregating to 2.0 x 1.8 x 1.0
cm. Dissection reveals 3 possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm to 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm.
Section code:

81: 2 possible lymph nodes

32-83: 1 lymph node serially sectioned
C. PROSTATE
Received fresh is a 39 gm resected prostate, 5.0 cm from left to right, 3.6 cm from apex to base, 3.5 cm
from anterior to posterior, with attached segments of right and left seminal vesicle and vas deferens.
The capsule is tan-pink, smooth and intact. The specimen is inked as follows: apex-red, anterior’
orange, right lateral-green, left lateral—yellow. base—blue, posterior-black. After removal of the apex and
base the remaining prostate weight is 23 gm. The specimen is serially sectioned from apex to base at
4-5 mm intervals to reveal beige—tan spongy tissue. No nodules can be grossly identiﬁed. A portion of
the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement level 2 and a shave of level 3. The remainder of the
specimen is submitted as follows:

01: level ‘1 right anterior

C2: level 1 right posterior

03: level “i left anterior

C4: level i left posterior

05: level 2 capsule right anterior

06: level 2 right posterior capsule

07: level 2 left anterior capsule

08: level 2 left anterior capsule

09: level 4 right anterior

010: level 4 right posterior

01 is level 4 left anterior

012: level 4 left posterior

013: right apex perpendicular sections taken

014: left apex perpendicular sections taken

015: right base with periurethral margin

016: left base with periurethral margin

017: right lateral base

018: left lateral base

019: right base

020: left base

021: representative section of right seminal vesicle

022: representative section of right vas deferens

023: representative section of left seminal vesicle

C24: representative section of left vas deferens

DIAGNOSIS:
A. LYMPH NODES, RIGHT PELVlC. EXClSION:
— TWELVE LYMPH NODES WlTH NO EVIDENCE OF ADENOCARCINOMA (0112)

B. LYMPH NODES, LEFT PELVJC, EXClSlON:
- THREE LYMPH NODES WETH NO EVEDENCE OF ADENOCARCENOMA (0/3)

 

 

C. PROSTATEPROSTATECTOMY:

— PROSTATEC ADENOCARCENOMA, GLEASON GRADE 4+3 (TOTAL SCORE : 7), INVOLVING THE
RIGHT AND LEFT LOBES OF PROSTATE AND GLAND CONFENED (SEE SYNOPTEC REPORT).
