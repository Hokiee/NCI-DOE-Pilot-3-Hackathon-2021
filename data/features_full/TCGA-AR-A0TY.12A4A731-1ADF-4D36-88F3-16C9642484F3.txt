Breast, right, simple mastectomy: Inﬁltrating ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 111 (of 111) is identiﬁed
forming a 2.4 x 2.2 x 1.8 cm mass (AJCC pT2) in the right upper outer quadrant of the breast. A
signiﬁcant component of in situ carcinoma is not identiﬁed. A benign ﬁbroadenoma (0.6 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm)
is identiﬁed in the upper inner quadrant. Skin, nipple, and resection margins are free of tumor (closest is
anterior/superior, free by 3.8 cm). Multiple (8) right axillary lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

 

Lymph nodes, right axillary sentinel, excision: Multiple (7) right axillary sentinel lymph nodes are
negative for tumor [AJCC pNo(sn-)]. Blue dye is identiﬁed in right axillary sentinel lymph nodes No.1A
and No.1B. Blue dye is not identiﬁed in right axillary sentinel lymph nodes No. 1C, No.1D, No.1E, No.2,
and No.3. Immunohistochemical cytokeratin stain was performed on the parafﬁn embedded sentinel
lymph node tissue and conﬁrms the H&E impression.

Breast, left, simple mastectomy: Benign breast tissue with non-proliferative ﬁbrocystic changes
characterized by apocrine metaplasia, cyst formation, and multiple (2) ﬁbroadenomas (upper inner
quadrant, 0.9, and inferior central, 1.1 cm). A single left axillary lymph node is negative for tumor.

Estrogen and progesterone receptor analysis and Her-2/NEU have been ordered on parafﬁn embedded
tissue from the right breast.
