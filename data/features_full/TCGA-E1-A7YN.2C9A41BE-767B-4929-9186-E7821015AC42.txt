CLINICAL HISTORY:

Brain tumor. Brain neoplasm NOS. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a
«year—old female with a history of breast cancer status post bilateral
mastectomies, hypertension, GERD who presented with complaints of visual and

olfactory seizures, headache and right temporal well—differentiated

astrocytoma status post brain biopsy and is being electively admitted for V
craniotomy and tumor resection

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Brain tissue", received fresh for frozen section and placed in formalin at
on g is a 3.5 x 2.1 x 1.3 cm piece of tissue, representative
sections frozen and submitted in AFl (some tissue taken by tissue bank).

Tissue from block AFl is placed entirely in block Al the remaining tissue is
submitted in block A2—3.

B. "Brain tissue", received fresh and placed in formalin at on
are multiple pieces of pink—white soft tissue consistent with brain (4 x 3 x
1.3 cm in aggregate) which are submitted entirely in blocks 31—3.

, INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
> A. "Brain‘tissue":AFl (rep)— glioma, low grade

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

Microscopic examination shows brain diffusely infiltrated by an astrocytic
neoplasm. Endothelial proliferation and necrosis are not seen. There are some
gemistocytes and a brisk perivascular and leptomeningeal lymphocytic
infiltrate. Astrocytes are immunopositive for GFAP. HAM-56 and LCA highlight
inflammatory cells and microglia. The MIB—l index is approximately 10%.

COMMENT: A MULTIVARIATE SURVIVAL ANALYSIS OF PATIENTS WITH ANAPLASTIC
ASTROCYTOMAS REVEALS THAT THE HAZARD OF SHORT SURVIVAL AMONG PATIENTS WITH 0—2
ABNORMAL MARKERS (OUT OF 4) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THAT FOUND WITH
PATIENTS WITH >2 MARKERS (P—0.037) EVEN AFTER ADJUSTMENT FOR AGE EFFECT.

MGMT PROMOTER METHYLAT ION IDENTIFIED

Methodology:

DNA is isolated from formalinwfixed, paraffin—embedded (FFPE) specimen.
Molecular analysis of the MGMT gene is performed by methylation—specific PCR.

Molecular-based testing is highly accurate but as in any laboratory test, rare
diagnostic errors may occur.
