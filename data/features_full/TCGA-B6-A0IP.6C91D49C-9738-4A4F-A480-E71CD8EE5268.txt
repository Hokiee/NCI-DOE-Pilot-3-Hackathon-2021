GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. "Left breast mass (AF1)", received fresh for frozen section. A 7.3 x 4.4 x
2.5 cm ovoid fragment of soft yellow fibroadipose which has been previously
sectioned revealing a 1.7 x approximately 1.6 x 1.4 cm firm stellate
circumscribed yellow-tan mass. The surgeon has stated the margins are not an
issue on this specimen the mastectomy is to be performed. A portion of the
lesion has been previously submitted as frozen section AFl. Fresh tissue for
ER/PR was not submitted. The remainder of the specimen composed of soft yellow
lobulated adipose tissue without additional focal lesions.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Al— frozen section AFl remnant.

A2— additional section of mass.

A3—A4— additional tissue in the area of lesion.

AS— representative of the remainder fibroadipose tissue.

B. "Left breast", received fresh and placed in formalin. A 701.6 gram, 35 x
18.3 x 3.0 cm left breast and axillary dissection is received. The breast is
21.1 x 18.3 x 3.0 cm in greatest dimension and the axilla is 7.5 x 6.5 x 1.5
cm in greatest dimension. The overlying ellipse of white skin is 19 x 8.2 cm
in greatest dimension. The nipple is located slightly inferior and medial on
the skin surface and is retracted and exhibits a crusted skin surface and is
approximately 1 cm in greatest diameter with a 3.5 cm areola. Superior to the
nipple is a 7.5 cm long recent linear suture surgical incision. The surgical
margin is marked with blue ink and the specimen is sectioned revealing a fresh
biopsy cavity, approximately 7.5 x 6.5 x 6 cm in greatest dimension lined by
soft hemorrhagic adipose tissue. The biopsy cavity is grossly within 0.5 cm
with closest deep surgical margin, 12.5 cm with the closest inferior soft
tissue surgical margin. The tumor does not grossly identified within the
specimen. The remainder of the breast tissue is composed of soft lobulated
fibroadipose tissue with only small amount of pink-tan fibrous breast tissue.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Bl— nipple.

82— representative through incision on skin surface.
BB- biopsy cavity in closest deep margin.

B4—BS- additional sections of biopsy cavity wall.
86— closest superior soft tissue margin.

87— closest inferior soft tissue margin.

BB- representative upper inner quadrant.

39- representative lower inner quadrant.
BlO—representative lower outer quadrant.

Bll- representative upper outer quadrant.

 

The axillary dissection is removed from the mastectomy specimen, divided into
proximal, mid, and distal thirds and examined for lymph nodes. Several lymph
node candidates from 0.5 to 3.2 cm are identified, predominantly in the distal
third of the specimen. Lymph nodes are submitted as follows:

BIZ- one lymph node candidate from proximal.

313- one bisected lymph node candidate from proximal.
314— one lymph node candidate from mid.

315— one bisected lymph node candidate from mid.

318— one bisected lymph node candidate from distal.
B19— one bisected lymph node candidate from distal.
BZO~ one bisected lymph node candidate.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. "LEFT BREAST MASS" (EXCISIONAL BIOPSY):

INFILTRATING CARCINOMALVLOBULARHTXPE.

GROSS TUMOR SIZE, 1.7 X 1.6 X 1.4 CM (GROSSLY).

SIZE OF INVASIVE COMPONENT 1.7 CM.

LYMPHATIC/VASCULAR INVASION: ABSENT.

MULTIFOCAL TUMOR: NO.

IN SITU CARCINOMA PRESENT, OCCUPYING LESS THAN 5% OF TUMOR (SLIDE A-2,
A-4).

TYPE OF IN SITU CARCINOMA: LOBULAR TYPE.

EXTENSIVE INTRADUCTAL COMPONENT: NO

STATUS OF NON-NEOPLASTIC BREAST TISSUE INCLUDES PROLIFERATIVE
FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES WITH ATYPIA, INTRADUCTAL PAPILLOMA (SLIDE A-3)
MICROCALCIFICATION PRESENT IN ASSOCIATION WITH BENIGN BREAST TISSUE.
SURGICAL MARGIN STATUS: (SEE COMMENT)

ESTROGEN/PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR AND CELL CYCLE ANALYSIS PENDING.

B. "LEFT BREAST WITH AXILLARY DISSECTION", (REMOVAL):

RESIDUAL INFILTRATING AND IN-SITU CARCINOMA: ABSENT.

STATUS OF NONrNEOPLASTIC BREAST TISSUE: INTRADUCTAL PAPILLOMA, ATYPICAL
DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA.

MICROCALCIFICATIONS PRESENT IN ASSOCIATION WITH ATYPICAL DUCTAL
HYPERPLASIA.

NIPPLE STATUS: FREE OF TUMOR.

SKIN STATUS: FREE OF TUMOR.

MUSCLE STATUS: NOT SAMPLED.

SURGICAL MARGIN STATUS: NEGATIVE.

LYMPH NODE STATUS: NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY IN 16 LEFT AXILLARY LYMPH

NODES, (0/16).

COMMENT: The surgical margin of the biopsy specimen was not evaluated, as the
mastectomy was performed during the same procedure, per conversation with the
surgeon. The resection margins of the mastectomy specimen are negative for
tumor.

specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).

ADDENDUM 1:

Tissue was sent to the . for assay of the estrogen
and progesterone receptors. The estrogen receptor activity was judged to be
POSITIVE with an estimated FMOL value of 154. The progesterone receptor
activity was judged as POSITIVE with an estimated EMOL value of 106. Please
refer to for a complete report.
