Tumor necrosis/treatment effect: not identified
Vascular invasion: not identified

Perineural invasion: not identified

Capsular invasion: not identified

Margins: uninvolved by tumor; tumor is 0.5 cm from closest margin
(segment 4 parenchymal margin)

Lymph nodes: none submitted in this specimen (see specimen B)

Background liver: macrovesicular steatosis involving 65% of hepatic
parenchyma with grade 1 steatohepatitis; no evidence of bridging
fibrosis or cirrhosis on H & E stain (results of trichrome stain
will be issued in an addendum)

AJCC Pathologic TNM Stage: pTl pNO
NOTE: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information

available at the time of this report, and is subject to change
pending clinical review and additional information.

Clinical History:
—year—old female, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

Gross Description:
Received are three appropriately labeled containers.

Container A is additionally labeled "gallbladder."

Previously opened or disrupted: no

Measurements: 7.5 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm

External surface: green/gray, smooth and glistening

Luminal contents: green, viscous fluid

Stones present: none

Mucosa: green and velvety

Wall thickness: less than 1 mm

Other comments: cystic duct node is present and measures 0.5 x 0.3
x 0.2 cm, tan/pink

Block #: A1, cystic duct margin, en face, representative section and
cystic duct lymph node

Tissue remains in formalin.

Container B is additionally labeled "portal lymph nodes." It holds
six fragments measuring 1. 3 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm in aggregate of
yellow/tan fibrofatty tissue.

Tissue is entirely submitted in blocks B1— B2,

Container C is additionally labeled "Segment 4, 5; short
stitch=Segment 6 margin, long stitch=Segment 4 margin. " The
specimen contains a 110 gram, 1.5 x 6.9 x 4.3 cm partial
hepatectomy. The specimen is received with a short stitch

marking the Segment 6 margin which is inked blue, and a long stitch
marking the Segment 4 margin which is inked black. The capsule is
tan/brown and smooth.

Sectioning reveals a 3.5 x 3.1 x 2.9 cm well circumscribed
yellow/tan mass.

Within the center there is a focally hemorrhagic area. The mass is
0.2 mm from the capsule, 0.6 cm from the blue margin, and 0.5 cm
from the black margin. No additional masses or lesions are
identified. The remaining liver parenchyma is tan/brown and smooth.

Both tumor and normal are submitted to Tissue Procurement.

Block summary:

Cl - mass with respect to the capsule

C2 — mass with respect to the blue margin
C3 — mass with respect to the black margin
C4—C5 — representative sections of the mass
C6 - normal liver away from mass

Tissue remains in formalin.

Addendum

The purpose of this addendum is to issue results of special stains

performed on liver tissue from specimen C that is uninvolved by
tumor.

Addendum Comment

DPAS: no evidence of involvement by alpha—l—antitrypsin deficiency
(no DPAS positive globules identified within hepatocytes)
Trichrome: no evidence of increased fibrosis (stage 0)

Reticulin: highlights normal hepatic framework

Iron: no evidence of increased iron deposition
