SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Patient: Specimen #: - --

FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued):

:- . ** Rennrr n1pntronicallv Signed Out **

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY:
—year—old . with diagnosis of left breast cancer.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. LEFT BREAST LUMPECTOMY received fresh labeled with the patient's name
and designated "LEFT BREAST LUMPECTOMY" is a piece of fatty tissue, 8.0 x
5.0 x 6.5 x 1.8 cm, impaled with a needle localization wire. The specimen
is oriented with sutures (short=superior, long=latera1) and is inked as
follows: Red=medial and lateral, blue=superior, green=inferior,
yellow=anterior, black=posterior. The needle localization wire enters the
specimen at the lateral margin. The.tip of the wire is embedded in the mid
portion of the specimen. The accompanying specimen radiograph is reviewed
and shows numerous calcifications in the area of the wire localization.
The specimen is serially sectioned, medial to lateral, revealing a poorly
differentiated mass, 3.0 cm in greatest dimension, corresponding to the
area of radiographic abnormality. The mass is firm and nodular, and
contains at least two well—circumscribed masses with a tan, gritty cut
surface. The largest of these well—circumscribed masses measures 1.2 cm in
greatest dimension. The 3.0 cm mass abuts the superior and inferior
margins. The remaining tissue is variably fatty and fibrous; the fibrous
tissue is firm and nodular in some areas. Sections of tumor and grossly
normal fibrous tissue are harvested for the rotocol. Matched
sections for histology are as follows:

Al—Az: Tumor.

A3: Grossly normal fibrous tissue, medial portion of specimen.
A4: Medial most margin of Specimen.
AS—AG: Full thickness cross section.
A7-A9: Full thickness cross section.
A10—A12: Full thickness cross section.
A13—A15: Full thickness cross section.
A16—A18: Full thickness cross section.
A19-A21: Full thickness cross section.
A22—A23: Full thickness cross section.
A24—A25: Full thickness cross section.

B. NEW MEDIAL MARGIN, LEFT BREAST received in formalin labeled with the
patient’s name and designated "NEW MEDIAL MARGIN, LEFT BREAST" are two
fragments of yellow/tan fibrofatty soft tissue. The largest fragment
measures 7.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm and the smaller tissue fragment measures 4.5 x
2.5 x 1.3 cm. The specimens are received unoriented. The specimens consist
of lobulated, yellow/tan soft tissue with areas of interdigitating white,
fibrous areas. The outer surface of each specimen is inked in black. Cross
sectioning through both tissue fragments demonstrates homogeneous, yellow,
lobulated soft tissue with interdigitating white, fibrous strands. No
discrete masses or nodules are found.

Cassette key:

Bl-B8: Largest tissue fragment.
B9—B15: Smaller tissue fragment.

C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE NUMBER ONE received in formalin labeled with the
patient’s name and designated “SENTINAL LYMPH NODE NUMBER ONE" is a 0.7 cm
grossly apparent lymph node and a small amount of adherent fat. A small
portion of the node is harvested for the protocol. The remaining
lymph node is submitted.

D. AXILLARY CONTENTS received in formalin labeled with the patient's name
and designated "AXILLARY CONTENTS" are three fragments of

fibrofatty soft tissue measuring 3.5 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm in aggregate.
Sectioning through the specimen demonstrates a mottled, yellow/red
fibrofatty soft tissue.

Cassette key:
D1—D2: Largest tissue fragment.

D3: Second largest tissue fragment.
D4: Remaining tissue fragment.
