COMMENT:
A high percentage of tumor cells (greater than 20%) immunostaining for MGMT has been reported to be
associated with a relatively diminished response to Hence,

the 20% result in this case suggests the possibility of a reiativeiy diminished response to—

Recent studies have shown that co-expression of EGFRvIII and PTEN as detected by immunostainin
was si nificantl correlated with a clinical response of glioblastomas to EGFR kinase inhibitorsﬁ
Hence the preserved expression of PTEN in this case, when combined
with EGFRViII mutation, permits a possibility of this tumor being responsive to EGFR-kinase inhibitors.

Retained expression of PTEN was found to be associated with a more favorable ro nosis in patients
with high grade aromasﬁ

PATiENT: _ ACCESSION Ir:

Presence of activated (phosphorylated) p42l44 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (pMAPK) often is
indicative of an upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. It has been shown to be associated -

with a relative resistance to radiation therapy in gliobiastoma muiiiforme

Correspondingly. a high percentage of tumor cells immunoreactive to pMAPK antibody in this case may
predict a relative resistance to radiation therapy.

The use of these tests in guiding therapy has limitations. Review of the relevant literature and clinical
correlation is advised. These test results do not obligate or preciude use of the reievant therapeutic
agents.

FLUORESCENCE IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION (FISH) for EGFR in BRAIN

 

Tissue Block: I
RESULTS: NORMAL EGFR & chromosome 7 signal pattern
Number of cells evaluated: 40

INTERPRETATION:

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FiSH) analysis on a brain tumor sample from this patient with
Abbott Molecular probes specific for the centromere of chromosome 7 (control probe) and the
short arm (EGFR-7p12) of chromosome 7 was performed. The control sample gave expected
results.

These studies did not detect any aberrant signal patterns of EGFR in the 40 nuclei examined,
with an EGFR gene to Cep 7 signal ratio of 1.1

NOTE:
1. Samples are considered positive in brain if the EGFR to CEP 7 signal ratio is 2 2.0 in 2 10% of anaiyzed cells or
tumors with four or more copies of the EGFR gene in 2 40% of the ceils (high poiysomy).

2. Samples are considered inconclusive, requiring consult with the pathologist, in brain if the EGFR to CEP 7 signai
ratio Is 2 2.0 in <10% of analyzed cells or when four or more copies of the EGFR gene in < 40% of the cells.
