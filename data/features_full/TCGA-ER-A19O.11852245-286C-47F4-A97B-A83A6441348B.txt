COMMENT:

Part 2: A panel of lmmunostains (CD 68, HMB 45, melan A, $100 and tyrosinaee) was performed on the sentinel lymph

node (block 2A). All the melanoma markers are negative except for C058, which is positive in macrophages. and $100 in
dendritic cells.

Part 3: The positive large lymph node shows more or less complete replacement by metastatic malignant melanoma. The
capsule is seen at places which is Intact with reactive changes around. However some areas show no capsule with tumor

at the cut margin suggestive of previous sectioning observed on gross examination. The remaining nodes are small and
free of neoplasm.
