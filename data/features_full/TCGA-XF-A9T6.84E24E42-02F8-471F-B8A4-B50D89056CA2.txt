CLINICAL INFORMATION:

GROSS. EXAMINATION:

A: The specimen is received fresh from the 0.R. and labeled "Rt distal ureter".
It consists of a portion of ureter measuring 0.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in
diameter. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in AFS.

B: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Lt distal ureter".
It consists of a portion of ureter measuring 0.4 cm in length and 0.4 cm in .
diameter. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in cassette BFS.

C: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Bladder, uterus,
ovaries". It consists of a cystectomy specimen with attached uterus, bilateral
fallopian tubes and ovaries. Overall, the specimen measures 20.5 x 14 x 5.5 cm.
Peritoneum attached posteriorly measures 18 x 12 x 0.1 cm and appears smooth and
glistening with no involvement by tumor. The overlying perivesical fat (resection
margin) is inked black and the specimen is opened along the anterior aspect of the
bladder to reveal a polypoid exophytic mass involving the right lateral wall, close
to the right ureterovesical junction and compressing the right intramural ureter.
The mass measures 5 x 4 x 3 cm and grossly invades through the wall (depth of
invasion 2 cm) into perivesical fat but not extending to the inked surgical
resection margin. The uninvolved bladder wall measures 1 cm in thickness. The
remaining bladder mucosa appears unremarkable with no other lesions or masses being
identified. Bilateral ureterovesical junctions are identified and are patent. The
ureters are then opened. The right attached ureter measures 9 cm in length and 0.5
cm in circumference and appears unremarkable, and the left attached ureter measures
8 cm in length and 0.5 cm in circumference and appears unremarkable. The uterus is
symmetrical and measures 7 x 4.5 x 2 cm, and the serosal surface is smooth and
glistening. The exocervix measures 4 cm in diameter with a slit— like as measuring
1.4 cm. The exocervical mucosal surface is smooth and glistening with no gross
abnormality. The uterus is bivalved revealing endometrium that is tan-yelIOw in
color appearing atrophic. A small polypoid lesion on the anterior aspect of the
endometrium measures 0.7 cm. The myometrium ranges between 0.8 and-1 cm in
thickness and appears unremarkable. The right ovary measures 2 x 0.8 and 0.5 cm and
appears unremarkable. The left ovary measures 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm and appears
unremarkable. The right fallopian tube measures 5 cm in length and ranges between
0.3 and 0.6 cm in diameter and appears unremarkable. The left fallopian tube
-measures 4 cm in length and ranges between 0.3 and 0.5 cm in diameter, with a focal
tubal uterine adhesion that measures 0.6 cm with multiple firm adjacent nodules

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

AFS—BFS: See final microscopic~diagnosie.

C: Sections of the bladder show a deeply invasive poorly differentiated papillary
urothelial carcinoma (Clo—15) that extends through the entire wall into perivesical
fat (€10,12,13.15). A single focus of vascular invasion is seen (C12). Resection
margins are free of malignancy. There is no associated in situ carcinoma (flat

lesion), either adjacent to the invasive tumor or in additional random sections of
the bladder mucosa.

D—S: See final microscopic-diagnosis.
