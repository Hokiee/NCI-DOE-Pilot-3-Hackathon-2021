C. Soft tissue, pancreatic portal vein interface, excision: Fibrous
tissue with granulation tissue and acute inﬂammation.

D. Pancreas, neck margin, excision: Negative for tumor.

E. Head of pancreas, gallbladder, duodenum, and portion of jejunum;
Whipple resection: Invasive moderately differentiated ductal
adenocarcinoma is identiﬁed forming a solid mass (4.3 x 3.5 x 3.1
cm) located in the pancreatic head. The tumor extends beyond the
pancreas to involve the peripancreatic soft tissue, duodenal wall,
and bile duct. Both angiolymphatic and perineural invasion are
absent. Tumor necrosis is absent. The uncinate margin is positive
for invasive carcinoma whereas the portal vein groove and cystic
duct margins are negative. The adjacent non-neoplastic pancreatic
parenchyma shows marked chronic pancreatitis. A single (1) cystic
duct lymph node is negative for tumor. The gallbladder demonstrate
chronic cholecystitis. Multiple (2 of 10) regional lymph nodes are
positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.

F. Lymph nodes, peripancreatic, excision: Multiple (2) lymph nodes
are negative for tumor.

G. Lymph nodes, gastrocolic, excision: Multiple (5) lymph nodes are
negative for tumor.

H. Lymph nodes, celiac axis, excision: Multiple (2) lymph nodes are
negative for tumor.

This ﬁnal pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic
examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the
specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are
reviewed to conﬁrm these ﬁndings. Any substantive changes
identiﬁed on permanent section review will be reﬂected in a
revised report.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received fresh labeled "common hepatic artery lymph nodes" is a

2.5 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. All
submitted. Grossed by

B. Received fresh labeled "common hepatic artery lymph node #2" is a
2.5 x 2.1 x 0.7 cm aggregate of adipose tissue, lymphatic tissue not
identiﬁed grossly. All submitted. Grossed by ‘

C. Received fresh labeled "pancreatic portal vein interface“ is a
0.7 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm portion of tan-pink tissue. All submitted.
Grossed by

D. Received fresh labeled "pancreatic neck margin" is a 3.0 x 2.1 x
0.8 cm portion of pancreatic tissue with orientation. All
submitted. Grossed by

E. Received fresh labeled "head of pancreas, gallbladder, duodenum,
portion of jejunum, and pancreas stones" is a Whipple specimen
consisting of 34.0 cm in length portion of duodenum, 7.0 x 5.2 x 4.8
cm portion of pancreas, and a 16.5 x 5.5 x 2.4 cm gallbladder. The
pancreatic uncinate margin is inked yellow and shaved. The portal
vein groove is inked blue and submitted perpendicularly. There is a
4.3 x 3.5 x 3.1 cm annular and diffusely inﬁltrative mass within '
the pancreas at the uncinate margin. The mass extends to
peripancreatic soft tissue. A stent is present within the common

bile duct. Multiple irregular fragmented stones are identiﬁed

within the pancreas and pancreatic duct system, showing obstruction
toward the ampulla and dilation toward the pancreatic neck margin.
The gallbladder contains no choleliths. Peripancreatic lymph nodes
are identiﬁed. Representative sections are submitted. Grossed by

F. Received fresh labeled "peripancreatic lymph nodes" is a 2.9 x

2.2 x 0.8 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. Lymph nodes
submitted. Grossed by

0.7 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. Lymph nodes
submitted. Grossed by

H. Received fresh labeled "celiac axis lymph nodes" is a 2.9 x 1.0 x
0.8 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. Lymph nodes
