C: Prostate

Clinical History

Chief complaint: ( ,1 This is a y.o. year old male who
was diagnosed with prostate cancer. His Gleason score is 8, and
his preoperative PSA was 9.1.

Gross Description

A. Received labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes" is a 2.5 x 1.5 x
1.5 cm soﬁ yellow adipose tissue which contains a single 1.5 cm
tan-yellow potential lymph node candidate. The tissue is entirely
submitted as follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY:
A1 single potential lymph node candidate, bisected
A2 remaining fat

B. Received labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes" is a 3.7 x 3 x 1.7
cm soﬁ yellow adipose tissue, which contains 5 potential lymph
node candidates measuring from 0.2 em up to 1 cm in greatest
dimension. The tissue is entirely submitted as follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Bi 3 intact potential lymph node candidates

B2 2 potential lymph node candidates, each bisected, one
inked black for differentiation

B3 remaining fat

C. Received labeled "prostate“ is a 131 g, 8 x 6.3 x 5.5 cm
prostate. The left and right seminal vesicles are 2 x 1.2 x 0.5
cm and 2.5 x 1.3 x 1 cm, respectively. The left and right vas
deferentia are 1 x 0.5 cm and 1 x 0.5 cm, respectively. The
surrounding soft tissue is roughened, tan and lobular, especially
at the leﬁ apex and inked leﬁ half blue and right half black.
The specimen is sectioned from apex to base to reveal bilateral
and multiple pale yellow nodularities, left lateral greater than
right with focal extension to the capsule, especially at the left
apex. No additional abnomalities are apparent and representative
sections are submitted as follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY:

C1-5 left distal urethral margin, radial

C6-8 right distal urethral margin, radial
C9-11 leﬁ proximal urethral margin, radial
C12-14 right proximal urethral margin, radial

C15 leﬁ distal prostate, anterior
C16-17 leﬁ distal prostate, posterior
C18 right distal prostate, anterior
C19 right distal prostate, posterior

C20-21 Ieﬁ mid prostate, anterior
C22-23 left mid prostate, posterior
C24-25 right mid prostate, anterior
C26-27 right mid prostate, posterior

C28-29 leﬁ proximal prostate, anterior
C30—31 left proximal prostate, posterior
C32-33 right proximal prostate, anterior
C34-35 right proximal prostate, posterior

C36 left seminal vesicle, posterior leﬁ prostate, leﬁ
vas deferens margin

C37 right seminal vesicle, posterior right prostate,
right vas deferens margin

Tissue is obtained for tumor bank and genomic studies.
