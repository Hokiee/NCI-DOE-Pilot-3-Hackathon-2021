Diagnosis:

A. - H.) LUNG AND LYMPH NODES, LEFT LOWER LOBE AND MEDIASTINAL/HILAR NODES
(N6, N7, N9L, N10L, AND N11L), LOBECTOMY AND EXCISIONS:
- INVASIVE MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA, WELL DIFFERENTIATED.
- Spanning 15.5 cm, involving almost entire left lower lobe.
- Tumor does not penetrate pleura (PLO).
- Post-obstructive pneumonitis present...
- MARGIN STATUS: NEGATIVE.
- Closest margin is bronchial at 0.3 cm.

- ZERO OF EIGHT LYM PH NODES INVOLVED BY TUMOR (0/8).

PATHOLOGIC TUMOR STAGING SUMMARY:

Histologic type and grade: Invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma, low-grade
(well differentiated).

Primary tumor: pT3, 15.5 cm in greatest dimension (see comment).
Regional lymph nodes: pNO, 0/8.

Distant metastasis: NIA.
Pathologic tumor stage: "3 (see comment).

Margin status: R0, negative.
Lymphatic and perineural invasion: Not identiﬁed.

COMMENT: Although the tumor grossly Spans 15.5 cm in greatest dimension, the
invasive component inciting a desmoplastic response is smaller (probably just over 3
cm) and raises a possible alternate -otential classiﬁcation as T2a and stage IB

based on recent literature from

(addendum to follow). A short panel of immunostains argues against colorectal
origin (CK7+ICK20-ICDX2-Nillin-); and lends some immunohistochemical support to a
pulmonary origin (CK7+, weakly Napsin-A positive, although it is negative for TTF-1).
The extensive involvement of the LLL argues strongly for a pulmonary primary.

Gross Description:
A. The specimen is labeled left lower lobe and is received without ﬁxative. It consists of a heavy and

dense lobe of lung which measures 17 x 10.5 x 9 cm and weighs 528 grams. The pleural surface of the

lung shows some blotchy violaceous discoloration near the hilum. The pleural surface is otherwise pale

red with a translucent appearance. In the posterior-inferior surface of the lung there is a prominent area of
retraction and irregularity involving an area approximately 4 cm in maximum dimension. The pleural
surface in this area is inked. At the hilum the bronchial margin is identiﬁed and removed as a thin shave

for frozen section. There are no obvious peribronchial nodes. Sectioning of the lung reveals an ill—deﬁned
pale yellow ﬁrm neoplasm underlying the area of pleural disruption. This neoplasm measures 6 cm in its
superior-inferior most extension, abutting the pleural surface of both the inferior-lateral portion of the lung
as well as the basilar surface (measuring 15.5 cm in superior-inferior axis). This neOpIasm generally blends
in perceptively with the surrounding beefy and dense lung parenchyma extending nearly to the apical

edge. There is a 5 x 3.5 cm area at the apical most portion of the lung which appears uninvolved by the
process, as well as a 1.2 cm area along the anterior-medial basilar edge of the lung. Sectioning ofthe

bronchi reveals no gross intrabronchial lesions. The stapled parenchymal margin is grossly negative by 3—5
mm. Representative sections of the subpleural mass are obtained for research purposes. Representative

sections are submitted. Section summary: A1) bronchial margin from frozen section, A2) vascular margins,
A3) lateral-inferior mass and overlying pleural surface (inked). A4-A5) additional sections of lateral inferior

mass. A5) sections of basilar surface of lung, AT-AB) sections of mid lower lung lobe, A9) sections of apical

lower lung lobe, A10—A1 1) section of bronchus and immediately adjacent pulmonary parenchyma (block
A11 for light decalciﬁcation).—

B. The specimen is labeled NHL and is received in formalin. It consists of two 0.6 - 0.7 cm fragments of
tan to dull red and anthracotic tissue which are submitted in cassette B1 .-

C. The specimen is labeled N10L and is received in formalin. It consists of a singl 0.9 x 0.6 cm tan
lymph node. The node is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in cassette C1.

 

D. The Specimen is labeled N9L and is received in formalin. It consists of a single violet-tan 1.5 x 0.3 x 0.7
cm lymph node. It is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in D1. -

 

E. The specimen is labeled NHL #2 and is received in formalin. It consists of a 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm
fragment of gray-tan and anthracotic tissue. It is trisected and submitted in cassette E1 . -

 

F. The specimen is labeled N11L #3 and is received in formalin. It consists of a single 0.7 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm
fragment of dull red tissue which is submitted intact in cassette F1 -

G. The specimen is labeled N6 and Is received in formalin. It consists of a 1.1 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm fragment of
soft ﬁbrofatty tissue. Within the fatty tissue there are two areas of anthracotic discoloratio ' vary from
0.6 - 0.2 cm in maximum dimension. The anthracotic areas are submitted in cassette G1.

 
 

H. The specimen is labeled N7 and is received in formalin. It consists of four fragments of reddish violet
and anthracotic tissue along with focal adherent fatty tissue. These four fragments vary from 0.6 cm in
maximum dimension to 1.8 x 1 x 0.7 cm. The largest fragment is serially sectioned and submitted in

cassette H1. The second largest fragment Is submitted intact in cassette H2. The two remaining fragments

are each bivalved and submitted in cassette H3 (larger inked). -

 

Microscopic Description:

A. The sections show an Invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma with lepidic growth pattern peripherally as
well as a central zone inciting desmOplastic response (the latter zone is estimated to be just over 3 cm).
The tumor consists of numerous glands lined by mucinous epithelium having low-intermediate grade

nuclei. The tumor abuts the visceral pleura and focally invades the elastic ﬁbers of that pleura (but does

not fully transgress the elastic ﬁbers of the pleura or penetrate to the visceral pleural surface). The
bronchovascular margin is negative (along with an adjacent benign peribronchial node, 071). All together

(including nodes in specimens B-H) there are eight benign lymph nodes (013).

Per request o-the tumor is stained to try to conﬁrm pulmonary origin. The tumor shows strong
expression of CK7, weak expression of Napsln, but is negative for: TTF-1. CDXZ, Villin, and CK20.
