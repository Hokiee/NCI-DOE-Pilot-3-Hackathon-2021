Microscopic Description: 94»)

Sections demonstrate a variably cellular glioma that diffusely infiltrates both the gray and white matter.
The majority of the tumor cells demonstrate prominent perinuciear halos. They consistently have round
to oval nuclei. Atypia is moderate. Cellularity is accentuated in a multinodular pattern. Neither
microvascular proliferation nor necrosis are identified. A few scattered mitotic ﬁgures are seen, but
these are insufficient by themselves to warrant classiﬁcation as anaplastic.

Tumor lD

Scattered MiB-l reactive cells are present throughout the tumor. However, even in the most
proliferative regions, a labeling index of only 2.2% is calculated. Combined with the other histologic
features, this does not warrant classiﬁcation as anaplastic/grade lll. Nevertheless, the cluster of
hypercellularity and degree of atypia is somewhat worrisome and close follow up is indicated.
