Gross description: Received fresh for frozen section labeled ", left renal mass" consists

ofa448 gram, 11x 9x
6.5 cm yellow—pink encapsulated mass. The specimen comes designated with

a clip at the base. The base is inked black and the area of the clip is
frozen for frozen section diagnosis. Further sectioning reveals yellow,
possibly necrotic cut surfaces. A piece of the specimen is sent to
Cytogenetics, and pictures are taken per surgeon. Representative sections
are submitted as designated for microscopic evaluation.

Designation of sections: ZFS frozen section. 2A tumor in relation to
normal. 2B—2E random sections all in relation to capsule. Please note
that cassette 2E contains sections in relation to base.

CYTOGENETIC ANALYSIS REPORTS
DIAGNOSIS: Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma

KARYOTYPE: Abnormal karyotype: 47,X,—.+7,+17[20]

RESULTS: The renal mass washarvested after three and four days in

culture. The chromosomes from twenty metaphases were counted and
analyzed, and three of these metaphases were karyotyped by G—banding. The
modal chromosome number was 47, and the cells were missing

chromosome and contained an extra copy of chromosomes 7 and 17. Loss of I
and trisorny for chromosomes 7 and 17 have been reported in cases of

papillary renal cell carcinoma and are consistent with this patient‘ s

diagnosis.
