(2. Container 0 is additionally labeled uterus. cervix. 880 and contains a 22 gram radical hysterLctomy specimen received with detached bilateral
adnexa. The specimen is comprised of uterine corpus (6.5 cm. in length by 5.5 x 5.1 cm.), ulerin cervix (4.5 cm. in length by 3.3 x 3.2 cm.), vaginal cuff
(1.5 cm. in length), right paracervical soft tissue (3.5 x 3.0 x 1.8 cm.), and left paracervicai soft tissue (4.5 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm). The corpus is smooth and
glistening. The ectocervicai mucosa is pink—tan glistening and features a yellow~tan granular rirnlsurrounding the 1.2 cm. patuious, patent 03. Sections
through the peracervicai soft tissue reveal a yellow-tan vascular cut surface along with three ﬁrm, fatty possible lymph nodes within the left paracervical
tissues. These possible lymph nodes range from 0.5 to 0.7 cm. in greatest dimension. The specimen is blveived to reveal a 5.5 x 4.0 cm. yellow-ten
ulcerated, fungating mass that involves the endocervical canal and is contiguous with the aforementioned cervical os granularity. This mass extends to
the level of the lower uterine segment and invades 1.5 cm. into a 1.6 cm. thick endocorvix. The triangular endometrium is pink-tan and glistening with an
average thickness of 0.2 cm. The surrounding myometrium is pink~ten ﬁbrous and slightly trabecuiated with an average thickness of 2.8 cm. No
myometrial nodules or lesions are identiﬁed.

The ﬁrst fimbrialed fallopian tube is 3.0 cm. in length and ranges from 0.5 to 0.7 cm. in diameter. The attached yellow~tan lobuiated ovary is 2.7 x 1 .8 x
0.9 cm. The cut surface is yellow—tan and ﬁbrous with a tan-orange corpus luteum and two unilooulated cysts. 0.3 and 0.4 cm. in greatest dimension.
The cysts feature smooth inner linings and contain clear, watery fluid.

The second fimbriated fallopian tube is 3.5 cm. in length and ranges from 0.4 to 0.7 cm. in diameter. The attached yellow‘tan lobulated ovary is 2.8 x 2.1
x 0.9 cm. The cut surface is yellow-tan and ﬁbrous with multiple gray~white corpora alblcentia.

Representative sections are submitted in cassettes 01-19 labeled ignated as follows: 1—rlght paracervicai soft tissue.
perpendicular. 2-ieﬂ paracervical soft tissue, perpendicular; B—three whole possible left paracert/icai lymph nodes: 4—-anterior vaginal cuff. on face; 5—-
posterier vaginal cuff. on face; 6 through 8—full thickness sections of anterior endocervix to lnclu do ectocervix in cassette 6; cassettes 9—bisected full
thickness posterior endcectocervix (notched ends adjoined); 10 and 1 1-full thickness posterior «Endocerle to include additional ectocervicai mucosa in
cassettes 011. 12. 1 2 is anterior lower uterine segment: 1 3—postenor lower uterine segment; i l and 15~full thickness anterior endomyometrium; 16
