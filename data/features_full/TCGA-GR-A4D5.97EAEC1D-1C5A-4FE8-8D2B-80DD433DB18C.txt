‘ t I'D

Intraopemtive Diagnosis:
Lymph node, level 213, excision (FSAl and touch prep): Lym 11 id ti e present, pending additional
workup. This was performed by Dr. no reported to Dr. r the phone by Dr. -

Source/Gross: '
The specimens are received fresh in three containers labeled -

Part A is designated "left level 2B lymph node" and consists of a 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm lymph node. The
specimen is bisected and entirely submitted for ﬁozen section diagnosis in cryoblock FSAI. Following
dozen section diagnosis, halfofthe Specimen is sent for molecular diagnostic studies (one piece —- 1.9 x 0.9
x 0.2 cm). The rcmsinderof the specimen is entirely submitted in block Al in B-plus for pemrenent
sections (one piece— 1.9 x 0.9 x 0.2 cm).

Part B is designated "right skin lesion" and consists of a 1.6 x 0.9 cm ellipse of skin Md: attached
subcutaneOus tissue measuring 1.2 x. 1.6 x 0.5 cm. The skin surface is white and mncmukable, missions
are identiﬁed. Sectioning demonstrates an. ill-deﬁned pale ares underlyhrg the skin surface. measuring 0.9 x
0.5 x 1.0 cm. ' .

The specimen is submitted as per the Lymphoma Study Group Protocol:

Touch props are made '— One.

Fixed in formalin for 24 hears — One piece, 1.4 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm, block Bl.

Frozen in _OCT for immunohistochemlcal studies — One piece, 1.1 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm.
Placed sterilely in medium for cytogenetlcs — One piece

Frazer: in foil for molecular diagnostic studies — One piece, 0.9 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm.
Fixed inB-plus -one piece, 1.1 x 1.0 x 0.4 block. block BZ.

Placed in cytcgenetio media for molecular research: One piece, 1.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm)

Part C is designated "left deep level 2 lymph node“ and consists of a 4.3 x 1.7 x 1.4 cm lymph node
candidate. Sectioning demonstrates a 2.7 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm tan-gray nodule. Adjacent to this larger nodule is s
smaller nodule which measures 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.

The entire specimen is submitted as per the Lymphoma Study Group Protocol:

Touch preps are made -— Two. ,

Fixed in formalin for 24 hours — Two pieces, 2.1 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm and 1.4 x 0.9 x 0.3 cm, cassettes Cl-C2.

Placed sterilely in medium for cytcgeneties — One piece, 1.4 x 1.9 x 0.3 cm.

Frozen in foil for molecular diagnostic studies - One piece, 1.9 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm.

Fixed in Baplus Ame pieces. 1.9 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm and 2.0 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm, blocks C3434.

WTERPRBTATION1 The parafﬁn markers indicate a reactive phenotype.

The in-situ hybridization tests for ka :1 and lambda 1i ht chains were developed and the perfonnenoe
characterisﬁos determined by unoperoxidase Laboratory. It has not been
cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has detemined that such
clemance or approval is not necessary. This testis used for clinical purposes. It should not be mgaxded as
investigation! or for resemh. This laboratory is certiﬁed under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
