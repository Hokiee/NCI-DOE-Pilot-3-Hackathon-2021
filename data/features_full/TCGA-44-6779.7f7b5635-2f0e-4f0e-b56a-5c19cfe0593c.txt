B. L4 lymph node
C. Level 10 lymph node
D. Level 5 lymph node
E. Subcarinal lymph node
F. Level 6 lymph node
G. Left lung

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Lung cancer.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS

FSA) R4 lymph node — Negative for malignancy.
FSB) L4 lymph node — Negative for malignancy.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. Part A is submitted fresh for frozen labeled "R4 lymph

node" consists of multiple fragments of tan-white and
yellow tissue admixed with anthracotic pigment. The aggregate
measurement is 4 x 2 x 0.5 cm. Submitted entirely for frozen
section.

B. Part B is submitted fresh for frozen labeled "L4 lymph

node" consists of multiple fragments of gray-red and yellow
tissue with an aggregate dime f 2 x 2 x 0.5 cm. Submitted
entirely for frozen section.

C. Received fresh, "level 10 lymph node", are two

slightly rubbery gray-black-red tissues, in keeping with
lymph nodes, measuring 0.35 cm. in greatest dimension and 0.7 x 0.5
x 0.5 cm. The larger tissue is bisected and the specimens are
entirely submitted in two blocks, as labeled. AS-2

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Smaller node in toto; 2 - bisected larger node.

D. Received fresh, labeled "level 5 lymph node", are two

slightly rubbery gray-black-red tissues, in keeping with
lymph nodes, averaging 1.1 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm. The specimens are
bisected and entirely submitted independently in two blocks (one
bisected node per cassette). AS-2

E. Received fresh, labeled "subcarinal lymph node", are

four slightly rubbery tan-gray-red tissues, in keeping with
lymph nodes, measuring up to 0.6 cm. in greatest dimension. The
specimens are submitted in toto in one block. AS-l

F. Received fresh, labeled "level 6 lymph node", are two

soft tan-red to gray-black tissues, in keeping with lymph
nodes, measuring 0.5 and 2.4 cm. in greatest dimension, with a scant
amount of associated adipose tissue. The larger node is bisected
and the specimens are entirely submitted in two blocks, as labeled.
AS—2

RY: l — Smaller node in toto; 2 - bisected larger node.

G. Left lung submitted fresh for tissue procurement

labelled "left lung" is an intact lung with two lobes
weighing 442 grams. There is a suture line present at the
amputation point of the main left bronchus, the left main pulmonary
artery and main left pulmonary vein. The pleural surface of the
lung is intact with a finely stippled anthracotic pigment present.
No obvious areas of puckering of the pleura or umbilication are
evident. Several small possible peribronchial lymph nodes are
present adjacent to the bronchial stump. There is a mass that is
palpable in the interlobar fissure. This appears to be below the
surface of the lung. Sections are placed through the mass and this
reveals a large tumor mass which is immediately inferior to the main
bronchus. The tumor mass measures maximally 6 x 5 x 4 cm. It
arises approximately 1 cm below the bronchial cuff margin that
grossly does not appear to be involved by tumor. There does appear
to be at least one lymph node which is partially involved by tumor

adjacent the bronchus. Portions of the t ormal lung are
submitted for procurement per request of Further
sectioning of the lung reveals a second present deep to

the pleural surface of the lower lobe. This pleural mass as central
necrosis and measures maximally 3 x 2 x 1.5 cm. It has the same
fleshy tan-white gritty cut surface as does the main tumor mass.
The upper lobe does not appear to have any discrete nodules. It is
crepitant gray-tan tissue without focal nodularity. Sections after

fixation.
BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — bronchial margin; 2 — vascular margin; 3 —
pleural margin of the main dominant tumor mass; 4-7 - dominant tumor

mass; 8-10 - secondary smaller tumor including pleural surface; 11 —
random left upper lobe; l2 - random left lower lobe; l3—l4 —
bronchial lymph nodes.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Microscopic sections of both lesions present in the left
lung have a similar histologic appearance. Both are
moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas with cells
exhibiting prominent eosinophilic cytoplasm. It is not clear from
the histology if this represents two separate primary tumors or an
intrapulmonary metastasis from the main lung tumor. Results of the
evaluation of the lung are summarized in the following template:

Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma.

Histologic grade: Moderate to poorly differentiated.

Primary tumor (pT): Two lesions are present. The larger lesion
measures 6 x 5 x 4 cm., the smaller lesion 3 x 2 x 1.5 cm. (pT2).
Margins of resection: Bronchial and vascular margins of resection
are free of tumor. Visceral pleural surface free of tumor.

Direct extension of tumor: Absent.

Venous (large vessel) invasion: Negative.

Arterial (large vessel) invasion: Negative.

Lymphatic (small vessel) invasion: Negative.

Regional lymph nodes (pN): Two of six bronchial lymph nodes contain

metastatic adenocarcinoma (2/6). All mediastinal lymph nodes are
negative (le).

Distant metastasis (pM): Cannot be assessed (pMX).

5, 3x6, 14x2

DIAGNOSIS

A.

Lymph node, R4, resection:
Negative for malignancy.

Lymph node, L4, resection:
Negative for malignancy.

Lymph node, level 10, resection:
Negative for malignancy.

Lymph node, level 5, resection:
Negative for malignancy.

Lymph node, subcarinal, resection:
Negative for malignancy.

Lymph node, level 6, resection:
Negative for malignancy.

Lung, left pneumonectomy:
Multicentric, moderate to poorly differentiated
adenocarcinoma. Bronchial, vascular and visceral pleural
surfaces are free of involvement by tumor.
Two of six peribronchial lymph nodes contain metastatic
adenocarcinoma (2/6).
