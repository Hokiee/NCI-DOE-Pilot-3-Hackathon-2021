FINAL DIAGI": .. ‘~:

UTERUS AND CERVI} “ BILATERAL ADNEXA, MICROSCOPIC ASSISTED VAGINAL HYSTERECTOMY WITH

BILATERAL SALPINGO-OJZ’HORECTOMY (166 GRAMS) -

. WELL DIFFERENTIATED ENDOMETRIOID TYPE ENDOMETRIAL ADENOCARCINOMA (see comment).
INVASIVE TUMOR IS CONFINED TO AN ENDOMETRIAL POLYP AND MEASURES 3.3 CM IN GREATEST

DIMENSION; THE POLYP INVOLVES APPROXIMATELY 20% OF THE POSTERIOR UTERINE WALL.
LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IS NOT IDENTIFIED.

EXTENSIVE COMPLEX ATYPICAL ENDOMETRIAL HYPERPLASIA.

CERVIX WITH BENIGN ENDOCERVICAL POLYP, NEGATIVE FOR NEOPLASM.

LEFT AND RIGHT OVARIES WITH PHYSIOLOGIC CHANGES, NEGATIVE FOR NEOPLASM.
RIGHT FALLOPIAN TUBE WITH PARATUBAL CYST, NEGATIVE FOR NEOPLASM.

LEFT OVARY WITH OLD SUTURE GRANULOMA, NEGATIVE FOR NEOPLASM.

COMMENT:

Cross refer pelvic wash specimhlch was negative for malignant cells. Previous diagnosis of complex
atypical hyperplasia is noted . Portions of this case were reviewed by —who
agrees with the above interpretation;
