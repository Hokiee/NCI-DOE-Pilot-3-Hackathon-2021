SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Patient:
II
IIIIII

Clinical Diaonosis s History:
year old with biopsy proven high grade leiomyosarcoma of right leg.
sresents today for radical resection.
\CLLD-4;>«ES

Specimens Submitted:
1: Right calf mass
2: Anterior margin of right calf

DIAGNOSIS: S§t¥<3:
1. Right calf, mass; excision:

-High grade spindle cell sarcoma morphologically compatible with high
grade leiomyosarcoma.
- Tumor shows focal oseeous metaplesia.

-Tumor infiltrates skeletal muscle and deep subcutaneous tissue.

-Tumor size:4.l x 3.1 x 2.0 cm.

~Mitotic rate: 20 per 10 hpfs

-No necrosis present. Nuclear pleomorphism is seen.

-Surgical resection margins are negative. Focally the tumor is within
1mm of posterior margin limited by fibrous and adipose tissue.
2. Right calf, anterior margin; excision:

—Benign skeletal muscle and fibre connective tissue.
-No evidence of malignancy.

Note: Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumor cells are positive for
h-Caldesmon, focally HERBS and negative for sun, desmin, 8-100, ENE—45 and
cytokeretin ARI/A33. Even though SMA and desmin are negative, the
morphological features and caldeemon positivity supports the above
diagnosis.

Some of the immunohistochemistry and 183 tests were developed and their
performance characteristics were determined by the Department 0! Pathology.
They have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is
not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not
be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratorv is certified
under t! as
qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL). AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

~tt Report Electronically signed Out **'

Gross Description:

1. The specimen is initially received fresh and labeled "Right calf mass."
It consists of one, irregularly shaped, soft, tan-brown piece of muscular
tissue (7.3 x 4.3 x 3.5 cm), to which is attached tan—white ellipse of skin
(4.1 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm). The skin surface and outer surface of the muscular
piece of tissue are both smooth and glistening. The specimen is received
with two surgical sutures, which are oriented as follows: "long stitch
anterior, short stitch superior.‘ The specimen is then anatomically oriented
and differentially inked as follows: anterior - yellow: posterior a green;
superior - blue: inferior - black; medial - red; lateral - orange. The
specimen is subsequently bisected transversely to reveal an ovoid. firm,
tan—white mass (4.1 x 3.1 x 2.0 cm), which has a whorling cut surface. A
portion of the mass and adjacent muscular tissue is submitted to Tissue
Procurement Services. The remainder of the specimen is serially sectioned to
reveal that the tumor is located within 0.1 cm of the inferior, medial, and
posterior margin; all other margins are grossly free of tumor. No hemorrhage
or necrosis is grossly identified on the cut surfaces. Representative
sections are submitted. All margins are perpendicularly sectioned and
submitted.

Summary of Sections:

TIP - skin tips

SK - Skin, in relation to underlying tumor mass
SM - Superior Margin

1M ~ Inferior Margin

MM - Medial Margin

LM - Lateral Margin

AM - Anterior Margin

PM — Posterior Margin

T1 - Tumor mess, one full thickness section

T2 - Tumor mass, second full thickness section

2). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled ' anterior margin of right
calf ' and consists of a piece of fibromuscular tissue measuring 4 x 2.5 cm,
and 1.5 cm thick. A stitch marks the new margin of excision, which is inked
black. No tumor is grossly identified. The tissue is serially sectioned
and entirely submitted.
