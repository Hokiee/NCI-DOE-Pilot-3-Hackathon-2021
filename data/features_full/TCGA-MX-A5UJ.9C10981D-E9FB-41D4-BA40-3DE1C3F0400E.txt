Gross Description:

1) The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "Distal gastrectomy'. It
consists of a distal portion of stomach with attached adipose tissue and
omentum. The stomach measures 15.0 x 8.5 x 3.0 cm in total dimensions and
has a pink tan smooth serosal surface. The attached omentum measures 15.0 x
9.3 x 3.0 cm and is grossly unremarkable. The specimen is opened to reveal
gray-tan centrally ulcerated polypoid tumor. The tumor is 2.9 cm from the
proximal margin and 0.5 cm from the distal margin. Representative shaved
sections of proximal and distal margins were submitted for frozen section.
The tumor measures 6.6 cm in length, and 5.7 cm in width. Sectioning of the
tumor reveals 0.6 cm depth of invasion to the serosa. The remaining gastric
mucosa shows gray-tan prominent rugae. Multiple lymph nodes are identified
in the perigastric adipose tissue, measuring from 0.1 cm to 1.3 cm in
greatest dimension. All identified lymph nodes are submitted. A portion of
the tumor is submitted for TPS. Photographs are taken.

Summary of sections:

FSCa - representative distal and proximal margins
FSCb - representative distal and proximal margins
FSCc - representative distal and proximal margins
PM — additional representative proximal margin
DH - tumor to distal margin. perpendicular
T-tumor

U - uninvolved gastric mucosa

0 - omentum
