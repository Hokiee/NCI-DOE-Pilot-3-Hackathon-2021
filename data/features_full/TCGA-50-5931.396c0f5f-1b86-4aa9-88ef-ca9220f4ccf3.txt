Addendum

Special stains were ordered for chromogranin, synaptophysin, and mucin to further characterize the tumor and to rule out
the possibility of a neuroendocrine origin for the tumor.

Chromogranin and synaptophysin stains were negative, consistent with the previous diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma.

Although the tumor shows clear evidence of gland formation, the mucin stain was negative, which is occasionaliyseen in
more poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas.

These results do NOT change the previously re‘ndered diagnosis of a moderately to poorly differentiated
adenocarcinoma.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

SUMMARY STATEMENT

This iobectomy specimen from “left upper lobe of lung” demonstrates a moderate to poorly differentiated
adenocarcinoma (3.3 cm.). The tumor has neuroendocrine features. The bronchial, vascular and pleural margins are free
of tumor. Six lymph nodes identified are negative for metastatic carcinoma. The TNM stage of this lesion is T2; M0; MX.

LUNG, LEFT UPPER LOBE, THORACOTOMY AND LEFT UPPER LOBECTOMY —
. INVASIVE MODERATELY TO POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA (3.3 CM.).
THE BRONCHIAL, VASCULAR, AND PLEURAL MARGINS OF RESECTION ARE FREE OF TUMOR.
AREAS OF TUMOR SUGGEST POSSIBLE NEUROENDOCRINE DIFFERENTIATION. SPECIAL STAINS HAVE BEEN
ORDERED AND THE RESULTS OF THESE STAINS WILL FOLLOW IN AN ADDENDUM.
TWO INTRAPARENCHYMAL LYMPH NODES (012), NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.
FOUR HILAR LYMPH NODES (Of-4}, NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.
SURROUNDING LUNG SHOWS CHANGES OF EMPHYSEMA.
TNM STAGE: T2; N0, MX.
