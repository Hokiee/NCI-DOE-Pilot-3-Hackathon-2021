MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
(Dr

"LESION (RT FOREARM) SUTURE PROXIMAL". An oriented ellipse of skin 35 x 15 x 10mm in depth,

orientated with a stitch at one tip marking proximal designated 12 o'clock. The 3 o‘clock margin inked blue
and the 9 o‘clock margin inked black. There is a subcutaneous nodule up to 8mm across. The entire nodule

embedded in one block (2 slices).

MICROSCOPIC REPORT

"LESION (RT F OREARM) SUTURE PROXIMAL".

The specimen consists of skin including subcutis. Microscopy shows nodular deposits of malignant tumour
mainly within the subcutis with an occasional nodule in the deep reticular dermis. The tumour is composed
of nests of epithelioid cells with one or more prominent nucleoli and moderate amount of eosinophilic
cytoplasm. The nodules are scattered throughout the subcutis and some appear to be within lymphatics. No
junctional or intraepidermal component is seen. The appearance is entirely consistent with recurrent“
melanoma. V ' M

Small islands of tumour extend to within 0.4mm of the deep margin. The closest peripheral margin is clear
by approximately 2.7mm at the level of subcutis (3 o'clock).
