The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the

cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60°/o of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak

HER2 protein expression), and in-house known HER2 ampliﬁed control tissue were evaluated along
with the test tissue. These control slides run along side of this patient's sample showed appropriate
staining. Adequacy of Specimen: Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma identiﬁed for

HER2 IHC 2+ results.
COMMENT
This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for Trastuzumab (Hereptin) therapy
(1,2). Clinical Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective
response and overall survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of
whether HER2 tumor status was determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to
adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease
recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2 protein over—expressed or gene ampliﬁed
invasive breast cancer (3).
HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved

(TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This
assay was not modiﬁed, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed.
Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results
in the medical literature (4), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of
staining performance within the Institute Pathology Department.
HER2 TEST VALIDATION
This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised
recommendations and guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing In Breast Cancer Task Force, and the
jointly Issued recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected
breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC as outline above and interpreted as, negative
(score O/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without knowledge of the previous reported
results.

These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as ampliﬁed or non-ampliﬁed and
the HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance
between the IHC and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC.
9 of the 80 cases were interpreted as equivocal by IHC and Of these 3/9 (33%) were non-ampliﬁed by
FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be ampliﬁed.

Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests
performance and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proﬁciency and the interpretation of
HER2 assays. The laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including
the CAP proﬁciency testing program.

Patthsion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit

Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER—2 NOT AMPLIFIED
Clinical Interpretation of results
Ampliﬁcation of the HER—2 gene was evaluated with interphase ﬂuorescence in-situ
hybridization (FISH) on formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn embedded tissue sections using a chromosome
17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the Pathology
Core Facility by Dr.. A majority of tumors cells displayed moderate polysomy 17
with 2 to 4 chromosome 17 signals and 2 to 4 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0,
consistent with no ampliﬁcation of the HER2/neu gene.

Block used F1 Source of case: RPCI
Tissue ﬁxation formalin-ﬁxed tissue Outside Case No: NA
Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes

HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.46
This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-Zineu signals by the total number of
CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic
mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded.
Method of ratio enumeration: manual count
Limitations
The Vysis Patthsion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is
intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free
and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding
adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into
consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status.
No

treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER—
2/neu
gene ampliﬁcation status alone.
Overview of this test
FDA APPROVED REAGENT
Patthsion HER—2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of
patients for whom Herceptin® therapv is being considered. These tests were performed in the
I, under the direction
of Dr.. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the
clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.
