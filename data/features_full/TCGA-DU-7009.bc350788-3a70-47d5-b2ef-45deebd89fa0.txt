 

BRAIN BIOPSY: OLIGODENDROGLIOMA- (MIB—l: 4%)

ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSIS:
ADDITIONAL TISSUE: OLIGODENDROGLIOMA {MIB-l: < 0.5%}-

Operation/Specimen: UPDATED REPORT
Brain tumor #1, frozen section. Brain tissue #2, frozen section.

Clinical History and Pre—Op Dx:

GROSS PATHOLOGY: Multiple 0.3—0.5 cm tissue fragments. Frozen
section
diagnosis: Glioma. In #1 and 3.

MICROSCOPIC: Sections show an oligodendrogljoma involving the white
'matter and the cortex. The tumor is moderately hypercellular with
mild

pleomorphism. Mitotic figures, endothelia] hyperplasia and necrosis
are not identified. This is a low grade oligodendroglioma, grade A in

ADDITIONAL MICROSCOPIC: Sections of the additional tissue retrieved
from the tumor bank that was removed from the radiologically enhancing
area show a low grade oligodendroglioma which is similar to the
original tissue fragment- Anaplastic features are not seen- The
proliferative index (MIR—1) is less than 0.5%.
