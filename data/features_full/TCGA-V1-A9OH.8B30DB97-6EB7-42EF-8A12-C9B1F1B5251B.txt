SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

 

FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS

A. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, dissection: No tumor in 12 lymph node fragments
(0/12).

B. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, dissection: No tumor in four lymph nodes (0/4).

C. Prostate gland and seminal vesicle, laparoscopic robot-assisted radical
prostatectomy:

- Prostate:

1. Prostatic adenocarcinoma, bilateral, Gleason score 5+3=8, with extracapsular
invasion, tumor at inked right bladder margin; see comment.

2. Nodalar hyperplasia.

— Seminal vesicles: Right and left seminal vesicles involved by prostatic
adenocarcinoma.

COMMENT:

The tumor is a mix of Gleason grades 5, 4, and 3 with predominately pattern 5 present. On slides C8
and C11, tumor is present immediately adjacent to the inked margin (< 0.1 cm) and positive at the
right bladder margin (slide C20).

. has reviewed slide C4 and concurs with the grade of tumor.

Specimen(s) Received

CzProstate and seminal vesicles (fresh)

Clinical ﬂlstory

The patient is m with prostate cancer who undergoes robot-assisted laparoscopic
radical prostatectomy.

Gross Description

The specimen is received in three parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record
number. Parts A. and B are received in formalin.

Part A, labeled "right pelvic lymph node," consists of multiple soft to firm, irregular, pink-tan/yellow
fatty tissue fragments measuring 4.4 x 3 x 1 cm in aggregate. Five candidate lymph nodes are found
ranging between 0.5 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm through 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is submitted as follows:
Cassette A1: Four candidate lymph nodes.

Cassette A2: One candidate lymph node.

Cassettes A3-AS: Remaining fatty tissue.

Part B, labeled "left pelvic lymph node," consists of multiple soft to ﬁrm, irregular, pink-tan/yellow fatty
tissue fragments measuring 2.7 x 1.7 x 0.4 cm in aggregate. Three candidate lymph nodes are found
ranging between 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 through 1.7 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted as follows:
Cassette 31: Three candidate lymph nodes.

Cassette 82: Remaining fatty tissue. '

Part C, received fresh and additionally labeled "prostate and sv," consists of a 49-gram prostate gland
with intact seminal vesicles/vas deferens bundles. The gland measures 4.0 cm medial—lateral, 3.5 cm
apex-base, and 4.0 cm anterior-posterior. The external surface of the gland is soft, red-tan and is
received with a single suture and a single metal clip. The seminal vesicles/vas deferens bundles are soft
and red-tan. The left measures 4.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm and the right measures 3.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. The
right vas deferens measures 3.0 x 0.5 cm and the left measures 2.0 x 0.5 cm. A palpable lesion is
noted along the right posterior mid. The right anterior surface of the gland is inked green, the left
anterior surface is inked blue, and the posterior surface is inked black. The apical and bladder margins
are removed, and the remainder of the gland is serially sectioned from apex to base into ﬁve serial

.. 4w 1 :-

slices of 5 mm average thickness. The seminal vesicles/vas deferens bundles are attached to serial slice
5. Serial slices reveal a vague, yellow area in the right posterior of slices 1, 2, 3 and 4, and another
vague, yellow, irregular area in the left posterior of serial slices 2 and 3. Following further dissection
and submission of tissue for pathologic evaluation, tissue is taken from slices 1, 2, 3 and 4 for research
purposes. The entire gland is submitted as follows:
