DIAGNOSIS:

A.Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes,
hysterectomy

and bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy: FIGO grade II (of
III)

endometrial adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, is
identified forming ”~I"I
a mass (6.1 x 2.1 x 1.9 cm), circumferentially involving
the

endometrial cavity. The tumor invades 1.8 cm into the
myometrium

(total wall thickness 1.8 cm). The tumor does not involve
the

endocervix. Lymphovascular space invasion is not
identified. The

tumor involves the left and right tube. The bilateral
ovaries are

uninvolved. The surgical margins are negative for tumor.
[AJCC

pT3a N1 MX].

B.Lymph nodes, right para-aortic above IMA, excision: One
of 2
lymph nodes are positive for tumor.

C.Lymph nodes, right para—aortic below IMA, excision: One
of 2
lymph nodes are positive for tumor.

B.Lymph nodes, presacral, excision: Three lymph nodes are
negative for tumor.

E.Lymph nodes, left para—aortic, excision: Two of 5 lymph
nodes are positive for tumor.

F.Vessels, left gonadal, excision: Negative for tumor.

This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic

examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation
of the

specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent
sections are

reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive
changes

identified on permanent section review will be reflected
in a
revised report.

DIAGNOSIS COMMENT:

An immunohistochemical stain for p53 was performed on
Block A8

(right fallopian tube) and was negative in tumor cells.
This

finding supports the above interpretation.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A.Received fresh labeled "uterus, right and left fallopian
tubes and ovaries" is a 150 gram uterus with attached
bilateral

tubes and ovaries and an unremarkable cervix. The uterine
serosa

has diffuse adhesions on posterior and anterior lateral
surface with

adipose tissue adhered to the fundus and anterolateral
surface.

There is a 6.1 x 2.4 x 1.9 cm mass involving the entire
endometrial

cavity which grossly appears to invade 1.6 cm into the 1.8
cm thick

myometrium. There is a 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm right ovary
with a smooth

outer surface and a solid cut surface with a 7.0 x 0.6 cm
right

fallopian tube. There is a 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm left ovary
with a

smooth outer surface and a solid cut surface with a 7.5 x
0.7 left

fallopian tube. Representative sections submitted.

B.Received fresh labeled "right para-aortic nodes above
IMA" is

a 5.1 x 1.9 x 1.2 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic
tissue. A11

lymphatic tissue submitted.

 

 

C.Received fresh labeled "right para-aortic nodes below
IMA" is

a 4.7 x 1.9 x 1.3 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic
tissue. All

lymphatic tissue submitted.

D.Received fresh labeled "presacral lymph nodes " is a 4.0
x

2.9 x 1.0 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.
All

lymphatic tissue submitted.

E.Received fresh labeled "left para-aortic nodes" is a 5.8
x

3.5 x 1.4 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.
All

lymphatic tissue submitted.

F.Received fresh labeled "left gonadal vessels" is a 4.8
cm in

length by 0.2 cm in diameter portion of unremarkable blood
vessel.

A representative section is submitted.
