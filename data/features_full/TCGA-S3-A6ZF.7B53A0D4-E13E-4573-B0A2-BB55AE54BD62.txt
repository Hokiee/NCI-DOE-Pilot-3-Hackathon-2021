NOTE: THE ASSAY WAS PERFORMED AS A REFLEX TEST AFT ER THE HEM/NEUIMMUNOSTAIN WAS 2+.

INTERPRETATION: - NEGATIVE FOR HERZ GENE AWLIFICATION.

SPECIMEN TYPE: The HEM is performed on a formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded tissue slide from
block C3.

DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSAY: The HERZ. assay enables the HERZ
gene and Chrl'I centromere to be co-hybridized and visualized via light microscopy 0n the same slide Speciﬁcally for this assay,
I-IERZ is detected by a diniu'ophenyl (DNP) labeled probe visualized utilizing SISH DNP (silver' in situ hybridization)
detection kit. The Chr17 centromere is targeted with a digoxigenin (DIG) labeled probe and detected using , ISH DIG
detection kit. Dual ISH staining results in visualization by light microscopy and which HERZ appears as discrete black signals (SISH)
and Chr17 as red signals in nuclei of normal cells serving as internal positive control for staining) as well as in carcinoma cells.

SLIDE SCORING: Once an adequate target area is identiﬁed the reader records the scores for HERZ arid Chrl'l copy numbers that
are present in 20 representative nuclei. If the resulting HERZ I Chr17 ratio ﬁalls within 1.84.2 (EQUWOCAL) the reader is
recommended to score an additional 20 nuclei and the resulting ratio is calculated from the total 40 nuclei. HERZ gene status is
reported as non—ampliﬁed (HERZI Chrl7 < 2.0) or ampliﬁed (IERZ/Chrl’l _>. 2.0).

WUNOHISTOCHEMICAL EVALUATION OF ESTROGEN RECEPTORS, PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS, AND
HER-ZNEU IN INVASIVE MAMMARY CARCINOMA .

ESTROGEN RECEPTORS: 99 %, positive.
PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS: 40 %, positive.
STAINING INTENSITY: moderate

IiER-ZNEU: SCORE 2+, EQUIVOCAL.

lmmunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed parafﬁn embedded tissue (Block C3) using the following monoclonal
antibodies: Estrogen receptor (Clone SP1 ). Progesterone receptor (Clone IE2) and Her-Zneu Clone 4B5); control modem
for HER—ZNeu are provided within a kit (score 0 MCF-‘7, score 1+ T—47D, score 2+ MDA-MB-453, score 3+ BT474). Detection
system used: polymer. Primatv antibodies. reagents and control sections for I—lER-Zneu are all provided by ‘

All controls show appropriate reacrivity.

Reactivity of Emmi: and magstemne receptor; is determined based on the percentage of positively stained nuclei of tumor
cells. Reference values (CAP accreditation program checklist 2010 and guidelines on webpage):

Positive: nuclear staining in 1% or greater than 1% of invasive carcinoma cells

Negative : nuclear staining in less than 1% of invasive carcinoma cells

Staining intensity: is reported as weak. moderate or strong.

W is reported applying the CAP- scoring guidelines (CAP accreditation program checklist 2010 and guidelines on
webpaee):

Score 0 = Negative: No immunoreactivity. or faint weak immunoreactivity in <10% of tumor cells but only a portion of the
membrane is positive.

Score 1 a Negative: Faint weak immunoreactivity in 10% or >10% of tumor cells but only a portion of the membrane is positive.
Score 2+ = Equivocal: Weak to moderate mmplete membrane immunoreactivity in >lO% of tumor cells or

Score 3+ = Positive: More than 30% of the tumor cells must show circumferential intense and uniform membrane staining. A
homogeneous (chicken wire) pattern should be present.

Equivocal results for l-IER-2neu (Score 2+) will be subsequently followed by a reﬂex dual-color ISH testing.
