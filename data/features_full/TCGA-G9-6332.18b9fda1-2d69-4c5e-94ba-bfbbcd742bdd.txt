GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES

Received in formalin are three fragments of ten yellow soft and slightiy ﬁrm tissue measuring in
aggregate 4.0x4.0x1.5cm. Three presumptive lymph nodes are identiﬁed. They are submitted in toto in
Al-A3 (Each cassette contains one lymph node).

B. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES

Received in formalin are multiple fragments of tan pink soft and slightly ﬁrm tissue measuring In
aggregate 3.5x3.0x2.5cm. There are three presumptive iymph nodes identiﬁed. They are submitted in
toto in 81—82.

C. PROSTATE

Received fresh is a prostatectomy specimen weighing 359m and measuring 5.5x4.3x3.5cm. The
specimen is inked as follows: apex—red. anterior-orange. base—blue, left lateral—yellow, right lateral—
green and posterior—black. The specimen is divided into to 3 levels to reveal white solid tumor areas

 

present in the posterior left and right lobes. The right seminal vesicle measures 2.8x1.5cm, the right
vas deferens 2.0x0.6cm, the left seminal vesicle 2.?x1.0cm, and the left vas deferens I.9x0.5cm. One
core of the tumor and one section of the seminal vesicle are submitted for tissue procurement. The
prostate is submitted as follows: '

01 -C3: apex

04—05: level 1 right and left

GEE-CT: level 2 right and left

08-09: level 3 right anterior and posterior

CID-Ci 1: level 3 left anterior and posterior

012-013: right base

014—015: left base

0164317: n‘ght seminal vesicle

018—019: left seminal vesicle
