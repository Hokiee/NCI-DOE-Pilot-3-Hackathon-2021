MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
(Dr

Two specimens received.

 

1. "RIGHT FOREARM MELANOMA STITCH PROXIMAL ASPECT". A large ellipse of skin, 130 x 27
x 10mm deep. A proximal marking is present at one tip, designated 12 o'clock. 3 o'clock half blue, 9 o'clock
half black. There is a pigmented nodule 15 x 10 x 12mm in the subcutis which is well clear of both tips.
Representative tissue in two blocks (1A-B). There are four further satellite nodules ranging in Size from 3 to
6mm across, with a dark brown cut surface, present: around the main nodule within a 60mm distance. The
satellite nodules are all clear of both tips. Representative tissue in one block (1C).

2. "RIGHT AXILLARY DISSECTION". One piece of ﬁbrofatty tissue 160 x 120 x 50mm with an
overlying unremarkable narrow skin ellipse 90 x 20mm. At one end there is attached skeletal muscle piece 7
x 40 x 20mm. The specimen is dissected from the muscle attached end towards the other end, and the lymph
node harvested are embedded in this order. The largest node measures up to 45 x 30 x 30mm with a
pigmented cut surface. The skeletal muscle is unremarkable.
