C: Sections of the bladder show a pleomorphic population of transitional cell
infiltrating into the detrusor muscle in nests and broad cords. The malignant

cells are large and distinct cytoplasmic borders.

The cytoplasm is glassy pale and

eosinophilic. The nuclei are round to oval, the nuclear pleomorphism is marked and
consists of isolated greatly enlarged cells against a background of moderate
nuclear sized pleomorphism. Chromatin is coarsely clumped The chromatin clumping
is coarser in the larger cells. Nucleoli are conspicuous, red and occasionally
multiple. At the edges of the tumor, cells are present in smaller groups and
invade in thin round to oval trabeculae. Mitotic figures are occasionally

encountered. Vascular space invasion is identified

section.

C: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Bladder, uterus,
ovaries & perivesicle nodes." It consists of a 15 x 13 z 5.8 cm anterior
exenteration specimen. The uterus measures 9 x 6.2 x 6 cm. The right fallopian
tube measures 6.8 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter; it is grossly unremarkable.
The right ovary measures 2.2 x 1.7 x 0.6 cm and is grossly unremarkable. The left
fallopian tube measures 7 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter and is grossly
unremarkable. The left ovary measures 2.1 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm and is grossly
unremarkable. The serosal surface of the uterus is smooth. A subserosa myoma
measuring 5 x 3.5 x 3 cm is noted. It displays the usual protuberant whorled white
cross section. No areas of hemorrhage or necrosis are noted. The ectocervix
measures 2.5 x 2.2 cm and is lined by velvety, tan epithelium. The endocervical
canal measures 2.5 cm in length and is lined by velvety, tan epithelium. The
endometrial canal measures 4 x 2 x 0.1 cm; it is lined by velvety, tan epithelium.
Two polypoid projections are present in the endometrial cavity measuring 0.5 x 0.5
x 0.1 cm and 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm. The posterior endomyometrial to serosal thickness
is 2.2 cm. The anterior endomyometrial serosal thickness is 1.1 cm. The
vessico—uterine septum is soft to palpation. There is no gross extension of tumor
from the bladder to the cervix. The peritoneal surface overlying the bladder
measures 10 x 9 cm and is smooth and shiny. There are no peritoneal tumor
implants. The bladder measures 9 x 6.5 x 2 cm and contains a 2.2 x 1.9 x 1.1 cm
tumor. The tumor is located 0.7 cm from the urethral margin; it is smooth, firm
and white. The surface of the tumor is not papillary; The remaining bladder
mucosa is smooth and tan with the exception of a 2.2 x 1.5 cm area of hemorrhagic
discoloration superior to the tumor. The left distal ureter measures 1 cm in
length and 0.7 cm in circumference and inserts into the tumor. The right distal
ureter measures 6 cm in length and 1.1 cm in circumference and inserts directly
into the tumor. The bladder wall thickness far from the tumor is 0.6 cm. The
bladder wall thickness in the area of tumor is 1.5 cm. The tumor extends to within

0.4 cm of the external surface of detrusor muscle. Representative sections in 21
cassettes.

D: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right periaortic lymph
nodes." It consists of a 3.8 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm serpiginous, purple-tan tissue
fragment. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

E: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right common iliac nodes.“

It consists of a 2.8 x 1 x 0.5 cm greasy, yellow tissue fragment. Entirely
submitted in one cassette.

consists of 1.7 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm of ureter. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

P: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled “Right proximal ureter." It

consists of a 2.3 x 0.7 x 0.2 cm segment of ureter. Entirely submitted in one
cassette.

Q: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Gallbladder." It consists of
a 7.6 x 2.7 x 2.7 cm gallbladder. The external surface is smooth. A stone is
lodge at the cystic duct measuring 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is
opened to reveal green liquid bile with no further stones. The cystic duct is
opened to reveal a gallstone 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. The gallstone is
sectioned to reveal a black interior. The gallbladder is then opened to reveal
smooth, tan—yellow epithelium. The epithelium is velvety and there are no
