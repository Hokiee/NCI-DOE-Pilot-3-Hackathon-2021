J. PLEURAL BIOPSY , .«:
Received ﬁ'esh are four pieces of pink tan‘ soft tissue measuring 0.2 cm each. The specimen is

submitted in toto in one cassette labeled FSJ .

K. LEVEL 5 LYMPH NOD13
Received fresh are four lymph nodes ranging in maximum diameter from 0.6 to 1.9 x 1.1 x 0.5
cm. They are submitted as follows:

Kl: two lymph nodes

K2—K3: single lymph-node in each

L. 121. LYMPI—l NODE
Received fresh is a single lymph node measuring 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm. It is bisected and submitted

entirely in one cassette labeled L1.

M. LEFT UPPER LOBE
Received fresh is a lung lobectomy weighing 368 gm. and measuring 17.5 x 13 x 5.5 cm. The
specimen has a single tumor mass with'irregular border in the upper segment. The tumor
measures 7.2 x 5.6 x 4.5 cm. The tumor is 2.1 cm from the bronchial margin. The tumor is
grossly conﬁned to the lung without visceral pleura invasion. The rest of the lung is congested
showing focal emphysematous change. Multiple lymph nodes are found in the peribronchial
region ranging in maximum diameter from 0.5 to 2.9 x 2 x 0.6 cm. All the lymph nodes are
grossly negative for tumor. Representative‘sections submitted as follows:

FSM'. bronchial margin

They are grossly negative for tumor. They are submitted entirely as follows:
N1: one lymph node
N2: bisected lymph node

0. LEVEL 9 LYMPH NODE
Received fresh is a piece of ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.5 cm containing multiple
lymph nodes. It is submitted entirely in toto in one cassette labeled 01.
