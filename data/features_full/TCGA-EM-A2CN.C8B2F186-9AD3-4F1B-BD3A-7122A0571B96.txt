Memo.

1. The specimen container labeled with the patient's name and as "Left Paratracheal Node Dissection", contains two
pieces of ﬁbrofatty tissue measuring 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.3 and 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.2 cm. received in 10% buffered formalin.

1A submitted in toto.

2. The specimen container labeled with the patient's name and as "Paratracheal Lymph Node" contains one piece of red
tan tissue that measures 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. received in 10% buffered formalin.
2A submitted in toto.

3. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "Total Thyroid [Stitch = RT Superior Pole]" consists of a thyroid
gland that is oriented with a suture and weighs 69 .7 g. The right lobe measures 6.5 cm Si x 4.7 cm ML x 4.5 cm AP, the
left lobe measures 4.4 cm SI x 2.5 cm ML x 1.8 cm AP and the isthmus measures 3.8 cm SI x 1.8 cm ML x 0.8 cm AP.
The external surfaces have ﬁbrous adhesions. No parathyroid glands and/or no lymph nodes are identiﬁed grossly. The
external surface is painted with Silver nitrate. The entire right lobe is replaced by a well delineated solid nodule. The
remainder of the thyroid tissue is grossly unremarkable. Sections of the nodule and normal tissue are stored frozen.
Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows:

3A-M right lobe, superior to inferior (B-E F-l sections quadrisected)

3N-O isthmus (submitted in toto)

3P-T left lobe, superior to inferior (submitted in toto)
