Final Diagnosis: in
AL. Brain, right frontotemporal/insular mass, and fronlotemporal excision and CUSA: Anaplastie
uligoastrocytoma (WHO grade III).

immunohistochenucal stains were performed on parafﬁn embedded tissue using antibodies to p53, lDl-Il-RIBZH
and 16457. lDHl-Rl 32H stain is positive consistent with ID!“ mutation. p53 protein is positive in rare cells.
1-0-67 labeling is focally high. The findings support the above diagnosis.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies for lpl9q deletion have been ordered on parafﬁn sections and

will be Derfonned bv the L a. For interpretation. see
