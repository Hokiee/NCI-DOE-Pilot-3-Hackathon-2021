GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. RIGHT AXILLARY CONTENTS
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "right axillary contents " are piece of yellow-
tan adipose tissue, 14 x 10 x 2 cm, containing lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 cm to 2 cm; lymph nodes
are sectioned and submitted entirely:
A1: 6 possible lymph nodes
A2: 2 lymph nodes, bisected (one Inked green)
A3-A5: 1 lymph node, bisected, each block
A6: 1 lymph node
A7: 2 lymph nodes. bisected (one inked green)
A8: 1 lymph node, bisected
A9:2 lymph nodes
A10: 1 lymph node
A11: 3 lymph nodes
A12-13:1 lymph node
A14-A17: 1 lymph node
A18-A19: 1 lymph node

B. RIGHT BREAST EXCISION

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "right breast excision" is an previously inked,
177 g, 11.5 cm medial to lateral x 7.5 cm superior to inferior x 3.5 cm anterior to posterior, excision. The
overlying skin measuring 9.5x 7 cm in diameter. There are multiple brown papules on the Skin. Ink
code: anterior-yellow, posterior-black, medial-green. lateral-red, superior-blue, inferior-orange. The
specimen Is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 7 slices revealing a 3.5 x 3 x 3 cm, white. ﬁrm
mass that is closest to the superior and anterior margins at 1 cm. The clip was retrieved in slice 4.
Representatively submitted as per the attached diagram:

B1: medial margin

82: slice 2, anterior margin with tumor

B3: slice 2, superior margin with tumor

B4: slice 3, skin with tumor

B5-B6: slice 3, anterior margin with tumor

B7: slice 3, superior margin with tumor

BS: slice 3, posterior margin with tumor

C. RIGHT POSTERIOR MARGIN
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "right posterior margin" is a yellow—tan
adipose tissue. 10 x 2 x 1.3 cm. One surface has been marked with clips indicating new margin. This

surface is inked black. Serial sectioning does not reveal any abnormality. Representative sections
submitted in 4 cassettes.
