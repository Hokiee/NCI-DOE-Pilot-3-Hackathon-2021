Frozen Section Diagnosis

FSt; Skin and subcutaneous soft tissue, “previous biopsy site", F8: Representative sample of tissue with no tumor seen.
Skin and subcutaneous soft tissue with scar, focal chronic inflammation and giant cell reaction.

FS2A, 28: Muscle and soft tissue. “Deeper excision at site of previous incision", FS: Representative sample of tissue
with viable as well as necrotic skeletal muscle. granulation tissue formation, predominant chronic inflammation and giant
cell reaction present. No tumor seen.

Gross Description
The specimen is received in five parts in a container labeled with the patients name and medical record number.

Specimen #1 is received fresh for frozen section and designated "previous biopsy site” and consists of a 6.6 x 1.6 cm skin
ellipse excised to a depth of 1.1 cm. The skin surface is tan white, wrinkled and displays an ill«dofined paracentral linear
3.3 cm long scar. The deep surface is inked black. A representative section is submitted for frozen section, and the
frozen section control is submitted in cassette 1A. Additional representative sections are submitted in cassettes 18 and

1C.

Specimen #2 is received fresh for frozen section and designated “deeper excision, previous incision" and consists of a 6.5
x 1.5 x 1.4 cm irregular portion of ten red to tan yellow, rubbery coarsely iobulated soft tissue. Sectioning reveals red
brown to tan white. focally dense cut surfaces. Representative sections are submitted for frozen section, and the frozen
section control is submitted in cassettes 2A and 28. Additional representative sections are submitted in cassettes 20 and
20.

Specimen #3 is received in formalin and designated "rib“ and consists of three cylindrical fragments of firm bone ranging
from 5.5 to 6.4 cm in length, grossly consistent with a fragmented rib. Sectioning reveals tan red, firm and trabecuiated
cut surfaces with no discrete masses or lesions grossly identified. A representative section is submitted in cassette 3A
following decalcification.

Specimen #4 is received in formalin and designated "posterior intercostai node“ and consists of three tan yellow to grey
biaclr, nodular soft tissue fragments measuring 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is submitted in
ioto in cassette 4A. .

Specimen #5 is received in formalin and designated "pleura“ and consists of a 111.5 gram aggregate of three irregular
fragments of ten white to tan gray, indurated soft tissue fragments ranging from 7.5 to 8.7 cm in greatest dimension.
There are focal areas of attached yellow tan, coarsely lobulated adipose tissue. Sectioning reveals diffusely, dense cut
surfaces. The largest fragment is sectioned to reveal tan white. indurated gritty cut surfaces which are intermingled with
the yellow tan adipose tissue. Representative sections from each fragment are submitted in cassettes 5A through SE with
the largest fragment in relation to the attached adipose tissue submitted in cassettes SD and 5E.
