Clinical History

The patient is an r- d man with history of papillary renal cell carcinoma, status post right partial
nephrectomy in On imaging, he has a 4-cm complex left upper pole renal mass with an

adjacent 2-cm so id mass. l-le undergoes left partial nephrectomy.

Gross Description
The specimen is received in two parts, each labeled with the patient‘s name and unit number.

Part A is received in formalin and is additionally labeled "#1 left renal mass.“ It consists of a single
irregular partial kidney resection with attached perinephric fat, weighing 297 gm and measuring 28 x 9
x 5 cm. The kidney segment measures 8 x 5 x 4.5 cm. There are two tumors present in the specimen.
Tumor #1 measures 5 x 3.5 x 4 cm and is gold, friable, irregular, and hemorrhagic. Tumor #2
measures 2.2 x 2 x 1.6 cm and is yellow, solid, and abuts tumor #1. The tumors appear grossly
encapsulated with a thin shell of kidney parenchyma attached. There is one area of possible partial
disruption of the capsule near the kidney parenchyma for tumor #1. An adrenal gland is identiﬁed,
which is orange-tan and measures 4.5 x 3.4 x 1.2 cm. There is no gross involvement of the tumor with
the adrenal gland, and it is roughly 1.3 cm away from the gland. There is no sinus or hilus found in the
specimen. The renal parenchyma resection margin is inked black, and the perinephric margin is inked
blue. No candidate lymph nodes are identified. A portion of tumor #2 is taken for tissue banking.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Cassette A1: Tumor #1, relationship to kidney parenchyma.
Cassettes A2-A4: Tumor #1, relationship to perinephric fat margin.
Cassette A5: Tumor #2, relationship to kidney parenchyma.
Cassette A6: Tumor #2, relationship to perinephric fat margin.
Cassette A7: Tumor #1, relationship to adrenal gland.
Cassette A8: Adrenal gland.

Cassette A9-A11: Additional sections of the kidney with tumor.

Part B, received in formalin and labeled "perinephric fat," consists of multiple soﬂ irregular pieces of
yellow fatty tissue measuring 10 x 8 x 1.5 cm in aggregate. Visual inspection, palpation, and serially

sectioned reveal no lesions or nodules. Uniformly soft yellow fat is seen. Representative sections are
submitted in cassette Bl.

Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. Final diagnosis made by attending pathologist
following review of all pathology slides.
