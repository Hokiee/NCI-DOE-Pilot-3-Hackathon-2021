GROSS DESCRIPTlON:

A. WLE LEFT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "wide local excision left breast needle localization"
is an oriented. previously inked. 63-9. 8 x 5.5 x 3.7 cm needle localized lumpectomy specimen accompanied by two
radiographs. The single suture designates anterior, double-lateral. lnk code: Anterior-yellow. posterior-black, medial-
green, lateral-red, superior-blue, inferior-orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 7 slices
revealing ﬁrm tan mass (clip in slice 3), 3.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm, located at the medial margin. A second ill-deﬁned hemorrhagic
ﬁrm area, 1 x 0.9 x 0.6 cm. is identiﬁed in slice 6, approximately 1 cm from the mass. and approaches the nearest anterior
margin at distance of 0.6—cm. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. The specimen is
representatively submitted:

A1-A4: Perpendicular sections medial margin, entirely submitted

A5-A8: Slice 2, entirely submitted. A5-A6 demonstrate mass

A9-A12: Slice 3. entirely submitted, A10 demonstrates clip

A13: Slice 4, posterior/superior

A14: Slice 4, superior/anterior

A15: Slice 4, posterior/inferior

A16: Slice 5, posterior/superior

A17.A18: Slice 6, hemorrhagic ﬁrm area submitted entirely

A19-A20: Representative perpendicular sections, lateral margin

B. SENTINEL NODE #1 LEFT AXILLA

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "sentinel lymph node number one left axilla" is a tan
lymph node measuring 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm. Touch preparations are performed. The entire specimen is submitted, 81-32.

C. MED_lAL MARGIN LEFT BREAST

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "medial margin left breast" is an oriented
(suture at ﬁnal margin), 69. 5.5 x 2.5 x 1 cm fragment of ﬁbroadipose tissue. The ﬁnal margin inked black. The specimen
is sectioned and submitted entirely, C1—C5.

- NO METASTATIC CARCINOMA IS SEEN (0/1).

C. BREAST, LEFT, MEDIAL MARGIN. EXCISIONZ
- BREAST TISSUE WITH FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES
- NO MALIGNANCY IS SEEN.
