Gross Description:

Received in a single container labeled "_ — right colon

and terminal ileum" is a 23 cm previously opened portion of large
bowel including cecum. as well as 8 cm of attached previously opened
terminal ileum. The specimen is covered by a moderate amount of
pericolio and epiploic adipose tissue in which a 8.4 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm
grossly unremarkable vermiform appendix is identiﬁed. The visible
serosa is focally shaggy and tan pink with a few ﬁbrofatty

adhesions. Noted at a point approximately 9 cm from the distal
margin is a 3.3 x 3.2 cm area of indurated umbilication of the

serosa. The specimen has been received after tissue harvest for
genomic study. Within the specimen container are three tiesue
cassettes each labeled " The bowel wall is up to
0.6 cm edematous and ﬁbrotio The lumen is lined by tan pink mucosa
with preservation of intestinal folds. in the area corresponding to

the umbilication at a point 8.6 cm from the distal margin and 3.3 cm
from the iieocecai valve is a partially sectioned 9.2 x 7.5 cm

plaque like ﬁnely granular centrally ulcerated tan pink lesion with
raised rolled borders. This has a gritty gray tan ﬁbrotic cut

surface measuring up to 3.2 cm in thickness The lesion grossly
extends through the muscularis but is limited by the serosa in the
area away from the pen‘colic fat In the area of the pericolic fat

the lesion grossly appears to focally extend through the wall into

the adipose tissue where it is seen at its nearest point

approximately 0.9 cm from the nearest outer surface margin. The
lesion is noted within 0.1 cm of the outer surface in the area of

the serosa. Noted scattered along the length of the bowel are a few
additional tan gray polypoid excrescences up to 0.8 cm which are
unﬁxed to the underlying muscularis. On sectioning the surrounding
adipose tissue reveals multiple poorly deﬁned flashy tan pink to
yellow nodules up to 1.5 cm. Representative sections are submitted
labeled as follows: A - proximal margin; B - distal margin; C-G -
representative lesion and surrounding tissue; H - representative
polyps; l ~ random uninvolved bowel; J - appendix; K~N - individual
pericolic nodules bisected; 0-?! ~ whole smaller pericoiic nodules.

Microscopic Descri tion:
The slides labeled are examined. See diagnosis.
