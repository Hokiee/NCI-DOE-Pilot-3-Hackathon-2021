CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
F never-smoker with hx of rheumatoid arthritis, now with a 1.5 cm
RLL sub-solid nodule.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in six parts, each labeled with the
patient's name.

1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'right lower lobe wedge'. It
consists of a wedge biopsy of the lung measuring 6 x 3 x 2 cm. The
stapled line measures 6 x 5 cm which is shaved and the parenchyma
around it inked blue. The pleura is grey-pink glistening and there

is a puckered area measuring 1 cm in greatest dimension, located 2
cm from the stapled line margin. Beneath the puckered pleura there
is a grey-white ﬁrm nodule with ill-deﬁned borders measuring 1 x 1
cm, located 0.9 cm from the stapled line margin. Frozen section
performed on the nodule and resubmitted for permanent section. The
remainder of the parenchyma is pink-red, blotchy and crepitant. The
specimen is photographed and a metallic pin identiﬁed from the
nodular area. Representative sections are submitted.

2. Part two is received in formalin, labeled ‘level 8 lymph node'.
It consists of a single tan-maroon irregular piece of soﬁ tissue
measuring 3.7 x 0.5 cm. Entirely submitted.

3. Part three is received fresh, labeled 'right lower lobectomy, at

12:53'. It consists of a right lobe of lung measuring 15 x 9 x 1.5

cm. There is a staple line identiﬁed on the specimen measuring 7

cm in length. The bronchial and vascular margins are identiﬁed.

The bronchial margin measures 1.5 cm in length and is stapled. The
vascular margin measures 0.9 cm in length and is stapled. Serial
sectioning of the specimen reveals tan-maroon spongy parenchyma. No
deﬁnite nodule or mass is identiﬁed. The staple line is inked

blue. Representative sections are submitted.

ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS:

KRAS, EGFR and ALK FISH were sent on
The test is to be performed on

The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited
accession number were retrieved ﬁ'om archives. The pathologist whose
signature appears below reviewed the original pathology repOrt,
examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1A appropriate to
the speciﬁcations of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9
unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to

’ where the subject molecular test will be performed. An
addendum report will be issued when the results of this molecular
test are available.

ADDENDUM #2:
INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY

MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY
KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS

Referring Physician:

Body Site: Right lower lobe of lung
Specimen Type: Slides

Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma

RESULTS: Wild-type gene.

INTERPRETATION:
No mutations were identiﬁed at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.

COMMENT:

‘ Mutations'in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor W
prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
therapies in patients with non-small—cell lung cancer (N SCLC). KRAS

mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (N SCLC)
patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking
history.

This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of

the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for
use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in fresh,
frozen, or formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn embedded tissue. In particular
the test performance has been established in samples of colorectal
cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor these
mutations, although several other tissues are also known to harbor
KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix,
etc.).

Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene ampliﬁcation status may provide
additional information regarding this patient's probability of
response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if

clinically indicated. See references.

METHOD/ LIMITATIONS:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantiﬁed
and ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

ADDENDUM 3:
EGF R Mutation Analysis

Body Site: Right lower lobe of Lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma

RESULTS: Positive for the E746_A750de15 mutation in Exon 19.

INTERPRETATION: Deletion mutations in exon 19, mostly involving the
LREA motif, are reported to correlate with responsiveness to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non—small-cell

lung carcinoma.

COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more cellularity is optimal for
this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 50% tumor

'/

cellularity upon pathologist review.
E746_A750del$ corresponds to 223 5_2249de115.

A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was
identiﬁed. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
signiﬁcance.

Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with
differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among
patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.

This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small—cell

lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.
Mutations present in less than 10—20% of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change
during tumor progression or the course of the therapy; therefore,

this result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a
mutation in another sample or sub—sample obtained from this tumor.

This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical signiﬁcance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.

METHOD:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantiﬁed
and ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.
