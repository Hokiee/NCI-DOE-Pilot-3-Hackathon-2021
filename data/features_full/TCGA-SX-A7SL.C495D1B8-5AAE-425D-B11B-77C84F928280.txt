DIAGNOSIS:
A. Left kidney: Papillary renal cell carcinoma, grade 1/4, 4 cm,
confined to the kidney.

Procedure/laterality: Left robotic nephrectomy.

Histologic type: Papillary renal cell carcinoma, type I.

Nuclear grade (Fuhrman, l—4): Grade 1/4.

Tumor size: 4 x 3.7 x 3.7 cm.

Tumor site: Upper pole left kidney.

Tumor focality: A single circumscribed lesion in the cortex.
Sarcomatoid features: Absent.

Tumor necrosis: Absent.

Microscopic tumor extension:No extension into perinephric tissue,
renal sinus, renal vein or collecting system.

Surgical margins: The external soft tissue and ureteral margins are
negative for carcinoma.

Lymph-vascular invasion: Absent.

Lymph nodes: Absent.

Pathologic findings in nonneoplastic kidney: Adjacent to the
carcinoma there is a 2 cm unilocular renal cyst.

Sections of cortex away from the carcinoma show less than 5%
sclerotic glomeruli, minimal interstitial fibrosis, some dilated
atrophic tubules, and severe renal artery and intra—renal artery
atherosclerosis.

Pathologic staging: pTla, pNX.

Biorepository sample (if applicable): Yes, non—malignant cortex and
carcinoma.

Block(s) containing malignancy suitable for additional testing: Al,
A3, A4, A5.

The frozen section diagnosis is confirmed by the permanent sections.

CLINICAL INFORMATION:

Left renal mass.

SPECIMEN(S):
A:Left kidney

PRELIMINARY INTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:

A. Left kidney, frozen section diagnosis: Papillary renal cell
carcinoma. '

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

and "left kidney".
Procedure: Radical nephrectomy.
Specimen laterality: Left.
Tumor site: Upper pole.
Tumor size: 4.0 x 3.7 x 3.7 cm.
Tumor focality: Unifocal.
Gross extent of tumor:

Extension into perinephric tissue: Absent.

Extension beyond Gerota‘s fascia: Absent. we _76 I}

Extension into renal sinus: Absent.

Extension into renal vein: Absent.

Extension into collecting system: Absent.
Adrenal gland: Absent.

Gross notes:

Gross tumor characteristics: Well—demarcated, tan and a rubbery
mass with somewhat lobulated—appearing cut surfaces with a couple
foci of yellow—orange, moderately soft areas measuring up to 1.2 cm
in greatest dimension.

Kidney weight: 564 g with fat; weight without fat 165 g.

Kidney dimensions: 11.5 x 6.0 x 4.7 cm.

Ureter dimensions: Length-~8.5 cm and diameter-—O.4 cm.

Lymph nodes: None identified.

Inking details: The outer~most surface of the fat adjacent to
the mass is inked blue.

Biorepository sample submitted: Yes, see block key.

Other findings: Abutting the mass, there is a 2.0—cm in greatest
dimension unilocular cyst compartment containing tan, clear fluid.
The inner cyst lining is smooth.
