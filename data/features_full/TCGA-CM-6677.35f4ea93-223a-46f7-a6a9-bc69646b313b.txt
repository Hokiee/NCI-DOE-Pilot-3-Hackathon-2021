Gross Description:

1. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right colon" and consists of a
segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and ascending colon.
The terminal ileum measures 15.2 cm in length and 4.1 cm in circumference

at the proximal resected margin. The remaining colon measures 41.6 in
length with a circumference of 8.2 cm at the distal resected margin. The
attached appendix measures 9 cm in length and averages 0.8 cm in diameter.
The appendiceal and intestinal serosa are pink tan and smooth. The colonic
serosa has a focus of retraction and is inked black. Focally hemorrhagic
lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the specimen
measuring up to 6 cm in thickness. There is also omentum (17.2 to 15 x 1 cm)
which is serially sectioned revealing unremarkable adipose tissue. The
specimen is opened to reveal a circumferential tan-pink mass measuring 3.5
cm in length and 8 cm in width. The mass is located in the transverse colon,
immediately adjacent to a tattoo site, 32.2 cm from the proximal margin,
10.3 cm from the distal margin, and 16.5 cm from the ileocecal valve.
Sectioning shows that the tumor invades the muscularis. The depth of
invasion is 0.3 cm grossly; the tumor has a thickness of 0.6 centimeters.
There are two tan-pink polypoidal masses (1.1 cm and 0.4 cm in greatest
dimension) located 3.0 cm and 4.5 cm from ileocecal valve, respectively. The
remaining mucosa is unremarkable. The attached adipose tissue is thoroughly
examined and all identified lymph nodes are submitted. Representative
sections of the specimen are submitted for permanent sections and for-
