Resected cross-section of the colon with tumor-free resection margins, under inclusion of
a tubular adenoma with mild dysplasia (synonym: low-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia)
and a tubulovillous adenoma with focal severe dysplasia (synonym: high-grade intra-
epithelial neoplasia) and with a well to moderately differentiated colorectal
adenocarcinoma (G1 to 2) with infiltration of the lamina muscularis propria and without
regional lymph node metastases (pT2 pNO 0/31) on the base of a further tubulovillous
adenoma with severe dysplasia.
