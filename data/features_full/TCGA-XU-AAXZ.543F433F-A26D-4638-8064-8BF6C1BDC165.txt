COMMENT

The tumor is composed of densely intermixed sheets of epithelial cells
and mature lymphocytes. The epithelial cells show irregularly enlarged
nuclei with vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli. Occasional
mitotic figures are noted. These tumor cells demonstrate prominent
keratin pearl formation, consistent with squamous differentiation, The
tumor has extends irregularly into the adipose tissue but it is uniformly
covered by the latter, with painted margins negative for tumor. Most of
the lymphocytes are positive for CDla and CD99.consistent with immature
thymocytes. Scattered CD5 positive lymphocytes are also noted by the
epithelial tumor cells are negative for CD5. The epithelial.tumor cells
show strong staining for CK5/6 and high molecular weight cytokeratin.
with the majority of lymphocytes being CD1a/CD99 positive and the
epithelial tumor cells being CD5.negative, this is more consistent with a
type B3 thymoma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

The specimen is labeled with the patient's name and as "thymus gland and
thymoma stitch marks left pleura". It consists of a thymus gland, which
is oriented with a suture on the left pleura. The gland measures 12 x 12
,x 2,1 cm. It is painted with silver nitrate. The right half of the gland
appears unremarkable. A firm tumor, measuring 5 x 3 x 2cm, is identified
on sectioning the left half containing the suture. The tumor is
variegated tan to red and partly hemorrhagic. Grossly the tumor does not
extend to the capsule or pleural surface. Representative sections are
submitted.
