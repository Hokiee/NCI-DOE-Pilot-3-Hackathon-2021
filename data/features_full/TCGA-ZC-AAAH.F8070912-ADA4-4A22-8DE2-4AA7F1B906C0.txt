Macroscopy:

9.5x7.5x3.5cm measurung, 90g tissue. In lamellar cut surfaces at 5.5x4.5x2cm large lobulated,
partially turned perfused tumor with gray-white surface.

1.1: Frozen section.

1.2: vascular surgical margins in the region of the right thymus
1.3 : Right thymus cranial

1.4 : Right-sided mediastinal pleura

1.5-7 : Left -sided thymus with bleeding

1.8 : Left-sided mediastinal pleura .

1 .9-1. 10: Ventral preparation shares.

1.1 1: dorsal preparation shares

1.12-15 : More cuts

Microscopy:
Histologically, a lobular, focal regressive tumour in a normal developed thymus. Small - to
large - lobular up the tumour and rich of epithelial cells, but consistently dominated by

lymphoid cells. It is noteworthy that also occur within the tumour follicles. The normal
thymus shows a moderate thymitis with some germinal centers.

Assessment:

In summary, the thymoma shows the image of a WHO type B2 thymoma, in some sections,
also a Bl thymoma (about 60:40 ). In the present material with infiltration of mediastinal fat

(Masaoka stage II) and intratumouros lymphofollicular hyperplasia. The thymoma extends
below the pleura, without real inﬁltration.

Thymoma WHO-typ 32 (60%), some areas type B1 (40%) // the tissue for TCGA only
contains the BZ-parts
