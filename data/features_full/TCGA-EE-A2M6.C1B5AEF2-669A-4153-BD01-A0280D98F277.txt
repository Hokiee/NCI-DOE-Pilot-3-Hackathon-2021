CLINICAL NOTES

Melanoma Hx. Now axillary mets.

§PECIMEN INFORMATION

Radical axillary dissection (level [11) including lesser pectoral muscle.
(Double) stitch marks apex of specimen.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
~—-—————_._______

"Right axillary contents double stitch marks apex". A piece of ﬁbroadipose
tissue 165 x 110 x 75mm with attached skeletal muscle 70 x 50 x 40mm. A double
suture marks the apex. Lymph nodes were dissected from the apex. The specimen

includes a number of enlarged centrally necrotic lymph nodes which are
macroscopically involved by tumour up to 45mm across.

A. '22 apical nodes whole.

B. 4 whole nodes.

C. Portion of 1 large node.

D. 4 nodes whole.

E. 1 node bisected.

F. 3 nodes whole.

G. Section of one large macroscopically involved node.
H. 1 node bisected.

J. Part of one large macroscopically involved node.
K. I node whole.

L. I node bisected.

MICROSCOPIC REPORT

"Right axillary contents double stitch marks apex". Four of twenty lymph
nodes show involvement by large pleomorphic malignant cells consistent with
metastatic malignant melanoma. No extracapsular spread of tumour is seen.
None of the involved nodes contain micrometastases ( Qmm).

lmmunohistochemical stains show focal 2+ positive staining for S 100, HMB45 and
Melan A. This immunohistochemical proﬁle is characteristic of malignant
melanoma.
