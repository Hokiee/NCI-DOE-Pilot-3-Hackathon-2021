This report is issued to give lmmunohistochemistry results. Immunohistochemical staining is performed in our lab on a
representative parafﬁn-embedded section of part A.

MARKER CloneNendor RESULTS STAINING SCORE

HER2 overexpression A88 Positive 10 % 1+
10% Invasive tumor cells with complete membrane staining for HER2
Uniformity of staining absent for HER2

Homogeneous, dark circumferential pattern present for HER2

FOOTNOTE

For Her 2: Positive cases are those with uniform, intense and complete membrane staining in greater than 30% of invasive tumor cells (Score 3+). Negative
cases are defined as those with no staining (Score 0) or weak, incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of cells (Score 1+). Equivocal or indeterminate
cases are those with strong staining In less than or equal to 30% of cells. or complete membrane staining that is either non-uniform or weal: in intensity, but with
obvious circumferential distribution in at least 10% of tumor cells (Score +2).
