or frozen section.

 

B: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Left distal ureter."

it consists of a 1 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm fragment of red—tan tissue. Entirely submitted
for frozen section.

C: The specimen is received fresh from the 0.R. and labeled "Apical urethral

margin." It consists of a 1.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm fragment of red—tan tissue. Entirely
submitted for frozen section.

D: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Urinary
b1adder,Uterus, Bilateral fallopian tubes & ovaries." It consists of a 15 x 12 x
5.5 cm cystectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy. The bladder measures 6.5 x 7 x 4 cm. The uterus measures 9
x 6.5 x 2.5 cm. The right ovary measures 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm, and the left ovary

0.4 cm in diameter. The left fallopian tube measures 6.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm
in diameter. There is no serosal involvement. The specimen is inked blue and the
urethral margin is submitted for frozen section. The bladder is then opened along
its anterior surface to reveal a 4 x 3.5 x 1 cm endophytic, ulcerated mass in the
posterior portion of the bladder. Both ureterovesical junctions are grossly
negative. Tumor extends to within 0.2 cm of each ureterovesical junction. The
remaining bladder mucosa is otherwise unremarkable. The ureters are opened to
reveal grossly normal mucosa. The left ureter measures 4.5 cm in length and 1.2 cm
in circumference. The right ureter measures 4.6 cm in length and 1.1 cm in
circumference. The right ovary and fallopian tube are grossly unremarkable on
external examination and on sectioning. The left ovary and fallopian tube are
unremarkable on external examination and sectioning. The ectocervix measures 4 x 3
cm and is lined by smooth tan epithelium. The endocervical canal measures 2.9 cm
in length and 0.7 cm in diameter and is lined by smooth, tan epithelium. The
endometrial canal measures 3 x 1.7 x 0.1 cm and is lined by smooth. tan epithelium.
Serial sectioning of the uterus reveals an unremarkable myometrium and serosa
with the exception of a single nodule 0.5 cm in greatest dimension, located
intramurally. Careful palpation of the perivesical fat pad reveals no
lymphadenopathy. Representative sections are submitted in 22 cassettes.

E: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled l'Left peri aortic lymph

nodes." It consists of a 4.5 x 2.2 x 1.2 cm of fatty tissue. Entirely submitted
in two cassettes.

F: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Left common iliac lymph

nodes.“ It consists of a 5 x 2 x 0.5 cm of greasy yellow tissue. Entirely
submitted in two cassettes.

G: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right para caval lymph

nodes." It consists of a 4.2 x 2.7 x 1.5 cm of greasy yellow tissue. Entirely
submitted in two cassettes.

H: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right common iliac lymph

nodes." It consists of a 4 x 2 x 1.5 cm greasy yellow tissue. Entirely submitted
in two cassettes.

I: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled “Right node of cloquet." It

consists of a 2 x 1 x 1 cm of greasy yellow tissue. Entirely submitted in one
cassette.

J: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled “Right external iliac lymph

nodes." It consists of a 4 x 3 x 0.7 cm greasy yellow tissue. Entirely submitted
in two cassettes.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:

A-C: See final microscopic-diagnosis.

D: Sections show invasive transitional cell carcinoma, nuclear grade 3-4/4. The
cells are medium to large with high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio prominent
nucleoli, vesicular chromatin and coarse chromatin clumping. The mitotic rate is
high. The tumor cells grow in sheets and trabeculae and penetrate the muscularis
propria extending into the perivesical fat. The tumor does not extend into the
vaginal wall. Lymphovascular space invasion is identified (D5). Multifocal
carcinoma in situ is identified (A5,1l). The cervix is uninvolved. Both ovary and
fallopian tubes are unremarkable. The ovaries show normal physiologic changes.
The uterus shows proliferative endometrium, adenomyosis and a single intramural
leiomyoma. Metastatic transitional cell carcinoma is identified in a single
posterior perivesical lymph node (D18).
