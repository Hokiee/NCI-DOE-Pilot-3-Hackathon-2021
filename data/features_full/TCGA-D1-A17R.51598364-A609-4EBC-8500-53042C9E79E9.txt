DIAGNOSI S:
A. Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy
and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: FIGO grade II (of
III)
endometrial adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, is
identified forming ‘
a mass (4.4 X 3.9 x 1.2 cm), located in the posterior
uterine wall.
The tumor invades 0.1 cm into the myometrium (total wall
thickness
2.2 cm). The tumor does not involve the endocervix or
cervix.
Lymphovascular space invasion is not identified. The
margins are
negative for tumor. The cervix, bilateral ovaries,
fallopian tubes
and appendix are unremarkable. [AJCCpleNOMX].

B. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, biopsy: Multiple (5) right
pelvic

lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

C. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, biopsy: Multiple (6) left
pelvic

lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic
examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of
tzliea
specimen(s).
