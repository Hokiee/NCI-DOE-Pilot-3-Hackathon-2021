Clinical History
Papillary thyroid cancer.

Gross Description

Specimen A is labeled ”total thyroidectomy." Received fresh is a
14 gm total thyroidectomy specimen. The specimen consists of
right thyroid lobe (5.2 x 2.1 x 2.0 cm), left thyroid lobe (3.1 x
2.2 x 1.5 cm), isthmus (2.5 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm). The specimen comes
oriented with a suture that marks right superior pole. There is a
possible 0.3 cm lymph node identified.

The right lobe is serially sectioned to reveal a 0.5 cm in
greatest dimension, unencapsulated, firm, white-tan lesion that
grossly abuts the blue-inked margin and is in the superior half
of the right thyroid lobe. There is a second unencapsulated
lesion present towards the inferior pole of the right thyroid
that measures 1.6 x 1.1 x 1.0 cm. This lesion is brown—tan,
soft, and has a hemorrhagic center. The remaining thyroid
parenchyma is red—tan and unremarkable.

.,

The left thyroid is serially sectioned to reveal a 1.3 x 1.1 x
0.6 cm, white—tan, ill-defined lesion. The remaining left thyroid
lobe has red—tan parenchyma with no other discrete nodules or
masses present. The isthmus is serially sectioned to reveal a
red—tan cut surface with no discrete lesions or masses present.
The case is reviewed by Dr.

Sections are submitted as follows: A1 — lesion in superior
portion of thyroid lobe, A2—A4 — lesion #2 in the inferior half
of the right thyroid, A5~A6 - lesion in left thyroid lobe, A7 -
representative section of isthmus, A8possible lymph node.

Part B is labeled "right central neck nodes." Received in
formalin is a 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm aggregate of two fragments of
adipose tissue. There are three possible lymph nodes identified,
ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 cm in greatest dimension. Sections are
submitted as follows: Bl — three possible lymph nodes, B2 -
remainder of specimen.
