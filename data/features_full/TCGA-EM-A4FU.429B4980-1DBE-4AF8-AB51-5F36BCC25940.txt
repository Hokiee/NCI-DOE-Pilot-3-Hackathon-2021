Gross Description .
The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "Thyroid: Total thyroidectomy” consists of a thyroid gland that

weighs 66.7 g. The right lobe measures 7.5 cm SI x 3.0 cm ML x 1.1 cm AP, the left lobe measures 5.6 cm SI x 4.0 cm
ML x 3.0 cm AP and the isthmus measures 4.0 cm SI x 2.6 cm ML x 2.2 cm AP. The external surfaces have ﬁbrous
adhesions. No parathyroid glands or lymph nodes are identiﬁed grossly. The external surface is painted with silver nitrate.
The upper pole of the right lobe contains a well delineated nodule that measures 0.9 cm SI x 0.9 cm ML x 0.8 cm AP. The
upper to lower pole of the left lobe contains a well delineated mass that measures 4.2 cm SI x 3.3 cm ML x 3.0 cm AP.
The isthmus contains a well delineated nodule that measures 3.9 cm SI x 2.6 cm ML x 2.2 cm AP. The remainder of the
thyroid tissue is unremarkable. Sections of left lobe nodule and nonnai tissue are stored frozen. Representative sections
are submitted as follows:

1A-H right lobe, superior to inferior

1I-M istths

1 N-V left lobe. superior to inferior
