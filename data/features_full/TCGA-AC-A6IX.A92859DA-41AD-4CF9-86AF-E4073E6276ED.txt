PATHOLOGIC TUMOR STAGlNG SUMMARY:
Type and grade (invasive): Invasive lobular carcinoma, Nottingham grade 2.
Primary tumor: pT2(m).
Regional lymph nodes: pN3a.
Distant metastasis: Not applicable.
Pathologic stage: lllC.
Margin status: Negative.
COMMENT: The main tumor mass is located in the 34:00 region of the breast, and
grossly measures 3.5 cm in diameter. Adjacent to this nodule is a 1.2 cm secondary
nodule. A third 0.5 cm nodule is identiﬁed in the lower inner quadrant, and small foci
of invasive tumor are located in the subareolar breast tissue. The separately
submitted lymph node (specimen B) is positive for metastatic carcinoma, and is
included in the total iymph node count above.

FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

 

Source of Specimen:

A. Breast;leﬂ
B. Apical node

Clinical History/Operative Dx:

Leﬂ breast cancer

Gross Description:

A. Received fresh labeled "modiﬁed radical mastectomy" is a right modiﬁed radical mastectomy
specimen. The breast measures 16 cm (medial-lateral) x 15 cm (superior-inferior) x 5 cm
(anterior-posterior), and weighs 538 Q. There is an elliptical portion of tan skin measuring 15 x 8 cm, with
nipple and areola present just medial of center. The attached axillary tail measures 10 x 4 x 1,5 cm. The
specimen is inked as follows:

Blue - Superior,
Orange - interior,
Black - Dee p.

The specimen is sliced from medial to lateral in nine slices with slice 1 most medial, slice nine most
lateral (including axillary tail). The nipple is in slice #4.

There is a dominant mass in the 3—4:00 aspect of the specimen, approxrmately 5 cm from the nipple,
measuring 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm. This mass is 2 cm from the closest inferior margin, 1 cm from the deep margin,
and is at least 4 cm from all other margins. A nodule is appreciated superior-posteriorto lesion #1, 1.2 x
0.8 cm, within slabs #5.

There is a second ill~deﬁned nodule located approximately 3 cm superior to the largest mass, located in
the upper outer quadrant, approximately 2 cm in diameter. A third ill—defined area of nodularity is
identified in the upper inner quadrant meaSuring up to 2.5 cm in diameter, located in slabs 3-4. from

medial. in the lower inner quadrant, there is a 0.5 cm nodule, at least 1 cm from the nearest margin.

There is ill-deﬁned nodularity in the lower outer quadrant region, apart from the main tumor, and areas of
central ﬁbrocystic changes. The axillary tail contains prominent lymph nodes, the largest of which is 2.5
cm in diameter. Portions of tumor and non-tumor breast tissue, and a portion of the suspicious lymph node
are submitted for research. Time removed from breast: Time placed in formalin:
