GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. SENTINEL NODE #1 AND #2
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "sentinel node #1 and #2, right axilla' is a 1.8
x 1.5 x 0.6 cm portion of adipose tissue, within which, two lymph nodes are identiﬁed, 0.4 cm( #2) and
0.8 cm( #1). A touch preparation is made on each node. The specimen is entirely submitted as follows:
AI- lymph node #1
A2-lymph node #2
B. RIGHT BREAST
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "right breast" is an oriented
(suture in axilla), 358 g, 21 x 17 x 5 cm mastectomy specimen with 7.5 x 5.4 cm beige skin ellipse
showing a 1 cm diameter retracted nipple. Ink code: Posterior-deep, anterior/superior-blue,
anterior/inferior—orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 13 slices
revealing two possible lesions. Mass #1, in the upper inner quadrant (two o'clock, slices 9-10), 2 x 1.5 x
1.4 cm, is located 2.2-cm from the deep margin and 1.4-cm from anterior. Approximately 4.5-cm from
mass #1, a second mass is demonstrated in the upper outer quadrant (slice 8), 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm, located
2.5-cm from the deep margin and 1 cm from anterior. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue
procurement (mass #1). Representatively submitted:
31-82: Nipple
B3: Skin
B4-B5: Mass #1, two o'clock, UIQ, slice 9
36—87: Mass #1, two o'clock, UIQ, slice 9

815-816: Representative sections, LIQ, slice 12
BI7: Possible axillary lymph nodes

C. RIGHT AXILLARY CONTENTS

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and “ axillary contents" is a 10.5 x 10.0 x 2.5 cm
portion of adipose tissue, within which, 34 possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed, ranging from 0.1 to 2.5
cm. The cut surfaces of the larger nodes are fatty to soft tan-pink. No evidence of tumor is grossly
noted. The specimen is entirely submitted as follows:

C1-six lymph nodes

CZ—six lymph nodes

CS—six lymph nodes

C4-six lymph nodes

CS-seven lymph nodes

06- one lymph node bisected

C7-one lymph node bisected

C8-C9-one lymph node

C10-C14-remaining soft tissue

DIAGNOSIS:
A. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #1 and #2, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION:
- METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE OF ONE LYMPH NODE (1/1),
MEASURING 8-MM WITH EXTRANODAL EXTENSION.

B. BREAST. RIGHT, MASTECTOMY:

TSS:

- INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 2, MEASURING 1.1 CM, PRESENT IN UPPER
INNER QUADRANTWMW’

- HIGH NUCLEAR GRADE, DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SlTU. SOLID type

- SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR

- BIOPSY SITE CHANGES WITH FIBROSIS, GRANULATION TISSUE

- usual ductal hyperplasia without atypia

- ﬁbroadenoma (0/.7-CM) AND INTRADUCTAL PAPILLOMA (0.2-CM)

- SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT.

C. LYMPH NODES, RIGHT, AXILLARY DISSECTION:
- Thirty-FOUR LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0134).

NOTE: Two nodules are grossly identiﬁed, one located in the upper inner quadrant and one located in
the upper outer quadrant. Microscopically. the former is invasive ductal carcinoma and the later is
ﬁbroadenoma.

ADDENDUM:

Patthsion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit

Case NoAnalytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED
Clinical Interpretation of results
Ampliﬁcation of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase ﬂuorescence in-situ
hybridization (FISH) on formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn embedded tissue sections using a chromosome
17 r'emmmeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the

j by Dr.. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17

signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no
ampliﬁcation of the HER2/neu gene.

Block used B7 Source of case: Tissue ﬁxation formalin-ﬁxed tissue Outside Case NorNA
Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes
HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.15

This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of

CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic

mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded.
Method of ratio enumeration: manual count

Limitations

The Vysis Patthsion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is

intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free

and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding

adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into

consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status.
No

treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-
2/neu

gene ampliﬁcation status alone.

Overview of this test

FDA APPROVED REAGENT

Patthsion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of
natients for whom Herceptin® therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the
, under the direction
of Dr.. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the
clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.
