GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. RIGHT GROIN SUPERFICIAL LYMPH NODE

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "right groin superﬁcial lymph node" is an
unoriented piece Of yellow-tan soft tissue. 45 x 10.5 x 3 cm. On sectioning, are multiple blood vessels
with lumens up to 0.2 cm and areas of dense ﬁbrous tissue with embedded staples and sutures. The
lymph nodes ranging from 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm to 2.4 x 2.2 x 1.1 cm. Lymph nodes are sectioned and
have variegated pink and black-tan cut surfaces admixed with fat and ﬁbrous tissue; lymph nodes are
submitted entirely:

A1: blood vessels

A2: ﬁbrous tissue

A3-A6: 1 sectioned lymph node in each cassette

A7-A9: 1 sectioned lymph node

A 10-A11: 1 bisected lymph node

A12-A13: 1 bisected lymph node

B. RIGHT EXTERNAL ILIAC LYMPH NODE

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "right external iliac lymph node"
is a red-tan lymph node with attached adipose tissue measuring 3.9 x 2.8 x 2.9 cm. The specimen is
sectioned to show dark brown/gray, soft, ﬂeshy cut surface. A portion of the specimen is submitted for
tissue procurement. Representative sections are submitted, 81-82.

C. ADDITIONAL RIGHT EXTERNAL ILIAC LYMPH NODE

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "additional right iliac lymph
node" are multiple fragments of red—tan soft tissue measuring 3.9 x 2.8 x 0.4 cm in aggregate.

Surg Date

Sectioning shows two possible lymph nodes, 1.9 x 1.4 x 0.4 cm and 3.5 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm. The entire
specimen is submitted:

C1: One bisected lymph node

02: One bisected lymph node

C3: Remainder of the specimen

D. RIGHT OBTURATOR LYMPH NODE

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "right obturator lymph node"
is a portion of red-tan soft tissue measuring 5.8 x 4.5 x1.1 cm. Sectioning shows multiple possible

lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 up to 4.3 x 3.5 x 1.1 cm. Cassettes are submitted as follows:
D1: 4 possible lymph nodes

DZ-D7: One lymph node, sectioned
E. ADDITIONAL PRE-PERITONEAL TISSUE
Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "additional preperitoneal

tissue" are two fragments of red-tan soft tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm in aggregate. Entirely
submitted, E1.

Population: Lymph Node

Stain/Marker:Result: Comment:
HMB 45 Negative
A103,MELAN-A Negative

The interpretation of the above immunohistochemistry stain or stains is guided by published results in
the medical literature, provided package information from the manufacturer and by internal review of
staining performance and assay validation within the Immunohistochemistry Laboratory. The use of
one or more reagents in the above tests is regulated as an analyte speciﬁc reagent (ASR). These tests
were developed and their performance characteristic determined by the Department of Pathology
Laboratory. They have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The
FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.

Special stains and/or immunohistochemical stains were performed with appropriately stained positive
and/or negative controls.
