Microscopic Description:

Sections demonstrate a hypercellular glial neoplasm compose of two phenotypic
populations of neoplastic cells. The astrocytic component of the tumor consists
perdominantly of cells with gemistocytic features, including eccentric moderately
plemorphic nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. The oligodendrocytic
component of the tumor is characterized by numerous neoplastic cells with round to oval
nuclei and prominent perinuclear halos. The two populations of tumor cells in some areas
are intermixed and in others areas appear separate. Overall, the ctyologic atypia appears
moderate. There is a background of microcystic change. The tumor diffusely infiltrates
adjacent brain parenchyma. Scattered mitotic figures are seen. Microvascular
proliferation is prevalent. Foci of early micronecrosis are seen. The low mitotic activity
of the tumor (up to 2 mitoses per 10 high power fields) and the moderate degree of
pleomorphism would suggest a low grade glioma; however, the presence of prominent
microvascular proliferation and foci of early necrosis are concerning for a high grade
tumor. A final diagnosis will be issued pending review of MIB-l.

Addendum Discussion:

The MIB-l labeling index ranges up to 6.9% in the most proliferative regions of tumor.
The elevated MIB-l labeling index, in conjunction with the immunohistochemical
features support an oligoastrocytoma with features concerning for early anaplastic
progression. The findings of early micronecrosis and microvascular proliferation are
worrisome for anaplastic progression. The degree of necrosis is not felt to be substantial
enough to classify this tumor as a glioblastoma with oligodendroglial differentiation;
however, this neoplasm should be closely followed.

Diagnosis:
Oligoastrocytoma with early anaplastic progression. MIB-l Labeling Index: 6.9%
