MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
A—C: See ﬁnal microscopic diagnosis.

'0: Sections of the bladder representing the section of the polypoid mass in the left lateral wall shows a moderate
to poorly differentiated papillary urothelial carcinoma (04-9), grade 3 of.4, extending into the superﬁcial part of the
muscularis propria. Associated with invasive tumor are fooi of in situ urothelial carcinoma (ﬂat lesion) which
mainly involve the left lateral and posterior wall of the bladder. The left bladder we" also shows chronic
inﬂammation, ﬁbrosis and changes consistent with previous biopsy site. The rest of the bladder mucosa shows
extensive chronic inﬂammation with cystitis glandularis and cystitis cystica. All resection margins of the bladder
are free of dysplasia and malignancy. The prostatic urethra show polypoid cystitis (023). Sections of the prostate
show marked chronic inflammation; otherwise. the prostate is free of dyspiasia or malignancy.

INTRAOPERATIVE FROZEN CONSULTATION:
AFS: Right distal ureter:
- benign

BFS: Left distal ureter:
- benign

CFS: Apical urethral margin:
- prostatitis with calciﬁcation

SFS: Sigmoid polyp:

ureter with surrounding fat measuring 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. Entirely submitted for frozen section in cassette AFS.

B: The specimen is received fresh from the OR. and labeled "Lt. distal ureter-f/s". It consists of a segment of
ureter with surrounding fat measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. The ureter itself measures 0.3 x 0.3 cm. Entirely
submitted for frozen section in cassette BFS.

C: The specimen is received fresh from the OR. and labeled "Apical urethral margin-fie". It consists of two
pink-tan soft tissue fragments measuring 2 and 0.7 cm in greatest diameter. The specimen is entirely submitted
.for frozen section in cassette CFS.

D: The specimen is received fresh fromthe OR. and labeled "Bladder/prostate". It consists of radical
cystoprostatectomy specimen measuring 0.8 x 15 x 5 cm overall. The peritoneum measures 23 x 13 by less than
0.1 cm. It is pink-tan, smooth, glistening and unremarkable. The prostate and lower bladder are entirely inked
black. Red ink is superimposed at the right side of the prostate. The prostate itself measures 4.5 x 4 x 3.5 cm.
Opening the prostate anteriorly reveals a prostatic urethra to measure 3.5 x 1 cm without excavation. The
verumontanum measures 0.7 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. It is unremarkable. The bladder measures 10 x 7 x 4 cm. Opening
the bladder anteriorty shows a pink-tan polypoid mass on the upper part of the left anterior wall which measures
2.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. The polypoid mass is surrounded by a velvety hemorrhagic area measuring 1.2 x 1.7 cm
which is surrounded by white-tan scar measuring 1.5 cm. The mucosa in the posterior bladder wall is granular
and edematous. The rest of the bladder mucosa is pin k—tan and unremarkable. Sectioning the polypoid mass
reveals that the tumor extend grossly to the superﬁcial muscle but does not extend to the deep muscle or the
surrounding fat. The attached right ureter measures 6 cm in length and 0.6 cm in circumference with normal
appearing mucosa. The attached left distal ureter measures 5 cm in length by 0.5 cm in circumference with
normal appearing mucosa. The right seminal vesicle measures 2.5 x 2 x 0.5 cm, and the left seminal vesicle
measures 2.5 x 1.7 x 0.5 cm. Both the right and left seminal vesicies are grossly unremarkable. The right vas
deferens measures 4 cm in length by 0.2 cm in diameter, and the left vas deferens measures 4.5 cm in length by
0.2 cm in diameter, and are unremarkable. No perivesical lymph nodes are identiﬁed. Representative sections
are submitted in 30 cassettes.

E: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Lt. para aortic LN". It consists of multiple fragments of

yellow fatty tissue with lymph nodes, measuring 3 x 2 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in three
cassettes.

F: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Lt. common iliac LN". It consists of multiple fragments of

yellow fatty tissue with lymph nodes, measuring 6.5 x 3.8 x 2.1 cm in aggregate. Entirely submitted in six
cassettes.

'G: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Rt. para caval LN". It consists of a 1.5 x 1 x 0.5 cm yellow
fatty tissue fragment. Serially sectioned and totally submitted in one cassette.

COMMENT:

Permanent sections of the colonic wall from the site of previous sigmoid polypectomy reveal an area of
adenomatous mucosa within the granulation tissueand focally on the surface. i cannot exclude the possibility that
the adenomatous mucosa in the granulation tissue is a focus of residual carcinoma. The change is not seen on
review of the frozen sections and only focally on the permanent sections of this Specimen. That includes deeper
sections of the parafﬁn block.The surface adenomatous change is close to an inked margin but on deepers is not
seen to involve it.
