The following statement applies to all immunohietochemietry, Ineitu hybridization (ISM A FISH), molecular anatomic pathology, and
immunotluorescence testing:

The testing was developed and its periormance characteristics determined by the ‘ , as
required by the CLIA '88 regulations. The testing has not been cleared or approved Tor me epecITIc use by me U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, but the FDA has determined such approval I: not necessary for clinical use.

This laboratory le certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 ('CLIA") as qualified to perform high-
compiexlty clinical testing. Pursuant to the requirement: of CLIA, ASR': used in this laboratory have been established and verified for
accuracy and precision. Additional Information about this type of test is available upon request.
