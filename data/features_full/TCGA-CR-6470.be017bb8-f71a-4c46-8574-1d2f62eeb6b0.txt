Tissue Submitted: unspecified

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1) SOURCE: Tonsil , Right

Received fresh is a specimen labeled, "right tonsil," consisting of a

2.8 X 2.0 X 1.1 cm tonsillectomy specimen. A 2.2 X 1.8 X 0.9 cm mass is
identified on the mucosal surface of the specimen. The specimen is inked
black. The specimen is serially sectioned and a portion of the specimen
is obtained for future research studies. A portion of the specimen is
submitted for frozen section analysis. The remainder of the specimen is
submitted for permanent section.

Summary of sections: lAFSC, 1/1; 1B-C, mass, 1B, 2/1, 1C, 3/1.

2) SOURCE: Right Neck adjacent to jugular vein

Received fresh is a specimen labeled, "soft tissue right neck adjacent
to jugular vein," consisting of a 0.5 X 0.4 X 0.3 cm portion of soft
tissue, which is entirely submitted for frozen section analysis.
Summary of sections: 2AFSC, 1/ 1.

3) SOURCE: Right neck level 1 B

Received fresh is a specimen labeled, "right neck level 1B," consisting
of a 4.0 X 3.0 X 1.0 cm portion of yellow, soft, and lobulated adipose
tissue. A search for lymph nodes is performed. No lymph nodes are
identified through palpation. The specimen is serially sectioned to
reveal tissue consistent with a salivary gland. The specimen is entirely
submitted.

Summary of sections: 3A, 2/1; 3B, 1/1; 3C, 2/1; 3D, 1/1; 3E, 1/1.

4) SOURCE: Right neck level 2 + 3

Received fresh is a specimen labeled, "right neck level 2-3," consisting
of two fragments of fibroconnective and adipose tissue, measuring 5.0 X
4.5 X 1.0 cm in aggregate. A search for lymph nodes is performed. The
specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.

Summary of sections: 4A, fragment of fibroconnective tissue, bisected,
1/ 1; 4B, three lymph nodes, 3/ 1; 4C, one lymph node, bisected, 2/ 1; 4D,
three lymph nodes, 3/ 1; 4E-G, fragment of fibroconnective tissue,
serially sectioned, 1/1 each.

5) SOURCE: Right neck scar

Received fresh is a specimen labeled, "right neck scar," consisting of a
7.0 X 0.7 X 0.4 cm portion of skin and subcutaneous tissue. A 6.0 cm
scar is identified on the cutaneous surface of the specimen. The
specimen is not oriented. The subcutaneous tissue is inked black. The
specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.

Summary of sections: 5A, tips, 2/ 1; 5B-C, scar, 5B, 8/1, 5C, 6/ 1.

6) SOURCE: Left neck level 2,3

Received fresh is a specimen labeled, "left neck level 2-3," consisting

of a 7.0 X 3.0 X 1.0 cm portion of fibroadipose tissue. A search for
lymph nodes is performed. A representative portion of the specimen
containing lymph nodes is submitted.

Summary of sections: 6A, four lymph nodes, 4/ 1; 6B, three lymph nodes,
3/ 1; 6C, portion of fibroconnective tissue, 1/ 1.

7) SOURCE: Tonsil , Left

Received fresh is a specimen labeled, "left tonsil," consisting of a
tonsillectomy specimen, measuring 2.5 X 1.5 X 1.0 cm. The specimen
reveals eXtensive cautery artifact. The specimen is inked black,
serially sectioned and entirely submitted.

Summary of sections: 7A-B, tonsil, 2/1 each.

8) SOURCE: Teeth; 1,31,32

Received fresh is a specimen labeled, " teeth, 1, 31, 32," consisting of
molar teeth with attached minimal amount of soft tissue, showing no
significant histopathologic changes. The specimen is filed in the
medicolegal file. No tissue is retained for permanent section. This is a
gross diagnosis only.
