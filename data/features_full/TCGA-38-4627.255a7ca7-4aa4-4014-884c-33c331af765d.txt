— No metastatic carcin0ma identified (0/1).

Comment :
None.

Clinical History:
The patient is with right NSCLC, in for right thoracotomy.

Received are three appropriately labeled containers.

container A is additionally labeled "RUL."

Specimen fixation: formalin

other attached structures: n/a

lmor location: central

Tumor size and description: The tumor mass is a 2.7 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm firmr tan mass with stellate borders and
focal areas of gray discoloration scattered across the cut surface.

Relationship of tumor to bronchUS: does not groesly involve
Distance of tumor to bronchial margin: approximately 2.9 cm
Relationship/distance of tumor to pleura: the tumor nodule is grossly abutting the overlying blue inked pleura

Distance of tumor to other surgical margins: There is a complex staple line running across the specimen. and the
tumor nodule is at least 0.6 cm from the staple line. -

Involvement of attached structures by tumor: n/a

Description of nontumorous lung: Dark, red/tan, soft, spongy and aerated lung parenchyma with no other lesions
or abnormalities identified.

Comment: The following is submitted to Tissue 9rocurement: the bronchial margin was removed and the next cross
section of bronchus was given to Tissue Procurement, representative tumor and representativa normal

lung were also given to Tissue procurement.
