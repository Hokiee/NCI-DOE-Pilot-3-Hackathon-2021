these microscopic fobi, with single bigh.power microscopic fields contalning as
many as three mitotic figures. Maximal mitotic counts are eight mitotic figurea
per 10 high power fields. The proliferation index, as judged by
immunohistochamical staining with the proliferatibn marker MIB 1, is variable,
but is markedly increased within the hypercelluiar'and mitotically active fields
described of, where it approaches the order of 10% focally. There is scattered
weak t0 maderate nuclear positivity for p53 protein. Considered in cumbination,
these morphological findings [mitotic caunts greater than five figures per 10
high pawer fields, hypercellularity and pleamorphism,,microvascular endothelial
preliferation] are cohsistent with WHO grade III ianaplastic} mligodendraglicma.
C, All tiasua submitted was proce33ed and examined. Sections include cartex and
white maﬁter, demonstrating some reactive changes. No unequivocaL areas of
glioma invclvement evident in the material examined.
CONCLUSION:
A. and 8. Right frantal.brain tumor. WHO grade III {anaplasticl
aliqodendroglioma.
C. Posterior margin resection. Reactive cortex and white matter; ~ no definite
qlioma identified.
Representative formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections will be
submitted for FISH [fluorescence in situ hybridization} studies to assess 1p,
19q and EGFR. These results will be reported separataly.
