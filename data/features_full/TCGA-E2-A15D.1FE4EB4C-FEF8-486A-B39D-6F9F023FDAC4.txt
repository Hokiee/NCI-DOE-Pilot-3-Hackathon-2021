GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. RIGHT BREAST CANCER
Received fresh labeled with the patient’s identiﬁcation and "right breast needle localization" is a previously inked 53g,
6 x 5 x 4cm needle localized lumpectomy with radiograph. lnk code: anterior-yellow, posterior-black, superior-blue,
inferior-orange. medial-green. lateral-red. Specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 8 slices revealing
a 2.5 x 2.3 x 1.5cm tan white ﬁrm well circumscribed mass, 0.60m from the closest inferior margin in slices 2-7. A
surgical clip is identiﬁed in slice 5. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement. Representatively
