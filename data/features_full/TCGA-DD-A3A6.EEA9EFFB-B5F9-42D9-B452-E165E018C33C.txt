TISSUE DESCRIPTION:

Right lobe liver (645 grams, 17 x 12 x 7 cm),gallbladder (9 x 3 x 2 cm) and
separately submitted pericholedochal lymph node (3 cm) A1, Bl, C1, C2,
C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8

DIAGNOSIS:

Right lobe liver, resection: Grade 2 hepatocellular carcinoma is identiﬁed forming
a well-circumscribed mass (8 x 6 x 6 cm) in the right lobe of the liver. The closest

surgical resection margin is at a distance of 2 mm. The margins of resection are free
of involvement.

Gallbladder, excision: Mild chronic cholecystitis.

Pericholedochal lymph node, excision: Single inﬂammatory lymph node identiﬁed.
Parafﬁn section immunostains show neoplastic cells are positive for CAM 5.2,
Vimentin, and alpha fetoprotein, while they are negative for p-CEA, 8-100, and actin.
In situ hybridization for albumin mRNA is weakly positive. These results support
the diagnosis of hepatoma. HMB-45 immunostain, however, is also positive in
neoplastic cells; the meaning of this staining reactivity is unclear.

Note: Seen with Dr. and Dr.

PRELIMINARY FROZEN SECTION CONSULTATION:
Hold to conﬁrm - grade 3 hepatocellular carcinoma right lobe liver.
