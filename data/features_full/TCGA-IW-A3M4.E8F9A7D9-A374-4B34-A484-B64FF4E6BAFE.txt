COMMENT: Preliminary pathologic ﬁndings were renorted to the ofﬁce of Dr. 1 on

and subsequently discussed with Dr. A battery of immunohistochemical stains
was subsequently performed. The tumor cells exhibit strong positive staining for vimentin and
smooth muscle~speciflc actin. Many of the neoplastic cells also stain positively for desmin and some
also stain positively for CD10. No speciﬁc staining of the neOpIastic cells for myoDi, C9117,

C. UTERUS

Labeled with the patient's name, labeled "uterus", and received fresh in the Operating Room for intraoperative
frozen section, is a 5 l0 gram total hysterectomy specimen with an attached segment of left fallopian tube. The
uterus is asymmetric and markedly distorted in shape clue to the presence of underlying mass lesions (see below).
The uterus measures about 12.0 cm from the fundus to the ectocervix, 10.0 cm from comu to cornu, and up to 9.0
cm from the anterior surface to the posterior surface. The uterine serosa is pink-tan, and shows some adhesions and
some attached thin—walled translucent clear to pale yellow ﬂuid-filled cysts, the latter of which measure up to about
1.0 cm in diameter. The cystic lesions are present in the anterior fundic region. Attached to the uterus, there are
parametrial (parauterine and paracervical) soil tissues that measure up to about 1.5 cm in width on the right side and
up to about 1.0 cm in width on the left side. The right parametrial tissues are invaded by semisoft, tan tumor. The
left pammetrial tissues are focally hemorrhagic but appear grossly free of tumor. The cervix is about 4.0 cm long
and has a maximum diameter of 5.0 cm in the eotocervlcal region. The mucosa lining the ectocervix is ran to pink-
tan and shows a few tiny punctate areas of hemorrhage, but is otherwise grossly unremarkable. No vaginal cut? is
identiﬁed. The paracervical and parametrial tissues anteriorly are inked blue and those postcriorly are inked black.
The external cervical us is slit-shaped, about 0.8 cm in diameter and patent. The uterus was previously incised on
both sides at the time of intraopcrative consultation. The cervical transformation zone is distinct. The cndoccrvical
canal is about 3.0 cm long. to the anterior endocervical near the tower uterine segment, there is a. 0.5 cm in
diameter semisoﬁ tan endocervical polyp. Cut sections of the cervix, including the polyp reveal several mucus—
ﬁllcd cyst, ranging from less than (H to about 0.6 cm in diameter. The cervix appears grossly free of tumor. The
cndomctrial cavity is about 6.0 cm long and up to 1.5 cm in width. Within the posterior lower uterine segment.
there is about a 0.5 cm diameter semisot‘t tan endometrial polyp. Elsewhere the endomctrium is relatively smooth.
ran to red-tan and ranges from less than 0.1 to about 0.2 cm in thickness. The endometrium appears grossly Free of
tumor. There is a fairly welhcircumscrihcd 9 x 7.5 x 7.5 cm tumor mass with focally irregular borders that occupies
nearly the full thickness of the muscular uterine wall and extends into the adjacent parametrial soft tissues and broad
ligament on the right side. The tumor is composed of scmisot’t tau tissue. No grossly evident areas of necrosis are
seen in the large tumor mass; however there are small foci of hemorrhage within the lesion. The intrauterine portion

of the neoplasm involves the fundus and corpus. No extension into the lower uterine segment or cervix is seen.
Within the uterus, there are also ten well~circumscrihed tnyomatous masses that range from about 0.2 to 3.0 cm in
maximum dimensions. Two of the myomatous lesions are subserosal and the rest are intramural. Nine of the ten
myomatous masses are composed of ﬁrm tan—white Solid tiSSue without grossly evident areas of hemorrhage or
necrosis. One of the myomatous lesions is composed of somewhat softer tan solid tissue without grossly evident
areas of hemorrhage or necrosis. Attached to the ieﬁ comu of the uterus, there is an 1 1.5 cm long, up to 0.5 cm
diameter timbriated let‘t Fallopian tube. The seros‘al surface of the fallopian tube is pink-tan. mildly congested, but
smooth. Cross sections of the fallopian tube reveal a patent lumen that ranges from pinpoint to about 0.2 cm in
diameter. The left fallopian tube appears grossly free of tumor, No left ovarian tiSSue or right adnexal tissues are
identiﬁed in the specimen. Several representative sections of the large uterine mass were frozen and sectioned for
intraoperative diagnosis (FS ﬁt). Frozen section interpretation was rendered by Dr. ‘ The frozen section
remnants and the rest of the specimen are subsequently ﬁxed in formalin.

Representative sections are submitted.
