GROSS DESCRIPTION: (continued)

Cassette 68: One lymph node, bisected.

7) Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, unit number and "uterus, tubes anu
ovarieS", is an 82 gram specimen consisting of an unopened uterus (7.0 x 5.0 x 3.0
cm). right fallopian tube (5.0 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter), right ovary (2.0 x
1.4 x 0.8 cm), left fallopian tube (5.0 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter), left ovary
(2.2 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm). The exocervix (3.0 x 2.5 cm) is covered by smooth, glistening,
pink—red mucosa. The external os is slit—like and measures 0.8 cm in diameter. The
endocervical canal (2.5 cm in length) has a tan-pink herringbone mucosa. The
endometrial cavity (3.5 cm from cornu to cornu, 3.0 cm in length) has a tan-pink
endometrial lining. There is an approximately 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm polypoid tumor of
heaped-up pink-red tissue on the upper anterior endometrial wall which appears to
extend into the upper posterior wall. The tumor has a thickness of approximately
0.2 cm and appears to encroach upon the underlying myometrium. No areas of deep
myometrial invasion are identified grossly. The tumor is located approximately 2.0 cm
from the lower uterine segment in the right upper cornual region, Myometrium measures
1.5 cm in maximum thickness. The serosa is dull pink-tan and without adhesions. The
fallopian tubes are patent and have fimbriated ends. The right ovary has a mildly
convoluted yellow to pink~tan surface with multiple corpora albicantia. The left
ovary has a mildly convoluted yellow to pink—tan outer surface with a single smooth
walled cyst (0.6 cm in greatest dimension) and multiple corpora albicantia. A
representative portion of endometrial tumor and uninvolved tissue are submitted for
research. The specimen is representatively sampled and submitted as follows:
CASSETTE SUMMARY:

Cassette 7A: Anterior cervix.
Cassette 7B: Anterior lower uterine segment.
Cassette 7C: Posterior cervix.
Cassette 7D: Posterior lower uterine segment.
Cassette 7E-7J: Anterior wall, full thickness.
Cassette 7K—7N: Posterior wall, full thickness.
Cassette 7?: Right ovary.
Cassette 70: Right ovary, fallopian tube.
Cassette 7R: Left ovary.
Cassette 75: Left ovary, fallopian tube.
