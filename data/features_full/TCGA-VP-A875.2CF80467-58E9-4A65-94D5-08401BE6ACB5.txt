Gross Description

The specimens are received in two formalin—filled containers, each labeled

' The first container is labeled "prostate." It holds a
prostate with one attached left seminal vesicle, and one detached right seminal
vesicle. The prostate has previously been inked black, and has had sections
removed from both the right and left lobe. The prostate weighs 48.5 gm and
measures 4.7 cm from anterior to posterior, 4.8 cm from superior to inferior,
and 5.3 cm from left to right. The right seminal vesicle measures 2.7 x l.6 x
1.4 cm; the left seminal vesicle measures 2.2 x 1.7 x 0.9 cm. On section, the
prostate shows soft, pink—tan, unremarkable tissue and the seminal vesicles are
unremarkable. Labeled Al — shaved bladder neck margin; A2 and A3 — left apical
radial margin; A4 and A5 — right apical radial margin; A6 and A7 - left apex; AB
and A9 - right apex; A10 and All - left base; A12 and A13 — right base; A14 —
left seminal vesicle; A15 — right seminal vesicle. Jar l.

The second container is labeled "lymph nodes pelvic." It contains a mass of
fibrofatty tissue with a diameter of 2.8 cm in diameter, measured in aggregate.
Labeled B1, B? Jar O

NON-NEOPLASTIC PROSTATE
The non—neoplastic prostate shows no abnormalities

 

METASTATIC LYMPH NODES
The lymph nodes are as follows (expressed as the number of metastatic nodes in
relation to the total number of nodes examined)

"pelvic" (0/4)

PRIMARY TUMOR (T)
Tumor extends through the prostate capsule (T3)
Extracapsular extension (unilateral or bilateral) (T3a)

REGIONAL LYMPH NODES (N)
No regional lymph node metastasis (NO)

DISTANT METASTASIS
Distant metastasis cannot be assessed (not evaluated by any modality) (MX)

STAGE GROUPING
T3a/NO/MX (Gleason Grade 3+4) (Stage III)

The pathologic stage assigned here should be regarded as provisional, and may
change after integration of clinical data not provided with this specimen.
