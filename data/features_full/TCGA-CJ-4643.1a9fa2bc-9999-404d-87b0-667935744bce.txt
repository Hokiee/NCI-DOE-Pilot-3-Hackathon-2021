GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) RIGHT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND ~ A nephreotomy specimen (22.0 x 13.5 x 6.3 cm) including the right kidney (13.0x 5.5 x
4.0 cm), a segment of the renal artery, the renal vein, two ureters (7.5 and 12.0 cm in length x approximately 0.4 cm in average

diameter), and the adrenal gland (0.6 x 3.7 x 1.8 cm).

There is a 9.5 x 7.2 x 6.0 cm well-circumscribed tumor in the mid portion of the kidney. Centrally. the tumor has a myxoid appearance
with a focus of calciﬁcation; the periphery is orange-yellow and slightly friable. There are no deﬁnitive areas of hemorrhage or
‘ecrosis. The tumor pushes onto the renal pelvis but does not invade it. There is no extention into the adipose tissue, renal sinus,

anal vein, or Gerota‘s fascia.

The adjacent kidney parenchyma is unremarkable. The pelvicaiyceai system is smooth and devoid of any lesions. One possible hilar

lymph node measures 1.7 x 0.9 x 0.9 cm.
Serial cross sections of the adrenal gland show an enlarged cortex measuring 0.5 cm. The remainder of the adrenal gland is

unremarkable.
Portions of tumor have been submitted for possible electron microscopy and to the tumor bank.

INK CODE: Black - Gerota's fascia and capsule nearest tumor.

SECTION CODE: At. both ureters, renal artery, and renal vein margins, en face; A2, enlarged portion of adrenal gland; A3. kidney,
representative sections; A4-A5. tumor within pelvis; AB-AB, tumor with inked capsule; AQ-A’t 0, tumor with adjacent kidney; At 't. tumor;
A12, representative sections of Gerota's fascia overlying tumor; A13, one possible lymph node; A14, tumor with sinus; A15, tumor with

pelvis; A16, adrenal gland, representative section. -
