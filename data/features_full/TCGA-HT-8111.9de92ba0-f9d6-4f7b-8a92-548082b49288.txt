Tumor:
Normal:

Addendum Diagnosis:
Anaplastic Oligoastrocytoma, Astrocytoma Predominant
MIB-l Labeling Index: 9.2%

Addendum Discussion:

Numerous MIB-l reactive cells are present throughout the tumor. In the most
proliferative areas, a labeling index of 9.2% is calculated, consistent with the anaplastic
histologic features.

Microscopic Description:

Review of frozen section and permanent material demonstrate a moderately hypercellular
glial neoplasm with variable and focally marked cytologic atypia. Numerous
gemistocytic cells and fibrillary astrocytes are present as well as areas of prominent
perivascular lymphocytic cuffing. Minor foci of classic oligodendroglioma are seen.
Scattered mitotic figures are identified.
