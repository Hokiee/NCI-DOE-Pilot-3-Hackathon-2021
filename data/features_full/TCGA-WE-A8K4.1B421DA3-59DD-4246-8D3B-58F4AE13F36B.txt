MACROSCOPIC:
8 mm punch biopsy.

MICROSCOPY:

{quli’ §:/EIV\ (?E:CZJL4~\4

A punch excision of skin showing a benign early trichilemmoma which
appears completely excised. There is no evidence of dysplasia or

malignancy.

HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

CASE HISTORY:

Superficial mass for many years.

necrosis in old lipoma.

MACROSCOPIC:

: TRICHILEMMOMA.

Ulcerated skin over mass.

? Fat

One core of tissue, 0.9 cm, plus frags.

MICROSCOPY:

A fragmented needle core biopsy of fibrofatty tissue, which includes
parts of a malignant neoplasm. It is composed of pleomorphic large
epithelioid and spindle—cell shaped cells. They have abundant
eosinophilic (sometimes faintly yellowish) cytoplasm and large
eosinophilic nucleoli. Elsewhere, the tissue shows chronic

fibro—inflammatory changes with focal yellowish brown pigment
(probably blood-derived).

There are various possibilities, of which malignant melanoma or
metastatic carcinoma are likely contenders. Are there any clinical
or historical clues?

Please regard this as a provisional and preliminary urgent report.

Definitive diagnosis will depend upon immunohistochemical staining.
A further report will follow.

DIAGNOSIS:
CORE BIOPSY OF MASS, RIGHT ARM

REPORTED BY:

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT:
Histochemical and immunohistochemical staining has been undertaken.

No definite melanin is recognised within the tumour cells. They are
strongly immunostained in 8100 protein, melan A, and HMB—45
preparations. They do not stain for keratins. These observations

imply that the tumour is a malignant melanoma. The history provided
seems odd in that context.

DIAGNOSIS:
CORE BIOPSY OF MASS, RIGHT ARM: MALIGNANT MELANOMA

REPORTED BY:

REPORT DATE:

 

MALIGNANT MELANOMA MINIMUM DATA SET
LAB NUMBER:
PRIVATE PATIENT: Yes

ADDRESS FOR REPORT:
CLINICAL HISTORY:

: Melanoma right upper arm.

MACROSCOPIC:

Large disc of skin 12 x 17 x 3.5 cm. Skin sutured centrally with
underlying firm tumour, 4 cm maximum diameter, which has been
sliced open,disrupted Distance of tumour to margin approximately 4

cm,

minimum 2.0 cm. Deep margin black. Peripheral margin yellow.
Closest margin is A and B. A and B continuous. C and D continuous.
E and F = random tumour.

MICROSCOPIC:
Tumour type Nodular
Growth phase Vertical
Breslow thickness (mm) 12.00
Mitotic rate (lsq mm) 4
Regression Absent
Lymphovascular invasion Absent
Perineural invasion Absent
Microsatellites Absent
Coexistent naevus Absent
Tumour inﬁltrating lymphocytes Non-brisk
Completely Excised Yes
Deep margin (mm) 0.3
Circumferential margin (mm) 20.0
Stage pT4a
COMMENT:

Skin sliced open before receipt-——ulceration can not be
excluded.

The possibility of a metastatic lesion should be excluded
clinically.

DIAGNOSIS:

Skin of Right Arm: Malignant Melanoma.

REPORTED BY:

ADDITIONAL REPORT:

BRAF immunostain is negative-
This case was sent to for BRAF
testing.

BRAF gene analysis using PCR for
Codon 600, Exon of BRAF gene showed no evidence of mutation.
