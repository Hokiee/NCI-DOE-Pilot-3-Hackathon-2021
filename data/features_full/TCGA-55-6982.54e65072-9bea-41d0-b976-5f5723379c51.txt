GROSS EXAMINATION.

A. The specimen is received in a container labeled with the

name of the patient and labeled as lymph node, station four,
lower paratracheal. The specimen consists of an oval pink
tan fragment of lymphoid tissue. The specimen measures 1.0
x 1.0 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is totally submitted for
frozen section.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: Benign lymph node. -

B. The specimen is received in a container labeled with the
name of the patient and labeled as lymph node, station four,
lower paratracheal. The specimen consists of an ovoid pink
tan fragment of l phoid tissue which measures 1.0 x 0.x
0.4 cm. The spec1men is totally submitted for frozen

usection.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: Benign lymph node. -

C. The specimen is received in a container labeled with the
name of the patient and labeled as lung biopsy, right lower
lobe nodule. The specimen consists of a gray pink wedge
biopsy of lung tissue which measures and 6.5 x 3.0 x 1.5
cm. The spe01men has a palpable 0.8 cm calcified nodule.
The serosal surface exhibits anthracotic stippling The
surgical margins are closed with rows of silver colored
metal staples The staple margin is removed and the margin
-is marked with ink. The specimen is serially sectioned and
the calcified nodule is submitted in block one for routine
processing following rapid decalcification. The remaining
specimen except for the stapled margin is submitted in
blocks two through four.

D. The specimen is received in a container labeled with the
name of the patient and labeled as lymph node, station nine,
pulmonary ligament. The specimen con31sts of an ovoid piece

rof gray tan rubber tissue which measures 1. 2 x 0.7 x 0.3

cm. The spe.cimen 1s bisected revealing an anthracotic lymph
node. The specimen is totally submitted.

E. The specimen is received in a container labeled with the
name of the patient and labeled as lung, right lower lobe.
The specimen consists of a gray pink piece of lung tissue
which measures 18 x 8 x 4.5 cm. The serosal surface
exhibits anthracotic stippling. The surgical margin is
closed with rows of silver colored metal staples. The
serosal surface is puckered and umbilicated. This area is
marked with ink. Under this area is a gra tan indurated
nodule which measures 3.5 cm in greatest dimension. This
nodule is located 1. 2 cm from the nearest stapled margin. A
frozen section is performed on the bronchial margins in two
blocks with a frozen section on the tumor nodule on frozen
section block three.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: Eul, UL bronchus—bronchial margin
free of tumor, E-2, lower bronchus- bronchial margin f
- tumor. E—3, tumor nodule— non—small cell carcinoma.
The stapled surgical margin is removed and the margin is
marked with ink. Additional sections of bronchial margins
are submitted in block four, anthracotic lymph nodes are
sampled in block five, tumor nodule and inked margin are
sampled in block six. The umbilicated area is sam led in
block seven. The area of tumor appears to be within 0.5 cm
of the closest bronchial margin and is sampled in block
eight. The remainder of the specimen is seriall
sectioned. Sectioning reveals a 0. 3 cm nodule d1stant of
the primary nodule. This nodule is submitted in block

nine. A representative section of normal appearing lung
tissue is submitted in block 10.

F. The specimen is received in a container labeled with the
name of the patient and labeled as lymph node, right hilar.
The specimen consists of an ovoid piece of blue gray rubbery
tissue which measures 2.0 x 0.6 x 0. 5 cm. The specimen is
sectioned revealing an anthracotic lymph node. The specimen
is totally submitted.

G. The specimen is received in a container labeled with the
name of the patient and labeled as lymph node, station four,
lower paratracheal. The specimen consists of two shaggy
fragments of gray tan soft tissue measuring in aggregate 1.5
x 0.8 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is totally submitted.

H. The specimen is received in a container labeled with the
name of the patient and labeled as lymph node, station
eight, paraesophageal. The specimen consists of a gray tan

'anthracotic lymph node measurin 0. 5 x 0.3 cm. The
specimen is totally submitted.
