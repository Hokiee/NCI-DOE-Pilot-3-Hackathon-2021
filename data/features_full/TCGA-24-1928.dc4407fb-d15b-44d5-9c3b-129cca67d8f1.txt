Microscopic Description and Comment: Poorly differentiated papillary serous adenocarcinoma
extensively replaces the omentum, is present on the serosal surfaces of the appendix,
uterus, both ovaries and both fallopian tubes and involves the specimens labelled I‘colonic
implant” and “small bowel implant.“ Both ovaries have been entirely submitted and no
significant cortical involvement is identified. The endometrium exhibits cystic atrophy but
is free of carcinoma. The myometrium contains several leiomyomas, the largest measuring 0.3
cm. Because the bulk of the tumor is present in the omentum and peritoneal locations and the
totally submitted ovaries exhibit only a a small amount of tumor on the serosal surfaces,
this tumor is best classified as a primary peritoneal papillary serous adenocarcinoma.

History: The patient is a — with a history of breast carcinom-

now has malignant ascites and a pelvic mass. Operative procedure: Examination under
anesthesia, exploratory laparotomy, omentectomy, appendectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy,
bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy and tumor debulking.

Gross Description The specimens are received in seven containers of formalin, each labeled
with the patient's name. The first container is labeled "omentum.“ It contains multiple
fragments of fibroadipose tissue that weigh 350 grams in toto and measure 20 x 15 x 3.5 cm
in aggregate. Most of the fibroadipose tissue fragments contain infiltrative tumor nodules
with the largest one measuring 10 x 4 x 3 cm. Sections of the tumor nodules show white—gray
solid cut surfaces with focal necrosis.

The second container is labeled ”colonic implant" and contains a single fragment of gray—tan
soft tissue that measures 6 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm. Sections show white—gray solid cut surface with
focal necrosis.
