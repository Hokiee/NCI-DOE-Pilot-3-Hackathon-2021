1) The specimen is received fresh. labeled "total thyroidectomy" and consists of a thyroid weighing 15.5 g. A stitch marks the
right superior pole. The right lobe measures 4.8 x 2.5 x 1.6 cm. the left lobe measures 4.8 x 2.2 x 1.2 cm, and the Isthmus
measures 2.5 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm. The external surface is covered by a thin ﬁbrous capsule. The posterior surface of the specimen is
inked black, and the anterior is inked blue. Sectioning reveals three well-circumscribed, focally calciﬁed nodules. measuring 0.7
cm (left inferior lobe, arbitrarily designated as Ni). 0.4 cm (right superior lobe, arbitrarily designated N2), and 2.3 cm (right
mid-inferior lobe, arbitrarily designated N3) in greatest dimension. The isthmus displays homogeneous. beefy red out surfaces: no
discrete lesions are grossly identified. s taken. The left and right lobes and isthmus are entirely submitted sequentially from
superior to interior.

Summary of sections:

N1 - nodule 1 (0.7 cm. left inferior lobe)

N2 - nodule 2 (0.4 cm. right superior lobe)
N3 - nodule 3 (2.3 cm, right mld‘inferlor lobe)
RL - remaining right lobe

LL - remaining left lobe

IS - isthmus

2). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "right neck. level 2", and consists of a portion of adipose tissue measuring 4 x 2.5 x 0.6
cm. Multiple pink tan ﬁrm lymph nodes ranging from 2 to 0.2 Cm in greatest dimension. All identified lymph nodes are
submitted.

3). The specimen is received fresh. labeled ”right neck, level 3,"and consists of a portion of adipose tissue measuring 3 x 1.9 x 0.8

submitted.

Summary of sections:
BLN - 2 bisected lymph nodes. one inked blue
