Final Surgical Pathology Report
Procedure:

Diagnosis
A. Right breast, excisional biopsy;
Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, grade 3, 3.5 cm in greatest dimension.
Invasive carcinoma 1 mm from posterior margin of resection.
Ductal carcinoma in situ, solid subtype, nuclear grade 3, accounting
for less than 5% of the tumor, margins uninvolved
B. Right axillary contents, resection:
Metastatic carcinoma in 2 of 14 lymph nodes, size of largest
metastasis 3.4 cm, extracapsular extension present (2/14).

Microscopic Description:
Microscopic examination performed.

A. Invasive Carcinoma: present
Histologic type: infiltrating ductal cancer
Histologic grade:
Overall grade: 3
Architectural score: 3
Nuclear score: 3
Mitotic score: 3

Greatest dimension (pT): 3.5 cm, pTZ

Specimen margins: negative but close, 1 mm from the
posterior margin (black in block A6)

Vessel invasion: not identified

Ductal carcinoma in situ: present
Histologic pattern: solid
Nuclear grade: 3
Central Necrosis: focal
% DCIS of total tumor (if mixed): < 5%
Extensive intraductal component (present/absent): absent
Specimen margins: negative, 3 mm from posterior
Calcification: not identified

B. Sections of the axillary dissection demonstrate metastatic
carcinoma in 2 of 14 lymph nodes, (le). The size of largest
metastasis is 3.4 cm. Extracapsular extension is present.

Specimen
A. Right breast mass
B. Right axillary contents

Clinical Information
Right breast cancer -year-old black female with right cancer and
positive nodes

Gross Description

Received fresh in a transpec container, subsequently fixed in formalin
labeled "right breast mass" is a 6.0 x 5.5 x 4.5 cm yellow pink fatty
tissue fragment which has a short suture designating superior and a
long suture designating anterior. The margins are inked as follows
based upon the orienting sutures: superior — orange; anterior — blue;
posterior — black; inferior — green. The specimen is serially

sectioned from medial to lateral. There is a 3.5 x 3.2 x 2.5 cm ill
circumscribed white tan mass centrally located, and within 0.2 cm of
the closest margin (deep). White rice—like pellets or gross identified
in the central which we be grossly consistent with a nrevious biopsy
site. The specimen is received in pathology it nd fixed in
formalin and . Representative sections of the specimen are
submitted as fellows: l - medial margin perpendicular, 2 — lateral
margin perpendicular. 1 — 10 — representative sections of the remainder
of the specimen.

E. Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled "right
axillary contents" is a 12.0 x 6 x 5 x 2.5 cm aggregate of yellow fatty
tissue grossly consistent with axillary contents. The specimen has a
suture designating superior. Multiple lymph nodes are palpated the
largest measuring 3.4 cm and located midway through the specimen. The
highest is markedly indurated as is the largest lymph node. The lymph
nodes are submitted from highest to lowest as follows: 1 ~lymph node
bisected, 2 ' 3 possible lymph nodes, 3 - 4 ~ 3 possible lymph nodes
each, 5 — representative section of largest positive lymph node,/l
possible lymph node bisected, 7 — 2 possible lymph nodes, 8 — 1
possible lymph node.
