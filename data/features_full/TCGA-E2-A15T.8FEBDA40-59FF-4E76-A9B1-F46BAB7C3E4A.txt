INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:
TPA/TPB-SLN #1, #2: Negative for carcinoma.
Diagnosis called by Dr. to Dr. at (A, B).

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 LEFT AXILLA
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and “sentinel LN #1“ is a fragment of yellow ﬁbroadipose
tissue, 5 x 3 x 1 cm containing a lymph node measuring 2 x 1 x 0.9 cm. The lymph node is sectioned and a touch
prep performed; lymph node submitted entirely in A1.
B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 LEFT AXILLA
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "sentinel LN #2" is a fragment of yellow ﬁbroadipose
tissue measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm containing a 1.5 x 1 x 0.9 cm lymph node. It is sectioned. a touch prep is
performed, and lymph node is submitted entirely in Bl.
C. LEFT BREAST
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "left breast" is an oriented 1408 g, 28 x 20 x 4 cm
mastectomy with 17 x 7 cm skin ellipse and a 0.9 cm everted nipple. Ink code: Anterior/superioroblue,
anterior/inferior—orange, posterior-black. Specimen is serially sectioned into 12 slices from lateral to medial with
nipple in slice 7 revealing a 7.2 x 5.8 x 3.2 cm ill-defined inﬁltrating mass extending from the 12 to 3 o'clock positions
in the upper outer quadrant in slices 3-7 that is closest to the anterior margin at 1,2 cm. In the axillary region is a
possible lymph node. 2.3 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm. Representatively submitted:
Cl: slice 2, UOQ lateral to lesion
cz-ca: slice 3. UOQ lesion (bisected)
C4: slice 4, UOQ superior portion of lesion
05-06: slice 4, UOQ lesion (bisected)
C7: slice 4, L00 inferior lesion
CB: slice 5, UOQ superior to lesion
C9: slice 5, posterior margin (grossly closest deep margin)
010: slice 6. mid section including lesion
C11: slice 7, mid section
C12: slice 8. medial to lesion
C13: slice 9, UIQ
C14: slice 11, HQ
C15: slice 2, LOO
616: slice 1, UOQ
017: possible lymph node
018—019: skin and nipple (bisected perpendicular sections)
D. LEFT BREAST SKIN
Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "left breast skin" is an unoriented tan pink skin
excision 32 x 1cm excised to a depth ranging from (Mom to 1.8cm. The skin surface is grossly unremarkable.
Representatively submitted in D1-DZ.
E. RIGHT BREAST TISSUE
Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and "right breast tissue" is a 2369, 27 x 12 x 5.4cm
aggregate of ﬁbrofatty tissue with attached unremarkable tan pink skin 10.5 x 4.3cm. The specimen is serially
sectioned to reveal unremarkable breast parenchyma. Representatively submitted in 31-82.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 1, LEFT AXILLA, BIOPSY:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NO TUMOR SEEN (011).

B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 2, LEFT AXILLA. BIOPSY:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NO TUMOR SEEN (0/1).

C. BREAST, LESS/SIMPLE MASTECTOMY:
: INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 2, WITH MUCINOUS
FEA U ES.
- INVASIVE CARCINOMA MEASURES AT LEAST 3 CM.
~ MARGINS, FREE OF TUMOR.
- DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), MICROPAPILLARY, PAPILLARY,
CRIBRIFORM. AND SOLID TYPES. NUCLEAR GRADE 2, WITH NECROSIS.
- SKIN, NIPPLE, AND SKELETAL MUSCLE, N0 TUMOR SEEN.

NOTE: The tumor involves the upper outer quadrant and consists of multiple foci of invasive carcinoma admixed with
DCIS. On a slash-Slidedbembcus of invasive carcinoma measures at least 3 cm. Invasive carcinoma spans
an area ~ 7 cm.

D. SKIN, LEFT BREAST, EXCISION:
- SKIN, NO TUMOR SEEN.

E. BREAST, RIGHT, EXCISION:
- APOCRINE METAPLASIA AND STROMAL FIBROSIS.
- BENIGN SKIN.
