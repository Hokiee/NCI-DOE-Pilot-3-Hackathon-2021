Diagnosis

This concerns a resected sigma sample with a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma
with histopathological differentiation grade G2, with ulceration of the inner surface of the
tumor, with necrosis, with peritumoral, chronic recurrent secondary inﬂammation with an
acute inﬂammation ﬂare, with carcinomatous lymphangitis, with tumor infiltration of the
sigma wall layers to the subserous fatty connective tissue, with moderate chronic
lymphadenitis of the tumor-free lymph nodes (0/13), with tumor-free overview slices from
the resection margins and from the anastomosis ring, as well as with a sigma diverticulosis.

According to the preparation sections at hand, the spreading of the tumor of the sigma
carcinoma corresponds to a tumor stage of pT3, pNO, MX, L1, R0.
