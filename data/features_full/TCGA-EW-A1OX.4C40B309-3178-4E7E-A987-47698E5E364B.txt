A. Received in formalin is a yellow ﬁbroadipose tissue weighing 92 grams, measuring 9.0 x 7.5 x 3.5 cm. The 3 'men is

oriented with short suture superior margin. long suture lateral margin and double sutures deep margin. The argins are
inked as follows: Superior margin is inked in blue, superior margin inked in green. lateral margin is inked in o nge.
medial margin is inked in red. anterior margin inked in yellow and deep margin inked in black. Multiple cross actions.
there is well demarcated tumor mass 3.0 x 2.4 x 2.4 cm located at approximately 0.7 cm closest margin (and .4 cm
inferior margin). The rest of the breast shows a white diffusely breast tissue and adipose tissue. The stroma fat ratio is

approximately 30-70%. Representative sections are submitted in twelve cassettes as follows:

1 Superior margin
2 inferior margin
3 Lateral margin
