Comment

Tumor cells have characteristic features of serous carcinoma. Clear cell changesis also seen_.i_nusgme
areas. however the tumor cells are diffusely positive for p53 and p16. Focal glands are positive for ER but
the tumor is negative for PR and PASD consistent with serous carcinoma.

Clinical History
endometrial ca.

Gross Description
1. The specimen container labelled with the patient's name and as "right pelvic lymph nodes" contains

multiple pieces of an unoriented fibroadipose tissue measuring from 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.6 to 3.8 x 2.3 x 1.4

received in 10% buffered formalin. . Within the fatty tissue, multiple lymph nodes are identified grossly
measuring 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 to 1.4 x 1.2 x10 cm.

The specimen is submitted in toto as follows:

1A one lymph node bisected

13 one lymph node bisected

10 one lymph node bisected

10 multiple lymph nodes.

1E 1F the rest of the fatty tissue submitted in toto

2. The specimen container labelled with the patient's name and as "right common iliac lymph nodes"
contains a single piece of an unoriented ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.6 received in 10%
buffered formalin. . Within the fatty tissue, two lymph nodes are identified grossly measuring 0.5 x 0.4 x
0.4 and 1.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm

The specimen is submitted in toto as follows:

2A two lymph nodes

ZB the rest of the fatty tissue submitted in toto

3. The specimen container labelled with the patient's name and as "left pelvic lymph nodes" contains
multiple pieces of an unoriented fibroadipose tissue measuring 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.8 to 1.8 x 1.3 x 1.5 received
in 10% buffered formalin. . Within the fatty tissue, multiple lymph nodes are identified grossly measuring
0.4 x 0.4 x 0.4 to 1.3 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm.

The specimen is submitted in toto as follows:

3A multiple lymph nodes.

SB one lymph node bisected

SC one lymph node bisected

3D-3E the rest of the fatty tissue submitted in toto

4. The specimen container is labeled with the patient's name and as "uterus, cervix, right ovary and
bilateral fallopian tubes” contains a uterus, cervix, right ovary, right and left fimbriated fallopian tubes
received in 10% buffered formalin. The entire specimen weighs 38.3 g. The uterus measures 6.0 SI x
4.4 ML x 5.5 cm AP with the cervix measuring 2.7 cm with a 0.4 cm ovoid-shaped os. The right and left
fimbriated fallopian tubes measure 6.0 x 0.4 and 4.2 x 0.5 cm respectively. The right ovary measures 3.6
x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. On gross examination, multiple paratubal cysts are identified on both the right and left
ﬁmbriated fallopian tube ranging in size from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm to 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm filled with clear ﬂuid
as well as and gelatinous material. The external surface of the right ovary as well as the cut surface is
tan in color, smooth and grossly unremarkable. The anterior and posterior uterine serosa is intact, brown-
tan in color smooth and shiny. On sectioning, a large polypoid tumor is identiﬁed on the superior aspect
of the anterior and posterior endometrium measuring 2.8 x 3.0 x 1.6 cm. The tumor is brown tan in color,
and has a soft and slightly friable consistency. The rest of the endometrium is tan in color shiny and
smooth. The myometrium measures 0.6 cm in thickness and has a slightly trabeculated appearance.
The endocervix is tan in color, and appears to be slightly nodular. Multiple pinpoint hemorrhages are
identified on the exocervix. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

4A left ﬁmbria longitudinally sectioned and submitted in toto

43 left fallopian tube serially sectioned and submitted in toto

40 right ﬁmbriated longitudinally sectioned and submitted in toto

4D. right fallopian tube serially sectioned and submitted in toto

4E 4G right ovary serially sectioned and submitted in toto

4H anterior endomyometrium superior aspect full thickness

4l-4J anterior endomyometrium mid superior aspect to cervix longitudinal section
4K posterior endomyometrium superior aspect thickness

4L-4M posterior endomyometrium superior aspect to cervix longitudinal section
multiple pieces of tissue stored frozen

5. The specimen container is labeled with the patient's name and as "omentum" contains a single piece of
an unoriented ﬁbroadipose tissue received in 10% buffered formalin. The tissue measures 8.0 x 1.8 x 1.5
cm.

On serial sectioning, the cut surface is predominantly fatty with no nodules identified grossly.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

5A- 5E representative section submitted
