Gross Description:

The specimen is received fresh for tissue procurement with

acquisition of tissue labeled with the patient's name,

and labeled "anterior mediastinal mass" and consists of a previously inked and
multiply incised irregular, lobulated rubbery mass, which has dimensions of 8.2
x 7.4 x 5.8 cm and weighs 274 g. The external surface is gray-tan to red-brown.
smooth and glistening to somewhat shaggy. There is some loosely attached
fat/possible thymic tissue, which has dimensions of 12.0 x 7.0 x 2.0 cm. The
specimen is further sectioned to reveal a pink-tan to red-brown, lobulated,
glistening, focally hemorrhagic and somewhat ﬂeshy appearing cut surface. This
mass is largely encapsulated. The loosely attached fat/possible thymic tissue is

910 (9/ 15 /l‘-/

3586/3

serially sectioned to reveal a gray-yellow to red-brown, focally hemorrhagic,
lobulated, glistening cut surface. Also, there are eight discrete lymph nodes
identiﬁed that range from 0.4 to 1.9 cm in greatest dimension.

Representative sections are submitted as labeled:
1-4 mass (two diagnostic sections are submitted in each cassette);
5 loosely attached fatjpossible thymic tissue;
6 four lymph nodes submitted in toto;
7 one lymph node submitted in toto;
8 three lymph nodes submitted in toto.

Microscopic Description:

Sections show an encapsulated tumor composed of abundant small mature
lymphocytes in association with inconspicuous bands of epithelial cells with
small oval nuclei and scant cytoplasm. There are broad fibrous bands running
through the tumor which intersect at acute angles. There are occasional "serum
lakes", hypocellular zones with protein-containing fluid.
