Intraogerative Consultation:

An intraoperaiive non-microscopic consultation was obtained and interpreted as: ”Brought to frozen 'BSO. pelvic tumor”
consisting of a 65 gram 8 x 6 x 60m friable illary— appearing tan—brotvn mass with attached tailopian tube portion.

Microscopic Description and Comment:

Evaluation of the “BSD. pelvic tumor” specimen ShOWS multiple matted fragments of ovarian tissue and ialiopian tube all
showing extensive involvement by high grade serous adenocarcinoma. of particular note, the sections of fallopian tube
show focal adenocarcinoma in situ within the tuba! epithelium, finding that indicates that, formally. the disease in this
case could be due to primary ovarian serous adenocarcinoma, primary tubal serous adenocarcinoma. or synchronous
primary ovarian and tubal serous adenccarcinomas (by convention In the absence of invasive disease arising within the

tubal adenocarcinoma' In situ, the tumor ha ry and the corresponding synoptic
completed). Clinical correlation' Is required
History:

The patient is a —with complex pelvic masses and a CAI25 over 10,000. Operative procedure:
Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and tumor debuiking.

Gross Description;
The specimen Is received in nine Iormalin- tilted containers, each labeled- ”-F! The first is additionally
ur ng

labeled "omentum/F51.' It holds a lace of tan- brown Iibroadipose tissue meas 1.5 x 0.3 cm. At one end is a
1....0x05x030mtannodule _

The second container ls labeled 'umbtlieus.‘ it holds an irregular piece of Ian iibroadipose tissue measuring 3 x 1.5 x
0.7 cm. At one end is a iirm 1.0 cm circumierence nodule that has a trabeculated appearance on out suriace. Labeled

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

The third container is labeled “BSO, pelvic tumor.‘ It holds a surgical specimen as described In the intraoperative
consultation, measuring 8 x 6 x 6 cm. Within the main mass, the surface of which is disrupted by a tan neoplasm with
papillary excrescences, two distinct ovaries cannot be discerned. Along one edge of the specimen Is a 2.0 x 0.5 cm
tubular structure. grossly consistent with fallopian tube. A putative fallopian tube is resent (0.5 cm in length) along the
opposite side. Labeled 01 to C4 - tumor in relation to across; 05 - fallopian tubes

The fourth container is labeled "pelvic tumor and sigmoid colon." it holds an unoriented piece of large Intestine
measuring 25 cm in length. The serosal and mesenteric fat is studded with innumerable white nodules ranging in size
from 0.1 to 1.5 cm. The colon is Opened lengthwise to show a tan-brown mucosa! folding pattern with no mucosa!
lesions. Six centimeters from one surgical margin, the corneal mass is lmpinging on the bowel lumen, and the luminal
circumference narrows lo 2 cm. The remainder of the luminal circumference is approximately 3.5 cm. The serosal fat
is serially sectioned to show multiple white nodules consistent with numerous soft tissue tumor deposits. No definitive
lymph nodes are identified. Also in the container Is a separate fragment of fibroadlpose tissue studded with tan—white
tumor deposits measuring 7 x 5 x 3 cm. Sectioned to show a tan-white tumorous mass measuring 5 cm in greatest
dimension. in the mid portion of this mass is a 0.3 cm luminal diameter containing fecal material. Labeled Di, 02 -
large intestinal margin; D3. D4 - area of mucosa in serosa at area of narrowing: D5 - additional sections of bowel
mucosa; D6 to D? - serosat nodule; DB to De - sections from separate fibroadipose tissue fragment.

The fifth container is labeled "bladder peritoneum." it holds a lace of fibrofat tissue measuring 4 x 3 x 1.0 cm. The
surface is studded with small (less than 0.2 cm) nodules.
The sixth container is labeled "omentum." it holds a piece of fibroadipose tissue measuring 15 x 15 x 3.0 cm. The

fibroadipose tissue is studded with innumerable tan-white nodules, some of which coalesce and measure 5 cm in
greatest dimension. The nodules are sectioned to Show a solid tan—white cut surface.

The seventh container is tabeled “distal pancreas.“ it holds a disrupted piece of fibroadipose tissue measuring 3.5 x 3 x
3.7 cm. Along one surface of this ilhroadipose tissue is a 2 x t x 0.5 cm firm, lobulated tissue. grossly consistent with
pancreas. Sectioned to show an unremarkable cut surface with no tumor grossly identified.

The eighth container is labeled "distal cecum and appendix." it holds tWo fragments of Ian tissue. The first contains a 6
x 1 cm appendix. The mescappendix is studded with multiple tan-white nodules, grossly consistent with involvement by
the metastatic tumor. A 1.0 surgical suture at the line of resection is present distally within this specimen. The second
tan tissue fragment measures 2 x 1 x 1 cm and has a 3.2 cm staple line of resection. Multiple tan-white nodules are
present on the serosal surface. The largest measures 1.5 cm. These nodules are at the staple line of resection.
Labeled H1 — appendix; H2 — additional tissue fragment.

The ninth container is labeled ‘EEA donuts, gross.‘ it holds two mucosal donuts. The largest donut measures 2 x 1.5 x
0.5 cm and the mucosa has been evened and Ian-brown with local areas of i mentation. The smaller donut measures
1 cm in diameter and also has focal mucosal hemorrhages. d9
