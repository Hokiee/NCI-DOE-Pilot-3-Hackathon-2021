TNM Descriptors: m (multiple primary tumors)
Primary Tumor (pT): pT2a: Tumor greater than 3 cm, but 5 cm or less in greatest dimension

surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of
invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus (ie, not in the main
bronchus); or Tumor 5 cm or less in greatest dimension with any of the
following features of extent: involves main bronchus, 2 cm or more distal to
the carina; invades the visceral pleura; associated with atelectasis or
obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve

Gross Description

Specimen A is received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and is designated as "left upper lobe
wedge." The specimen consists of a wedge of lung measuring 7.0 x 3.4 x 2.3 cm. The specimen is incised prior to receipt.
There is a nodule measuring approximately 1.5 cm in greatest dimension present in the specimen, causing pleural puckering,

less than 0.5 cm from the nearest staple line. Representative section of the tissu ' ' ' (A1FS).
Representative section of the remainder of the specimen is submitted as follows. Ml

Specimen B is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled with the patient's name, medical record number, and is
designated as "left upper lobe lung." The specimen consists of a lobe of lung weighing 180 grams and measuring 11.0 x 8.0 x
5.0 cm. There is a mass measuring 4.5 x 3.5 x 1.9 cm abutting the visceral pleura, causing puckering. The mass is 1.0 cm from
the staple line of the presumed previous wedge resection. The mass is 2.3 cm from the bronchial and vascular margins. The
mass surrounds the large vessel (probable vein) but does not appear to invade it. No gross bronchovascular invasion is
identiﬁed. An additional area of pleural thickening spanning approximately 4.0 cm is present, grossly 1.0 cm from the
aforementioned mass and 1.0 cm from the bronchovascular margins. The thickening abuts the staple line. Multiple possible

peribronchial lymph nodes are identiﬁed. The bronchial margin is submitted for frozen section (B1FS). No other lesions are

identiﬁed. ' ering overlying the 4.5 cm mass is inked blue. Representative sections are submitted
as follows.

Specimen C is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number, and is designated as "#6 lymph

submitted as follows.

Specimen D is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number, and is designated as "#7 lymph
