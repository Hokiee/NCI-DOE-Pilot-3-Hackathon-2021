GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin,
and consists of a dark tan intact gallbladder which measures 8.0 x 3.0 x 3.0
cm. The serosal surface is smooth and glistening. Opening the gallbladder
reveals it to be filled with a thick green bile and contains round
multifaceted calculi ranging in size from 0.1 cm up to 0.6 cm in greatest
dimension. The mucosa surface is dark green, velvety and the gallbladder wall
measures 0.2 cm in thickness. Found within the cystic duct are two brown

HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

multifaceted calculi measuring 0.2 cm in greatest dimension. Grossly the
cystic duct lymph node is not identified. Three representative sections are
submitted in one cassette.

B. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin,
and consists of a portion of liver weighing 859 g and measuring 15.0 x 12.0 x
8.0 cm. The resection margin of the specimen has been inked blue. Sectioning
of the specimen reveals a lobulated necrotic mass occupying approximately 80%
of the liver measuring 12 x 9.6 x 2.4 cm. The border of this mass has an
ill—defined appearance and two small tan nodules are identified within the
liver parenchyma adjacent to this large mass. Both these nodules measures 0.2
cm in greatest dimension. A prominent blood vessel is noted within the liver
parenchyma that contains thrombus material. Grossly the liver capsule has a

4 lobulated appearance due to invasion of the mass. Grossly the main mass comes

@g’ to within approximately 1.5 cm of the blue painted margin. The liver capsule

' overlying the normal liver parenchyma has a slightly bumpy appearance
?cirrhosis. Sections of the specimen is as follows:

B1. section of vessel with thrombus at blue painted margin

32—3. two random sections of blue painted margin

B4—6. section of nodules on liver capsule

B7. section of nodule on liver capsule and small nodule close to
overlying blue painted margin, 0.2 cm

B8—10. three sections from the large mass

Ell—12. two random sections from adjacent liver parenchyma

B13. section of small nodule ?satellite lesion in liver parenchyma

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:

The hepatocellular carcinoma is composed of mainly trabecular and
pseudoglandular pattern. The tumor cells are hyperchromatic with easily
identifiable mitoses. Focal tumor necrosis is also present. There are
peritumoral intravascular invasion. The tumor is focally infiltrating into
the perihepatic adipose tissue (? diaphragm). The immunohistochemical stains
demonstrate the nature of the hepatocellular origin. The tumor cells show
canalicular stain for CEA and are strongly positive for Hep-par-l. They are
negative for CK7, CKZO, synaptophysin and AFP. The background hepatic tissue
is cirrhotic. The etiology of cirrhosis cannot be determined.” HowevEr. there
are signifiCant numbers of lymphoplasmacytes and eosinophils in the periportal
area. The hepatocytes show no ground glass change or Mallory bodies.
