This amended report is issued to correct the source of specimen in part #1

to left kidney per
labeled from the operating room.

1. Left kidney, biopsy:

- High grade carcinoma.

2. Soft tissue at hilum, excision:

- Fatty tissue with high grade carcinoma.
- Lymphoid tissue not identiﬁed.

3. Fat at diaphragm, excision:

- Fatty tissue with no tumor seen.

4. Anterior margin, biopsy:

- Fatty tissue with no tumor seen.

5. Medial soft tissue at apex, excision:
- Fatty tissue with no tumor seen.

6. Retroperitoneal soft tissue, excision:
- Fatty tissue with no tumor seen.

7. Left ureter, ureterectomy:

8. Left kidney, total nephrectomy:

- High grade renal cell carcinoma, papillary type II, 6.7 cm.
- Tumor invades through the kidney into the perirenal fat.

- Vein invasion is identiﬁed.

- Vascular and ureteral margins with no tumor seen.

- pTNM: T3a Nx Mx

Note: lnnnunohistochemical stains performed with good positive and
negative controls show tumor cells focally positive for RCC, CK19 and
vimentin. They are negative for CD10, keratin903, CK5/6 and CD117. This
proﬁle is consistent with papillary carcinoma of kidney.

Gross Description:
Received in eight parts.
Source of Tissue: 1. Labeled #1, "left kidney mass"

Intraoperative Consultation: UROTHELIAL CARCINOMA PER DR. 1

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled "left kidney mass". It consists of a soft red-

brown irregular tissue fragment measuring 1 x l x 0.3 cm. Entirely frozen in IFS.
************************************************************************

Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled #2, "nodes at hilum"

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled "nodes at hilum". It consists of two soft
yellow-tan irregular ﬁbrofatty tissue fragments measuring 1.5 x l x 0.5 cm. The
specimen is sectioned to reveal a soft yellow-tan ﬁbrofatty cut surface. Entirely
submitted in cassette 2A.
************************************#****#****#*************************

Source of Tissue: 3. Labeled #3, "fat at diaphragm"

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled "fat at diaphragm“. It consists of three soft
yellow-tan irregular fibrofatty tissue fragments measuring 1.2 x 1 x 0.5 cm in

aggregate. Entirely submitted in cassette 3A.
************************************************************************

Source of Tissue: 4. Labeled #4, "anterior margin"

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled "anterior margin". It consists of a soft yellow-

tan irregular ﬁbrofatty tissue fragment measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. Entirely
submitted in cassette 4A.
************************************************************************

Source of Tissue: 5. Labeled #5, "medial lymph node dissection at apex"

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled “medial lymph node dissection at apex". It
consists of a soft yellow-tan irregular ﬁbrofatty tissue fragnent measuring 3 x 2.5 x 0.5
cm. The specimen is sectioned to show a soft yellow-tan ﬁbrofatty cut

surface with no masses present. No obvious palpable lymph nodes present.

Entirely submitted in cassettes SA-SB.

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled "retroperitoneal lymph nodes". It consists of
two soft yellow-tan irregular ﬁbrofatty tissue fragments measuring 4 x 3 x 0.5 cm in
aggregate. The specimen is sectioned to reveal a homogeneous, soﬂ

yellow-tan ﬁbrofatty cut surface with no palpable lymph nodes present.

Source of Tissue: 7. Labeled #7, "left ureter, stitch marks distal end"

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled "left ureter, stitch marks distal end". It
consists of a soft tan-pink tubular tissue measuring 10.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in
diameter. The outer surface is inked black. The specimen is serially

sectioned to show a smooth tan-pink cut surface with no obvious papillary

Source of Tissue: 8. Labeled #8, "left kidney, stitch marks area of gross

tumor protruding outside of kidney"

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled “left kidney, stitch marks area of gross tumor
protruding outside of kidney". It consists of a kidney with surrounding perinephric fat
weighing a total of 290 grams and measuring 13.5 x 9.5 x 5.5 cm. The

orientation suture is identiﬁed. The attached ureter measures 9.5 cm in

length and 0.5 cm in diameter. The ureter is opened to reveal a smooth

tan-pink mucosal lining with no ulcerations or polyps present. The kidney

is bisected to show a 6.7 x 5.5 x 5 cm ill-deﬁned ﬂeshy papillary tumor

located predominantly at the superior and mid pole aspect of the specimen.

The sutured area and surrounding fat margin closest to tumor are inked

green. The ureteropelvic junction appears unremarkable. The anterior pole

and approximately 60% of the renal pelvis also appears unremarkable. The

tumor comes within less than 0.1 cm of the closest capsule. Tissue

submitted to tumor bank and representative sections are submitted in

Designation of Sections: 8A- urethral and vascular margins, 83- additional
random section of ureter, 8C- ureteropelvic junction, 8D-8E- protruding
section of tumor through outside of kidney, 8F -8H- tumor with closest
surrounding capsule, 81-81- tumor with adjacent uninvolved renal pelvis

Addendum Diagnosis
Because of patient' 5 history of thyroid cancer, at the request of

, the renal lesion was stained with antibodies TTF-l, thyroglobulin
and pan keratin. Positive and negative control slides are satisfactory.
Tumor is positive for keratin and negative for TTF-l and thyroglobulin.
The diagnosis of kidney cancer is unchanged.
