Gross Description:

1. The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "sigmoid and distal rectum
". It consists of a reotosigmoid colon that measures 13.0 cm length and 9 cm
in average diameter. The serosal surface is partially peritonealized. The
radial resection margin is inked black. the distal margin (without staples)
is inked green and the proximal margin {stapled} is inked blue and the
specimen is opened to reveal a tumor that is located 8.0 cm tram the
proximal margin and 1.6 cm ﬁrom the distal margin. The tumor measures 3.4 cm
in length and 3.6 cm in width. Serial sectioning reveals tumor invasion to a
depth of 0.7 cm. which is 1.4 cm from the closest radial margin. The
remaining mucosa shows no gross abnormalities. Pericolio and peri-rectal
adipose tissue is thoroughly examined for lymph nodes, and all possible
nodes are submitted. Entire tumor and representative sections from the rest
of the specimenesentative are submitted. TPS is submitted.

Summary of seotions:

PM - proximal margin
DM _ distal margin

2.) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled “Distal margin“ and
consists of a ring of pink tan soft tissue measuring 1.7 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm.
Multiple sutures and staples are attachedr The mucosal surface is pink tan
and focally hemorrhagic. The sutures and staples are removed and the soft
tissue is entirely submitted.

3.) The specimen is received in formalin. labeled ”troximal margin" and
consists of a silver metal anestomotic pin measuring 7.5 x 2.8 x 1.5 cm. At
the center of the pin, a blue plastic piece is noted. A ring of pink tan
soft tissue is attached measuring 1.9 x 1.6 x 1.6 cm. The mucosal surﬁace
is pink tan and focally hemorrhagic and the aerosol surﬂace is pink tan and
smooth. Several sutures and staples are noted. The sutures and staples are
removed and the soft tissue is entirely submitted. .
