Gross Description The specimens are received in eight containers of formalin, each labelled
with the patient's name. The first is labelled "vulvar biopsy" and contains a single piece

of pinkHtan tissue measuring 0.3 cm in diameter. Wrapped in filter paper. —

The second container is labelled "infra-colonic gastric omentum." It contains a segment

of resected omentum measuring 34.0 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm in greatest dimension, which contains
multiple pink—white tumor nodules, measuring 0.3 to 3.0 cm in diameter. On sectioning, these
nodules appear pink-tan—yellow, solid, and partially inhomogeneous. Some of these nodules

iear to be cystic with small intracystic papillary structures present.—

The third container is labelled "colonic mesenteric lymph nodes." It contains a single

piece of fibroadipose tissue measuring 3.3 x 1.6 x 1.5 cm in reatest dimension, within
which three putative lymph nodes are dissected. —

The fourth container is labelled "left ovary, F31" and contains a collection of pink-tan
tissue fragments measuring 5.6 x 3.5 x 1.7 cm in aggregate. No grossly identifiable

ovarian tissue is present. On section, these tissue fragments appear pinkhtan, solid, and
homogenous. Also present in the specimen container is a white cassette, which contains a
single piece of pink—tan tissue fragment {2.2 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm in greatest dimension) with
similar growth features as those described above. This particular piece of tissue appears to
be the frozen section remnant. Labelled D1 remainder of frozen section tissue —
sections of the left ovarian tissue. _

The fifth container is labelled "right adnexal tumor" and contains a piece of pink—tan
tissue measuring 6.0 x 5.4 x 2.5 cm in greatest dimension, which has smooth external surface
on one side. The specimen appears to have been previously sectioned. Sections of the tissue
show multilocular cystic lesions, 0.7 to 1.3 cm in diameter, which have a smooth internal
surface with yellow-tan clear fluid. In addition, multiple ill—defined nodules (0.7 to 1.2
cm in diameter} are also identified either within the cyst wall or underneath the external
surface. Also present in the container is a small tissue fragment measuring 1.7 x 1.2 x 1.2
cm in greatest dimension, which is pink—tan, solid, and homogenous on sectioning. Labelled
E1HE4, sections of the right adnexal tumor; E5, sections of smaller tissue fragment. -

The sixth container is labelled "colonic nodule" and contains a collection of
irregularly—shaped, pink-tan tissue fragments measuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm in aggregate.
Sections of the tissue show pink—tan, solid, and homogenous out surfaces. Labelled F1—F3.

The seventh container is labelled “uterus, cervix, right ovary." It contains a resected
uterus with attached right ovary and fallopian tube. The entire specimen weighs 80 grams.
The cervix (2.8 x 3.0 x 2.7 cm in greatest dimension) has an overall smooth and hyperemic
ectocervical surface measuring 3.1 x 3.6 cm in area. The ectocervical 03 measures 0.3 cm
in diameter. The endocervical canal measures 1.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter, and
appears grossly unremarkable. The corpus uteri measures 5.0 x 5.5 x 2.8 cm in greatest
dimension and appears symmetric with an overall smooth serosal surface except through

a focal area at the right anterior surface where nodulated adhesions (2.8 x 1.4 cm in
area) are noted. The endometrial cavity measures 3.8 x 2.5 cm in greatest dimension and is
