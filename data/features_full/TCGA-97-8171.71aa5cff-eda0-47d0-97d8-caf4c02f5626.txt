Note (1-3): The foci of tumor are small and have low-grade

cytologic features, so the morphologic differential diagnosis

includes a reactive mesothelial proliferation, especially on the
frozen section slides. However, immunohistochemical stains on
permanent material show that the tumor cells are positive for TTF-l

while negative for calretinin su ortin the diagnosis. This case

ADDENDUM #1 FOR MOLECULAR TESTS:

 
 

   

 

 

KRAS, EGFR and ALK were sent on- or patient.
The test is to be performed on tissue from case

The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited
accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose
signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,
examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 4E appropriate to
the specifications of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9
unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to where the
subject molecular test will be performed. An addendum report will be
issued when the results of this molecular test are available.

ADDENDUM 2:

MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY
KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS

Specimen #: -

RESULTS: Wild type gene.

INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified at codons 12 and 13 of
the KRAS gene.

COMMENT:

Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor
prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
therapies in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS
mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly
associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.

This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of

the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated

for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in
fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. In
particular the test performance has been established in samples of
colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor
these mutations, although several other tissues are also known to
harbor KRAS mutations (e. g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,
appendix, etc.).

Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene amplification status may provide
additional information regarding this patient's probability of
response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if

clinically indicated. See references.

METHOD/LIMITATION:
Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified

and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

ADDENDUM 3:

EGFR Mutation Analysis

Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma

RESULTS: Positive for the E746_A750de15 mutation in Exon 19.

INTERPRETATION: Deletion mutations in exon 19, mostly involving the
LREA motif, are reported to correlate with responsiveness to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small-cell

lung carcinoma.

COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more cellularity is optimal for
this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 70% tumor
cellularity upon pathologist review.

E746_A750de15 corresponds to 2235_2249de115.

Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with
differential responsiveness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among
patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.

This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell

lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change
during tumor progression of the course of therapy; therefore, this
result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation

in another sample or sub-sample obtained from this tumor.

This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.

METHOD:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the samples, quantified
and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or

negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.
