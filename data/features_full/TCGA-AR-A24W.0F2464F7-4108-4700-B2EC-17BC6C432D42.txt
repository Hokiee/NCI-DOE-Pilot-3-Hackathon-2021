.» . Final Diagnosis
'1‘:
Breast, right, total mastectomy: lnﬁltratingfjuctal carcinoma, Nottingham grade II (of III), [tubules 3/3, nuclei 2/3, mitoses 1/3;
Nottingham score 6/9], forming a 2.1 x 1.4 x Til—emirnaﬁssTocated in the central breast (AJCC pT2). Ductal carcinoma in situ,
intermediate nuclear grade, comprising approximately 5-25% of tumor volume. Angiolymphatic invasion is present. The non-
neoplastic breast parenchyma shows proliferative ﬁbrocystic changes. Calciﬁcations present in malignant ducts. Biopsy site
changes present. The tumor does not involve the nipple, overlying skin, or underlying chest wall. All surgical resection margins,

including deep margin, are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 2.1 cm, deep margin).

Lymph nodes, right axillary sentinel Nos. 1A, 18, 1C and 2, sentinel biopsy: Three (of 4) right axillary sentinel lymph nodes ﬂ
positive for metastatic carcinoma (>2.0 mm) [AJCC pN1(Sr\) ]. Extranodal extension is not present. Blue dye is identiﬁed in
lymph nodes Nos. 1A and 113. Lymph node No. 1C does not contain blue dye.

Lymph nodes, right axillary, dissection: Multiple (18) right axillary lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

Breast, left, total mastectomy: Ductal carcinoma 31 shim, micropapillary and cribriform types, low nuclear grade without
intraluminal necrosis, involving an area over 5.7 x 2.3 x 1.4 cm [AJCC pTis]. The non-neoplastic breast parenchyma shows
nonproliferative ﬁbrocystic changes. Calciﬁcations are present in malignant ducts. Biopsy site changes are present. Nipple and
skin are without diagnostic abnormality. All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 1.5
cm, deep margin).
