COMMENT:
1. The anastomotio ring in part 25 Is a portion of esophagus shows vascular Invasion at the esophageal adventitia.
confirmed by dual lmmunostain of AE1-AE31CIDS1 and eiastln stain (VVG). This Is considered as positive proximal margin
In the synoptic report. This ﬁnding was discussed with

2. The circumferential margin can't be accurately evaluated due to lntraoperative pert-esophageal and pert-gastric fat
stripping.
