Regional Lymph Nodes: pNZa
Number examined: 33
Number involved: 4
Distant Metastasis: Not applicable

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen in formalin is right colon with attached terminal ileum and appendix. right
hemicolectomy. The colon measures 25 cm in length by 3 cm in diameter. the small bowel
measures 7.5 cm in length by 2 cm in diameter, and the appendix measures 10 cm in length
by 1 cm in diameter. The closest radial margin is 5 cm. 3.5 cm distal to the ileocecal
valve there is a nearly circumferential ulcerating partially obstructing mass measuring 3
cm in length by 4,5 cm in width. At the distal end of this there is an associated polyp
measuring 1 x 0.8 x 1 cm. The tumor is located 14 cm proximal to the distal margin of
resection. Cut section through the ulcerated mass reveals hard pinkish—tan tissue
infiltrating through the wall into the overlying subserosa. The remainder of the mucosa
throughout the colon and small bowal appears normal, There is one grossly enlarged
subserosal lymph node measuring up to 3 cm in diameter containing hard white tissue with
central necrosis which is soft and pasty. Other lymph nodes vary from small and rubbery to
slightly enlarged. There is one slightly enlarged firm lymph node submitted separate from
the intact specimen. Sections are submitted as follows:

1 - proximal terminal ileum margin of resection

2 — distal colon margin of resection

3 ~ appendix

4—? « mass in colon

8 — grossly enlarged lymph node and separately submitted lymph node
9—l4 - remainder of subserosal lymph nodes

A portion of the colon mass has been processed with tumor tissue banking protocol.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The slides are examined and evaluated.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
Specimen processed for tissue banking per protocol.
