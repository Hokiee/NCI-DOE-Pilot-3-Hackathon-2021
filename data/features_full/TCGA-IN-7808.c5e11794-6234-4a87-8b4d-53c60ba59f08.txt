ESOPHAGEAL AND SMALL BOWEL SEGMENTS. NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.

COMMENT:
Although the carcinoma measures 3.5 cm grassiy It extends from the esophageal proximal margin In the distal margin of

part 7 Iesophagogwtreclomy). which la a length of approxima‘lely 20 cm. An immunahiawmemical stain for Alma is
performed on block a {anastmolic rings). which is nogativa tor carcinoma. All Controls reacted appropriately.
