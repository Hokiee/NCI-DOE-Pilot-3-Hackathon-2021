Gross Description

Received are specimen containers A re R All requisitions and specimen containers are
labelled with the patient's name, The cassettes and are
labelled with the Surgical Number

A. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The
container is designated as "Gallbladder“. The specimen consists of an intact gallbladder
which measures 16.5 x 7.5 x 6.5 cm. The ssrosa is slightly congested but otherwise
unremarkable. The adventitial surface is marked with black dye. A cystic duct lymph
node is not grossly identified. The cystic duct is patent. The lumen contains yellow,
red watery bile and multiple black calculi which range in size from less than 0.1 cm to
1.3 cm in maximum dimension. The calculi are irregular, smooth and multifaceted. The
mucosa is green to yellow~stained and velvety. There is an area of defect on the mucosa
measuring 0.4 cm in maximum dimension, which comes to within 8.2 cm of the cystic duct
margin.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Al w cystic duct margin, neck, body and fundus. The section from the body contains the
mucosal defect.

B. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The
container is designated as "right liver". The specimen consists of a liver lobe which
weighs 770 g and measures 13.0 x 11.7 x 8.6 cm. The cauterized resection margin is
marked with black dye. The capsular surface is dark brown to congested with irregular
tan areas. Multiple palpable firm nodules are identified on the capsular surface and
come to within 2.5 cm of the nearest resection margin. Sectioning through the specimen
reveals an ill—defined can to white to brown, slightly friable mass measuring 11.4 x 10.5
x 8.4 cm. Grossly, this mass extends to the capsular surface. The mass comes grossly to
within 0.4 cm of the nearest resection margin. Groesly, it appears as if the tumor has
invaded to a vessel. The remaining liver parenchyma appears to be dark brown to orange,
mottled and firm. The mass is adjacent to the nodule palpated on the capsular surface.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Bl ~ most unremarkable liver parenchyma.

82 ~ two sections or mass in relation to nearest resection margin.

B3 and B4 . three sections of possible vessel invasion of tumor.

ES — second area of possible vessel invasion, contiguous section bisected.
E36 ~ two sections demonstrating possible capsular invasion.

B"! through BS - three sections of liver which are grossly uninvolved by the mass ('.>
cirrhosis) .

Microscoyic Description

B. Sections of the tumor show a poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.
Immunohistochemistry yielded the following results: Alpha fetoprotein+. CEA(p)-, EMA
canalicular pattern, vimentinw, Hep Path.
