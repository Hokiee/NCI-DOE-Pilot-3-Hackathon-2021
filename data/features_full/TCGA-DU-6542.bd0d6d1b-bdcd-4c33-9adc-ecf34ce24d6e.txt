CLINICAL HZSTORY
Brain tumor.

OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES .

Operation/Specimen: A: Right temporal tumor, excision biopsy
.8: Deep temporal tumor, excision biopsy

C: Posterior temporal tumor, excision biopsy

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:'

A. Brain, right temporal tumor, excision biopsy: Glioblastoma with
oligodendroglial component (WHO Grade IV) (see comment).

B. Brain, deep temporal tumor, excision biopsy: Glioblastoma with
oligodendroglial component {WHO Grade IV).

C. Brain, posterior temporal tumor, excision biopsy: Glioblastoma
with oligodendroglial component {WHO Grade IV).

COMMENT

All specimens show similar features and will be described together.
Sections ’

show a high—grade glioma demonstrating mitotic activity, microvascular
proliferation and geographic necrosis. Many cells have round nuclei
very much

resembling an oligodendroglioma. Other cells are more astrocyte— or
gemistooytic astrocyte—like in appearance. Some cells are intermediate
between

miniﬂgemistocytes and classic gemistocytes. Hermelin slides are also
examined '

and show some mucin pools. The tumor is diffusely p53 positive and the
Ki—67

labeling index is up to approximately 30%. Positive and negative
controls show

appropriate immunoreactivity.

PROCEDURES/ADDENDA
Loss of Heteroz osit lp, 19q Assay (LOH)
Date Orderedﬁ Date Reported: —

 

Interpretation
POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 19q is detected.

No deletion of chromosome arm 1p seen.

Informative loci are: D18548, D181592, Dl8552, DlQSZlQ, and PLA2G4C

Results—Comments

Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block.

DNA extracted from a corresponding blood specimen was used as normal
reference '

control.

H slide was examined and no microdissection was

needed.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA

(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both lp and 19q. The 3
markers ' I I

on lp are D18548, D181592, and D18552 {with D18468, DlSlSlZ, and
D18496 as

backup markers) and the 3 markers on l9q are D193219, D198412, and
PLA2G4C

{with D193606 and DlQSllB2 as backup}. All markers are microsatellites
(2 or 4 . -
nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a miniSatellite (26 nt repeat)
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score,
amplicon size, and ease_of interpretation. The backup markers are used
if the

first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or
otherwise

ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas
with 1p

and 19q deletion.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results

from a

standsalone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its
performance

characteristics determined by the — labOratory as
required by - I —. It has not been cleared or approved
for

specific uses by the 0.8. Food and Drug Administration {FDA}. The FDA
has

determined that such Clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are

provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted
only in

the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.

TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non—neoplastic cells in

the sample
may preclude the detection of allelic loss.

NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected.

Results—Comments .
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block.

H slide was examined and no microdissection was
needed.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT
premoter

have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents.
Assessment of

MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA
followed

by real—time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and
unmethylated DNA _

sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by
serial

dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and
was

assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA.

Factors such as the presence of >50% non—neoplastic cells in the
sample, or

extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated
MGMT

promoter sequences. }

NEGATIVE — No evidence of EGFRviII mutation is detected

Results-Comments

TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from paraffin

tissue
block

The epidermal growth factor receptor {EGFR} is an attractive molecular .

target

in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated
in up

to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant
III

(EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR
that is _

commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of
glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically
distinct .
subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has
been '

shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the
tumor

suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin
fixed,

paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The
cDNA is

then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR
products -

are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this
assay has

been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal
cells.
