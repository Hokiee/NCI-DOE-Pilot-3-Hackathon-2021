FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS

A. Brain, left temporal lobe, biopsy: Anaplastic oligodendroglioma, WHO grade III;
see comment.

B. Brain, left temporal lobe, biopsy: Anaplastic oligodendroglioma, WHO grade III;
see comment.

C. Brain, left temporal lobe, resection: Anaplastic oligodendroglioma, WHO grade III;
see comment.

COMMENT:

Sections demonstrate an extensively infiltrating oligodendroglloma involving adjacent cortex (best
demonstrated on section Bl). Mitotic ﬁgures are identified (5 MF/10 HPF). Scattered foci of
microvascular proliferation are present,supporting the diagnosis of anaplastlc oligodendroglioma.
Immunohistochemistry for MIB-l will be performed and evaluated on blocks A2 and BI, and the findings
will be reported in an addendum. In addition, level sections on block Bl as well as

immunohistochemistry for p53 and IDH—I {R132H mutant form) on block A2 will be performed, and the
results will be reported in an addendum to follow.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for 1p19q will be performed at the
on block A2, and the findings will be reported in a separate report.

The immunoperoxidase stain(s) reported above Were developed and their performance characteristics
determined by the They have not been cleared or
approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or
approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as
investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments of 1988 ("CLIA") as qualified to perform high-complexity clinical testing.

Intraoperativo Diagnosis

F81 (A) Brain, left temporal lobe, biopsy: Anaplastlc oligodendroglloma, WHO grade III. Tissue section
and cytologic preparation.

Gross Description '
The specimen is received fresh in three parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record
number.

Part A, additionally labeled "tumor,“ consists of multiple soft irregular pieces of off-white/red tissue (1.1
x 1 x 0.2 cm in aggregate). A portion of the specimen is submitted frozen for frozen section diagnosis 1
and cytologic preparation, and the frozen section remnant is entirely submitted in cassette A1. The
remaining unfrozen tissue is entirely submitted in cassette A2.

Part B, additionally labeled “permanent = brain tumor,“ consists of two unoriented, ovoid fragments of
pink to deep-red, glistening soft tissue (0.8 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm and 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm). The specimen is
entirely submitted in cassette Bl.

Part C, additionally labeled "CUSA trap ~ permanent," consists of multiple irregular, friable pale tan to
pink-red, glistening soft tissue fragments (4 x 2.5 x 0.8 cm in aggregate). The specimen is entirely
submitted in cassettes C1-C6. ‘

Clinical History

The patient is a -year-old male who presented with seizures and was found on MRI brain scan to have
a left temporal lobe lesion with central enhancement and increased cerebral blood volume, most
compatible with a malignant glioma. The patient undergoes resection.

Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. Final diagnosis made by attending pathologist following review of all
pathology slides. The attending pathologist has reviewed all dictations and preliminary interpretations performed by any resident
involved in the case and performed all necessary edits before signing the ﬁnal report.

Addendum Comment

The tumor cells are strongly positive for IDH1 (R132H mutant form) and negative for PS3. The
proliferative index assessed by M181 is estimated at 5%.
