By this signature, I attest that the above diagnosis is based upon my

is smooth, but there is a solid area with exophytic, tan, polypoid tumor. Attached to the
external surface of the mass is soft tissue measuring 3.0 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm, but out surfaces
do not show any identifiable fallopian tube. Also present in the container is a cassette
labeled "F82" that holds a piece of tumor measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm. Labeled Bl — F82
remnant; BZ and B3 — tumor present on inked ovarian surface; 34 to B5 - tumor; B6 - necrotic
tumor; B7 » tumor nodule within c st; B8 to B9 — attached soft tissue (possible fallopian
tube). B10~B14= additional tumoui

The third container is labeled "#3, right adnexa" and contains a single piece of tan,
friable, partially necrotic tumor measuring 8.5 x 7.3 x 4.0 cm. One surface is smooth and
white, suggesting the possibility that someone opened the specimen prior to receipt in
pathology. A portion of fallopian tube measuring 2.6 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter
includes fimbria and is adhesed to the outer surface of the mass. Although adhesed to the
mass, the fallopian tube is mobile and does not appear to be involved b the tumor. Labeled
C1 to C4 — tumor: C5 — fallopian tube. (36—810 : additional tumor. i

The fourth container is labeled "#4, omentum" and contains two pieces of lymphoid tissue
together measuring 16 x 14 x 2 cm. Approximately one—fourth of the tissue is involved by
a firm white tumor, the largest single implant measuring 9.5 cm in maximum dimension. The
specimen is sectioned at 0.3-0.4 cm intervals and every tumor nodule is sampled at least
once. All the tumor implants have a similar gross appearance. Labeled D1 to 013. _
