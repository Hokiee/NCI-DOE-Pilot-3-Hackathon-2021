Comment

The grossly visible cervical squamous cell carcinoma, which measures 3.0 x
2.5 x 1.2 cm, is microscopically located 1.5 mm from the nearest inked
sarosa. The tumor extends to a maximum depth of 12 mm in a 13.5 mm thick
section of cervix (section 813). The invasive carcinoma is grossly located
2.0 cm from the nearest vaginal cuff margin.

Pertinent Clinical Information
~year—old female with cervical cancer

Clinical Impression: SCCA

Gross Description
Specimen Material: A. Left parametrium, B. Radical hysterectomy, bilateral
tubes and ovaries, C. Left pelvic lymph node, D. Right pelvic lymph node

The case is received in four parts, each labeled with the patient's name
, medical record number and given accession number
and it is accompanied by a requisition form labeled with the same
name and accession number.

Part A. Received in formalin labeled "LEFT PARAMETRIUM" is an irregular
portion of fibrofatty tissue measuring 2.7 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm with an attached
suture. Within the fibrofatty tissue, an elongated gray~white vessel is
identified measuring 2.0 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter. There are no
discrete masses seen within the lumen. The specimen is submitted in its
entirety in cassettes A1—A3 with the vascular tissue adjacent to the suture
inked black to facilitate the embedding process in A1.

Part B. Received in formalin labeled "RADICAL HYSTERECTOMY BILATERAL TUBES
AND OVARIES", is a 148 gram, 9 cm from superior to inferior x 7 cm from
cornu to cornu x 2.8 cm from anterior to posterior uterus with bilateral
attached adnexa and attached cervix measuring 3.0 cm x 3.5 cm with a 0.7 cm
slit-like external os. The anterior surface is inked blue and posterior
surface is inked black. The serosa is tan-pink and hyperemic. The vaginal
cuff is present measuring 4 x 1.2 cm x 0.2 cm. The parametrial tissue is
present measuring 2 x 1 x 0.2 cm (right) and 1.5 x 1 x 0.5 cm (left). The
endometrium measures 0.2 cm thick; no focal lesions are seen. The
endometrial cavity measures 3 x 0.3 cm. There is a 1.5 x 1.2 cm gray—white
circumscribed submucosal nodule; the cut surface displays whorled, firm,
homogeneous tissue. The myometrium measures 1.5 cm thick.

The cervix displays a tan~yellow centrally ulcerative mass (3.0 x 2.5 x 1

cm) located on the posterior and anterior surface of the endocervix. The
mass appears to invade to a depth of 1.2 cm but is grossly 0.4 cm from the

Page 2 of 5

 

 

outer surface. The mass extends into the lower uterine segment. The mass
is located approximately 1.0 cm from the lower uterine segment and 2.0 cm
from vaginal cuff margin.

The right adnexa include a 4 x 2 x 1.5 cm ovary. The surface is tan—yellow,
smooth, hyperemic and glistening. There is a 1.5 x 1 x 0.6 cm smooth
unilocular cyst with serosanguineous fluid. The cut surface displays
tan-white to tan-yellow soft homogeneous tissue. There is a 4 cm in length
x 0.6 cm in diameter fimbriated right fallopian tube. The surface of the
fallopian tube is tan-pink, smooth and hyperemic. The cut surface displays
a pinpoint lumen.

The left adnexa include a 2 x 1.5 x 0.5 ovary with 4 cm in length, 0.6 cm in
diameter fimbriated fallopian tube. The surface of the ovary is tan-yellow,
smooth, and glistening; no lesion or excrescence is seen. The cut surface
displays tan-white to tan—yellow unremarkable tissue. The left fallopian
tube across is tan-pink, smooth and hyperemic. The cut surface displays a
pinpoint lumen.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Bl—B4 vaginal cuff margin in its entirety; clock designation: 12—3, 3-6,
6-9, 9-13

BS right, parametrium tissue, en face

BG left parametrial tissue, en face

B7—Blo anterior longitudinal section from fundus to cervix, sequentially
from superior to inferior

Ell—314 posterior longitudinal section, sequentially from superior to
inferior

B15 cervical, greatest depth of tumor invasion

B16 tumor to exocervix

Bl7 myometrial nodule

B18 right ovary

519 right ovarian cyst

320 right fallopian tube

321~ left ovary

822 left fallopian tube

Part C. Received in formalin labeled "LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE“ is an
irregular portion of fibrofatty tissue measuring 6.5 x 0.8 cm. Within the
fibrofatty tissue, multiple lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.3 to'2
cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as
follows: C1 four possible whole nodes

02 two whole possible nodes

C3 two whole possible nodes

Part D. Received in formalin labeled "RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH MODE" is an
irregular portion of fibrofatty tissue measuring 6.7 x 5.5 x 1.5 cm. Within
the fibrofatty tissue, multiple possible lymph nodes are identified ranging
from 0.4 to 2.2 cm in greatest dimension. The cut surface of the larger
nodes displays fatty firm lymphoid tissue. The lymph nodes are submitted in
their entirety as follows:

D1 five possible whole nodes

D2 three whole possible nodes

D3~D4 one serially sectioned possible node

D5 one bisected possible node

Microscopic Description
A, C, D: Performed.

B. HaE stained sections show cervical invasive squamous cell carcinoma

with lymphatic invasion. The endometrium shows a proliferative pattern with
an occasional mildly dilated gland lumen; no atypia, hyperplasia or
carcinoma is seen. The myometrium shows a leiomyoma without increased
mitotic activity. atypia, increased cellularity or tumor necrosis found.
Other than a benign right ovarian cyst, the fallopian tubes and ovaries are
unremarkable. '
