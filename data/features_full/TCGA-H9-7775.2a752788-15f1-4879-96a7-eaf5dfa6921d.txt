Gross Description:

The specimen is received fresh for tissue procurement, labeled with the
patient's name and additionally labeled "prostate" and consists

of a 49 gram, 4.3 cm in length by 5 x 5 cm prostate gland with attached
bilateral seminal vesicles. The specimen is received previously inked as
follows: Right side yellow, left side black, posterior red.

The distal margin of resection is coned and submitted in cassette 1. The
proximal margin is coned and submitted in cassette 2.

The remaining prostate gland is sectioned from apex to base. The cut surface is
pink-tan with diffuse nodularity surrounding the prostatic urethra. Sectioning

through the seminal vesicles and segments of vas deferens reveals a pink-tan,
unremarkable cut surface.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

1 apex, completely submitted;

2 bladder base, completely submitted;

3-14 right posterior prostate gland, apex to base, completely
submitted;

15-25 left posterior prostate gland, apex to base, completely
submitted;

26 right anterior, cross section 2;

27 left anterior, cross section 3;

28 right anterior, cross section 4;

29 left anterior, cross section 5;

30 right seminal vesicle-prostate interface;

31 -32 additional right seminal vesicle;

33 left seminal vesicle-prostate interface;

34-35 additional left seminal vesicle.

Microscopic Description:
The final diagnosis of each specimen incorporates the microscopic examination
findings.
