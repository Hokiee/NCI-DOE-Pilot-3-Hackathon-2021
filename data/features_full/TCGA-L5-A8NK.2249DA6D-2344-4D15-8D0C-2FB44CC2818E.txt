OPER DATE: REQ DOC:

VERIFIED BY:

-year- -old with two month history of mid retrosternal dysphagia (+) 20 pd at.
loss over past month. Clinical Diagnosis: Esophageal cancer. Operative
Procedure: THE. 1) Cervical esophagus. 2) Cervical esophageal margin. 3) Mid
right parsesophageal LN. 4) Left gastric LN, celiac angle.

VERIFIED BY:

1. ”Cervical esophagus” Received in formalin in a large container is a 12.2 cm
segment of previously opened esophagus with a tsn~brown unremarkable
adventitial surface. Upon opening the mucosa surface is white-tan, smooth and
glistening with the exception of a 3 x 2 cm ulcerating lesion (C's depth: .1
cm) that involves approximately 50% of the circumference. The lesion is 2.5 cm
away from the stapled margin. Specimen inked blue and sectioned. Grossly tha
adventitial surface under the lesion is firm and indurated and it appears that
the tumor mass involves the whole circumference of the esophagus underneath
the moose. The tumor extends into the adventitia.

1A. Margin closest to tumor.

18. Hargin furthest away from tumor.

1c-r. One linear section of esophagus from margin nearest tuner to distal
margin.

16. Possible lymph nodes.

2. ”Cervical esophageal margin” Received in formalin in a small container is a
1 cm segment of esophagus with staples at one end. Hucosal and aerosol surface
are grossly unremarkable.

3. ”Left gastric lymph node taken from celisc origin” Received in formalin in
a small container is a yellow-tan 0.6 cm diameter soft tissue mass. aisected.

6. ”Mid-right paraesophageal lymph node” Received in formalin in a small
container is a broun-tan 0.5 cm soft tissue bit.

PATIENT NBR: SEN: F
ADM DATE:
OPER DATE: REG DOC:

Type of carcinoma: Squamous cell carcinoma

Depth of invasion: Periesophageal soft tissue..
)1qu of positive l'yntoh nodes: 0/14

Extranodal metastasis: Unknown.

Pattern of invasion: infiltrative.

Esophageal and gastric resection margins involved: No
Deep resection margin involved: Yes.

TNM classification: T3 N0 Mx

VERIFIED BY:
1 a. 2. Esophagus, transhiatal esophageotomy: Invasive well differentiated
squamous cell cell carcinoma. The tumor traverses the muscularis propria and
extends into the periesophageal soft tissue. The tumor is present at the inked
periesophageal soft tissue margin. The proximal and distal surgical margins
are negative. Six pariesophageal lyimh nodes are negative for neoplasm. See
template.

3. Left gastric lymh nodes, excision: Six lynph nodes negative for
malignancy.

4. Mid right periesophageal lymph node, excision: one lymph node negative for
neoplasm.
