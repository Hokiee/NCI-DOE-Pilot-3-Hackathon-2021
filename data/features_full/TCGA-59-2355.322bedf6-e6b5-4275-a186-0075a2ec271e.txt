GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. RIGHT ADNEXA

Received fresh for frozen section is a cystic ovarian mass measuring 11 x 1 l x 4 cm. The surface
of the specimen shows a inultinoduiar mass measuring 5 x 4 X 4 cm. The remainder of the
surface is tan-pink and smooth. The specimen is sectioned to Show a multiloculated cyst ﬁlled
with tan~yellow serous ﬂuid. Sectioning through the multinodular tumor on top of the specimen
shows a yellow, ﬂeshy cut surface. The lining of the cyst is covered with papillary projections
ranging from 0.1 em up to 1 cm in length. The largest papillary projection is in the area
corresponding to the multinodular tumor seen on the surface of the specimen. The attached

fallopian tube is 6 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter and is grossly unremarkable.
Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as follows:

FSAl -FSA2: sections of the cyst and multinodular area for frozen section

A3 A4. sections of the thin area of the cyst wall

A5- A12: sections or the intracystic and surface nodular area

A13: sections of faIIOpian tube
B. LEFT OVARY
Received ﬁxed 1n a container labeled with matching patient information and specimen
identiﬁcation is an ovarian mass with attached fallopian tube. The ovarian mass measures
overall 4 X 3 x 2.5 cm. The surface of the ovary shows multiple multinodular tumors ranging
from 0.9 to 2 cm in greatest dimension. T he fimbrial end of the fallopian tube shows similar
tumor nodule measuring 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The remainder of the fallopian tube measures 5 cm in
length and 0.5 cm in diameter and is grossly unremarkable. Sectioning through the ovary shows
tan~yellow, fleshy cut surface without obvious parenchymal nodules. Representative sections of
the specimen are submitted as follows:

Bl—B3: sections of ovary with attached surface tumor

B4: sections of fallopian tube and attached tumor
C. UTERUS AND CBRVIX
Received ﬁxed in a container labeled with matching patient information and specimen
identiﬁcation is a hysterectomy specimen consisting of uterus with attached cervix. The
specimen weighs 138 grams. The uterus measures 8.5 x 7.5 x 4.5 cm. The external
conﬁguration of the uterus is slightly distorted by subserosal nodule located at the superior
posterior aspect of the tumor. The peritoneal reflection at the anterior lower aspect of the tumor
shows inﬁltration with tumor. The area infiltrated with tumor measures 5.5 x 2.5 x 1 cm. The
exocervix is 3 x 2.5 cm and is covered by tan-pink unremarkable mucosa. The specimen is
opened bilaterally and shows possible endometrial polypoid lesion. The largest is located at the
fundus and measures 3.5 x 3 x 1.5 cm. The second polyp is seen at the endocervical canal,
however, it is connected with a long stalk to the fundus. This polyp measures 6 cm from the base
of the (at the fundus) to the tip and 1.5 x 1.5 at the tip. The third polyp is located at the anterior
wall and measures 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. Sectioning throughout the myometrium shows that the
three polyps are conﬁned to the endometrium without evidence of myometrial invasion. The
myometrium also shows multiple subserosal and intramural tan-white nodules ranging between
0.5 and 1.3 cm in greatest dimension. The myornetrium measures 2.5 cm at the anterior wall and
2 cm at the posterior wall. Sectioning through the reflection of the peritoneum where a tumor is
seen shows no invasion into the myometrium. This tumor has tan—yellow, glistening cut surface.
Representative sections of the specimen are submitted in thirteen cassettes as follows:

Cl -C2: sections from the tip of the ﬁrst (fundic) polyp

C3-C4: section of base of the ﬁrst polyp with full thickness myometrium

CS: sections of tip of second polyp (long pedunculated polyp)

C6: sections of the base of second polyp with full thickness endometrium and

myometrium

C7: sections of the thi1d polyp at anterior wall

C8-C9: sections of tumor at anterior peritoneal reﬂection

D. ABDOMINAL TUMOR
Received ﬁxed in a container labeled with matching patient information and specimen
identiﬁcation are two nodular pieces of tan soft tissue measuring 0.8 and 1.4 cm in greatest
dimension. Each piece is bisected and submitted in toto in a separate cassette.
E. OMENTUM
Received are multiple fragments of tan-yellow focally hemorrhagic ﬁrm and nodular soft tissue
ranging from 1 to 19 cm and measuring I9 x 8 x 2 cm in aggregate. Sectioning shows tan—white
to yellow focally necrotic cut surface. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted in
two cassettes (multiple sections per each cassette).
Note: Tissue procurement was performed on part A. Gross photographs are taken for parts A

and C.

synchronous primary.
