CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neo corpus uteri.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Uterus and cervix (AF1)", received fresh for frozen section diagnosis is a
68 gm, 8 x 5.5 x 3 cm hysterectomy specimen with attached cervix (3 cm in
length x 3 cm in diameter) with a patent es of 0.6 cm. The serosal surface is
pink—tan and grossly unremarkable. The paracervical soft tissue is inked
entirely in blue and the specimen is opened laterally on each side. The
.cervical canal (2.5 cm length x 2.4 cm wide) is tan-pink, has a herringbone
'pattern. The endometrial canal (4.5 cm in length x 3 cm from cornu to cornu)
demonstrates a large, contiguous, fungating mass on the posterior portion
(beginning 1.5 cm superior to the lower uterine segment and continuing to the
anterior endometrium approximately 2.6 cm from the lower uterine segment. Both
lower uterine segments are grossly uninvolved. Serial sectioning of the
endometrium demonstrates a focally 1 cm thick endometrium overlying a 1.1 cm
thick myometrium. The area of deepest invasion is located on the posterior
surface and appears to grossly invade 0.8 cm into a 1.7 cm myometrium. The
deepest invasion on the anterior endometrium is 0.3 cm into a 1.7 cm
myometrium.

B. "Hernia sac", received fresh and placed in formalin is
a 9.5 x 9 x 3.2 cm aggregate of fibroadipose tissue. The specimen is
sectioned revealing benign fibroadipose tissue. Representative sections in
81-83.

C. "Right tube and ovary", received fresh and placed in formalin ;

is an 8 gm, 6 x 3.1 x 1.8 cm tube and ovary specimen. The fallopian
tube (7.5 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter) is upon sectioning tan—white and
grossly unremarkable. The fimbriae is also grossly unremarkable. The right
ovary (2.5 x 1.6 x 0.9 cm) is white-tan, cerebriform and upon sectioning
demonstrates a 1 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm corpus albicans.

D. "Left tube and ovary", received fresh and placed in formalin

s an 11 gm, 6.8 x 3 x 2 cm tube and ovary. The fallopian tube (7.6
cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter) appears on sectioning grossly unremarkable
the attached fimbriae is grossly unremarkable. The left ovary (3 x 1.2 x 0.8
cm) is white—tan cerebriform and upon sectioning is grossly unremarkable.

E. "Left pelvic lymph node", received fresh and placed in formalin

is a 5 x 2.3 x 1.8 cm aggregate of fibroadipose tissue which is
dissected for lymph nodes. Six lymph node candidates are identified.
Submitted as follows:

El— one lymph node candidate (mostly fat)
E2— two lymph node candidates
E3— two lymph node candidates
E4— one lymph node candidate

F. "Left common", received fresh and placed in formalin
is a 1 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm fragment of soft brown tissue which is submitted in its
entirety in F1.

G. "Aortic", received is a 2.8 x 2 x 0.6 cm aggregate of fibroadipose tissue
which is dissected for lymph nodes. One lymph node candidate measuring 2.6 cm
in length x 0.4 cm is bisected and submitted in its entirety in G1 and G2.

H. "Right pelvic node", received fresh and placed in formalin
_ is a 5.5 x 4.5 x 0.8 cm aggregate of fibroadipose tissue which is
dissected for lymph nodes. The largest lymph node is 2 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm.

I. "Right aortic lymph node", received fresh and placed in formalin

. is a 3.5 x 3.2 x 0.8 cm aggregate of fibroadipose tissue which is
dissected for lymph nodes. Two lymph nodes are found ranging from 1.3 cm in
greatest dimension to 0.5 cm.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
A. “Uterus and cervix": AFl (rep) 0.8 cm into a 1.7 cm myometrium,
endometrioid adenocarcinoma FIGO grade 2.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed. Depth of invasion is best seen on the
frozen section slide (AFl), as the tissue did not survive processing intact.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: Total hysterectomy

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 7th Edition): pTla pNO pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution‘s Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

DIAGNOSIS:
