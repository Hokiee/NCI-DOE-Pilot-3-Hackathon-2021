HORMONE RECEPTOR STATUS .
Laboratory:

Estrogen Receptor: Negative .
Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0

Progesterone Receptor: Negative

Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0

The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the proportion score (0
= no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of cells staining, 4 = 31 -60% of
cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate
intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring range from 0 to 8.

ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score of less than or
equal to 2.

Comment: This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for hormone therapy (1).

ER and PR analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the ER (ER 105. 1:100) and PR
(PGR 136, 1:100) antibody provided by , following the manufacturer’s instructions listed in the package insert.
This assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of
the ER/PR immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (1),
information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within Pathology
Department.

METHODOLOGY
Methodology: Fixation Type and Length: TIssue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin

‘ for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Antibody and Assay Methodology: Rabbit anti-human HER2,
HerceptestTM (FDA-approved test kit), (. A). Control Slides Examined: External kit—slides
provided by manufacturer (cell lines with hIgn, low and negative HER2 protein expression), and in-house known
HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. These control slides run along side of this
patient's sample showed appropriate staining. Adequacy of Specimen: Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive
carcinoma identified for HER2 evaluation.
Scoring Criterion and Scoring System:
IHC Level of Expression(Score) /Tumor Cell Membrane Staining Pattern
Negative (0)/Absence of Staining
Negative (1+)/Faint Incomplete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells
Equivocal (2+)/Weak complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells
Positive (3+)/Strong complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells
Equivocal Category for HER2 IHC results: A HER2, 2+ staining result that is interpreted as equivocal may not
indicate gene amplification. A FISH test for HER2 gene amplification will be ordered for all HER2 IHC 2+ results.
COMMENT
This assay can be used to select invasive breast cancer patients for Trastuzumab (Hereptin) therapy (1,2). Clinical
Trials have shown that Trastuzumab substantially increases the likelihood for an objective response and overall
survival for patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of whether HER2 tumor status was
determined as IHC 3+ or FISH positive. Trastuzumab added to adjuvant chemotherapy substantially increase
disease-free survival and decreases the risk of disease recurrence by about 50% for patients with early-stage HER2
protein over-expressed or gene amplified invasive breast cancer (3).
HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved Dako HercepTest
(TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This assay was not modified, and
adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical
staining characteristics is guided by published results in the medical literature (4), information provided by the
reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance within the Pathology Department.
HER2 TEST VALIDATION
This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised recommendations and
guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the jointly issued recommendations and
guidelines from A860 and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC
as outline above and interpreted as, negative (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without
knowledge of the previous reported results.

These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and the

HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance between the IHC

and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were
interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 319 (33%) were non-amplified by FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be
am lified.

‘IPhe Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests performance
and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of HER2 assays. The
laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including the CAP proficiency testing
program.
