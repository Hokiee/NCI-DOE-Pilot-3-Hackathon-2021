GROSS? DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT INGUINAL SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1, NOT BLUE, COUNT 112 - A 2.4 x 1.3 x.0.7 cm lymph node.

SECTION CODE: A1, A2, one possible lymph node serially sectioned. The entire specimen is submitted.
(B) LEFT INGUINAL SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2, NOT BLUE, COUNT 73 - A 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm lymph node.

SECTION CODE: B1, one possible lymph node serially sectioned. The entire specimen is submitted.

(C) 2 CM MARGIN MELANOMA, LEFT PARAMEDIAN BACK, SHORT — SUPERIOR, LONG - LEFT LATERAL - A tan skin ellipse
measuring 14.2 x 5.0 x 5.0 cm. The specimen is inked in its central portion but it also shows a 1.0 cm circular area that appears to
be a 0.6 cm circular, elevated, healed scar. This central area is located at 6.5 cm from the superior (12 o'clock tip), at 1.7 cm from

the 3 o‘clock edge, 6.2 cm from the 6 o'clock tip and 1.8 cm from the 9 o'clock edge.

INK CODE: Blue - from 12-3-6 o'clock; orange- from 6-9-12 o'clock.

SECTION CODE: C1, 12 o'clock tip, ink side up; C2, 6 o'clock tip, ink side up; C3, 3 o'clock edge, ink side up; C4, 9
o'clock edge, ink side up; C5, deep margin related to the area of interest; 06—013, area of interest from 12-6 o'clock. .'

(D) LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS, LEVEL 1, 2, 3 NODES - One pale-gray fibroadipose tissue (12.5 x 9.0 x 6.0 cm) with a pale—
gray mass (4.0 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm) with a pale-gray cut surface with focal hemorrhage and possible central necrosis. Multiple lymph
nodes are identified ranging from 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm to 4.0 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted. The mass
area is representatively submitted.

SECTION CODE: D1, mass with the hemorrhage; DZ, mass with possible central necrosis; 03-05, representative
sections of other areas of the mass; D6-D8, each containing four possible lymph nodes; D9—D12, each containing two possible
lymph nodes; D13, one possible lymph node serially sectioned; D14. D15, one possible lymph node serially sectioned; D16, D17,
one lymph node serially sectioned; D18-D21, entirely submitted of the largest lymph node.

(E) ADDITIONAL LEVEL 3 NODES - Two pale-gray fibroadipose tissue (5.0 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm in aggregate) with multiple possible
lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm to 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted.

SECTION CODE: E1, E2, each containing four possible lymph nodes; E3—E6, each containing two possible lymph nodes;
E7, E8, each containing one possible lymph node serially sectioned; E9, E10, one possible lymph node serially sectioned.

CLINICAL HISTORY.

None given.

ADDENDUM

This modified report is being issued to provide additional information/results.

GROSSDEscRIanON

(D) LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS, LEVEL I, II, III NODE - The largest mass is entirely submitted.
SECTION CODE: D22-D33, entirely submitted of the remainder of the largest mass.

COMMENT

(A, B) Examination of additional tissue levels and an immunohistochemical study on paraffin sections with an anti-melanocytic
cocktail (HMB45, anti-MARTl and anti-tyrosinase) fails to reveal metastatic melanoma.

(D) Additional sections of the lymph node involved by melanoma were examined and no definite extracapsular extension is
identified in the cross-sections examined. Tumor necrosis is seen.
