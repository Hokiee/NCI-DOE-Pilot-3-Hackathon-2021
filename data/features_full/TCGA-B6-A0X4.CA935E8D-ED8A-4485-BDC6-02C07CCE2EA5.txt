CLINICAL HISTORY:
Breast cancer, tumor was 3 x 2.5 x 2 cm.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A sutured 10.5 cm linear incision is present over the lower inner quadrant.
The margins are inked in blue. Sectioning reveals a 3 x 2 x 2 cm biopsy cavity
in the lower inner quadrant, 3 cm from the inferior margin, 2 cm from the
medial margin, 4.5 cm from the deep margin, 8 cm from the superior margin, and
more than 15 cm from the lateral margin. The biopsy cavity extends to within
1 cm of the skin incision. Adjacent to the deep edge of the biopsy cavity is
a 3 x 2 x 1 cm irregular mass of firm, tan—white tissue. The mass lies
approximately 3.5 cm from the deep surgical margin, 2 cm from the medial
margin, 3 cm from the inferior margin, 7.5 cm from the superior margin, and
greater than 15 cm from the lateral margin. In the upper inner quadrant,

3.5 cm from the biopsy cavity, is a 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm well circumscribed
nodule of firm, pale pink—tan tissue. The nodule lies nearest the deep margin,
extending to within 2 cm of this margin. In the lower outer quadrant are two
similar well—circumscribed nodules of pale pink-tan tissue: a 1.1 x 0.6 x 0.5
cm nodule and, 1.5 cm lateral to this, a 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm nodule. The 1.1 x
0.6 x 0.5 cm nodule lies 5 cm from the lateral surgical margin and 4 cm from
the inferior surgical margin. The 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm nodule is 3.5 cm from the
lateral surgical margin and 4 cm from the inferior surgical margin. Further
lateral and inferior within the lower outer quadrant is a small, 0.4 x 0.3 x
0.2 cm, oblong mass of firm tan tissue, lying 2 cm from the deep and the
lateral surgical margins. In the upper outer quadrant there are small areas
of fibrosis, some associated with small cysts (up to 0.3 cm in diameter).
Within the axillary tail, thirty—two lymph node candidates, 0.5 to 2.2 cm in
greatest dimension, are identified: 8 within the proximal third (zone III), 6
within the middle third (zone II), and 18 lymph nodes in the distal third
(zone I).

 

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Al— six lymph node candidates from zone III, 0.5 to 1.1 cm in greatest

dimension.

AZ— two bisected lymph node candidates, 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm and 1 x 0.6 x 0.5

cm, from zone III.

A4-A5- one bisected lymph node candidate, 2.2 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm, from zone II

A6— four lymph node candidates, 0.8 to 1.2 cm, from zone I.

A7— six lymph node candidates, 0.5 to 1.1 cm, from zone I.

AB- six lymph node candidates, 0.8 to 1 cm, from zone I.

A9— two bisected lymph node candidates, 1.3 x 1 x 0.4 cm and 1.6 x 1.3 x 0.5

cm, from zone I.

A22- section extending to the inferior surgical margin near the biopsy
cavity.

A23- sections extending to the superior surgical margin nearest biopsy cavity.

   

A24— sections extending to the umdial surgical margin nearest the biopsy

AZS— inner upper quadrant.
