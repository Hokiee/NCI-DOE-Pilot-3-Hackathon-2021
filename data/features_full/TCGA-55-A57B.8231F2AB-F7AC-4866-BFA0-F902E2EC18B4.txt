Grbss Description:
A. The specimen is labeled Mill and is received in formalin. i nsists of a 0.3 cm fragment of dark
anthracotic tissue which is submitted intact in cassette M.

B. The specimen is labeled, N101. #2 and is received in formalin. it consists of a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm
fragment of redoyellow to gray~brown, focally cauterized tissue. it is submitted intact in cassette 31. I

C. The specimen is labeled left upper lobe and is received without fixative. it consists of an 18.8 x 9.5 x 3
cm lobe of lung which weighs 101 grams. The pleural surface is predominantly pinkdan to pale red but in
the central medial portion of the lung, there is retraction and irregularity of the pleural surface with an
ediacent 4 cm area of violaceous discoloration of the pulmonary perenchyma. The retracted pleural
surface is inked green. There is a single bieb at the medial apical surface of the lung. At the hilum staple
lines are present, both superiorly, inferioriy. and across the buibar bronchus. The lobar bronchus is
removed as a thin shave and is submitted for frozen section as CFS. There are scattered small and slightly
larger peribronchlal nodes which are up to 0.6 cm maximally. Serial sections of the retracted central
medial pleural surface reveal an underlying pale yellow, lirm neoplasm which measures 3 x 2.3 x 1.8 cm.
it abuts the pleural surface of the medial lung and is 0.4 cm from the closest bronchial resection margin. it
is 2 cm from the closest interlobar staple line at the inferior hilum. it appears to grossly erode into an
adiecent segmental bronchus. Sections of the remainder of the lung reveal slight consolidation adjacent
to the tumor but otherwise well—aerated pulmonary parenchyma. Representative sections are submitted.

D. The specimen is labeled N10L #3 and is received in formalin it consists of a 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm
fragment of mottled, gray-tan to red-brown tissue which is focally calcified. it is serialty sectioned and
submitted in cassette [)1 for decalciﬁcation.

E. The specimen is labeled N6 and is received in f alin. it consists of three 0.4-0.8 cm strips of dark red
tissue which are submitted intact in cassette E1 .

F. The specimen is labeled N7 and is received in formalin. it consists of a 0.8 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm strip of pale
red to anthracctic tissue which is Submitted intact in cassette Ft.

fragment of pink-tan to anthracotic tissue which is submitted intact in cassette G1. -

H. The specimen is labeled NQL and is received ' rmaiin. it consists of a 0.2 cm fragment of anthracotic
tissue which is submitted intact in cassette H1.

1, The specimen. is labeled N1 1L and is received in formalin. it consists of two strips of dull red to
anthracotic tissue which vary from 0.8—1 cm in length and are up to 0.3 cm in diameter. The specimen is
submitted intact in cassette l1 1

Microscopic Description:
A. Sections demonstrate one lymph node, negative for metastasis.

8. Sections demonstrate one lymph node, negative for metastasis.

(3. Sections demonstrate lung tissue, containing inﬁltrating neoplasm, composed predominantly of
angulated glands, lined by cuboidal epithelial cells, with Sarge hyperchromatic nuclei, markedly
oieomorphism and prominent nucleoli. in other areas of the tumor, the neoplastic cells are in solid nests
or single cells. Ten peribronchial iymph nodes, negative for tumor are identiﬁed. Elastic stain, performed
on block C4, with adequate control. confirms the absence of visceral pleural invasion.

D. Sections demonstrate lymphoid tissue, containing a central hyaiinized and calcified nodule. Metastatic
carcinoma is not identiﬁed.

E Sections demonstrate fibrcvascular tissue and adipose tissue and blood. No lymphoid tissue is

identified.
