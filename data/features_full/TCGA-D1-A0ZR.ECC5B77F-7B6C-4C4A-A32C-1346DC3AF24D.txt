endometrialﬂadenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, forming a
3.4 x'2‘.7 x "‘ ”"

1.6 cm polypoid mass in the posterior and right lateral

involved. Cervix

shows no diagnostic abnormalities. Ovaries and fallopian
tubes show

no diagnostic abnormalities.

identified.

Gross examination only.

a solid

cut surface with a 7.2 x 0.7 cm right fallopian tube.
