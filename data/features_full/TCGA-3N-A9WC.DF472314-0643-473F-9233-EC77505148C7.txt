GR088 DESCRIPTION:

"'ELECTRONICALLY SIGNED OUT'"

 

Left axillary node level 1,2 + 3 'stitch marks level 2: The Specimen Is received fresh labeled
left axlllary node level 1. 2. and 3". and consists at an oriented fragment or flbrofatty tissue measuring 15 x 12 x 4 cm.
Near one end is an attached suture designating level 2. Levels 1 and 3 are not indicated. There Is a palpably firm
mass measuring 7 x 5.5 x 2.5 cm that is indicated by level 1 b Multiple lymph nodes are dissected from
all three levels. Three representative portions of the largest (lave ymph node are utilized for tissue banking.
With the exception of the largest lymph node. the lymph nodes are entirely submitted.

Summary of sections: A1-A5) Largest mass (level 1. A1 adjacent to tissue utilized for tissue banking). A6)
Single level 1 lymph node unsectloned. A7) Single level 1 lymph node bisected. A8) Sings level 1 lymph node
bisected. A9) Multiple unsectloned level 1iyth nodes. Alli-A12) Multiple unsectioned level 2 lymph nodes. A13)

 

Multiple unsectloned level 3 lymph nodes.

3. Level 3 left lymph node (axillary : eceived fresh labels—L axillary lymph node level 3" and
consists of three tan lymph nodes ranging in greatest enslon from 0.2 to 1 cm. The lymph nodes are entirely
submitted unsectloned in cassettes 31-32. ﬂ

C. Rt. oulder melanoma 'short SI! - superior. medial 'leng stitch - inferior. lateral: Received in formalin
labeled Right shoulder melanoma”. is a 12.0 x 4.4 cm oriented. tan-white skin ellipse which is excised to a
depth 0 . cm. There is a short stitch designating superior. medial (12 o'clock) and a long stitch designating
inferior, lateral (6 o'clock). The epidermis displays a 0.5 x 0.3 cm ill-defined. pink-red lesions which comes to within
1.3 cm of the nearest 3 o'clock margin. The specimen is inked black from 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock to 6 o'clock. blue
from 6 o’clock to 9 o'clock to 12 o'clock. and the 12 o'clock margin is inked yellow. The specimen is sectioned and
representative sections are submitted as follows: Ct-CB center. transverse sections to include entire lesion (Ci and
02 are contiguous sections. C3 and C4 are contiguous sections. 05 and OS are contiguous sections). C? radial
sections of the 6 o'clock and yellow inked 12 o'clock spices.

D. Rt axillary sentinel node #1: Received in formalin labeled — Right axillary sentinel node #1'. is

' a 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm ovoid. pink-tan candidate lymph node which is bisected to reveal a pink-tan, smooth cut surface.
The specimen is submitted in its entirety in D1.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:

A. The largest mass (A1 - A4) represents an apparent lymph node largely replaced by metastatic malignant
melanoma. Extracapsular spread is not definitively identified. Panmelanoma immunoperoxldase stains are
performed on blocks A6 - A13. Tissue pick up is focally noted and knife carryover is seen. Background staining is
also seen. No additional metastatic feel are present.

8. Panmelanoma lmmuneperoxidase stains are performed on both tissue blocks. Metastatic melanoma is
not apparent.

C. Prior biopsy site changes are noted. Residual malignant melanoma Is not identified.

. Lymph node profiles are evident. A Panmelanoma immunoperexldase stain is performed and is
negative for metastasis.
