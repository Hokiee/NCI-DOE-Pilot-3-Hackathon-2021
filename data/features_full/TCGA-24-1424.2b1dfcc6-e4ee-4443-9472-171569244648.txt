Specimenist Received:

A: UTERUS. CERVIX. BILATERAL TUBES AND OVAHIES
B: SIGMOID
C: OMENTUM

Gross Description;

The specimens are received in three iorrnaiin-filied containers, each labeled m The first container
is labeled ”uterus, ovaries. tubes, cervix." It contains a 122-gram uterus and calm. an etac e bilateral adnexa.
The larger adnexa includes an 11.0 x 6.5 x 4.8 cm solid and muliicystic purple-pink-yeltow mass that replaces the
ovary. with sxophyilc tumor on the surface of the ovary. Sections show the mass is largely comprised of spongy,
heterogeneous white and yellow tissue with additional cystic areas. No deﬁnite residual normal ovarian parenchyma is
identified. The 4.2 cm long x 0.6 cm diameter portion of tan-purple fallopian tube has a proximal portion with tumor
nodules on its surface. Sections show probable involvement of the tube! wall by the tumor. The smaller adnexa
includes a 5.8 x 4.9 x 3.8 cm yellow-tan ovarian mass. The surface of the mass is exophytic. and shows a 2.0 cm
diameter disruption. Sections oi the ovarian mass show a 3.0 cm diameter cystic portion. with papillary excrescences
on the otherwise smooth cyst lining. There is gross. diiluse Involvement of the surtace of the ovary by the tumor. The
specimen includes a 3.5 cm long x 0.6 cm diameter tan-purple fallopian tube with an unremarkable iimbriatsd end.
The surface of the ialiopian tube shows minute (0.1 cm) nodules that may represent tumor nodules. Sections of the
fallopian tube show an unremarkable lumen. The 6.8 (cornu to cornu) x 9.5 (tundus to ectooe rvix) x 6.0 cm (anterior to
posterior) uterus and cervix is covered by tan serosa. The uterine contour is distorted by a 5.3 cm tibrold anteriorty.
The serosa has hemorrhagic areas. and adhesions that may represent tumor implants. The 3.4 cm diameter cervix is
covered by smooth white mucosa, and has an unremarkable 0.8 cm diameter external 05. The uterus and cervix are
opened to show an unremarkable 1.9 cm long x 0.3 cm diameter endocervtcal canal, lined by shiny mucosa. The 2.8 x
1.4 cm endometrial cavity is lined by pink endometriurn. There is a 0.5 cm diameter plnk polypold mass with a very
thin stalk near the lundus. There is a second 0.7 cm diameter pink poiypoid mass with a narrow stalk attached to the
tower uterine segment portion of the endometriat cavity. Sections of the cervix show no masses. Sections of the
endomyometrlum show a maximum endometriai thickness of 0.1 cm. The myomeirlum (without iibroids) is up to 1.9
cm thick and is comprised of unremarkabte spongy tan tissue. Additional small intramural iibroids are identiﬁed,
comprised of lirm, whoried tissue. The large anterior fibroid is sectioned to show ilrm, whorled. white tissue. without
necrosis or hemorrhage. Labeled A1 - larger ovarian tumor, with surface involvement; A2 — cystic portion of larger
ovarian tumor with putative residual normal ovarian tissue; A3 and A4 — solid portions oi larger ovarian tumor; A5 -
fallopian tube with involvement by tumor from larger adnexa; A6 to A9 - smaller ovary; A10 - fallopian tube within
smaller adnsxa; A11 - anterior cervix; A12 - posterior cervix; A13 - anterior lower uterine segment endometrium, with
poiypoid lesion. and detached polypoid endometrial lesion from tundus; A14 - anterior endomyometrium; A15 -
posterior endomyometrium; A16 - posterior uterine serosa and myometrlurn; A17 - portion of largest tibroid. Jar 2.

The second container is labeled "sigmoid tumor." it contains a 1.2 cm diameter tan-white nodule, similar to tumor seen
on the ovaries. Sectioned. Labeled Bi. —

The third container is labeled "omentum." it contains a 39.5 x 11.8 x 2.5 cm portion of yellow-tan omentum. There are

multiple tumor nodules visible on the surface. Sections show multiple tan. lleshy. and firm tumor nodules, measuring
up to 4.2 cm in diameter. The nodules occupy approximately 20% of the volume oi the omentum. Labeled Ct. Jar 2.

HISTOPATHOLOGIC TYPE
The histologic diagnosis is serous adenocarcinoma

TUMOR LOCATION
Right and left ovary

HISTOLOGIC GRADE
The histologic grade is poorly differentiated -

TUMOR lNVASlON
Tumor is identified on the ovarian surface(s)
Tumor does invade the adjacent fallopian tube/perilubal soft tissue

TUMOR iNVOLVEMENT
Tumor involvement of the pelvic peritoneumfsolt tissue is present
Metastatic involvement of the omentum is present

TUMOR SIZE

The maximum dimension of tumor implants outside the true pelvis is greater than or equal to 2 cm

PRIMARY TUMORQHO
Based on the abov rmaiion. the primary tumor is ciassilied as macr
more than 2 cm in greatest dimension or regional lymph node metastasi

REGIONAL LYMPH MODES!

The regional lymph nodes ca t be assessed-
DiSTANT METASTASIS -

The status of distant tumor site cannot be assessed I

The pathologic stage assigned here should be regarded as provisional, and may change after integration of clinical
data not provided with this specimen.
