OPERAT IVE DIAGNOSES
Not Given
Operation/Specimen: A: Brain, biopsy
B: Brain, resection, perm
PATHOLOG ICAL DIAGNOS I S :
A. Brain, site not specified, resection: Oligodendroglioma.
B. Brain, site not specified, resection: Oligodendroglioma with focal
anaplastic transformation.
See comment.
COMMENT
Parts A and B are portions of cerebrum extensively infiltrated and focally
effaced by a glial neoplastic proliferation with an oligodendroglial
phenotype. The neoplasm has the morphology of a "looser" tumor. In part A
there are no features of atypia. In part B there is on focal area with brisk
mitotic activity, focal microvascular cellular proliferation, conspicuous
tumor cell and microvessel karyorrhexis, and focal tumor necrosis, i. e.
anaplastic transformation (WHO grade III).
Special stains to better characterize the neoplasm are being requested and
will be reported as an addendum.

Date Ordered: Date Reported:
Addendum Diagnosis

Brain, immunohistochemistry: MIB-l proliferation index: \R\ 10%.
See comment.
Addendum Comment

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates sparse gliofibrillary background,

with small focal areas with heavier glial processes. The neoplastic cells do
not over express the p53 protein. With the MIB-l a proliferation index of 8%
to 10% is determined in the more active areas.
Comment: The immunophenotype supports the diagnosis of high histological
grade oligodendroglioma. '
