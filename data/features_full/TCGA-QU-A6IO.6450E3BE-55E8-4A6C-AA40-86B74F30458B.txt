Margins

Tumor extends to the inked capsular margin of the left lobe (slides U and V). The bladder
margin and inked apical margins are free of tumor.

Extraprostatic extension: Absent.
Seminal vesicle invasion (invasion of muscular wall required): Absent.
Perineural invasion: Present.

Comments: There is one right obturator lymph node and that shows no evidence of malignancy.
Sections of the left obturator lymph node specimen reveal multiple lymph node proﬁles, but is not

clear how many nodes are represented by these proﬁles. However all of'these- sections are free of
tumor.

Clinical: Carcinoma of prostate on needle biopsy.
Gross:

The specimen is received fresh in three parts, all labelemnd the medical
record number.

Part 1 is additionally labeled "right obturator lymph node" and consists of a 3.5 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm fatty
tissue excision weighing 4 grams. The specimen is sectioned to reveal 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 possible
lymph node with a tan white granular cut surface. The remainder of the specimen is unremarkable
fatty tissue. The specimen is represented as followe: A = large node bisected. 8-0 = adjacent soft
tissue.

Part 2 is additionally labeled "left obturator lymph node" and consists of a 4.3 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm fatty
tissue excision, weighing 4 grams. The specimen is represented as follows: D= one large possible
node bisected. E-F = soft tissue.

Part 3 is additionally labeled "prostate" and consists of a 59 gram prostate specimen measuring
5.5 x 5.2 x 4.5 cm with a right seminal vesicle measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm and a left seminal
vesicle measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. The specimen has been oriented by the surgeon with a stitch

in the right seminal. vesicle. Theright vas deferens is 3 cm in length with an average diameter of
0.4 cm, the left vas deferens is 2.2 cm in length with an average diameter of 0.4 cm. The specimen
is inked with the right side in black and the left side in blue and is serially sectioned from apex to
the base. There is diffuse nodularity in the apex measuring 2 cm in greatest diameter. There is.
additionally in the posterior apex a ﬁrm rubbery nodule measuring approximately 0.8 cm in largest
dimension. in the right mid apex there is a ﬁrm white nodule measuring 0.4 cm in greatest
dimension. In the left mid prostate there is a palpable nodule measuring approximately 0.2 cm.
There is additionally some diffuse nodularity posteriorly in the mid base to base region. The
specimen is represented as follows: G = right seminal vesicle and vas deferens, H = left seminal
vesicle and vas deferens, l = shaved left base prostate, J = shaved right base of prostate, K—M =
left apex. N-P = right apex, Q = left and right posterior apex, R = right posterior mid apex, S = left
posterior mid prostate, T =1 left posterior mid base. U = right posterior mid base, V = left base, W =
left and right base, X = right mid prostate.
