CLINICAL HISTORY:
—year-Old female with malignant neoplasm of the ovary.

GROSS EXAMINATION: ,
A. "Proximal bowel", received fresh and placed in formalin at on

' is a 3.5 cm circumference x 0.7 cm length segment of gastrointestinal
mucosa containing a stapled line which is removed and the specimen is
submitted entirely in block Al.

8. "Pelvic mass, rectum", received fresh and placed in formalin at .on

is a 19 cm length x 5.5 cm circumference segment of large bowel. The
deep soft tissue distally is inked blue_and sectioning demonstrates a 4.5 x
4.1 x 3.1 cm well—circumscribed soft friable mass within the perirectal soft
tissue. The mass is-l cm from the colonic mucosal surface and 0.9 cm from the
closest blue inked soft tissue margin. Additionally, the lesion is 3.2 cm
from the distal colorectal margin and 14.1 cm from the proximal margin.

Sections are submitted as follows: 7

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. "PROXIMAL BOWEL":

PORTION OF COLON, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.

B. "PELVIC MASS, RECTUM, PARTIAL EXCISION":

PORTION OF COLON WITH POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA, INVOLVING
MAINLY SEROSA AND PERIRECTAL ADIPOSE TISSUE, CONSITENT WITH RECURRENT
,3 OVARIAN ADENOCARCINOMA, SEE COMMENT.
MAXIMUM TUMOR SIZE: 4.5 CM. ‘
MULTIPLE AREAS OF. VASCULAR INVASION PRESENT.

 

O. ”RECTAL AHASTOHOSIS DOUBT”:

PORTION OF COLON, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.

"PELVIC NODULE":

U

FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE AND LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.

E. "RIGHT INGUINAL LYMPH NODE":
TWO LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/2).

COMMENT: This patient has a history of poorly differentiated Serous
adenocarcinoma of the ovary and chemotherapy. Since the clinical impression
is recurrent ovarian carcinoma, and the histologic findings are very
consistent with that diagnosis, immunoperoxidase stains will not be performed
on this tissue, unless requested. '

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).
