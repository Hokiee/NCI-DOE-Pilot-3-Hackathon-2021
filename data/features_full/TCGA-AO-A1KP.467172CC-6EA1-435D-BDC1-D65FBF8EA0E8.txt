Left Axilla". It consists 0! two fragments of adipose tissue measuring 1.5
x l x 0.5 cm and 3 x 1.5 x l. on. Two possible tan lymph nodes measuring 0.2
and 0.8 cm in greatest dimension are identified. The specimen is entirely
submitted.

Sumary of Sections:

LN - lymph node

BL“ - bisected lymph node
I remainder of fat.

4) The specimen is received trash, labeled 'Left Total Mastectomy
(stitch marks axillary aspect)‘. It consists of a breast measuring 28 x 27
x 4.5 cm and weighing 1,750 grams. A suture designates the axillary aspect
or the specimen. Identified on the anterior surtace is a light tan skin
ellipse measuring 24 x 12 cu. Ne scars are identified on the epidermal
aurtace. A grossly unremarkable nipple measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm is
identified. The entire deep resection margin is inked. Identiﬁed on the
deep aspect is a 6 x 2.5 x 2 cm delect near the axillary aspect at the
specimen. Serial sections through the specimen reveal two distinct tumor
masses in the lower inner quadrant and one separate tumor mass between the
lower inner and lower outer quadrants. The two masses in the lower inner
quadrant are tairly well-circumscribed. fin. spiculeted with focal areas of
necrosis and measure 2 x l x 1 an and 1.3 x l x 1 cm. The larger tumor mess
is at a distance of 4 on from the closest deep resection margin and 2 cm
from the closest superficial resection margin. The smaller tumor nae: in
the lower inner quadrant is at a distance or 5 on iron the closest deep
resection margin and 4 on iron the closest anterior resection margin. The
tumor mass located between the lover inner and lower outer quadrants is
wellvcircumscribed, firm, can and measures 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and is located
at a distance or 5 cm from the closest deep resection margin. The remainder
o! the parenchyma is comprised of approximately 5% tan-white fibrous tissue
and 95% yellow-tan adipose tissue. A portion of the largest tumor is
submitted for us studies. The tumors are entirely submitted.
Representative sections ﬁrm the remainder of the specimen are submitted.
