CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neo corpus uteri. Per E-browser, the patient has a FIGO 1

endometriod endometrial adenocarcinoma and endometriosis.

GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries", received fresh for frozen

section is a 114 gram hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
specimen. (NOTE: The specimen cannot be definitively oriented due to
extensive serosal and bilateral adnexal adhesions and probable endometriosis
which obscure the usual orienting landmarks. The orientations used below are
presumed.) There is a 3.1 x 2.1 cm area of heaped—up endometrium centered in
the posterior endometrium that grossly appears to invade 2.6 cm into the 3.2
cm thick myometrium. The mass is tan and friable, with poorly defined
borders, and comes within approximately 0.5 cm of the posterior lower uterine
segment. The tumor does not involve the cervix or extend into the adnexa. The
0.2 cm thick endometrium is otherwise unremarkable. The myometrium displays
approximately five firm, white, whorled nodules up to 1.7 cm in greatest
dimension, and is otherwise unremarkable. The cervix displays a 1cm firm,
white whorled submucosal nodule and is otherwise unremarkable. The posterior
serOsal surface of the uterus is diffusely covered with shaggy, tan-gray
fibrous tissue which is continuous with adhesions involving the bilateral

The right fallopian tube (3.5 cm long x 0.6 cm in diameter) is
unremarkable. No definite right ovary is identified. Sectioning the right
adnexal soft tissue reveals numerous chocolate cysts of up to 0.6 cm in
greatest dimension. The 1eft_fallopian tube (3.5 cm long x 0.4 cm diameter)
is fixed to the anterior surface of the uterus by adhesions. No definite left
ovary is identified. Sectioning the left adnexal soft tissue reveals a 2.7 cm
unilocular chocolate cyst covered with adhesions that is affixed to the

uterine fundus.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL FINDINGS: ' .
The immunoperoxidase tests reported herein were developed and their
performance characteristics were determined by the

. "~-‘- ne---i _ __i- of them may nor be Cleared or approved oy
Fm. the 0.8. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such
f X clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical

~43 purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This

of 1988 (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity cliniCal testing.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: Hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and lymphadenectomy

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 6th Edition): pTla pNO pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

COMMENT: The tumor is an exophytic mass which is grossly suspicious for tumor
invasion into the outer half of the myometrium. The frozen section slides
also show areas of apparent deep myometrial tumor invasion. However, multiple
permanent sections of these areas demonstrate that these tumor foci are
actually present within adenomyosis, and do not invade the myometrium. This
finding is confirmed by an immunostain for CD10, which demonstrates a cuff of
endometrial stromal cells surrounding each tumor nest. Dr. notified
of the change from the frozen section diagnosis via email.

B. "LEFT PELVIC NODES" (BIOPSY):

THIRTEEN LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (0/13).

C. "RIGHT PELVIC NODES" (BIOPSY):
TWELVE LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (O/lZ).
