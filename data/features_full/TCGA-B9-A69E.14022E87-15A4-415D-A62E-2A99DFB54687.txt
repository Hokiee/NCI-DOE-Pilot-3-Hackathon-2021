Gross Description:

Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally
labeled "left kidney. " It holds a l, 220 gram, 25 x 12.0 x 10.0
cm nephrectomy specimen. The perinephric fat is inked blue.
Within the fat there is a 16.2 x 8.0 x 8.0 cm kidney. Within the
lower pole there is an 8.0 x 7.2 x 7.0 cm tan/yellow/red

firm, well circumscribed, variegated mass. The mass bulges the
capsule, but does not grossly appear to invade through it. The
majority of the mass is solid (90%) with the remaining 10% being
cystic. The cysts are filled with dark brown liquid. There are
no white myxoid areas grossly noted. The mass does not invade
into the sinus fat or involve the pelvis. The remainder of the
kidney parenchyma is red/brown with a distinct corticomedullary
junction. The renal vein artery and ureter are all patent. The
adrenal gland is not grossly identified.

Block summary:

Al — ureter, vein and artery margins, en face

A2—A3 - mass with respect to capsule

A4—A6 — additional sections of mass

A7 — uninvolved kidney away from mass

A8 - additional section of normal kidney away from mass

Tumor and normal are submitted to
