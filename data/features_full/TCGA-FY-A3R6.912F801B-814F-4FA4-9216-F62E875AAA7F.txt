tissue (microscopic evaluation).

Gross Description

A. The specimen is received fresh labeled "total thyroidectomy"
and consists of a 14 g total thyroid resection. There is a
suture designating the pole of the left lobe of the thyroid. The
surface is shaggy and gray—purple. The right lobe which is inked
blue is 4.5 x 2.0 x 1.4 cm. The left lobe which is inked black
is 4.0 x 1.8 x 1.8 cm. The isthmus which is inked yellow is 1.0
x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a
multinodular ill—defined firm tan—brown lesion that encompasses
the majority of the left lobe of the thyroid and approximates 2.2
x 1.5 x 1.3 cm. There are additional nonsuspicious
we1l~circumscribed soft tan-brown nodules identified in the
isthmus and the right lobe that measure up to 0.4 cm. The
majority of the right lobe has a firm red-brown cut surface.
Representative sections are submitted as A1-A6 entire left lobe
lesion: A7 isthmus and right lobe with nodules; A8 and A9 right
lobe with remaining nodules. This specimen is reviewed with-

A portion of the lesion is submitted for studies.

B. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section labeled
"possible tip of left inferior parathyroid" and consists of two
irregular tan—pink soft tissue fragments that are 10 mg and
average 0.2 cm. The are frozen and submitted in their entirety
in cassette BlFS.

C. The specimen is received in formalin labeled "level 6 lymph
nodes" and consists of two firm tan-gray grossly positive lymph
nodes that are 1.5 and 2.0 cm. Two representative sections from
each lymph node are submitted as C1 one lymph node, and C2
other lymph node.

D. The specimen is received in formalin labeled "left level 2
lymph nodes" and consists of four firm tan-gray lymph nodes that
range from 0.5 to 2.5 cm. Their cut surfaces are firm tan-gray
and grossly positive. They are submitted entirely as D1 one
bisected lymph node, D2 two whole lymph nodes; DB one bisected
lymph node.

E. The specimen is received in formalin labeled "left modified
radical neck dissection" and consists of a 9.0 x 5.5 x 1.3 cm
irregular indurated tan-yellow portion of fibroadipose tissue.
There is a double suture designating the lowest level 4 and a

single suture designating the lateral level 5. The specimen is
divided into a superior half (with level 4) and an inferior half
(with level 5). There is no attached salivary gland identified.

Identified within the inferior half of the specimen is a
prominent vessel that is 1.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter.
There is no gross evidence of tumor involvement. There are two
enlarged, grossly positive lymph nodes identified within level 4.
There are a few additional firm tan—gray lymph nodes identified
that range from 0.2 to 0.6 cm. Also noted separate from the
oriented tissue are two irregular, indurated tan—yellow portions

w

of fibroadipose tissue that measure 4 cm in aggregate. Within
the tissue there are several firm tan—gray lymph nodes that range
from 0.2 to 1.6 cm. Representative sections are submitted in
nine cassettes.

Cassette summary: E1 section from one grossly positive lymph
node, level 4; E2 section from one grossly positive lymph node,
level 1; E3 three whole lymph nodes, level 4; E4 cross—sections
of vessel, level 5; E5 two whole lymph nodes, level 5; E6 five
whole lymph nodes, level 5; E7 one bisected lymph node and
additional tissue; E8 five whole lymph node in additional
tissue; E9 five whole lymph nodes in additional tissue.
