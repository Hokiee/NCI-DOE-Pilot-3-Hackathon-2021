GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. TERMINAL ILEUM AND RIGHT COLON
Received fresh and labeled as "terminal ileum and right colon". Received is a closed segment of colon
and terminal ileum measuring 26.4 cm in length. There is a constricted portion of the right colon located
at the mid segment. This entire segment is inked blue. The terminal ileum measures approximately 4.6
x 4.1 cm and the right colon measures 22.0 cm in length and 6.0 cm in diameter. There is an ulcerated
tumor mass measuring 2.2 x 2.2 x 0.6 cm which extends through the muscularis propria. The tumor is
situated in the colon and is located 11.0 cm from the proximal margin and 13.0 cm from the distal
colonic margin. There are several polyps present throughout the right colon ranging in size from 0.1 to
0.7 cm. Sections are taken for tissue procurement and gross photograph was also taken.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

A1: shaved sections of proximal margin

A2: shaved sections of distal margin

A3-A11: mass, including deep margin

A12: polyps

A13: normal-appearing colonic mucosa

A14-A17: possible lymph nodes

A18: normal-appearing tissue from ileum
