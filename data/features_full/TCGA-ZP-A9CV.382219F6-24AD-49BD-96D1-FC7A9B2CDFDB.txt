ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS:

Cirrhosis (specify type): Micronodular
Gross:
A. The specimen is labeled "gallbladder." Received in

is a 9.0 x 5.5 x 1.3 cm in diameter gallbladder.
Adjacent to the cystic duct is a 0.8 cm in greatest
dimension pink—tan lymph node candidate. The mucosa is
velvety and orange—tan. The wall thickness is 0.1 cm.
Present within the gallbladder lumen are two ovoid smooth
black—green stones, 1.8 and 2.5 cm in greatest dimension.
The wall thickness ranges from 0.2 to 1.0 cm.
Representative sections, including the cystic duct margin
and possible lymph node are submitted in cassette A.

B. The specimen is labeled "HCC segment 5." Received fresh
in is a 26.8 gm, 4.6 x 3.7 x 2.5 cm portion of
liver. Numerous sutures and staples are present. The
capsule is smooth and purple—pink. The resection margin is
marked with black ink. The specimen is previously incised.
Further sectioning reveals a 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm well-
circumscribed nodular green—tan lesion which extends to the
hepatic capsule. The lesion is 0.5 cm from the closest
black inked resection surface. The lesion is well—
demarcated from the remaining hepatic parenchyma which is
orangewtan. Representative sections from the well—defined
lesion and unremarkable liver are submitted to

‘ tissue bank. Representative sections are
submitted to: permanent as follows:

C. The specimen is labeled "liver bx, junction 2/3."
Received in Tis—u~Sol are two 0.1 cm in diameter cores of
yellow~tan tissue with lengths of 1.1 and 2.0 cm. The

specimen is submitted in toto in cassette C. Iron,
reticulin and trichrome stains are requested.

Microscopic:
Histological examinations have been performed on specimens
A-C.

A. The mucosa of the gallbladder is intact. The wall of
the gallbladder shows focal areas of fibrosis. There is no
evidence of malignancy.

8. Sections of liver show a well~circumscribed
hepatocellular carcinoma. The tumor is proliferating, and
broad, trabeculated individual cells are polyhedral in shape
with oval, central nuclei. There is no severe dysplasia.
The resection margins are free of tumor. Adjacent liver
uninvolved by the tumor shows marked fatty change and
micronodular cirrhosis.

C. H and E, reticolin and trichromewstained sections of
liver Show a micronodular cirrhosis with a well~developed
micronodular pattern. Regenerative nodules Show severe
macrovesicular steatosis, and the liver biopsy shows no
evidence of dysplasia or neoplasia. Iron stain shows 2+
siderosis.
