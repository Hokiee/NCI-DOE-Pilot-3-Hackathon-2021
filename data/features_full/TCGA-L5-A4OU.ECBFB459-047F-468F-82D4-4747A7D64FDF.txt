Esophageal cancer, GERD x 20 years with adenocarcinoma and cholelithiasis.

Also has history of AFIB, hypertension, type l1 diabetes, congestive heart

failure, coronary artery disease, HI, DNA in with head injury. Clinical

diagnosis: Esophageal cancer. Operative Procedure: Status post /CA- 0 -., 3

C. 1:, .

1. 'Gallbladdar" Received in a median container is a 7.1 x 3.2 x 2.6 cm
gallbladder with unremarkable purple~gray serosa‘. The lumen is partly filled M
with dark green viscus bile and multiple black, multifaceted stones. The “7/4”"
stones are in the fundus and body and are seen q) to 1.7 cm in greatest
dimensions, crushing uith ease. The nucosa is dark green, velvety and the wall
thickness averages 0.2 cm. The cystic duct. is patent.

Cassette 1. Gallbladder.

2. "Distal esophagus proximal stomach” Received in formalin in a large
container is a previously opened, distal esophagus and proximal staunch that
is 12.9 x 8.5 x 4.4 cm in overall dimensions. There is a small amount of
adierent perigastric adipose tissue. The esophageal margin is stapled, as well
as the cardiac margin. The distal esophageal adventitia is. inked green and the
cardiac across is inked black. The esophageal adventitia is focally firm, as
well as the gastric seroaa near the esophagogastric junction. Arising in the
esoﬁiagogastric junction is a 3.3 x 1.8 cm circuaferential firm mass. The
centrally ulcerated tumor appears to involve 6.6 cm of the esophageal Mona
with the remaining 2.? CITI'lOCBted‘ in the gastric cardia. The cut surfaces
through the tuner shows a perforating moularis ard sarosa, involving the:
perigastric/adventitial fatty tissue. It is slightly puckering the gastric
across and perigastric fat. The remaining esophageal moose is unremarkable,
as well as the remaining gastric mucosa. Lymph node candidates are retrieved
from the periesophageal and perigastric fatty tissue up to 1.6 cm in greatest
dimensions. The cut surface of thelargest is gray-white, focally hemorrhagic
and partly replaced by fatty tissue.

ZC'D. Bisected full-thickness section of 56.! tuner.

2E. Additional section of tuner to esophageal rrucosa. (

2?. Nine whole lyrrph node candidate.

3. 'Cervical esophageal margin‘ Received in formalin in a small container is
a 0.8 cm segmnt of gray—prom cervical tissue. The possible margin is
stapled, and the distal margin is opened. The adventitia and moose are
unremarkable.

cassette 3. Cervical esophageal margin. l , staple line retained)

4. ”Celia: lymph noda' Received in formalin in a small container are two
ovoid'portions of fatty tissue. The smaller is 1.1 cm in greatest dimension
and the larger is 1.4 cm in greatest dimensions. The smallest portion is only
fatty tissue with no lymph node candidate readily seen. The larger portion has
a single 1 cm lymph node candidate which is gray-white on the cut surface.
