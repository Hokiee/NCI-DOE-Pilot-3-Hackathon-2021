DIAGNOSIS

(A) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND:
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR CELL TYPE), FUHRMAN'S NUCLEAR GRADE 2.

TUMOR PUSHES INTO RENAL SINUS ADIPOSE TISSUE. (SEE COMMENT)

TUMOR MEASURES 4.5 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION.

Vascular and soft tissue margins of resection free of tumor.

Renomedullary interstitial ceEI tumor (medullary fibroma) (0.5 cm in greatest dimension).

Adrenal gland, no tumor present.

COMMENT
The tumor focally pushes into the renal sinus adipose tissue with a weil circumscribed border. Multiple additional deeper sections are

examined and no unequivocal invasion into the renal sinus adipose tissue is Identified. No extension into the perinephric adipose tissue
is identified.

GROSS DESCRiPTION .
(A) LEFT KiDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND - A nephrectomy specimen consisting of a left kidney (15.0 x 10.0 x 6.0 cm), a segment of

renal artery, renal vein, ureter (10.5 cm in length x 0.3 cm in average diameter) and an adrenal gland (5.0 x 2.0 x 0.7 cm).

There is a 4.5 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm well-circumscribed tumor in the mid pole of the kidney. The tumor is bright yellow with areas of
hemorrhage and necrosis, predominantly within the center. The tumor focally pushes Into the renal sinus adipose tissue as a well
circumscribed nodule. The tumor abuts renal vein and renal pelvis and does not extend into the renal vein or pelvis. The tumor does
not extend into Gerota's fascia.

In addition there is a tan-white nodule (0.4 x 0.4 x 0.5 cm), 0.8 cm from the main tumor.
The pelvicalyceal system is smooth and has a stone (0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm). No iymph nodes are identified in the hilum of the kidney.
Seriai cross section of the adrenal gland shows unremarkable cortex and medulla.

. Portions of the tumor have been submitted for possible electron microscopy. Specimen photographs are taken. Tumor and normal are

submitted for Tumor Bank.
