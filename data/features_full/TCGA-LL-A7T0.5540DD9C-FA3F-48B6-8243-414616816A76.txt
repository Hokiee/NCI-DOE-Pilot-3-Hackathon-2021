GROSS DESCRIPTION :

Received fresh for tissue banking labeled with the patient's name and designated "left
breast" is a 1.094 gram. 24.0 x 23.0 x 5.5 cm fibrofatty breast. The breast has an
overlying 22.0 x 8.5 cm portion of tan-white skin. The skin has a central 6.5 x 5.5 cm
areola and 1.5 cm raised nipple. There is a green suture on the skin designating 12
o'clock. An indurated nodule is present beneath the skin surface directly medial to the
nipple and underlying the areola. The skin surface and areola have multiple plaque—like
pigmented papules. The largest papule is superior and lateral at the edge of the areola.
This papule is 1.6 x 0.8 cm. No additional scars or lesions are identified on the skin
surface. The deep margin is ragged and fatty. The specimen is consistent with a simple
mastectomy specimen.

The deep margin is inked blue. and the breast is sectioned to have a diffusely glistening
fatty cut surface. A medial, 2.3 cm nodular tumor mass is present beneath the skin surface
medial in the described area beneath the areola. The tumor has a focal multinodular
appearance at the periphery. but appears to be one mass grossly. The mass is 0.7 cm from
the skin surface. is 6.0 cm from superior. is 3.0 cm from inferior. is 5.0 cm from medial.
and 18.5 cm from lateral. The tumor is at least 4.5 cm from the deep margin. The tumor
has a central stellate. gritty indurated cut surface, and further sectioning shows the
tumor to range up to 2.8 cm. A section of tumor is sampled for tissue banking. The
remainder of the parenchyma is diffusely fatty with scant. delicate white fibrous tissue.
No additional tumor-like masses are identified. The delicate white fibrous tissue makes up
between 10—15% of the parenchyma. The tumor is most closely associated with the lower

1.3 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm possible tumor mass. This second described mass is 0.3 cm from the deep
margin and is associated with the lower inner quadrant. This separate tumor is 5 cm from
the first described tumor underlying the areola. The second mass is 4.5 cm from superior.
4.0 cm from inferior. 2.8 cm from medial. 20 cm from lateral. Representative sections are
sampled as labeled:

A1 — nipple entirely submitted

A2 ~ en face section of areola

A3 — pigmented skin papule

A4 - deep margin associated with first described tumor mass

A5—7 - sections of first described tumor mass to include mass to skin

B. Received in formalin. labeled with the patient's name and ”left axilla level 1 and 2" is
a 5.0 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm aggregate of yellow adipose. The adipose is trimmed to have four
nodular. fatty lymph nodes. The nodes range from 1.2 cm to 2.5 x 1.9 x 1.1 cm. The fat is
trimmed and the nodes are sectioned to be entirely submitted as labeled:

B1 — two lymph nodes with one lymph node bisected
ea — one lymph node bisected
B3 — the largest lymph node bisected
