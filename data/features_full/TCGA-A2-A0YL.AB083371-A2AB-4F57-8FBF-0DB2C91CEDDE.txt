TISSUE MEASURING 6 X 4 X 0.9 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSIONS. INK IS FOUND ON
ONE SIDE OF THE SPECIMEN. THIS IS RE-INKED WITH BLUE INK WITH A
PERIMETER OF BLACK INK. THIS IS SECTIONED AND SUBMITTED ENTIRELY LABELED

A1 THROUGH 6.

PART B RECEIVED LABELED FT BREAST STITCH AT 12 O’CLOCK,
IS A SIMPLE MASTECTOMY SPECIMEN MEASURING 16 X 16 X 5.2 CM. TEE NIPPLE
IS UNREMARKABLE WITHIN A 9.5 X 4.8 CM SKIN ELLIPSE. BLUE DYE IS NOTED IN
THE MID-SUPERIOR PORTION OF THE SPECIMEN. A SUTURE DENOTES 12 O’CLOCK.
TEE SUPERFICIAL ASPECT IS MARKED WITH BLUE INK, THE DEEP MARGIN WITH
BLACK INK. SECTIONING REVEALS THE CENTRAL 80% OF THE SPECIMEN TO CONSIST

 

FROM MEDIAL TO LATERAL AND UP T0 3.8 CM FROM SUPERFICIAL T0 DEEP. THIS

GREATER THAN 1 CM FROM THE SUPERIOR, INFERIOR, MEDIAL AND LATERAL MARGINS
GROSSLY. SECTIONING THE CENTRAL FIBROUS TISSUE REVEALS A MOTTLED PINK TO
GRAY-WHITE APPEARANCE. SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: Bl--NIPPLE,
BZ--UPPER OUTER QUADRANT, 83--UPPER INNER QUADRANT, B4--LOWER INNER
QUADRAN'I‘, BS~-LOWER OUTER QUADRANT. NOTE: Bl THROUGH BS ARE MIRROR

PART C RECEIVED LABELED— LEFT SENTINEL NODE #1 HOT AND
BLUE, IS YELLOW-RED FATTY TISSUE MEASURING 2.7 x 2.1 x 1.2 CM. FOCAL
BLUE DYE IS NOTED. SECTIONING REVEALS THIS TO BE A LARGELY FAT-REPLACED
LYMPH NODE WITH FOCAL BLUE DISCOLORATIO . IN THE ADJACENT TISSUE, THREE
ADDITIONAL LYMPH NODES ARE IDENTIFIED MEASURING 0.5 To 0.7 CM IN GREATEST
DIMENSION. THE LARGEST GROSSLY FAT-REPLACED NODE IS SUBMITTED A3 C1. THE

PART D RECEIVED LABELED EFT SENTINEL NODE #2 HOT AND
BLUE, IS YELLOW FATTY TISSUE MEASURING 3 X 2.7 X 1.0 CM. SECTIONING
REVEALS A 1.4 CM IN GREATEST DIAMETER GROSSLY UNREMARKABLE LYMPH NODE,
SUBMITTED LABELED D.

. PART E RECEIVED LABELED - LEFT BREAST ADDITIONAL 12 O'CLOCK
MARGIN INK AT NEW MARGIN, IS AN IRREGULAR PORTION OF YELLOW-RED FATTY
TISSUE MEASURING 11.5 x 5.3 x 1.0 CM. INK IS FOUND ON ONE SIDE OF THE
SPECIMEN. THIS IS FURTHER MARKED WITH BLUE INK WITH A PERIMETER OF BLACK
INK. REPRESENTATIVE TISSUE IS SUBMITTED LABELED E1 THROUGH 10.
APPROXIMATELY 70% OF THE SPECIMEN IS SUBMITTED.

PART F RECEIVED LABELED _ RIGHT SENTINEL NODE #1 HOT AND
BLUE, IS AN OVOID PORTION OF YELLOW-BLUE TISSUE IVIEASURING 1.1 x 0.5 x 0.5
CM. SECTIONING REVEALS THIS TO BE UNREMARKABLE NODAL TISSUE, SUBMITTED
LABELED F.

PART G RECEIVED LABELED - RIGHT SENTINEL NODE 2 BLUE AND

 

 

PART H RECEIVED LABELED _ IS A SIMPLE MASTECTOM'Y SPECIMEN
MEASURING 20.5 X 18 X 4.5 CM. THE NIPPLE IS UNREMARKABLE WITHIN A 9.3 X
6.2 CM SKIN ELLIPSE. FOCAL BLUE DISCOLORATION IS NOTED IN THE 12 O’CLOCK
AREA WHERE THERE IS AN ORIENTING SUTURE. THE SUPERFICIAL ASPECT IS
MARKED WITH BLUE INK, THE DEEP WITH BLACK INK. SECTIONING REVEALS THE

WITH MULTIPLE CYSTIC SPACES CONTAINING CLOUDY BROWN FLUID. NO DISTINCT
MSSES ARE EMIFIED. REPRESENTATIVE SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS:
H1--NIPPLE, H2--CENTRAL DEEP MARGIN, H3 AND 4--UPPER INNER QUADRANT, H5
AND 6--UPPER OUTER QUADRANT, H7 AND 8--LOWER OUTER QUADRANT, H9 AND

3 10-~LOWER INNER QUADRANT. NOTE THAT H4 IS THE EXTREME MEDIAL MARGIN.
