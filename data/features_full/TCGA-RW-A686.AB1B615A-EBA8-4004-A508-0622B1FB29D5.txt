Patient with pheochromocytoma - left. Operative Procedure/Tissue Submitted:
En bloc resection, left adrenal pheochromocytoma.

VERIFIED BY:

1. ”En bloc resection, left kidney and left adrenal pheochromocytoma.”
Received in formalin in a large container is a 530 gram, 16 x 11 x 7 cm en
bloc resection of kidney and adrenal glands with perirenal fat. There is an
irregular nodular mass partially covered by perirenal fat at the medial upper
and intrapolar region of the kidney and overlying the hilum (abutting the
hilar vasculature}. The nodular mass is encapsulated. Mass is inked green
and the specimen is bivalved revealing a mahogany colored neoplasm (10.9 x 6,8
x h.2 cm) arjsjﬂgujrouLxheuadrenal_medullahabutting the seminal vessels and
the adipose of the renal hilum, but maintaining a tissue plane and not
invading. The mass has a lobular architecture and abuts the upper half of the
medial aspect of the kidney, and again maintaining a tissue plane without
invasion. The remainder of the kidney is unremarkable. A few nodules
initially mistaken for possible lymph nodes are identified: however, upon
further inspection these nodules directly extended to the main mass and are,
therefore, considered to be part of the tumor. No lymph nodes are ideﬂtlf‘ﬂd
in the perineohric fat. Photographs are taken for reference.

1A. Ureter and Vascular margins.

18 E 1C. Bisected section of tumor adjacent to renal hilum.

1D & 1E. Bisected section of tumor adjacent to renal hilum.

1F - 1H. Additional sections of tumor with a tumor adjacent to possible normal
adrenal cortex in 1H.

1!. Uninvolved renal cortex from inferior pole of kidney.

iJ. Tumor.

1K. Possible residual adrenal gland.

2. ”Periaortic lymph node #1." Received in formalin in a small container is a
2.1 x 1.4 x 1.1 cm lymph node serially sectioned revoaling'pale pink cross
sections with a rim of pale orange. Entirely submitted in cassettes 2A and
28.

3. ”Periaortic lymph node #2.” Received in formalin in a small container is a
2.9 x 2.i x i.8 cm lymph node. This specimen is serially sectioned revealing
pink cross sections with scattered areas of hemorrhage and a rim of orange
tissue. Likely grossly positive.

3A. Representative cross section.
