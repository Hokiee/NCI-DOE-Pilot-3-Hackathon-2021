Main diagnosis/diagnoses:

Peripheral bronchopulmonary, histologically predominantly well differentiated mixed
adenocarcinoma of the left lower lobe of the lung. TNM classification on the basis of this
material pT2 pNO R0, stage IB. C34.3 M8255/3.

Comment/supplementary remark:

The classification of the adenocarcinoma of the lung is based on the result of the
immunohistochemical analysis obtained on the previous biopsy material. The tumor has a
compact, low stromal structure, of predominantly tubulopapillary differentiation and shows a
small bronchioloalveolar component at the margin. It extends to below the pleura, which it
has not however infiltrated on the basis of the sample examined. In a central direction the
carcinoma has invaded a peripheral bronchus, this being markedly distended and largely
obstructed by a tumor plug.
