Diagnosis

1) Uterus, cervix, ovaries, and left fallopian tube, hysterectomy ~

— Endometrial adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, FIGO grade
3. with superficial myometrial invasion into inner
one-half of myometrium (depth of invasion 4 mm;
thickness of myometrium 1.5 cm; 27% of myometrial
thickness).

- Cervix free of tumor.

— Adenomyosis; leiomyomata.

~ Ovaries, bilateral, negative for malignancy.

- Left fallopian tube, negative for malignancy.

— Right fallopian tube not identified (clinical correlation
advised).

2) Right pelvic lymph nodes, excision:
— Six (6) lymph nodes, negative for malignancy.
- Nodule of remote fat necrosis (incidental finding).
3) Left pelvic lymph nodes, excision:
Six (6) lymph nodes, negative for malignancy.

Comment ~

There is a mixture of FIGO grade 2 and FIGO grade 3 tumor present.
Although the grade 3 component appears to represent slightly less than 50%
of the tumor sampled, there is a significant amount of grade 3 tumor
present as well as nuclear grade 3, warranting an overall grade of 3. The
pelvic washing (n shows rare atypical cells but no diagnostic
cytologic evidence of malignancy (clinical correlation recommended).

Endometrial cancer; “

Frozen Section Diagnosis
Intraoperative consultation: Polypoid tumor. No definite invasion
identified./

Gross Description
Part 1) Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and “cervix,

uterus,

bilateral tubes and ovaries" is a pear—shaped uterus with attached cervix,
left fallopian tube, and bilateral ovaries. Right fallopian tube is

grossly

not identified. Uterus and cervix together weigh 86 gm and measure 7.5 x
4.5 x 4 cm. Uterine serosa is tan-pink and smooth. Cervix measures 3.5 cm
in diameter and shows no focal lesions. Uterus and cervix are bivalved,

revealing pale red-tan polypoid tumor in the endometrial cavity measuring
3 x 2 cm in surface dimension located 5.5 cm from the ectocervix. The
remaining unremarkable endometrium is tan-red and measures 0.1 cm in
thickness. Endocervical canal shows no focal lesions. Sections through the
tumor show an irregular endomyometrial junction. No definite invasion is
identified grossly (see microscopic description). The myometrium shows
apparent adenomyosis and a few unremarkable small leiomyomata ranging up

1.5 cm in diameter. Intraoperative report is given to “as
indicated above, by '

Representative sections of tumor are submitted for -studies. The
left ovary meaSures 2.5 x 1 x 1 cm and appears unremarkable. The left
fallopian tube measures 5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter and appears
unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted for “ studies.
The right ovary measures 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm and appears unremarkable.
Representative sections are submitted labeled as follows:

Anterior cervix

Posterior cervix

Uterine corpus tumor and leiomyomata
Lower uterine segment

Left tube and ovary

Part 2) Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and "right pelvic
lymph nodes" are several pieces of fibrofatty tissue measuring 3 x 3 x 2

in aggregate. Serial sections show six apparent lymph nodes. Also noted is
an ovoid hard nodule suggestive of calcified fat necrosis measuring 1.0 cm
in diameter. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted labeled as follows:

A,B: Trisected one lymph node per cassette.
C: Bisected lymph node.
D; Possible three lymph nodes.

E: Nodule./-

Part 3) Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and "left pelvic

and
solid (FIGO grade 3) growth patterns. The solid growth pattern appears to
represent slightly less than 50% of the tumor by volume. Due to the
nuclear grade 3 in these solid areas, as well as the Significant amount of
grade 3 tumor, the tumor is classified as FIGO grade 3. There is
superficial myometrial invasion present (maximum depth 4 nmn depth of
myometrium 1.5 cm; slide D). The lymph node sections show no evidence of
metastatic tumor.
