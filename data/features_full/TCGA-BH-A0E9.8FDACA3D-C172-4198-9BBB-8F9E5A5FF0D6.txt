- ONE LYMPH NODE, POSITIVE FOR CARCINOMA (1/1) (SEE COMMENT).

PART 2: BREAST. RI MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY -
VASIVE LOBULAR CARCINOMA. PLEOMORPHIC TYPE WITH FOCAL SIGNET CELLS.
B. NOT E II (TUB LE FORMATION- 3; NUCLEAR PLEOMORPHISMJ; MITOTIC ACTIVITY - 1:

TOTAL SCORE 719).

C. THE INVASIVE CARCINOMAS ARELOCATED AT THE 12 O'CLOCK AND 8 O’CLOCK POSITIONS. THE
INVASIVE TUMOR MEASURES 2.5 C-M IN GREATEST DIMENSION (TUMOR IN 12 O'CLOCK, GROSS
MEASUREMENT).

D. LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU (LCIS). NUCLEAR GRADE 2-3. ADMIXED WITH INVASIVE CARCINOMA.

E. RESECTION MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR IN SITU AND INVASIVE CARCINOMA.

F. LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IS .NOT NOTED.

G. NIPPLE AND SKIN ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
H. TWO OF 11 LYMPH NODES (2111) ARE POSITIVE FOR CARCINOMA.

I. MICROCALCIFICATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVASIVE AND IN SITU CARCINOMA.
J. FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES AND SCLEROSING ADENOSIS.

K. THE INVASIVE TUMOR CELLS ARE POSITIVE FOR ESTROGEN AND PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS AND
NEGATIVE FOR HERZINEU, AS PER PREVIOUS PATHOLOGY REPORT ‘, _.
