CLINICAL DETAILS

Radical cystectomy for G3 pT2 ureteric carcinoma. Tumour left bladder neck.
?Into prostate. ?Nodes right iliac.

MACROSCOPY

1. Piece of tissue 7mm diameter x 4mm length, which appears to have a central
lesion.

2. Bladder and prostate measuring 100mm SI, transverse 55mm and AP 40mm with
attached fatty tissue (182 x 120mm). On opening there is a bladder base tumour
(leﬁ more than right), measuring 27mm AP x 32mm SI x 40mm transverse. It has a
white homogeneous ﬁrm surface and appears to extend into the prostate. It is
focally haemorrhagic. The tumour appears to extend to, but not breach the
circumferential margin.

3. Fibrofatty tissue 35 x 25 x 12mm. No lymph nodes identiﬁed.

4. Tubular piece of tissue measuring 5 x 5 x 7mm.

5. Fibrofatty tissue which measures 30 x 35 x 10mm.

6. Tubular piece of tissue which measures 14 x 5 x 5mm.

7. Tubular piece of tissue which measures 15 x 4 x 4mm.

MICROSCOPY

1.

Frozen section report to

No evidence of carcinoma in-situ or invasive malignancy.

Parafﬁn section report

Parafﬁn sections show a largely morphologically normal ureter with a focal area
having some nuclear crowding and variation in size sufﬁcient for a diagnosis of
focal dysplasia. There is no evidence of carcinoma in situ or urothelial
neoplasia.

2. Sections of the macroscopically identiﬁed tumour confirm a poorly
differentiated solid transitional cell carcinoma arising from dysplastic
urothelium to invade through the muscle but lie free of the circumferential
surgical margins. There are numerous foci of comedo-type necrosis. No
unequivocal vascular invasion is noted. There is no perineural invasion.

The tumour is seen to extend into prostatic ducts and in a pagetoid fashion and
also invade the prostate. The prostatic circumferential margin is
morphologically normal. The surviving prostatic glands are morphologically
normal with no evidence of high grade PIN or evidence of microacinar
adenocarcinoma.

The urethral surgical margin shows evidence of carcinoma in situ and also
invasive carcinoma.

The background bladder shows morphologically normal urothelium with no evidence
of dysplasia or carcinoma in situ.

The tumour is seen to extend very close to the seminal vesicle wall but does not
involve the seminal vesicle per se. An accompanying giant cell reaction abutts
the seminal vesicle tissue.

3. Right external iliac nodes. All the specimen was processed and contains
mainly ﬁbrovascular and adipose tissue only. Towards one end there is a focus
of what appears to be a part of a lymph node with marked diathermy artefact
which raises the possibility of invasion by urothelial carcinoma.
Immunohistochemistry has been requested and a supplementary report will be
issued when results are available.

4. Right ureteric margin. This is ureteric tissue showing focal carcinoma in

situ. There is no evidence of a papillary neoplasm.

5. Right obturator node; Five lymph nodes identiﬁed, two containing metastatic
carcinoma with extension into extracapsular tissue.

6. Right surgical resection margin ureter; This is morphologically normal
ureteric tissue with no evidence of carcinoma in situ or TCC.

7. Left surgical ureteric margin; This is ureteric tissue showing carcinoma in

situ of the urothelium. There is no evidence of invasive malignancy.
SUMMARY: Radical cystectomy and lymphadenectomy; The appearances are those
of a

poorly differentiated solid transitional cell carcinoma invading the prostate

with regional node metastases. There is background carcinoma in situ and the
urethral and left ureteric surgical margins show carcinoma in situ (pT4 pN2 pr,
Tis).

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT
This report has been issued to give results of further scheduled tests.

Part 3 — Right externally iliac node; Immunohistochemistry confirms the area on
interest to be composed of lymphocytes expressing CD45. There is no cytokeratin
staining to suggest metastatic disease.

As such, the right external iliac node do not have any evidence of metastatic
disease.

Please note the summary diagnosis remains unchanged.
