Gross Description:

Specimen #1 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled left distal ureter and consists of a 0.4 x 0.2 cm tubular tissue
which is submitted in toto for frozen section diagnosis labeled FS1A. The frozen residue is submitted in the corresponding
cassette.

Specimen #2 is received in formalin labeled left pelvic lymph nodes and consists of a 5.0 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm aggregate of fat which is
palpated to reveal multiple nodes ranging from 0.1 cm to 3.0 cm in greatest dimension. The nodes are entirely submitted as
follows: '

2A: three possible nodes

28: two possible nodes

ZC-ZF: each cassette containing one bisected node

ZG-Zl: one trisected node

2J-2M: one serially sectioned node

2N: 1 bisected node

Specimen #3 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled right distal ureter and consists of a 0.6 x 0.4 cm tubular tissue
which is submitted in toto for frozen section diagnosis labeled FS3A. The frozen residue is submitted in the corresponding
cassette.

Specimen #4 is received in formalin labeled right pelvic lymph nodes and consists of a 5.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm aggregate of fat which is
palpated to reveal multiple possible nodes ranging from 0.3 cm to 3.5 cm in greatest dimension. The nodes are entirely submitted
as follows:

4A: four possible lobes

4B-4C: each cassette containing two nodes

4D-4G: each cassette containing one bisected node

4H-4l: one bisected node

4J—4K: one serially sectioned node

4L-4N: one serially sectioned node

Specimen #5 is received fresh labeled bladder and prostate and consists of a 12.5 x 11.0 x 5.0 cm bladder with attached 5.0 x 4.5
x 4.5 cm prostate. Extending from the prostatic urethra is a 35.0 x 0.7 cm catheter. Partially surfacing the posterior aspect is a 14.0
x 10.0 cm area of smooth peritoneum. Attached to the prostate are right and left vas deferens averaging 5.0 x 0.5 cm. The left
seminal vesicle measures 4.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm and the right seminal vesicle 4.5 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm. The right half of the specimen is
inked blue, the left half is inked black and the specimen is opened with a Y-shaped incision along the anterior aspect to reveal an
8.0 x 6.0 x 1.5 cm focally soft and necrotic papillary lesion involving the dome, posterior, anterior and left lateral wall of the bladder.
Noted on the prostate, at the bladder base, are several papiliary growths grossly not contiguous with the main mass measuring 1.0
cm in greatest dimension. Further sectioning reveals the mass effacing an area of muscle in the left lateral wall, focally possibly
invading into the adipose tissue, 0.3 cm from the posterior ink. The tumor does not grossly appear to involve the ureter. Serial
sectioning of the prostate reveals a 1.5 x 0.6 cm ill deﬁned tan lesion in the right apex towards the posterior aspect. grossly
abutting the inked capsule. Palpated are ﬁve possible nodes ranging from 0.1 cm to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. Note that
approximately 90% of the prostate is submitted. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

5A: possible urethral margin en face

58-50: perpendicular sections of right apical prostatic margin

5D—5E: perpendicular sections of left apical prostatic margin

5F—5G: bisected section of trigone with papillary growths near bladder base of prostate
5H: trigone with prostate to include papillary growths near prostatic bladder base
5|: right ureteral oriﬁce

5J: left ureteral oriﬁce

5K-5N: tumor to closest ink from left lateral wall (contiguous sections)

50: tumor to left lateral wall with possibly involved fat

5P: tumor to possibly involved vessel from left lateral wall

50-5T: tumor to closest invasion to posterior ink
5U-5V: tumor in dome

5W—52: tumor in anterior wall

5AA—5CC: right lateral wall

5DD-5ZZ: right prostate

5AAA-5WV: left prostate
5WWW-5XXX: bisected section of right prostate with seminal vesicle
5YYY-SZZZ: left prostate with seminal vesicle

5AAAA: right and left vas deferens margin
SBBBB: three possible nodes

SCCCC: one bisected node

5DDDD: one bisected node

Specimen #6 is received in formalin labeled left ureter-true margin and consists of a 1.5 x 0.6 cm tubular tissue with an attached
suture on one end. The specimen is entirely submitted as follows:

6A: sutured end
68: middle cross sections
6C: end opposing suture

Specimen #7 is received in formalin labeled right ureter-true margin and consists of a 2.3 x 0.4 cm tubular tissue sutured on one
end. The specimen is entirely submitted as follows:

7A: sutured end
78: middle cross sections
TC: and opposing suture

lntraogerative Consult Diagnosis
1A/FSDX: URETER NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

SAIGDX/FSDX: URETER WITH ACUTE INFLAMMATION AND REACTIVE CHANGES; NO TUMOR.
