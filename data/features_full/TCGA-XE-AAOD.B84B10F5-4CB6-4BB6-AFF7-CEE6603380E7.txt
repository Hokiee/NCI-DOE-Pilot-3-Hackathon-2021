ADDENDUM REPORT FOR

The choriocarcinoma is strongly positive by HCG and CAM5.2, while the
seminoma and the intratubular germ cell neoplasia are positive for c—
Kit. The seminoma is negative for CAM5.2 immunostains. The CD—3O is

negative.

These findings support the diagnoses:

1) MIXED GERM CELL TUMOR WITH SEMINOMA (80%), CHORIOCARCINOMA (20%)
right radical orchiectomy (see note)

2) TUMOR MEASURES 3 CM WITH AREAS OF NECROSIS AND HEMORRHAGE

3) TUMOR LIMITED TO TESTES

4) NO INVASION OF EPIDIDYMIS NOTED
5) LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION NOTED
