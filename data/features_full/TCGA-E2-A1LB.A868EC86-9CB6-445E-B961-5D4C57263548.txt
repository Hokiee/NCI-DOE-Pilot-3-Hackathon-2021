GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. WLE RIGHT BREAST

Received fresh labeled with matching patient identiﬁers is an oriented (short-superior, long-lateral) 124
g, 9.7 (medial to lateral) x 9 x 3 cm lumpectomy with a slender fragment of tan skin 2.8 x 0 .3 cm. The
specimen is inked as follows: anterior — blue, posterior - black, superior — red, inferior — orange, medial
— green, lateral — yellow. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 7 slices revealing
a 2.8 x 2.5 x 1.4 cm ill deﬁned ﬁrm tan mass approaching the closest posterior margin at 0.2 cm, and
superior margin at 0.5 cm. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

A1-A2: Perpendicular sections medial margin

A3-A4: Section 2 anterior

B. RIGHT AXILLARY CONTENTS

Received in formalin in a container labeled with matching patient identiﬁers is a portion of red yellow
ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 10.7 x 5.9 x 2.5 cm. Multiple possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging
in size from 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 up to 4 x 3.5 x 2 cm. Cassette summary:

B1-BS: Representative sections, largest lymph node

B4: Two possible lymph nodes

BS: Two possible lymph nodes

86: Four possible lymph nodes

B7: Four possible lymph nodes

BS: Two possible lymph nodes

39: Two possible lymph nodes

B10: Three possible lymph nodes

311-315: Additional possible lymph nodes

DIAGNOSIS:

A. BREAST, RIGHT, WIDE LOCAL EXCISION:
- INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, POORLY DIFFERENTIATED

(SBR’ GRADE 3), WITH APDéRINE FEATURES, AND SEVERAL FOCI OF
MICROINVASION ASSOCIATED WITH DCIS.

 

 

TSS:

- TUMOR MEASURES AT LEAST 3 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION.
- INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS 2 MM FROM THE DEEP MARGIN.
- EXTENSIVE LYMPHVASCULAR INVASION IS PRESENT.

- DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), SOLID TYPE, NUCLEAR GRADE 3.
WITH NECROSIS AND ASSOCIATED LYMPHOID INFILTRATE, INVOLVING
LOBULES.

- DCIS IS PRESENT AT THE LATERAL MARGIN, IS WITHIN 1 MM OF THE
ANTERIOR/MEDIAL AND ANTERIOR MARGIN, AND IS WITHIN 2 MM
OF THE DEEP MARGIN.

B. AXILLARY CONTENTS, RIGHT, DISSECTION:
- METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO 2 OF 25 LYMPH NODES WITH LARGEST
METASTASIS MEASURING 4 CM (2/25).
- NO EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IS SEEN.

ER/PR/HER2 Results

Performed on Case: This case - the largest lymph node with metastasis

 

Pathological staging (pTN): pT 2 N 1

SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS
Specimen: Surgical Excision
Block Number: 82 (Lymph node with metastasis)

 

ER: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0
PR: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0

 

COMMENT:

TSS

The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the
proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of
cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak
intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring
range from 0 to 8.

ER/PR positive is deﬁned as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is deﬁned as an Allred score
of less than or equal to 2.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
lmmunohistochemistry was oerforrned using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 105, 1:100) and PR (PGR
136, 1:100) provided by following the manufacturer 5 instructions. This
assay was not modiﬁed. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published
results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal
review of staining performance.

Fish Ordered: No
METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved HercepTest (TM) test kit s,

using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modiﬁed. External kit-slides

provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-
house known HER2 ampliﬁed control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well
preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identiﬁed for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2
immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided
by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.

This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from
ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. Pathology
Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
year-old woman, right breast, upper outer 4 cm mass, IDC, ER/PR negative; HER-2/neu positive,
WIth palpable adenopathy, here for lumpectomy and axillary lymph node dissection.

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right breast cancer
