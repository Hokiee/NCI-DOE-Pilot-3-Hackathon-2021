CLINICAL HISTORY
Right temporal tumor

OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES

Operation/Specimen: A: Brain, right temporal, excision biopsy
B: Brain, excision biopSy

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:
‘. and B. Brain, right temporal tumor, excisional biopsies: Glioblastoma (WHO

:ade IV} {see comment}.

COMMENT
Sections show a moderately pleomorphic glioma demonstrating frequent mitotic
figures, vascular proliferation and necrosis.

The tumor cells are diffusely p53 positive and the K—67 labeling index is
apprOXimately 40 to 50%.

MGMT promoter methylation and EGFRVIII assay results will be reported in
procedure addends.

MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA followed
by realmtime PCR amplification {MethyLight} of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences.
