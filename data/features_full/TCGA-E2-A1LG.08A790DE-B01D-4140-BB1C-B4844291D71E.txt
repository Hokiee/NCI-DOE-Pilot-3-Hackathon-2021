GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. SLN #1 RIGHT AXILLA
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "SLN #1 right axilla" is a piece of
ﬁbroadipose tissue, 4.5 x 3.1 x 1 cm. It is searched for lymph nodes. Four lymph nodes are identiﬁed
measuring 2.5 x 1.1 x 0 .6 cm. 1.5 x 1.1 x 1 cm, 0.6 x 0.4 x 0 .2 cm, and 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The 3
smaller lymph nodes are inked orange, green, and black; the lymph nodes are bisected and half of each
is submitted for frozen section diagnosis. Lymph nodes are submitted entirely:
FSA1: frozen section of 2 lymph nodes, bisected (1/2 of each)
FSA2: frozen section of 2 lymph nodes. bisected (1/2 of each)
A3: remainder of lymph nodes from FSA1
A4: remainder of lymph nodes from FSA2
B. RIGHT BREAST
Received fresh labeled with the patient‘s identiﬁcation and "right breast" is an oriented 16979, 38 x 30 x
3cm simple mastectomy with 23 x 20cm tan-brown skin ellipse and 1.3cm everted nipple. Ink code:
anterior-superior: blue, anterior-inferior: orange. posterior-black. The specimen is serially sectioned into
19 slices from lateral to medial with nipple in slice 10 revealing a 4cm area of scar tissue, with a 1cm
central previous biopsy site. 4.6cm from the deep margin in the UIQ of slice 12. The specimen is
radiographed and 3 biopsy clips are identiﬁed (in the UC of slice 10, and two in the UIQ of slice 12),
1.5cm from the closest anterior-superior margin in the UIQ of slice 12. A second possible 1 x 0.9 x
0.7cm previous biopsy site is identiﬁed in 3.8cm from the deep margin in the U00 of slice 7.

C. RIGHT BREAST UPPER OUTER QUADRANT
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "upper outer quadrant" is an oriented (suture
at ﬁnal anterior margin) 30 g, 11.3 x 3.7 x 0.9 cm ﬁbrofatty tissue. Final margin is inked black. Serial
sectioning reveals no discrete lesions. Representatively submitted in cassette C1-C3.
D. RIGHT BREAST LATERAL FLAP

 

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and ”right breast lateral ﬂap" is an oriented
(suture at ﬁnal anterior margin) 16 g, 6.6 x 3.9 x 1.2 cm ﬁbrofatty tissue. Final margin is inked black.
Sen‘al sectioning reveals no discrete lesions. Representatively submitted in cassettes 01-03.

E. LEFT BREAST AND AXILLARY TAIL

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and ”left breast and axillary tail" is an oriented
18449, 30 x 27 x 5cm modiﬁed radical mastectomy with 25 x 21cm tan-brown skin ellipse and 1.5cm
everted nipple. Ink code: anterior-superior: blue, anterior-inferior: orange, posteriopblack. The specimen
is serially sectioned into 13 slices from medial to lateral with nipple in slices 5-9 revealing a 4 x 3 x
2.8cm tan-white ﬁrm well-circumscribed mass in the U00 of slices 9-10, 3cm from the deep margin. A
dense ﬁrm ill-deﬁned ﬁbrous area 2cm in greatest dimension is identiﬁed in the UC of slice 6. 2.5cm
from the closest posterior margin. The axillary tail is 11 x 10 x 4cm. Dissection reveals 18 lymph nodes
ranging from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.20m to 1.4 x 1 x 1cm. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue
procurement. Representatively submitted:
