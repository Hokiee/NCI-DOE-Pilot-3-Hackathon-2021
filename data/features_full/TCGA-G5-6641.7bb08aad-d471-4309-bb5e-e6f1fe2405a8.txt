SPECIMENS:
A. SIGMOID COLON AND UPPER RECTUM
B. DISTAL DONUT
C. PROXIMAL DONUT

SPECIMEN(S):
A. SIGMOID COLON AND UPPER RECTUM
B. DISTAL DONUT
c. PROXIMAL DONUT

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. RECTOSIGMOID COLON
Received fresh is 7.5 cm segment of colon with a circumference of 6.2 cm. The proximal surgical
margin is stapled and the distal (designated by a suture) is received opened. Located 1.3 cm from the
distal margin is a polypoid tumor mass measuring 2 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm. The remainder of the mucosa is
free of masses or lesions. The distal margin is inked blue. The specimen is sectioned and the mass
appears to have superficial invasion. Tissue is procured; a photograph is taken. Representatively
submitted in:
A1: shave of proximal margin
A2-A6: entire mass including distal margin (perpendicular sections) and deep margin
A7: normal-appearing mucosa
A8-A14: lymph nodes
B. COLON DISTAL MARGIN
Received in formalin is a donut of pink-tan mucosa, 2.5 x 2.3 x 1.1 cm. Specimen is held intact by
staples. The mucosa has pinpoint areas of hemorrhage. After removal of staples specimen is
submitted entirely in cassette B1.
C. COLON PROXIMAL MARGIN
Received in formalin is a donut of pink-tan mucosa, 1.9 x 1.7 x 1.2 cm. H is held intact by blue suture
material. The mucosa is unremarkable. The specimen is submitted entirely in cassette Cf.

c. colon, PROXIMAL MARGIN, excision:
- colonic tissue, NO CARCINOMA SEEN
