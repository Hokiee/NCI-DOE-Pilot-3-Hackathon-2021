ADDENDA: ITCG

Addendum .
The combination immunohistochemical stain PIN4 (963, CK903, P5048) was performed on slide 3FF. The stain highlights

neoplastic glands located In the periprostatlc adipose tissue. These glands lack basal cells, and the cytoplasm is
highlighted by racemase. '

 

This result supports extracapsular extension, noted in the previously rendered report.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

PART 1: LYMPH NODES, RIGHT PELVIC, EXCISION -
NO EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASIA IN FOURTEEN LYMPH NODES (0H4).

PART 2: LYMPH NODES, LEFT PELVIC, EXCISION --
NO EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASIA IN TWENTY-ONE LYMPH NODES (0121).

PART 3: PROSTATE AND BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES, RADICAL PROSTATEC _
PROSTATE ADENOCARCINOMA. BOTH ACINAR AND DUCTAL TYPE, GLEASON SCORE 4 + 3 — 7.

THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT LOBES AND HAS A GREATEST NODULAR DIAMETER OF

1.9 CM IN ONE HISTOLOGIC SECTION.

THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES 15% OF THE EXAMINED PROSTATE VOLUME. .

THE CARCINOMA SHOWS EVIDENCE OF MULTIFOCAL EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IN THE LEFT ANTERIOR AND
POSTERIOR MID REGION OF THE PROSTATE (SLIDES 3U, 3FF, SGG), APPROXIMATELY 0.5 CM IN COMBINED
TOTAL DIMENSION. THE CARCINOMA IS ORGAN-CONFINED IN ALL OTHER REGIONS OF THE PROSTATE.
BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA. '

ALL EXAMINED SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA.

PERINEURAL INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

NO ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

HIGH GRADE PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA IS IDENTIFIED.

PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT3a N0 MX. ‘ -
