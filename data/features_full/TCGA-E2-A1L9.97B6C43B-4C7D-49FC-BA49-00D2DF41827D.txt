INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:

A-WLE right breast: Mass (1.4 x 1.2 x 1 cm) is 0.8 cm from the closest inferior margin.
TPB/TPC-sentinel lymph nodes #1 & #2 right axilla: Negative for tumor by touch prep.
Diagnoses called by Dr. to Dr. at '

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. WLE RIGHT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "WLE left breast needle localization" is a
previously inked, oriented (single-anterior, double-lateral, triple-superior) 53-9, 4 x 3.4 x 2.5 cm needle
localized lumpectomy with radiograph. ink code: Anterior-yellow, posterior-black, medial-green, lateral-
red, superior-blue, inferior—orange. Specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 7 slices
revealing a 1.4 x 1.2 x 1 cm ﬁrm, tan, stellate mass that is closest to the inferior margin at 0.8 cm.
Tissue is procured; Representatively submitted:
A1—A3: lateral margin, perpendicular sections
A4: slice 2, anterior inferior
A5: slice 3, anterior inferior
A6: slice 3, mid inferior (mass)
A7: slice 3, posterior inferior
A8: slice 4, anterior infeIior (mass)
A9: slice 4, posterior inferior (mass)
A10: slice 5, anterior superior
A11: slice 5, posterior superior
A12: slice 5, anterior inferior (mass)
A13: slice 5, posterior inferior (mass)
A14: slice 6, anterior inferior (mass)
A15: slice 6, posterior inferior (mass)
A16-A18: medial margin, perpendicular sections (muscle inﬁltrating the tissue)
B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 RIGHT AXILLA
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "sentinel lymph node #1 right axilla“ is a 4 x
2.3 x 1.5 cm lymph node; sectioned, it has a yellow-tan cut surface. A touch prep is performed;
submitted entirely in cassettes 81-82.
C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "sentinel lymph node #2" is a 3.4 x 3 x 0.4
cm lymph node; sectioned, it has a yellow-tan cut surface. Touch prep is performed; submitted entirely
in cassettes C1-C3.

DIAGNOSIS: -.
A. BREAST, RIGHT, WIDE LOCAL EXCISION:
- INyASIvEDUCTAL CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 2 WITH FOCAL NECROSIS, MEASURING 1.5-CM
- INTERMEDIATE NUCLEAR GRADE, DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, SOLID AND CRIBRIFORM
TYPES WITH CENTRAL NECROSIS
- SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR
- BIOPSY SITE CHANGES WITH FIBROSIS AND GRANULATION TISSUE
- SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT.

B. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #1, RIGHT AXILLA. EXCISION:
- METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE OF ONE LYMPH NODE (1/1), MEASURING 1.0-MM
(MICROMETASTASES) WITH NO EXTRANODAL EXTENSION, SEE NOTE.

C. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #2, RIGHT AXILLA, EXCISION:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1).

 

TSS:

NOTE: The touch preparation was reviewed, no tumor cells are identiﬁed. Therefore, the false
negativity is due to sampling error.
