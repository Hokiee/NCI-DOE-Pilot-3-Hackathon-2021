Final Diagnosis:
A, B. Brain, left temporal mass. CUSA and resection: Diffuscly inﬁltrative glioma with features most consistent
with low grade oligoastrocytoma (WHO grade 11). See comment.

Comment: This is an unusual case since the patient has a separate lesion in the opposite hemisphere (right
frontal), which has features quite similar on imaging and on biopsy demonstrated morphologic features of an
anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade III). The morphologic features of the 2 tumors will be compared upon
resection of the right frontal tumor, which is scheduled for ‘

lmmunohist'ochemical stains were performed on parafﬁn-embedded tissue using antibodies to GFAP, MIB-l and
p53. GFAP is positive in tumor cells, which have scant cytoplasm. p53 is variably expressed in over 50% of -
tumor cells. MIB-l labeling index varies fromvlow to moderate. The ﬁndings support the above diagnosis.

ADDENDA:
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies for lp19q deletion have been ordered on parafﬁn sections and
will be performed by the ‘
