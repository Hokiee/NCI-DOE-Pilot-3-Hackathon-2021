Surgical Pathology
SLIDE DISPOSITION:

DIAGNOSIS:

A. Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy

and bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy: FIGO grade 3 (of 3)
endometrial carcinoma: serousmtype, circumferentially
involving the

endometrial cavity from cervix to upper uterine fundus and
forming a

necrotic, friable, and exophytic mass (6.4 x 6.2 x 2.8
cm). The

tumor invades completely through the myometrium to uterine
serosal

soft tissues (1.7 cm of total myometrial thickness of 1.7
cm). The

tumor involves cervix/ endocervix. Lymphovascular space
invasion is

not identified. The margins are negative for tumor.
Multiple (2)

intramural leiomyomata (each 1.5 cm in greatest
dimension).

B. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, lymphadenectomy: One (of
20) left

pelvic lymph node is positive for a microscopic focus of
metastatic

serous carcinoma.

C. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(15) right

pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

F. Lymph nodes, right para—aortic, lymphadenectomy:
Multiple (9)

right para—aortic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.
G. Lymph nodes, left para-aortic, lymphadenectomy:
Multiple (11)

left para—aortic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.
D. Omentum, omentectomy: Negative for tumor.

E. Appendix, appendectomy: Benign appendix.

H. Diaphragm, right, biopsy: Negative for tumor.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3aN1] (7th
edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic

examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation
of the

specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent
sections are

reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive
changes

identified on permanent section review will be reflected
in a

revised report.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received fresh labeled "uterus, bilateral fallopian

tubes and
ovaries" is a 165.0 gram uterus with attached bilateral
tubes and

ovaries. The uterine serosa is smooth. There is a 6.4 x
6.2 x 2.8

cm exophytic friable mass filling the endometrial cavity
grossly

invading 1.7 cm. The myometrial thickness is 1.7 cm.
There are 2

leiomyomata, averaging 1.5 cm in greatest dimension.
There is a 2.5

x 1.9 x 0.7 cm right ovary with a smooth outer surface and
a solid

cut surface with a 9.4 x 0.4 cm right fallopian tube which
has

multiple paratubal cysts. There is a 2.1 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm
left ovary

with a smooth outer surface which is unremarkable and a
solid cut

surface. Representative sections are submitted.

B. Received fresh labeled "left pelvic nodes" is a 9.0 x
4.0 x 1.5

cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. Lymph nodes
submitted.

C. Received fresh labeled "right pelvic nodes" is a 10.0
x 6.5 x

 

 

 

 

 

0.5 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. Lymph
nodes
submitted.

D. Received fresh labeled "omentum" is a 53.0 x 5.5 x 1.0
cm

portion of omentum. No masses are identified grossly.
One possible

lymph node is identified. Representative sections are
submitted.

E. Received fresh labeled "appendix" is a 7.0 x 0.6 cm
appendix

with smooth serosa. There is no gross perforation. The
lumen

contains no fecalith. Representative sections submitted.

F. Received fresh labeled "right para—aortic nodes" is a
15.5 x 1.4

x 0.3 cm cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.
Lymph nodes

submitted.

G. Received fresh labeled "left para-aortic nodes" is a
4.0 x 4.0 x

2.0 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. Lymph
nodes

submitted.

H. Received fresh labeled "right diaphragm biopsy" is a
0.4 x 0.3 x

0.3 cm portion of red-tan soft tissue. All submitted.
