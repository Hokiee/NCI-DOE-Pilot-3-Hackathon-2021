Molggglgr Anatomic Pathologv Testjm
Block 20:

A. KRAS :20an 12M 3 mutation IDENTIFIED {Glyi 2Vai).
Note:
The quantity and quality of ioolatod DNA was acceptable for testing.

‘Ihe predictive value of KRAS mutation in colorectal cancer patients treated with cetuximab (anti-EGFR monoclonal
antibody) chemotherapy has recently been reported 1. Mutations in the KRAS codon 12113 gona were found to be
associated with resistance to cetuximab therapy, worse prognosis and poor survival in patients with metastatic colorectal
cancer. N However. not all tumors reveal such a correlation, therefore the presence of KRAS mutations should be
interpmted in the context of the cvtoiouic and histolonic findings and the patients clinical history.

Addendum
Moiecular Anatomic Pathology Tasting:
Block 2D:

A. No microsatelilte instability detected (Mlcrosateiiite stable}.
Note: -- ‘ ‘ , .
The five NC] rocommended dinuclooticle and mononucleotide polymorphisms wer_e utilinod to assess fur microsatolllte
instability (MSI) by PCR, Nona of five markers showed evidence of microsatellite instability.

High~lnvel MSI may have prognostic impiicationS, and patiantn with these tumors may be at risk for Heroditnry None
Polypnsis Colorectal Carcinoma syndrome (HNPCC or Lynch $yndromo)(i~ﬁ}. Genetic testing for germline mutations .
associated with that syndrome is indicated in patients with high-level Mgl. after appropriate-informed cansent and genetic
counseling (1). If clinical suspicion for HNPCC Is very high, genetic testing may be oopropnate even in cases With
microontollito stable lesions.
