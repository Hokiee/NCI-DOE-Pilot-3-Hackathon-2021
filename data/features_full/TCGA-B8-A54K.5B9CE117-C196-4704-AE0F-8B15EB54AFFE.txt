Description of kidney away from tumor: Pale tan, firm
unremarkable renal parenchyma

Hilar lymph nodes: Not available for observation
Other significant findings: None

Tissue submitted for special investigations: Tumor is submitted
to tissue procurement foundation.

Digital picture: None taken

Block Summary:
Al—A3 — Representative sections
Tissue remains in container.

Specimen B is additionally labeled "fat overlying tumor" and
holds a fragment of

yellow adipose tissue measuring 5.5 x 5.1 x 2.8 cm. The specimen
is serially .

sectioned to reveal unremarkable lobulated yellow adipose
tissue. No masses are

identified. Representative sections are submitted in blocks Bl-
B3. Tissue

remains in container.

Light Microscopy:

Light microscopic examination is performed by Dr. Sections of
the renal mass show a clear cell neoplasm with focal papillary
architecture, without psammoma bodies to suggest Xpll
translocation carcinoma. Features are interpreted as clear cell
carcinoma. Dr. concurs.
