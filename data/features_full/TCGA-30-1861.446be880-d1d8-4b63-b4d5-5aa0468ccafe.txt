O.R. CONSULTATION:

SPECIMEN LABELED "#2 OMENTAL TUMOR” {FSA}:
Metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma.

qmmewm

SPECIMEN LABELED "#3 RIGHT ADNEXAL MASS" (FSB):
Poorly differentiated carcinoma, consistent with papillary serous

carcinoma.
GROSS DESCRIPTION: F
The specimen is receive resh, in 7 parts, each labeled with the patient's
name and unit number.

Part 1, "rectus muscle", consists of a single fragment of red/tan muscle (2.5 x
1.4 x 0.6 cm). The entire specimen was submitted for special studies from the

frozen section lab.

Part 2, "omental tumor —- consists of a single piece of fibroadipose tissue

 

 

  

(3.0 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm) with a 0.8 cm white, firm nodule. Representative sections
of the nodule were submitted as "FSA".

Micro l — FSA remnant, l frag, {CGA_3D_1861
Micro 2 — omental tumor, 1 frag

Part 3, "right adnexal mass", consists of a firm, white, ovoid mass (7.0 x 2.5
x 3.0 cm) with a focally granular surface and soft, white, solid interior.

No areas of hemorrhage or focal necrosis are seen within the ovoid mass.
Additionally, several fragments of blood clot and soft tissue, ranging in size
from 2.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm up to 4.0 x 2.0 x 0.6 cm were present. Representative
sections of the ovoid mass were submitted as “FSB” and additional tissue was
sent to the tissue bank for special studies from the frozen section lab.

Micro 3 — FSB remnant, 1 frag, -
Micro 4—5 - tumor, 2 frags_

Part 4, "additional right adnexal tumor", consists of a pink/tan, fimbriated
fallopian tube (3.5 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter) and an attached ovary
(2.0 x 1.8 x 0.7 cm). The surface of the Ovary is white and smooth with a
single clear fluid—filled cyst. No tumor is grossly visible on either the
ovary or the fallopian tube. The entire specimen is submitted for histologic

evaluation.

Micro 8—9 ~ right ovary, multiple frags,‘

Part 5, "left tube and ovary with tumor", consists of a brown/tan segment of
fimbriated fallopian tube (3.0 cm in length by 0.6 cm in diameter) with an
attached ovary (1.7 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm). Also firmly attached to the fallopian
tube is a white/tan, firm nodule (3.0 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm). The tumor is grossly

similar to that submitted in part 3. Representative sections of tumor and
associated adnexal structures are submitted for histologic evaluation.

Micro 10 — tumor & associated soft tissue, 1 frag

Micro 11—13 — fallopian tube, multiple fra s,

Micro 14 - ovary, multiple frags, i

Part 6, "uterus and cervix", consists of a 179 uterus and attached cervix (5.4
x 3.5 x 2.4 cm). The exocervix (1.7 x 1.5 cm) has a smooth, glistening mucosal
surface with a 0.4 cm external 05. The endocervix (1.2 cm in length by 0.4 cm
in width) has a smooth, tan herringbOne—like mucosal surface. The endometrial
cavity (1.0 cm from cornu to cornu by 2.3 cm in length by 0.2 cm in thickness}
is tan/brown and smooth and is distorted by the presence of an intramural
leiomyoma (1.0 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm) deep to the posterior side, near the left horn
of the uterus. The myometrium has a maximum thickness of 0.9 cm. The serosal
surface is unremarkable.

Part 7, "tumor from cul de sac", consists of multiple fragments of firm,
white/tan soft tissue (ranging in size from 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm up to 5.5 x
4.0 x 2.7 cm) with a diffusely hemorrhagic, granular surface. The tissue is
grossly similar to that submitted in part 3.
