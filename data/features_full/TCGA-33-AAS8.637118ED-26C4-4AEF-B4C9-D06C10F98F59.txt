INTERPRETATION AND DIAGNOSIS:

l. LUNG, RIGHT UPPER LOBE, POSTERIOR SEGMENT (WEDGE RESECTION}:
MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA (2. 5 CM) . THE
CARCINOMA EXTENDS SUBPLEURALLY AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH RETRACTION AND

SCARRING OF THE OVERLYING PLEURA. THE PARENCHYMAL LUNG MARGIN IS
NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. SEE NOTE.

NOTE: The pathologic stage of the tumor is TlNOMX.

2. LYMPI-I NODES, R4 (DISSECTION): ONE (1) LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR
TUMOR.

3. LYMPH NODES, 410 (DISSECTION): ONE (1) LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR
TUMOR.

4. LYMPH NODES, STATION 7 (DISSECTION) : ONE (1) LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE
FOR TUMOR.

5. LYMPH NODE, R11 (DISSECTION) : ONE (1) LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR
TUMOR.

PART #1: RIGHT UPPER LOBE
Resident Pathologist:

The specimen is received fresh labeled w and designated
right upper lobe. It consists of one grossly identifiable fragment

of fleshy hemorrhagic tissue consistent with lung. A long black
suture which does not designate anything in particular is attached to
the specimen. The specimen weighs 66 grams and measures 10 x 6.5 x 4
cm. A palpable mass is identified in the parenchyma. The overlying
pleura is inked with black ink. Serially sectioning the lung reveals
a 2.5 cm tumor mass that is white tan and firm around the edges and
slightly necrotic and hemorrhagic in the center. Tumor and normal
lung are collected for the tumor bank and for 7 lab for
further studies. A tied off vessel is grossly identified. This
vessel is sampled and assumed to be a vascular margin. A long
parenchymal staple margin is grossly identified in the specimen in the
shape of a Y. This margin measures 9 cm at its longest aspect and
there is also an arm of the staple margin that measures 4.2 cm. The
tumor mass appears to grossly abut the pleura. However, the tumor
mass is located approximately 1.6 cm from the closest staple margin.
This staple margin is shaved and submitted in its entirety. The shave
suture margin is submitted in cassettes B-D. Sections are taken of
the tumor mass. Sectioning through the remainder of the lung
parenchyma does not reveal any other mass lesions. Sections of normal
lung are submitted. Additionally received with the specimen is a small
fragment of rib. This rib measures 2.1 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm. Adherent
fibrous tissue is identified on the outer aspect of the rib. Focal
areas of blood clot are also identified on the outer surface of the
rib. No gross abnormalities are identified. No sections are
submitted. The rib is a gross diagnosis only.
