MOLECULAR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY TESTING:

Block 1 D:

A. Mutations in BRAF, NHASGL HFlASB1, KRAS12/13 NOT identified.
8. FISH test results are negative for BET/PTO rearrangement.

NOTE:
DNA was extracted in the amount sufficient for testing.

BACKGROUND: _ ' _
Mutations in either BFlAF or HAS genes or RET/PTC rearrangements are found in more than 70% of papillary thyroId carcrnomas
(1). BFlAF V600E ) mutation has been associated with more aggressive behavior of papillary carcinoma (2, 3). The
association between BFlAF V600E mutation and features of tumor aggressiveness have also been observed In palelary '
microcarcinomas (4). Mutations in the HAS genes or PAXB/PPARg rearrangement occur in ~70% of follicular thyrord carcmomas
and with lower frequency in oncocytic (Hiirthle cell) carcinomas (5). Regarding the speciﬁcity of these mutatIons for cancer, BRAF
V600E mutation and FtET/PTC and PAXS/PPARg rearrangements are overall specific for malignancy in the thyroid, although they
have been reported with a very low frequency in benign thyroid lesions (6). HAS mutations occur in malignant and benIgn thyroid
tumors, being found in ~40-50% of follicular and anaplastic carcinomas, 30-40% of follicular adenomas and 10-15% of palelary
carcinomas (6). ' ' . .

MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS:
For parafﬁn-embedded surgical specimens. manual mlcrod/ssectlon was performed to collect tumor tissue. Specimens with the minimum of 50% of
tumor cells in a microdissection target are accepted for the analysis. Optical density readings were obtained. Real-time PCH was performed on the
' , platform to amplify BRAF codons 599-601, NRAS codon 61, HRAS codon 61, and KRAS codons 12/13 sequences. Post-PCP melting
curve analysis was used to detect possible mutations. lf required, the mutation type was conﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing of the PCFI product on
DNA from samples positive for each of these mutations was used as positive controls. Amplification at 35 cycles or earlier was

considered suffrbient for the analysis. The limit of detection is approximately 10-20% of alleles with mutation present In the background of normal
DNA.

RESULTS:

RET/PTO: The targeted area of the tissue showed 4(6.6%) of the cells with the rearrangement pattern and 57(93.4%) of the cells
with the normal pattern. The targeted area is considered NOT rearranged for the FlET/PTC region.

The RET/PTOi' Probe did not contain the rearrangement pattern.

RET/FTC Methodology Description:

Probe: RET/PTO Probe (10q11.2) and HET/PTC1 Dual-Color Fusion Probe 10q11.2-10q21

Probe Description: The FiET probe (labeled " l) is a 207 kb DNA probe located at band 10q11.2.

The H4 and 369 probes are approximately tuuno eacn (labeled in F ‘ “ ‘, and are located at band 10q21.

RET/PTO rearrangement is suggested to be present when three RET signals are identiﬁed in greater than 8% of the analyzed
cells. .
FiET/PTC1 rearrangement detection is as follows: Normal cells without the RET/PTCI rearrangement show two pair of green and
orange signals separated. Cells with the RET/PTOi rearrangement show two pair of signals (green and orange) in juxtaposition
and one green and one orange signal separated in greater than 8% of analyzed cells within the targeted area.

RET/FTC F lSH analysis was manually performed and quantitatively assessed by analysis of a minimum of 60 cells using the PTC
(369/H4) SpectrumOrange and the RET SpectrumGreen probes.
