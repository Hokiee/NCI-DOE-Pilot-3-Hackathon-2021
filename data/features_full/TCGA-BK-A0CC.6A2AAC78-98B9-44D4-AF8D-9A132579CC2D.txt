CLINICAL NOTES
PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Endometrial cancer.
HISTORY: Endometrial and cervical biopsies papillary serous
adenocarcinoma.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS
A - There is tumor present in both the endometrium and cervix,
cannot be certain on frozen section if separate processes or part
of
same process. There is both invasion and areas of high—grade
carcinoma. [** **]

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Received fresh for frozen section and tissue
procurement labeled "uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and
ovaries, bilateral parametria, upper vagina" is a 100 gm., 4.7 x
4.0
GROSS DESCRIPTION
x 4.0 cm. symmetrical uterine corpus with attached 3 cm. cervix and
bilateral adnexa. The serosa is smooth to scabrous tan pink-red.
The pericervical soft tissue margin is inked blue. The 4.0 x 3.8
cm. tan white ectocervix surrounds a patulous 2.5 x 1.0 cm. os. A
rubbery tan red polypoid lesion protrudes from the os. On opening
the posterior cervix contains an irregular, 3.5 x 2.0 cm. rubbery
tan pink-red lesion. On sectioning the lesion is glistening tan
white and appears to measure up to 1.3 cm. in thickness. The
lesion
appears to extend to within 0.8 cm. of the inked peripheral margin
of the cervix. A rim of apparent tan white vaginal mucosa
circumferences the ectocervix. The triangular, 4.0 x 3.2 cm.
uterine cavity contains tan white tumor predominating within the
fundus both anteriorly and posteriorly. On sectioning, the lesion
has a maximal thickness of 1.1 cm. and appears confined to the

upper
50% of the myometrium. Frozen sections are performed of cervix
(F51) and endometrium (F82). A portion of tumor from the cervical
area is retrieved for tissue procurement in addition to normal
endometrium. The myometrium is tan pink and measures up to 1.8 cm.
in thickness. A few well circumscribed rubbery whorled tan white
subserosal and intramural leiomyomata averaging 0.6 cm. in greatest
dimension are present. Bilaterally, the rubbery tan pink—gold
ovaries average 2.0 x 1.8 x 0.7 cm. Ovarian stroma is pale tan

with
identifiable corpora albicantia. The fimbriated pink purple right
and left fallopian tubes average 5.3 cm. in length and 0.6 cm. in
diameter with pinpoint stellate lumina. Representative sections
including the vaginal cuff margin and parametrial tissue are
submitted in 25 blocks as labeled. RS-25

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - vaginal cuff margin, 12 to 3 o'clock; 2 -

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
A. The entire endometrium, lower uterine segment and
endocervix are occupied by papillary serous carcinoma. A
rare psammoma body is noted. The tumor infiltrates just greater
than one half of the cervical stroma (57%) and just over one half
of
the myometrium (54%). It is difficult to know with certainty
whether this originated within the endometrium or the endocervix.
In
the template below, it is being treated as an endometrial primary
since these tumors are more frequent in this location. Please see
the template below:

HiSt°1°gi° tYPe= MW

Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Myometrial invasion:
6 mm. depth of invasion
11 mm. depth of myometrial thickness
54% of myometrial wall
Cervix: Also contains invasive carcinoma to a depth of 8 mm. with

maximal stromal thickness of 14 mm. (57%).

Primary tumor (pT) TNM: pT3b

Margins of resection: Tumor noted within vaginal stroma at margin

of resection.

Vascular invasion: Not detected.

Regional lymph nodes (pN): As per parts C through F, metastatic

disease is present to 2 of 17 lymph nodes, [**‘ **], le.

Distant metastasis (pM): Cannot be assessed.

other findings: Adenomyosis and leiomyomata of the uterus. Right

and left ovaries and fallopian tubes, bilateral parametria all
negative for tumor.
