GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received unfixed in seven parts.

dissection. The specimen is arbitrarily divided into 3 equal levels
and

potential lymph nodes are dissected out.

cm of

the left base of tongue edge, 0.4 cm of the medial base of tongue edge,
0.3 cm

pyriform

sinus and comes to within 0.5 cm of the margin. The lesion also at the
left

pyriform sinus and comes to within 1 cm of the sinus margin. The
lesion

inked

anterior soft tissue margin. The lesion comes to within 0.1~cm the
entire

bone bed. The epiglottis is almost entirely obliterated by the lesion.
The

lesion grossly does not extend to either the right or left false cords

cartilage is grossly uninvolved. The right false cord mucosa is
slightly

granular with no lesion is grossly identified.

The vocal cords and remaining laryngeal mucosa is tan—gray, soft and
grossly

'88 regulations. The testing has not been cleared or approved for the
specific use by the 0.8. Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA has
determined such approval is not necessary for clinical use. Tissue
fixation

ranges from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 84 hours.
This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments of 1988 ("CLIA") as qualified to perform high—complexity
