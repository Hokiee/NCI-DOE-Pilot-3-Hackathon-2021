Clinical Information

PREaOP DIAGNOSIS: Lung cancer
POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: Same
TYPE OF PROCEDURB:right VATS. lymphadenectomy

Gross Dgcription
Specimen is receimd in 5 parts:

A.The specimen is labeled "LEVEL VII" and is received in formalin. It consists of 3 black tan lymph nodes ranging from 0.6 x 0.5 x
0.3-0.8 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm. Entirely submitted in cassette Al.

B. The specimen is labeled "HILAR LYMPH NODE" and is received in formalin. It consists of a single black tan lymph node
measuring 1.2 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. Entirely submitted in cassette Bl.

C. The specimen is labeled "IEVEL II" and is received in formalin, It consists of 6 black tan lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 x 0.5 x
0.3-1.5 x 0.7 x 05 cm. Entirely submitted as follows

C1 = 5 lymph nodes

C2 = largest lymph node. bisected

D. The specimen is labeled "LEVEL IV" and is received in formalin. It consists of 2 lymph nodes measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.3-1.0 x 0.5
x 0.3 cm. Entirely submitted in cassette Dl.

E. The specimen is labeled "RIGHT UPPER LOBE" and is received in formalin. It consists of a lobe of the lung measuring 15 x 12 x
6 cm and weighing 270 g. The pleural surface is pink-purple and smooth. The soft tissue margin and bronchial margin of resection are
stapled shut. On section the cut surface shows 2.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm an ill—deﬁned gray-tan mass is noted which is 6 cm away from the
bronchial margin of resection. This mass is located in subpleurally. The pleura overlying this mass is inked black and covered with
smooth surface without any papillary excrescences. A remaining portion of the lung shows dark red congested parenchyma without
other lesions. At the hilum lymph node is not identiﬁed. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

E1: mass for further study

E2 = bronchial margin and blood vessel margin of resection

E3 = soft tissue margin of resection

E4435 = remaining entire mass

E6 :1 random section of lung

Specimen is in formalin more than 6 hours and less than 48 hours
