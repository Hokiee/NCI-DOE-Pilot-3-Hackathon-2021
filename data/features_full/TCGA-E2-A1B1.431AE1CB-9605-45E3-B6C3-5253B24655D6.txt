CLINICAL HISTORY:
yr old white female abnormal mammogram left upper outer breast. Cone Biopsy Shows well
differentiated inﬁltrating ductal carcinoma with mucinous features. ER+, Pr+ HER2+ by FISH
Right breast MRI showed mass at left upper outer quadrant 3x3x0.8cm. Second enhancing mass at
posterior aspect 7mm measurement. Questionable satellite lesion.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:

predominantly fat.

TPC, TPD: Lymph nodes, left axillary sentinel 3 & 4, excision: No malignancy identiﬁed.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 1:
- Received fresh for touch-prep and labeled, Sentinel Lymph Node #1, Left" is a piece of adipose tissue

measuring 2.4x2x.4cm. It is bisected and a touch-prep is performed. Specimen is submitted in toto in
block A1.

' B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 2:

TSS:

- Received in formalin and labeled "Sentinel Lymph Node #2, Left Axilla" is a lymph node with fat
measuring 2x3.5x1.1cm. Bisected. A touch-prep is performed and lymph node is submitted in toto in
block Bl.

C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 3:
- Received in formalin and labeled Sentinel Lymph Node #3, Left Axilla" is a tan lymph node measuring
1.3x1.2x0.6cm. Bisected and a touch-prep is performed. Submitted in toto in block C1

D. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 4:

- Received fresh for touch-prep and labeled, Sentinel Lymph Node #4, Left Axilla” is a piece of yellow-
tan fat and a tan lymph node measuring 1.5x1.2x0.3cm. It is bisected and a touch-prep is performed.
Specimen is submitted in toto in block D1.

E. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 5:

- Received fresh for touch-prep and labeled, Sentinel Lymph Node #5, Left Axilla" is a piece of fat and a
tan lymph node measuring 2.3x1.5x0.7cm. The Specimen is serially sectioned and touch-prep is
performed. Lymph node is submitted in toto in block E1-E2.

F. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 6:

- Received fresh for touch-prep and labeled, Sentinel Lymph Node #6, Left Axilla" is a piece of yellow-
tan adipose tissue containing a lymph node measuring 1.5x0.7x0.5cm. The lymph node is bisected and
a touch-prep is performed. The lymph node is submitted in toto in block F1.

G. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 7:

- Received fresh for touch-prep and labeled, Sentinel Lymph Node #7, Left Axilla" is a piece of yellow-
tan fat containing a lymph node measuring 1.0x9.0x4cm. It is bisectioned and a touch-prep is
performed. Specimen is submitted in toto in block G1.

H. WLE LEFT BREAST

- Received fresh and labeled, Wide Local Excision, Left Breast with Needle Localization" is an oval
shaped piece of yellow-tan ﬁbrofatty soft tissue Weighing 161 grams and measuring 9.2x8.1x3.2cm.
The specimen is received with an accompanying radiogram which shows a needle coursing from the
medial aspect to the lateral aspect. The needle is a stellate area of increased density and a surgical
clip is present. The specimen has been oriented in surgery with short designating superior long lateral
and looped anterior. Specimen is inked as follows: inferior-orange, superior-red, lateral-yellow,
anterior-blue, medial-green and posterior black. Specimen is serially sectioned from superior to inferior
and in the inferior aspect of the specimen is an irregularly shaped ﬁrm pink-tan mass measuring
3.7x3.5x1.5cm. Areas of hemorrhage are seen. The mass is within 1.1cm from the lateral margin,
1.2cm from the anterior margin, 2.2cm from the medial margin, 1.7cm from the deep margin, 1.7cm
from the inferior margin and approximately 4.4cm from the superior margin. Superior and slightly
posterior from this mass is a ﬁrm tan nodule measuring 0.7cm which is located 0.8cm from the larger
mass. It is possible that it is a continuous mass located 1.2cm from the lateral margin, 3.7cm from the
anterior margin, 1.3cm from the posterior margin and 4.8cm from the medial margin. This mass
corresponds with the increased area of density and second needle localization which is present on the
radiogram which is shown superior to the larger mass. Representative sections are submitted as
follows: H1-H6 larger mass including adjacent margins; H7-H8 breast tissue between larger mass and
smaller mass; H9 smaller mass; H10-H13 additional ﬁbrous breast tissue; H14 superior margin; H15
inferior margin.

l. ADDITIONAL MARGIN LEFT BREAST:

- Received in formalin and labeled , Additional Margin Left Breast. This Marks New Inferior Margin" is
an irregularly shaped piece of yellow-tan ﬁbrofatty breast tissue measuring 4.7x4.7x0.8cm. There is a
stitch present marking the new inferior margin. The margin is inked blue and serially sectioned. On
sectioning little ﬁbrous tissue is seen and no masses or lesions are found. Specimen is submitted in
toto in blocks l1-l10.

COMMENT:

Review of the original touch prep, for sentinel lymph node #2, shows a single minute focus of metastatic
tumor cells. The metastatic deposit in sentinel lymph node #2 measures 4mm in greatest diameter, and
shows approximately 1mm of extracapsular extension focally. Gross examination of the left breast wide
local excision shows an irregularly shaped 3.7x3.5x1.5cm lesion, which is grossly away from the

O

TSS: .

margins of excision. On gross examination, there is a separate ﬁrm nodule which measures 0.7cm in

diameter which is near the larger tumor mass. Examination of microscopic sections, in the intervening
breast between these two nodules, however shows continuity of the 2nd smaller nodule with the larger
mass, consistent with an irregular, dumbbell Shaped single lesion. This patient had ER, PR and HER2

lHC performed on her prior needle core biopsy 0. These results were ER positive, PR positive and
HER2 was found to be ampliﬁed by FISH.
