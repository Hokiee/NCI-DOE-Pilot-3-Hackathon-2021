2. The specimen is received fresh for intraoperative consultation and is labeled “Additional right paratracheal node”. it consists of
multiple pieces of tan pink soft tissue, measuring 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. Three lymph nodes are identiﬁed, measuring

3). The specimen is received fresh. labeled "total thyroideclomy stitch marks right lobe of thyroid" and consists of a thyroid
weighing 14.5 g. The right lobe measures 5.2 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm , the left lobe measures 3.2 x1.8 x 1.2 cm and the isthmus measures
1.7 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm. The external surface is covered by a thin fibrous capsule. A 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm portion of skeletal muscle is
attached to the lower right pole. The posterior surface of the specimen is inked black. and the anterior is inked blue. Sectioning of
the right lobe reveals 2 nodules in the mid to lower pole. abutting each other. The larger nodule (N1) is 1.5 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm solid
whitish, well circumscribed. The smaller nodule (N2) is 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. light brown, solid. well circumscribed. Sectioning of the
left lobe reveals 2 nodules. One nodule is 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm, solid, present in the mid pole (N1L). Second nodule is 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3
cm. solid. well circumscribed. abutting the posterior capsule in the mid aspect. The remaining thyroid parenchyma is red beefy and
vaguely nodular. Representative sections from both nodules on the right are submitted for TPS. The remaining tissue is serially
sectioned and entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:

N1 - larger nodule, right lobe (both nodules in block 1)
N2 - smaller nodule. right lobe
