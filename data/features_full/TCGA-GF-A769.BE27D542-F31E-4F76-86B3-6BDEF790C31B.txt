Gross Description:

Received in formalin, labeled "right calf mass" is a 15.3 x

8.3 cm tan, wrinkled skin ellipse excised to a depth of 2.8 cm. There is a

central 12.2 x 11.1 x 7.4 cm tan-gray to brown nodular, fungating well

delineated mass, which comes to within 2.4 cm from the nearest skin margin. This
mass on sectioning is tan to red, firm, heterogeneous. focally hemorrhagic and
partially necrotic (5%), coming to within 2.9 cm from the inked deep margin.
Located 1.2 cm from this mass is a 6.1 x 3.4 x 2.5 cm tan to red, irregular.

from the nearest inked skin margin. This mass on sectioning is tan-gray to red,
ﬁrm, heterogeneous, well delineated, partially necrotic (5%), coming to within
1.1 cm from the inked deep soft tissue margin. No other lesions are identiﬁed
on sectioning.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:
1 tips;
2 inked deep margin taken perpendicular;
3-8 larger mass;
9 satellite lesion to nearest inked skin margin;
10 satellite mass to inked deep soft tissue margin.
