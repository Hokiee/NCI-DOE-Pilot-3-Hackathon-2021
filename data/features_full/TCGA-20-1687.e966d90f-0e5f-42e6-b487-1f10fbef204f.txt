Gross Description:
Received in ten parts.
Source of tissue: 1. Cytology.

Source of tissue: 2. Labeled #2, "left tube and ovary"

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled " patient name and medical number, left
tube and ovary" corisists of a 65 gram, 5.9 x 5 x 3.3 cm tan—pink

hemorrhagic ovarian mass with a 5.5 x 0.5 cm red-tan hemorrhagic fallopian

tube with ﬁrnbriated end. The mass is inked black and sectioned to reveal

a tan papillary mass involving approximately 95% of the ovary. The mass

does not grossly appear to invade the wall. Multiple cysts ranging from 1

em up to 3 cm are ﬁlled with a yellow thickened material. Sectioning of

the fallopian tube reveals tan mildly hemorrhagic cut surfaces with a

pinpoint lumen. Representative sections are submitted as designated for
microscopic evaluation.

Designation of Sections: 2A bisected fimbriated end and cross sections of
fallopian tube. 2B~2D random ovarian tumor.

Intraoperative Consultation: CARCINOMA PRESENT FAVOR OVARIAN PRIMARY
PSAMMA BODIES AND PAPILLARY CANCER.

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled " patient name and medical number, right
tube and ovary" consists of a 79 gram, 7.5 x 4.5 x 4 cm tan~pinl<

hemorrhagic ovarian mass with a 5 x 0.5 cm red—tan hemorrhagic fallopian

tube with firnbriated end. The mass is inked black and sectioned to reveal

 

 

TEGA—ZU-lﬁﬁl

a tan papillary mass involving approximately 95% of the ovary. A piece of
the mass is frozen and submitted in cassette 3FS for microscopic
evaluation. The tumor grossly appears to invade the wall. Sectioning of
the fallopian tube reveals tan hemorrhagic cut surfaces with a pinpoint
lumen. Representative sections are submitted as designated for
microscopic evaluation.

Designation of Sections: 3FS frozen section. 3A — bisected ﬁmbriated
end and cross sections of fallopian tube. 3B—3D random ovarian tumor.

Source of tissue: 4. Labeled #4, "uterus, cervix and uterosacral
ligaments"

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled " patient name and medical number,
uterus, cervix and uterosacral ligaments" consists of a 124 gram, 6 x 5.2

x 4 cm red-tan hemorrhagic uterus with attached cervix 3 X 2.6 cm. The
exocervix is tan—pink hemorrhagic and smooth with a 0.5 cm patent 08.
There is a 3.5 x 3 X 2 our firm nodule on the anterior surface. The nodule

is inked black, the specimen is opened to reveal a tan-pink mildly
trabeculated endocervix, a tan-pink hemorrhagic myometrium averaging 2.4
cm and a tan—pink mildly hemorrhagic endometrium averaging 0.1 cm. The
specimen is sectioned and the mass on the anterior surface appears to
involve the myornetrium. The remainder of the cut surface is tan-pink
trabeculated and hemorrhagic. Representative sections are submitted as
designated for microscopic evaluation.

Designation of Sections: 4A right uterosacraliigament. 4B ieft
uterosacralligament. 4C anterior cervix. 4D posterior cervix. 4E
anterior full thickness. 4F anterior full thickness with tumor. 4G
tumor. 4H posterior full thickness.

appendix" consists of a 4.5 x 0.3 cm tan—red hemorrhagic appendix with
attached mesoappendix. Multiple ﬁrm nodules are grossly identiﬁed at

the distal end of the specimen. Sectioning reveals a wall thickness

averaging 0.1 cm, a pinpoint lumen and a velvety mucosa. The entire
specimen is submitted for microscopic evaluation.
