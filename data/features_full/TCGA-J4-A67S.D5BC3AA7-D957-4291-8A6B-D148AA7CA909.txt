prostatectomy specimen weighs 40 gram prostate gland with
attached seminal vesicle and vas deferens. The prostate gland
measures 4.0 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm and has a shaggy capsule that is
disrupted at the bladder resection margin and has been
previously inked black on the left and blue on the right. The
right seminal vesicle measures 3.5 x 1.5 cm. The right vas
measures 1.5 x 0.5 cm. The left seminal vesicle measures 3.0 x
1.0 cm. The left vas measures 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The inferior
prostate is sectioned transversely, removed from the rest of the
specimen and sectioned from anterior to posterior following the
plane of the urethra. The remaining gland is serially sectioned
transversely and shows a firm, focally nodular parenchyma. The
seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia Show no abnormalities.
Representative sections submitted as follows: inferior prostate
demonstrating apical margin submitted entirely anterior to
posterior in C1—C6 ; bladder resection margin in C7-C8; complete
section of mid gland anterior C9—C10; posterior ell-012;
complete section of upper third of gland, anterior C13—C14;
posterior C15—C16; remainder of the posterior gland submitted in
C17—C22; right seminal vesicle and vas deferens C23; left
seminal vesicle and vas deferens C24. Also there are two
additional cassettes for research labeled "normal" and

“tumor".
