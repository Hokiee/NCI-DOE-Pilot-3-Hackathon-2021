Surgical Pathology Report

 

CLINICAL HISTORY

The patient is a “who has a large lesion involving left

frontal, temporal, insular an asal ganglia regions, partially
hemorrhagic,

enhancing, and encasing internal carotid artery and left optic chiasm.

j'There- .
'is marked mass effect with herniations.

OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
Brain tumor

Operation/Specimen: A: Brain tumor, biopsy
B: Brain tumor, extra axial, biopsy

PATHOLOGICAL"DIAGNOSIS:

Ar'and B. Brain, left cerebral lesion, biopsy and excision:
Glioblastoma (WHO'

Grade IV) (see comment).

COMMENT
Permanent sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis. Sections show

a
highly cellular and moderately pleomorphic glioma demonstrating

7 mitotic ..
figures, vascular proliferation and necrosis. Immunohistochemical

- stains show

that the tumor cells are diffusely GFAP positive. Synaptophysin
highlights the

neuropil background and occasional tumor cells. CD3, CD4 and CD34
stain rare

to oCcasional cells. The Ki—67 labeling index is up to approximately
50%.

Positive and negative controls show appropriate immunoreactivity.

InterpretatiOn

‘NEGATIVEE NO evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected.

Results~Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT
promOter
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents.
' Ass e,ssment of
~. MGMT promoter m ethylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA
followed
by real— time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and

unmethylated DNA
sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by

serial
dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and

was
; . assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNAJ . . .-

‘ _Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the

sample, or

extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated
‘ MGMT '

promoter sequences.
