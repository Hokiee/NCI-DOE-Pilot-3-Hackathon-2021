1. Right frontal tumor
2. Right frontal tumor

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS:
Subdural hematoma

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION: , g -
l. Received fresh for frozen section labeled with the patient's name and
"right frontal tumor" are multiple pink—tan soft tissue fragments aggregating
to 1.0 X 0.6 x 0.1 cm. A smear is performed and the specimen is entirely

frozen on one chuck.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:
GLIOBLASTOMA. -

2. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "right frontal
tumor" are multiple tan—brown soft tissue-fragments aggregating to 4.0 X 3.5 X
2.0 cm. The larger fragments are serially sectioned and representative
sections are submitted in two cassettes.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
1, 2. Permanent section of the frozen section specimen demonstrates a markedly
hypercellular glial.neoplasm that is composed of moderately to markedly
atypical astrocytes. The neoplastic cells demonstrate significant nuclear
pleomorphfsm and hyperchromatic nuclei with irregular contours. Numerous
scattered mitotic figures are seen. The tumor demonstrates robust
microvascular proliferation and areas of necrosis, including pseudopalisading
necrosis. The neoplastic cells diffusely infiltrate the adjacent brain
parenchyma. The histologic features are consistent with a glioblastoma.

The MGMT immunostain demonstrates patchy regional immunoreactivity at overall
approximately 25u50% of neoplastic cells.
