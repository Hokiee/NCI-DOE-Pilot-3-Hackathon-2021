DIAGNOSIS:

A. Uterus, bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and

bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: FIGO grade I (of III)
endometrial

adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, arising in a background
of

complex hyperplasia with atypia, forming an exophytic mass
(2.8 x

2.5 x 1.9 cm) located in the anterior uterine wall. The
tumor

invades 0.2 cm into the myometrium (total wall thickness
2.4 cm).

The tumor does not involve the endocervix and the cervix
lS

unremarkable. Lymphovascular space invasion is not
identified.

Multiple (2) intramural leiomyomata ranging in size from
2. 2 cm to

3. 5 cm in greatest dimension are identified. The
bilateral ovaries

and fallopian tubes are without diagnostic abnormality.

B. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(17) right
pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

C. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, lymphadenectomy: Multiple
(3) left
pelvic lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

With available surgical materials, [AJCC pTlaNO](7th
edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic

examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation
of the

specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent
sections are

reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive
changes

identified on permanent section review will be reflected
in a

revised report.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled "uterus, right fallopian tube
and ovary"

is a 176.0 gram uterus with attached bilateral tubes and
ovaries.

The uterine serosa is smooth. There is a 2.8 x 2.5 x 1.9
cm

exophytic mass in the left anterior wall of the
endometrial cavity

grossly invades 0.2 cm to the myometrium. The myometrial
thickness

is 2.4 cm. There are multiple (2) uterine intramural
leiomyomas,

ranging in size from 2.2 cm to 3.5 cm.

There is a 1.1 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm right ovary with a ragged
outer

surface and a solid cut surface with a 5.5 x 0.6 cm right
fallopian

tube which is unremarkable. There is a 1.5 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm
left ovary

with a ragged outer surface and a solid cut surface with a
6.5 x 0.5

cm left fallopian tube which is unremarkable.
Representative

sections submitted.

B. Received fresh labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes" is a
6.8 x 5.0

x 1.7 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. Lymph
nodes

submitted.

C. Received fresh labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes" is a
7.1 x 4.5

' ' h
x 1 2 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. Lymp
