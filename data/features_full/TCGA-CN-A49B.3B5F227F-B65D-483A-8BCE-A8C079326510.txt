MICROSCOPIC:

Microscopic examination substantiates the above diagnosis.

The following statement applies to all immunohistochemistry, Insitu
Hybridization Assays (ISH & FISH), Molecular Anatomic Pathology, and
Immunofluorescent Testing:

The testing was developed and its performance characteristics
determined by

the Department of Pathology, as required by
the CLIA
'88 regulations. The testing has not been cleared or approved for the
specific use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA has
determined such approval is not necessary for clinical use. Tissue
fixation
ranges from a minimum of 2 to'a maximum of 84 hours.
This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments of 1988 ("CLIA") as qualified to perform high-complexity
clinical
testing. Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA, ASR's used in this
laboratory
have been established and verified for accuracy and precision.
Additional
information about this type of test is available upon request.
