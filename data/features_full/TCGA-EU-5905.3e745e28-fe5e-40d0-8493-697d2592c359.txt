A. KIDNEY - 1. Right kidney to—-

CLINICAL INFORMATION
Renal mass, right

 

 

The specimen is received in formalin labeled with the patient's nade additionally
labeled “right kidney to pathology%' and c kidney with
perirenal adipose tissue. The kidney measures . x . x .5 cm. There is an attached segment of
ureter measuring 5.5 cm in length with an average diameter of 0.4 cm. There is a 3 x 3 x 2.8 cm
encapsulated, well-circumscribed orange-red cystic mass in the lower pole of the kidney. The mass is 1
cm away from the ureter and does not invade the renal vein. The mass extends to the renal capsule but
does not invade through the renal capsule. The renal capsule is purple-tan, smooth and glistening with a
slight bulge overlying the area of tumor. No adrenal gland is identified. No lymph nodes are identified.
The cortical medullaryjunction is distinct and the cortex measures 0.6 cm. The uninvolved kidney is tan
with unremarkable medullary pyramids. The following representative sections are submitted.

SLIDE KEY

A1 — ureter margin

A2 —- vascular margin

A3 —- tumor and ureter

A4 — tumor and capsule

A5 — tumor and capsule

A6 — tumor and adjacent parenchyma
A7 — uninvolved kidney

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

 

 

 

Sections from the ureteral and vascular margins are free of neoplasm. Sections from the tumor show a
renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type, Fuhrman nuclear grade 3. The tumor extends up to the renal
capsule.

Please refer to the cancer case summary for additional findings.
Surgical Pathology Cancer Case Summary, Kidney

SPECIMEN TYPE: Right radical nephrectomy, without adrenal.
TUMOR SITE: Lower pole.

TUMOR SIZE: 3 x 3 x 2.8 cm.

MACROSCOPIC EXTENT OF TUMOR: Limited to kidney.

HISTOLOGIC TYPE: Conventional (clear cell) renal cell carcinoma.

HISTOLOGIC GRADE: G3 (Fuhrman grade 3).

EXTENT OF INVASION: T1.

MARGINS: Uninvolved by tumor.

BLOOD/LYMPHATIC VESSEL INVASION: Not observed.

REGIONAL LYMPH NODES: NX: Cannot be assessed (none included with specimen).

DISTANT METASTASIS: MX: Cannot be assessed.

ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: Examination of the adjacent benign kidney shows severe
arteriosclerosis but very little nephrosclerosis. Less than 5% of the tubular parenchyma is atrophic, and
less than 5% of the glomeruli are obsolescent. Nearly all of the arteries, however, show prominent

subendothelial fibroFlasia.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS

KIDNEY, RIGHT, NEPHRECTOMY
- Renal cell carcinoma, clear cell pattern, Fuhrman grade 3.
- Examined margins free of neoplasm.
- Maximal tumor diameter 3 cm.
