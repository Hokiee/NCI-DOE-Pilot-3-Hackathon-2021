CLINICAL HISTORY:
Large left breast CA with microcalcification diffusely around invasive tumor.
Suggests diffuse intraductal carcinoma.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Left breast mass (Af1)". Received is a breast biopsy specimen and frozen
section remnant. The breast tissue measures 5.0 x 4.0 x 3.5 cm. The surgeon

states that the margin is not important, thus the specimen is not inked.

Sectioning of the specimen reveals a red-brown nodule measuring 3.0 x 2.5 x /
1.5 cm. Tissue from the nodule has been sent for ER/PR study. A remnant of

frozen section of the red—brown tissue measuring 1.7 x 1.3 x 0.3 cm is

submitted in toto in Block A1, with representative sections of the nodule

submitted in Blocks A2-A4.

B. "Left breast", fresh. An 18 x 25 x 6 cm breast mastectomy specimen with a
23 x 14 cm skin ellipse and a 12 x 9.5 cm axillary tail.

The skin ellipse is notable for a grossly unremarkable nipple and areola and a
5.5 cm recently dehised biopsy scar located in the lower medial portion of the
ellipse.

The deep surface of the breast specimen is inked in black. Cut sectioning
through the breast reveals a 5 x 4 x 4 cm hollow biopsy cavity in the lower
medial quadrant which is lined by smooth white tissue in its cavity. The
cavity comes to within 0.5 cm of the inked distal surface, 0.8 cm from the
inked posterior surface, and 12 cm from the inked proximal surface. There is
a focal 1.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm firm, finely granular, grey-pink lesion located
adjacent to the lateral tip of the biopsy cavity. This lesion is, at its
closest points, 1.5 cm from the distal inked surface, 4 cm from the posterior
inked surface, 4 cm from the posterior inked surface, 11 cm from the proximal
inked surface, and 2 cm beneath the anterior skin surface. The remainder of
breast specimen is comprised of yellow-white fibrofatty tissue with an
especially prominent white fibrous focus in the upper midportion of breast
parenchyma.

 

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Bl representative section of nipple.

BZ-BS tissue around biopsy cavity site which includes firm lesion described
above.

B6—B7 representative sections from focal white fibrous area in upper
mid-portion of breast.

88-89 representative sections of upper medial portion of breast.

BlO—Bll representative sections of lower medial portion of breast.

312—813 representative sections of upper lateral portion of breast.
Bl4~815 representative sections of lower lateral portion of breast.

816 three lymph node candidates from intermediate portion of axillary tail.
817 four lymph node candidates from intermediate portion of axillary tail.
818 five lymph node candidates from most lateral portion of axillary tail.
819 four lymph node candidates from most lateral portion of axillary tail.
B20 three lymph node candidates from most lateral portion of axillary tail.
