Part A, "#1. Retroperitoneal node", consists of one pink/red fragment of soft
tissue (2.3 x 1.1 x 0.3 cm). No lymph nodes are identified. The entire

specimen is submitted for histologic examination.

Part B, "#2. RT kidney", consists of a radical nephrectomy specimen (762.5
gram, 21.0 x 10.0 x 8.8 cm) with ureter (4.5 cm in length x 0.2 cm in
diameter), possible arteries (5.0 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter), vein #1
(2.2 cm in length x 0.7 cm in diameter), vein #2 (2.2 cm in length x 0.2 cm in
diameter), and a portion of disrupted adrenal gland (5.0 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm)
without masses or lesions grossly. A tan/red to tan/yellow, encapsulated mass
(11.0 x 9.5 x 8.2 cm) is located in the upper pole 10.0 cm from the ureter
margin, 5.5 cm from the vein #1 margin, 2.0 cm from vein #2 margin, 4.3 cm from
the artery margin, and abutting the outer surface of the specimen (inked
black). Approximately 70% of the tumor is hemorrhagic with approximately 50%
necrosis in multiple nodules. The remainder of the mass is tan/white and
homogenous, and present as a single nodule in the lower part of the mass
abutting the more hemorrhagic nodule. The uninvolved renal parenchyma is

ADDENDUM:
RENAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION OF KIDNEY PARENCHYMA:

RIGHT KI DNEY , NEPHRECT OMY:

MILD CHRONIC CHANGES OF THE KIDNEY PARENCHYMA, MOST LIKELY

AGEs-RELATED, INCLUDING: .
— FOCAL GLOBAL GLONERULOSCLEROSIS, (1.1% OF GLOMERULI);
— FOCAL TUBULAR ATROPHY AND INTERSTITIAL FIBROSIS (<5% OF THE PARENCHYMA)

— ARTERIAL AND ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS, MODERATE (SEE NOTE)

 
 
 
     

NOTE:

The kidney parenchyma examined shows minimal chronic changes, as summarized
above.

The kidney parenchyma has been evaluated by Renal

Pathologist.

 

 

 

 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
Sections of formalin—fixed, paraffin~embedded tissue (block 810) were evaluated

using H&E, PAS, Jones' silver methenamine, and AFOG (trichrome) stains.

The sample consists of cortex and medulla. There are 373 glomeruli present, of
which 4 (1.1%) are globally sclerosed. The remaining glomeruli show no
significant expansion of the mesangial areas. There are no discernible craters
or double contours of the glomerular capillary wall basement membranes. Rare
distal tubules contain PAS—positive hyaline casts. Less than 5% of the
cortical parenchyma shows tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Arteries
and arterioles exhibit moderate sclerosis and hyalinosis.

METAPHASES COUNTED: 7 ANALYZED: 7 SCORED: 0 BANDING: GTG
INTERPRETATION:

Five of 7 metaphases obtained from sample Tl, contained the clonal
aberrations described above, including loss of the short arm of chromosome 3,
der(3), a characteristic finding in renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type.

Cell cultures from specimen T2 were attempted but unsuccessful, and the
cytogenetic analysis could not be performed.

COMMENTS:
Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the

standard methods employed. Chromosome analysis was performed at a level of 400

bands or greater.
