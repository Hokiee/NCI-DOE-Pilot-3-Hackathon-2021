Esophageal adenocarcinoma, 11M tumor with one para tunoral lymph node.

1. "Distal esophagus and proximal stomach." Received in formalin in a large
container is a 4 cm length of esophagua and attached 7.5 x 11 cm portion of
proximal stomach. Arising from the gastroeeophageal junction is a 3.5 x 3.x
2.2 cm polypoid mass. A 1.5 cm length of tumor extends superior into the
esophagus. This strip of tissue is 2.5 cm from the proximal surgical margin.
The mass is 6 cm from the distal (stomach) surgical margin. Iha adventitia of
the esophagus and the aerosol surface of the stomach are unremarkable. Ihe
adventitia opposite the tumor is inked green. Esophageal and gastric mucosa is
otherwise unremarkable. 0n serial, longitudinal sections, the tumor appears to
erode through the mucosa, but not into the muscle. Please see gross photos.
1A. Proximal margin (en face). Frozen section control.

13. Projection of tumor-like mucosa to normal esophageal mucosa (greatest
proximal extent of tumor).

ic-D. one full thickness section of tumor at esophageal junction extending to
normal mucosa proximally and distally, bisected.

iE-F. Full thickness section of tumor including tuner to proximal mucosa and
distal mucosa at deepest invasion. Bisected.

16-“. Three iynph nodes each.

2. "Cervical esophageal margin.“ Receiveo in formalin In a small container is
a 1 cm long section of esophagus, stapled at one end. Staple line is removed
and specimen submitted en face with true margin down.
