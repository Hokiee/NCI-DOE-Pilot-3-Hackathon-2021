pieces of red and bla oft tissue measuring 1.5 cm in greatest
aggregate dimension.

C. The specimen is received unfixed labeled level VII and consists of 2
pieces of red and black soft t e measuring 1.3 cm in greatest
aggregate dimension. Bisected

D. Specimen D. is received unfixed labeled for-L. node and consis f
a piece of red soft tissue measuring 1 by 0.7 x 0.6 cm. Bisected

E. Specimen E. is received unfixed labeled level XII and consists of a
reddish-brown piece of soft tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The
additional piece of similar appearing tissue measuri cm in greatest
