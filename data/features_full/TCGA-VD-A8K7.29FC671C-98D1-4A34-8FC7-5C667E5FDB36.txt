MICROSCOPY

Histological sections demonstrate an enucleated eye with a
regular cornea, a narrow anterior chamber and closed angles
as a result of rubeosis iridis. the ciliary muscles are
moderately atrophic and there is hyaliniaation of the
ciliary processes. The lens shows moderate cataractous
changes. -

In the posterior segment. a large choroidal melanoma can be

seen. This is dome—shaped with a total retinal detachment
with extensive subretinal fluid . The retina demonstrates
advanced atrophy with degenerative changes.

The tumour is not pigmented and consists predominantly of
spindle cells, with numerous balloon cells. The melanoma
cells are immunoreactive for MelanA and HSP-2'7 (score 2).

The number of mitoses is approx. 4/40 high power fields.

The microvasculature of the melanoma is prominent, and
closed loops are present in the tissue planes evaluated.
Occasional "vascular lakes" can be observed. and in these
tumour cells can be see located within the lumen.

The lymphocytic infiltrate within tumour is minimal.
Macrophages are scattered throughout the tumour in a mild
density.

There is no evidence of scleral invasion or of extraocular
growth. The optic nerve is tumour free, and demonstrates

mild atrophic changes. The examined vortex veins are free of

tumour .

DIAGNOSIS

Enncleated eye - choroidal melanoma of spindle cell type.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT

In the meantime, molecular genetic analysis of tumour DNA
extracted from the fresh uveal melanoma tissue was performed
using the technique termed multiplex ligation-dependent
probe amplification (MLPA) . These investigations were
performed in the

The kit P027 from ' which examines for gains or
losses in 31 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8. was used.
The DNA concentration was measured using - and the
quality assessed using multiplex-PCR prior to the MLPA
reaction.

The DNA concentration was high and of. good quality on
assessment. The MLPA reaction was run at least twice on
differing occasions, resulting in similar results.

The results of the sequence analysis of the MLPA products is

In summary, sequence analysis demonstrated normal
chromosomes 1, 3 and a, as well as a gain in chromosome 6p.

These molecular data require correlation with the clinical
and morphological data for metastatic risk assessment.
