COMMENT:

Representative sections of invasive carcinoma are submitted for p53 assay by
immunohistology, results of which will be reported in an addendum.

There are two lymph nodes identified showing non-necrotizing illadefined
granulomas. Histochemical stains for acid fast bacilli (AFB) and fungi (GMS) are
negative.

CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Pre- -op Dx: Bladder cancer
Post—op Dx: Same

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A: The specimen is received fresh from the o R. and labeled “Right distal
ureter~F/S". It consists of a segment of ureter with surrounding fat measuring 0.3

cm. The ureter itself measures 0.3 cm in length x 0.3 cm diameter. The specimen
is entirely submitted for frozen section in AFS.

B: The specimen is received fresh from the O R. and labeled “Left distal

ureter—F/S". It consists of a strip of tan tissue measuring 0.9 cm in length x 0.2
x 0.2 cm . The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in BPS.
C: The specimen is received fresh from the o R. and labeled "Bladder". It

consists of a urinary bladder with attached peritoneum and anterior vaginal wall
measuring overall 19 x 12 x 5.5 cm. The peritoneum measures 19 x 9 x 0.1 cm and
shows focal fine reddish—tan adhesions. identified on the posterior part of the
specimen is the anterior vaginal wall measuring 6 x 5 cm covered by ten glistening
mucosa. Also identified attached to the left side of the specimen is tan—brown
ovarian tissue measuring 2.5 x 1.3 x 1 3 cm. The outer surface is tan— brown smooth
and glistening. 0n sectioning, there is a cyst measuring 2 cm in greatest
dimension filled with serous fluid. The inner wall of the cyst is tan- -brown smooth

and glistening with no excre cences dentified.

is ill—defined tubular tissue measuring 4 cm in length x 0.3 cm in average external
diameter suspicious for fallopian tube. The bladder itself measures 9 x 7 x 4 cm.
The surgical margins are inked black and the bladder is opened. 0n opening the
specimen anteriorly, it reveals a tanvbrown sessile polypoid, exophytic mass. It
is located in the trigone / bladder neck area, measures 7.5 x 3.5 x 2 cm and is
almost circumferential sparring only 1 cm of the anterior bladder wall. It extends
to the left lateral wall. Also identified is another sessile tumor on the left
lateral wall, located 1.5 cm from the previous and measuring 119 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm.
The remainder of the bladder mucosa shows multiple foci of submucosal hemorrhage
and is hyperplasia. The uninvolved bladder wall is 0.9 cm in thickness. No
diverticula are identified. Sectioning of the tumor shows it invading through the
muscularis propria into the perivesical fat. Grossly, the tumor is located 1 cm
away from the nearest perivesical inked margin in the left lateral wall. The tumor
is seen abutting but not involving the left ureterovesical junction and is 0.5 cm
away from the right ureterovesical junction. The tumor is also 1.5 cm away from
the proximal urethra and 3.5 cm away from the distal urethra. The urethra measures
2 cm in length x 1.2 cm in average circumference covered with pale tan glistening
mucosa. Both ureterovesical junctions are identified, probed and opened revealing
the right attached ureter 7 cm in length x 0.4 cm in circumference, and left 5.5 cm
in length x 0.9 cm in circumference. Both ureteral mucosae are unremarkable.
Representative sections are submitted in 22 cassettes.

 

D: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Part of anterior vaginal
wall“. It consists of a tan fibrous irregular tissue segment measuring overall 3.5

x 1.5 x 1 cm. The tissue is serially sectioned into four pieces and totally
embedded in 2 cassettes.

E: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right LN of cloguet". It
consists of fibrofatty tissue with a lymph node measuring 2.5 x 1 x 0.5 cm. The
lymph node is bisected and totally embedded one cassette.

F: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right external iliac“. It
consists of of fibrofatty tissue with lymph nodes measuring 4 x 3 x 0.5 cm. The
largest lymph node measures 4 x 1 x 0.5 cm which is trisected and submitted in two
cassettes, and the remainder of the tissue is submitted in a third cassette.

G: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right obturator hypogastric
LN". It consists of fibrofatty tissue with lymph nodes meaSuring 7 x S x 2 cm.
The specimen is totally embedded in three cassettes.

H: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Left external iliac LN". It
consists of fibrofatty tissue with lymph nodes measuring 4 x 4 x 0.8 cm. The
specimen is totally embedded in three cassettes.

I: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Left obturator hypogastric
LN". It consists of fibrcfatty tissue with lymph nodes measuring 8 x 3 x 0.8 cm.
The largest lymph node measures 8 x l x 0.8 cm. It is trisected and totally
submitted in three cassettes, and the remainder of the tissue is submitted in a
fourth cassette.

J: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Left proximal ureter". It
consists of a segment of ureter measuring-1.2 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter.
The specimen is trisected and totally embedded in one cassette.

K: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled “Right proximal ureter". It
consists of a segment of ureter measuring 1.6 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter.
The specimen is totally embedded in one cassette.

INTRAOPERATIVE FROZEN CONSULTATION:
AFS: Right distal ureter '
- no high grade atypia or tumor identified

BFS: Left distal ureter
- no high grade atypia or tumor identified

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

A-B: See final microscopic—diagnoses.

C: Sections of the bladder representing the sessile_polypoid mass in the trigone
and left lateral wall show deeply invasive poorly differentiated urothelial
carcinoma (07.8—15), grades 3 and 4 of 4, extending into perivesical soft tissue
and associated with multiple foci of lymphovascular invasion. Associated with
invasive tumor are foci of in situ urothelial carcinoma (flat lesion). Additional
multiple random sections of bladder including trigone, right lateral wall, left
lateral wall, dome, posterior wall and left ureterovesical junction show urothelial
carcinoma in situ (C2,3,5,6,8,15,16). All resection margins are free of dysplasia
and malignancy. Sections of the left ovary show a simple serous cyst and corpora

albicantia. The tubular structure grossly identified from the area of the ovary is
consistent with the round ligament.

D-K: See final microscopic-diagnoses.
