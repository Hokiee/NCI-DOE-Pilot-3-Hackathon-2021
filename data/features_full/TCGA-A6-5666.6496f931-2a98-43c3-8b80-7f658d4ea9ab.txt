SPECIMEN
A. Sigmoid colon, upper rectum and adherent posterior bladder wall
and small intestines
B. Appendix

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Rectal cancer.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Received fresh subsequently fixed in formalin labeled
"sigmoid, upper rectum with adherent posterior bladder
wall
and small intestines". The specimen consists of a rectosigmoid
colon with adherent portions of small bowel and possible portion of
bladder. A segment of small bowel was 12 cm long, stapled at both
ends, which are arbitrarily inked blue and black. A portion of
colon is 46 cm long. Both ends are stapled, inked blue and the
opposite is opened and is inked black. There is also a small
portion of possible bladder, which is 7 x 5 cm. This is smooth to
slightly velvety and the margin of this is inked blue. Orientation
cannot be determined. One end away from the tumor is inked blue.
The opposite end close to the tumor is inked black. The specimen
is
opened to show a large fungating mass, which is 12 x 11.5 x 3.5 cm.
This comes within 2.5 cm of the black inked margin. This tumor is
centrally necrotic and goes through the wall of the colon, into the
surrounding fat and through the wall of the small bowel into the
mucosa of the small bowel. The remainder of the mucosa of small
bowel is pink—tan smooth glistening with normal slightly dilated
poles having an average circumference of 6.5 cm and the mucosal
alteration of tumor is 3.5 x 3.5 cm. This comes within equidistant
luminal margins of the small bowel. The tumor also comes through
the wall into the fat and possibly involves the mucosa of the
portion of bladder. This is velvety, coming within 0.5 cm of the
nearest peripheral margin. The remainder of the mucosa of the
specimen is pink—tan smooth glistening with an average
circumference
of 9.5 cm. The tumor comes within 1.5 cm of being circumferential
and shows a markedly necrotic central focus. Lymph nodes are
grossly identified. Representative sections of the specimen are
submitted as follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Representative luminal margins of small bowel,

— representative section of small bowel tumor, 3—4 — representative
section of bladder to tumor, 5 — representative luminal margins of
the colon, 6 — representative section of tumor to normal, 7 and 8 —
representative sections of tumor to fat, 9—12 — have six possible

lymph nodes — have four possible lymph nodes each.

cm

B. Received in formalin labelled "appendix" is a 6.3 x 0.7

appendix
which is partially covered with pink—tan smooth glistening serosa
and yellow
lobular fat. The specimen is sectioned to show an intact wall with
an average thickness of 0.4 cm. The lumen ranges from pinpoint to
0.4 cm and shows
possible diverticula present. No other discrete gross lesions are
identified. The entire specimen with the exception of the fat is
submitted in t settes. AS—2 (fat retained), proximal end
inked. AS—2.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

A. Microscopic exam of the resection shows:

Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified
Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated

Primary tumor(pT): Tumor invades through the entire colonic wall
and through the entire adhesed small intestinal wall into the lumen
of the small intestine. The tumor also invades into the

muscularis

propria of the bladder wall (pT4b).

Proximal margin: Negative for tumor.

Distal margin: Negative for tumor.

Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative for tumor although not

truly applicable given the resection of the adhered additional
organs.

Distance of tumor from closest margin: 2.5 from one of the

colonic

of

margins

Vascular invasion: Not identified.

Regional lymph nodes (pN): 30 lymph nodes are dissected from the
specimen and they are all negative for metastatic (pNO).

Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: Present in the soft tissue

adhesing the small intestine and the bladder to the upper
rectal/sigmoid colon resection. No discrete additional nodules

pericolonic tumor seen.
Distant metastasis (pM): Cannot evaluate pMX.
Other findings: There is significant necrosis of the tumor in the
central areas.

B. Microscopic examination of the appendix reveals a
benign
mucocele at the tip. No dysplasia or malignancy is
identified. There is focal fibrous obliteration of the tip

including obliteration of the diverticulum. There is acute
serositis

and ahdesions.

DIAGNOSIS
A. Sigmoid colon, upper rectum and adherent posterior bladder wall
and small intestines, resection:
Invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Tumor invades through the entire colonic wall and through the
entire adhesed small intestinal wall into the mucosa of the
small intestine. Tumor invades into the muscularis propria
of the bladder (pT4b).
Thirty lymph nodes are negative for metastatic tumor (0/30)
(pNO).
Resection margins are negative for tumor.
B. Appendix, excision:
Hyperplastic mucinous epithelium consistent with benign

mucocele. . Resection margins are negative. Serosal
adhesions.
