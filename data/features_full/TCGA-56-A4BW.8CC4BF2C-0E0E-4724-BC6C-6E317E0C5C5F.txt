Final Diagnosis (Verified)
Left lung, pneumonectomy with frozen section examination:
Moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma within upper lobe.
Overlying pleural surface free of neoplasm.

Gross Description (Verified)

"A. NFSA.” Received after frozen section is a 349 gram. 18.7 x 12.3 x 5.8 cm left lung. The bronchial and vascular margins have been
previously sampled. There is a 4.5 x 3.2 cm white—tan. ﬁrm mass in the upper lobe. The mass grossly appears to come to within 0.3 cm of the
adjacent pleura. The pleura overlying the mass has been previously inked blue. The mass grossly appears to surround the intraparenchymal
portion of the bronchus and comes to within 3.2 cm of the current bronchial margin. The remaining lung parenchyma ranges from pink-tan to
congested. No other masses or lesions are grossly identiﬁed in the remainder of the lung. At the hilum of the lobe are 7 possible lymph nodes
ranging from 0.4 to 1.8 cm in greatest dimension. Two portions of the specimen have been submitted for frozen section in cassettes "FSA1"
and "FSAZ." "A1-A3." random sections of the mass: "A4." random sections of the mass with adjacent intraparenchymal portion of bronchus;
"A5." random sections remainder of lung; “AS—A7." possible hilar lymph nodes.

"B, 4L lower paratracheal." Received is a 2.1 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm black to tan lymph node. The lymph node will be bisected and submitted in toto.
“B" all.

"C, 7 subcarinal." Received are 3 lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 to 1.1 cm. The specimen will be submitted in toto. “C." all.

"D. B paraesophageal below carina.” Received are 7 possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 to 1.1 cm. All the lymph nodes will be submitted
in toto. "D1." smaller lymph nodes; "D2." iargest lymph node.

"E. 9 pulmonary ligament." Received are 3 lymph nodes ranging from 0.7 to 1.2 cm submitted in toto. "E." all.
