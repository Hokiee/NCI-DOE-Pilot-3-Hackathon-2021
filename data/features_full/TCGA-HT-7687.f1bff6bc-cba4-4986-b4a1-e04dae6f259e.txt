Pathology Report for Subiect-

Discussion: Numerous MIB-l cells are scattered throughout in the
confluent cellular areas, labeling index of 9.5% is calculated. This level of
proliferative activity is virtually always seen in high grade tumors. It is
unclear why more mitoses were not identified in the specimen, but with
this MIB-l labeling index and the degree of cellularity and atypia, a
classification of anaplastic/grade III is warranted.

Microscopic Description: Sections demonstrate a neoplasm that is diffusely
distributed in the gray and white matter. This is composed of cells with
round nuclei, cytoplasm and prominent perinuclear halos. Perineural
satellitosis is prominent. Despite areas of confluent cellularity and
moderate Atypia, only a single mitotic figure is seen in over fifty high power
fields. Neither microvascular proliferation nor necrosis is present.

Diagnosis: Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma (WHO grade III).
