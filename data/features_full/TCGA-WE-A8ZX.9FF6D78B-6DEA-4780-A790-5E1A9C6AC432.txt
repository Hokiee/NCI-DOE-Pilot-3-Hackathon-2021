HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT
**SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT **

LAB No:

CASE HISTORY:

Metastatic malignant melanoma in left adrenal gland and left
axillary lymph nodes.

MACROSCOPIC:

1. Received fresh and unfixed for tissue banking , an
adrenal gland with surrounding perinephric fat, in total 7 x 6 x
2cm. The medulla of the adrenal gland contains an irregular yellow
grey tumour deposit, 2 x l.2cm. A = Tissue Bank sample of tumour, B
= Tissue Bank sample of normal adrenal gland.

2. Received fresh and unfixed for tissue banking , a left
axillary resection. It comprises a skin ellipse (14 x 1.3cm) with
underlying fat and skeletal muscle, forming a triangular structure,
14 x 3 x up to 14.5cm deep. 2A = Tissue Bank sample of enlarged
lymph node, ZB = Tissue Bank sample of skeletal muscle. Arising
towards the centre of the skin ellipse in the underlying fat is a
grey tumour nodule, approximately l.7cm diameter. Part has been
tissue banked. 2C+2D = further samples from this nodule, 2E =
adjacent lymph node, 2F+2G = large lymph node x one, 2H = lymph node
x one, 2I+2J = lymph node x one, 2K = enlarged, obviously involved,
lymph node close to muscle, 2L = near by lymph node x one, 2M = near
by lymph node x one, 2N = lymph node x one, 2P = enlarged lymph node
x one. It contains a small grey nodule. 2Q = lymph node x one, 2R
= lymph node x one, 28 = lymph node x one.

3. Lymph node, Level 2. Fatty fragment, 1.20m max. All embedded.
4. Lymph node, Level 3. Fatty tissue, 2.8 x 2.3 x 0.7cm. All
embedded.

MICROSCOPY:

l. A malignant, focally necrotic, tumour composed of sheets and
nests of polygonal epithelioid cells with large nuclei, prominent
eosinophilic nucleoli and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Some
cells have a yellowish cytoplasmic hue, but definitive melanin is
not recognised. The tumour is largely confined to the adrenal
medulla, focally extending into the cortex with a possible focus of
extracapsular spread (which is difficult to assess due to the
fragility of tumour).

Tissue Bank samples:
A. Metastatic malignant melanoma.
B. Normal adrenal parenchyma.

2. Thirteen lymph nodes have been recovered and six of them show
metastatic deposits of malignant melanoma. The tumour cells contain
brown pigment within their cytoplasm. The largest nodal deposit is
approximately 18 mm in maximum diameter. There is no evidence of
extracapsular spread.

Tissue Bank samples:
A. Metastatic malignant melanoma.
B. Normal skeletal muscle.

3. Fibrofatty tissue is present but there is no evidence of a
lymph node. There is no evidence of malignancy.

4. The one lymph node recovered contains deposits of metastatic
malignant melanoma. There is no evidence of extracapsular spread.

DIAGNOSIS:

1. LEFT ADRENAL GLAND; METASTATIC MALIGNANT MELANOMA
2. LEFT AXILLARY RESECTION

LYMPH NODES, LEFT AXILLA: METASTATIC MALIGNANT MELANOMA
(6/13)

3. LEVEL II LYMPH NODES (LEFT AXILLA): FIBROFATTY TISSUE ONLY,
NEGATIVE FOR NEOPLASIA.

4. LEVEL III (LEFT AXILLARY LYMPH NODE): METASTATIC MALIGNANT
MELANOMA (1/1).

REPORTED BY:

REPORT DATE:

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT: .
The specimen was sent to . . ~5
for BRAF testing. Their report reads:

Sequencing analysis of the BRAF gene has revealed the presence of a
mutation within codon 600 of BRAF gene.

COBAS technique does not differentiated between V6OOE and V600K.
MELANOMA: PATHOGENIC MUTATION WITHIN CODON 600 OF BRAF.

HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

**SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT **
LAB No:
CASE HISTORY:
Recurrent metastatic melanoma. lst axillary dissection . Now
recurrent nodule on PET CT (8). Neck dissection for macroscopi
disease.
MACROSCOPIC:

1. Left external jugular vein and nodes. Strip of fibrofatty
tissue (7 cm in length up to l.5 cm diameter) and separate fatty
frags together 1.5 cm. The main specimen bears a suture. Main
specimen in blocks A&B with separate frags in C.

2. Left level 2. Fibrofatty tissue (5 x 3 x 1.5 cm) which appears
to contain salivary gland 3 x 2.5 x 1 cm (sampled in A&B).

3. Left level 3. Fibrofatty tissue 4.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm.

4. Left level 4. Fatty tissue 3 x 2.5 x 1 cm.

5. Left level 5A. Fibrofatty tissue 4 x 2.5 x 1 cm. Breadsliced
in three cassettes.

6. Left level SB. Nodular mass of lymph nodes (10 x 6.5 x 3.5 cm)

bearing sutures and small metal clips. One end of the specimen has

been partially inked green and a sample removed from an underlying
lymph node. Remainder of specimen inked black. Slice from tissue

banked node in A. Slicing shows multiple lymph nodes replaced by

pale tumour, the largest individual metastasis up to 21 mm diameter.
Other nodes are matted together to form a nodular mass up to 4 cm

diameter (C&D). Two adjacent involved nodes in E.
7. Left axilla. Firm fibrotic tissue 2 x 1.5 x

1.7 cm.
8. Tissue left axilla. Fibrofatty tissue 3.5 x 2 x

1 cm.

MICROSCOPY:

1. Vein, parotid tissue and 4 lymph nodes with no evidence of
malignancy.

2. 24 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.

3. 15 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.

4. 10 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.

5. One lymph node with no evidence of malignancy.

6. 20 lymph nodes are present, 9 of which are extensively replaced
by highly pleomorphic and focally necrotic metastatic malignant
melanoma (including the node sampled for tissue banking). No
definite extracapsular spread is seen.

7. Dense fibrous scar tissue and one atrophic lymph node with no
evidence of malignancy.

8. Dense fibrous scar tissue, atrophic muscle and one lymph node
with no evidence of malignancy.

DIAGNOSIS:

1-6. LEFT NECK DISSECTION (LEVELS 2 TO 5B): METASTATIC MALIGNANT
MELANOMA IN 9 OF 74 LYMPH NODES, ALL IN LEVEL 5B, LARGEST METASTASIS
21 MM, NO DEFINITE EXTRACAPSULAR SPREAD

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT:

Following review, further levels were cut from one of the
