DIAGNOSIS

 

(A) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL:

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (10.0 CM MAXIMUM DIMENSION). CONVENTIONAL TYPE (70%
CLEAR CELLS, 30%

EOSINOPHILIC CELLS), FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3, INVASIVE INTO PERINEPHRIC
ADIPOSE

TISSUE. (SEE COMMENT)

Adrenal gland. no tumor present.

Margins of resection free of tumor.

COMMENT

The renal cell carcinoma invades into the perinephric adipose tissue.
The tumor pushes into the renal sinus, however, unequivocal invasion
into the renal sinus adipose tissue is not seen. The renal vein is not
involved by tumor. There is multifocal necrosis. Part of the tumor is

cystic.

 

JROSS DESCRIPTION
(A) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL - A radical nephrectomy specimen with
perirenal adipose tissue (16.0 x 10.0 x 9.0 cm) and adrenal gland (7.0 x
2.5 x 1.0 cm).

A solid and partially cystic tumor (10.0 x 9.0 x 6.0 cm) is present
in the upper pole of the kidney, extending to the center. The cut
surface is variegated ranging from yellow-orange to tan«plnk. The tumor
is approximately 0.5 cm from the closest external surface. It is close
to the renal hilum with no apparent invasion into the renal sinus.
The renal vein is free of tumor. No hilar lymph nodes are identiﬁed.
The adrenal gland is unremarkable. The remainder of the kidney is
unremarkable.
Representative portion of the tumor is submitted for electron microscopy
and the vaccine protocol.
INK CODE: Black - external surface close to the tumor.
SECTION CODE: A‘l. renal vein, renal artery, and ureteral margins:
A2—A5. tumor with pertrenal fat (closest external surface in A2);
A6-A’t 1, tumor adjacent to renal sinus; A12, adrenal gland; A13, normal

kidney. -

CLINICAL HISTORY
None given.
