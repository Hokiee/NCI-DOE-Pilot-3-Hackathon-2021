COMMENT

Additional tissue was re-exclsed, and invasive carcinoma does not approach the final margins.

However. I with involvement of lobules is 1 mm from the final interior margin and 2 mm from
the final superior and posterior margins.

Tumor marker studies will be performed and reported in an addendum.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) ADDITIONAL MARGIN OF MOST MEDIAL TUMOR - Received is a piece of fibroaciipose
tissue (1.8 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm) with clips on the true margin. The true margin inked black. The
specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in A.

(B) LEFT SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY - A segmental mastectomy specimen (8.0 x 6.5 x 5.5
cm) with a short stitch at the superior aspect, long stitch at the lateral aspect, and multiple clips
on the anterior aspect. The specimen is serially sliced from medial to lateral into 11 slices. A
well-circumscribed tan-pink tumor 1.4 x 1.1 x 1.0 cm, with an associated biopsy clip is identified in

 

 

 

slice #3, which is 0.7 cm from the closest anterior margin. Multiple smaller nodules are identified
lateral to the main tumor. One of these is very close to the anterior margin in the central anterior
inferior aspect of the specimen, and additional tissue is requested from this margin.

INK CODE: Anterior — yellow, posterior - black, superior - blue, interior - green, medial
and lateral - red.

SECTION CODE: BI. medial perpendicular margin; B2, tissue adjacent to tumor from
slice #2 ; 33-37, tumor and margins from slice #3 (B3 and B4, tumor with anterior margin in area
of clip; 85, interior margin; Be, posterior margin; B7, superior margin); BB, fibrous tissue adjacent
to the tumor from slice #4; BS, one small nodule, 1.2 cm from superior margin and 1.8 from
anterior margin of slice #4; B10, one small nodule 1.0 cm from anterior margin and 1.2 cm from
superior margin of slice #5; B11, one small nodule, 1.5 cm from anterior margin, 2.0 cm from
superior margin of slice #5; 812, B13, one small nodule, 0.1 cm from anterior margin and 1.2 cm
from inferior margin of slices #6 and #7; B14, one small nodule 0.4 cm from posterior margin and
1.5 cm from inferior margin of slice #4; 815-818, remainder of margins of slice #4, entirely
submitted (B15, anterior margin; B16, superior margin; 817, posterior margin; B18, inferior
margin); B19, representative section from slice #8; 320, lateral perpendicular margin.

(C) ADDITIONAL CENTRAL ANTERIOR INFERIOR MARGIN, LEFT BREAST — A portion of
Ilbroadipose tissue (2.0 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm) with clips on the true margin. The true maruin is inked
black. The specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in C1-C2.

(0) LEFT AXILLARY CONTENTS - Adipose tissue (11.0 x 7.5 x 3.0 cm). Multiple lymph nodes {3
are identified ranging from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm to 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm. '

SECTION CODE: 01-03, each containing six lymph nodes; D4, four lymph nodes; 05,
four lymph nodes; DB, one lymph node, trisected; D7, one lymph node, serially sectioned: D8.
one lymph node, serially sectioned; DS and D10, one lymph node, serially sectioned.

(E) ADDITIONAL LEVEL l LEFT AXILLARY TISSUE - Two lymph nodes (0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm and
0.8 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm), entirely submitted.
SECTION CODE: E1, one lymph node; E2, one lymph node, trisected.

SUMMARY

Tissue section of the invasive carcinoma BS was evaluated for HER-2/neu gene
amplification by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization technique using the T " ' ' '
HER-2lneu DNA Probe Kit (LSI HER-2/neu _ (CEP17

Slide adequacy is satisfactory. Sixty tumor nuclei were counted and showed an average of 1.57
copies of LSl HER-2/neu gene per nucleus and an average of 1.40 copies of CEP17 per nucleus.

Negative and positive controls (established by I with this batch are
appropriate.

Two representative images have been archived.

INTERPRETATION

The tumor cells demonstrated no amplification of the HER-2/neu gene copy levels (HER—Zneu:
CEP17 signal ratio: 1.12 )

The following guideline has been established for HER-2/neu testing:

Normal HER-2/neu levels: < 1. 80; equivocal HER-2/neu levels: 1.80 - 2.20; amplified HER-Z/neu
levels: > 2.20

(Ref: Arch Parholo Lab Med. 2007; 131 :18—43)

NOTES
The LSI HER-2/neu probe is specific for the HER-2/neu gene Locus (17g 11.2-q12) and the CEP

17 DNA probe is specific for the alpha satellite DNA sequence at the centromeric region of
Chromosome 17 (17 p11.1 -q11.2).

This test has been cleared and approved for specific uses by the US. Food and Drug

Administration. Its system is operating within the performance specifications stated in the product
insert.
