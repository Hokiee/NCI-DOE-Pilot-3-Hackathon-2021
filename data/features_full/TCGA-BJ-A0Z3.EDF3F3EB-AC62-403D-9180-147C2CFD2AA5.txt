Molecular Anatomic Pathology Testing:

Part 1:

A. BRAF V600E mutation IDENTIFIED at low level (see note).
B. Mutations in NRA861, HRA361, KRAS12/13, and RET/PTC1, RET/PTC3 and PAX8/PPARg
rearrangements NOT identiﬁed.

Note:

The BRAF mutation was identiﬁed and confirmed by direct sequencing. However, low levels of mutant DNA were seen
despite quite pure population of epithelial cells tested (based on the ratio of GAPDH and KRT7 controls), which indicates
that a small fraction of tumor cells is positive for this mutation. The prognostic importance of BRAF mutation when
present in a small fraction of tumor cells is not known and may be less signiﬁcant as compared to a more typical
situation when this mutation is found at high level.

Nucleic acids were extracted in the amount sufﬁcient for testing. Ampliﬁcation of GAPDH and KRT7 controls was
acceptableMutations in either BRAF or RAS genes or RET/PTC rearrangements are found in more than 70% of papillary
thyroid carcinomas (1 ). BRAF V600E( I) mutation has been associated with more aggressive behavior of papillary
carcinoma (2) and may be used for preoperative risk stratification of patients with papillary thyroid cancer (3). Mutations
in the RAS genes or PAX8/PPARg rearrangement occur in ~70% of follicular thyroid carcinomas and with lower frequency
in oncocytic (Hiirthle cell) carcinomas (4). Based on a recent prospective study of FNA samples (5) and our experience at
t, detection of BRAF mutations and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARg rearrangements in thyroid FNA samples correlated
with ~100% probability of cancer, whereas detection of RAS mutation correlated with malignancy in 83-87% of cases and
with benign follicular adenoma or hyperplastic nodule in 13-17%. However, single cases of false-positive BRAF mutation

detection in thyroid FNA samples have been reported in the literature (6) and therefore the results of molecular testing
should be interpreted in combination with clinical information Imaging, and cytology.
