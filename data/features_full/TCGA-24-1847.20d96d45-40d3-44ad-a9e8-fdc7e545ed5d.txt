SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
' es the above cited diagnosis.

  

History:
The patient is a _with stage iV Mullerian carcinoma. Operative procedure: Not stated.

Specimenis] Received:

A: BLADDER PERITONEUM
B: UTERUS, CERVIX, BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES
C: OMENTUM

Gross Description;

The specimens are received in three formalin-filled containers. each labeled The first container is
labeled "bladder peritoneum." it contains two firm pieces of soft tissue, one o w c :5 rown- lack. measuring 3 x 0.9

x 0.3 cm in ireatest dimension; the other is tan—yellow-and—brown, measuring 3.7 x 1 x 0.5 cm in greatest dimension.

The second container is labeled —." it contains a uterus and cervix, and two detached fallopian
tubes and ovaries. The uterus and cervix measure 6 cm from cornu~to~cornu. 10 cm from cervix-to-tundus, and 6.2 cm
from enterior-to-postenor. Approximately 25% of the cervix has been previously removed from the anterior hatf. The
uterus is opened to show a flattened endomelrial polyp within a triangular endometriai cavity. The endometrial polyp
measures 2.2 x 1.5 cm. The endometrial cavity measures 3 x 3. The endocervical canal is unremarkable and
measures 2.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. The remaining cervix and ectocervix are tan-white and

1. unremarkable. A single intramuscular iibroid, with a tan—white and whorled cut surface, is identified and measures 1

‘ cm in greatest dimension. There are two ovaries with attached fallopian tubes also identified within the container. The
smaller of the two has a fallopian tube with a paratubai cyst; the fallopian tube measures 3 cm in length and 0.8 cm in
diameter, with a paratubal cyst that measures t.3 cm; next to the paratubai cyst is a tan-white and firm area that
measures 0.9 cm In greatest dimension; at the medial and of the fallopian tube (nearest the uterus) is a tan-white and
tan-yellow firm mass that is attached to the paratubai soft tissue and measures 2.2 x 2.2 cm in greatest dimension; this
mass may represent the ovary. The larger specimen has a somewhat serplginous but unremarkable fallopian tube that
measures 3.5 cm in length and 1 cm in diameter; a cystic and firm massfovary is attached to the paratubal soft tissue
and measures 5.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm in greatest dimension; sectioning the mass shows a cystic tan-yetlow and golden
lesion with a trabeculaled itning without papillary excrescences; no normal ovarian stroma is identified. Labeled Bt
and 82 — anterior and posterior cervix: B3 and B4 - anterior and posterior endocervix; BS and BB - anterior and
posterior endometrium with polyp (in both); 87 - smaller fallopian tube with paratubal cyst; BB and 89 - smaller
mass/ovary; Bio - larger fallopian tube; Bit to 816 - larger mass/ovary; Bi? - leiomyoma from uterus.

The third container is labeled “omentum.” it contains a section of unremarkable fibroadlpose lissuelomenium that
measures 43.5 x 10.5 x 1.5 cm. Sectioning shows multiple tan-white well-circumscribed nodules that are consistent
with metastatic disease, ranging in size from 0.2 to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. Labeled 01 and (32 - sections of firm
nodules.
