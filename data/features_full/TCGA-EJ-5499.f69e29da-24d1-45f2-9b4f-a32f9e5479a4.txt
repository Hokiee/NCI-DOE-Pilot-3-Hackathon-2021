 

PATIENT HI
Theiatient is hit}: a history of PSA value of 5.2. The patient also has a history ot— biopsy on —

this biopsy reveals: poorly-differentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma in the right base. right mid, right apex. left base
and left mid of the restate and high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in the left apex of the prostate. The patient suffered a
pneumothorax in h
PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer.
POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: Same.

PROCEDURE: Radical prostateciomy-. TCGA EJ 5499
— - ' _

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

PART 1: LYMPH NODES, RIGHT PELVIC, EXCISION -
-NO EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASIA IN 11 LYMPH NODES(O!11).

 

  

PART 2: LYMPH NODES, LEFT PELVIC, EXCISION —
N0 EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASIA IN 8 LYMPH NODES (DIS).

PART 3: PROSTATE, BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES AND VAS DEFERENTIA, RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY —
PROSTATE ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 4 + 3 = 7.

MICROSCOPIC FOCI OF GLEASON PATTERN 5 ARE SEEN AND ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN 1% OF THE TUMOR.
THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT LOBES AND HAS A GREATEST NODULAR DIAMETER OF
2.3 CM IN ONE HISTOLOGIC SECTION (SLIDE HH).

THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES APPROXIMATELY 20% OF THE EXAMINED PROSTATE VOLUME.

THE CARCINOMA SHOWS MULTIFOCAL ESTABLISHED EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION.

THE EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IS SEEN IN THE REGION AROUND THE RIGHT SEMINAL VESICLE (3A), THE
RIGHT ANTERIOR BASE (SP, 30), POSTERIOR RIGHT APEX (3X), RIGHT MID (3Y), RIGHT BASE (32), POSTERIOR
LEFT APEX (3AA), AND POSTERIOR LEFT MID (3BB).

BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES, FREE OF CARCINOMA.

ALL EXAMINED SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA.

PERINEURAL INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

HIGH GRADE PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA IS IDENTIFIED.
