size of metastasis 0.6 cm; focal extracapsular extension
identified.

C: Thyroid gland, total thyroidectomy

D: Central lymph nodes and thymus, thymectomy and lymph node
removal

— Metastatic papillary carcinoma of thyroid in 3 of 7 lymph
nodes (3/7); maximum

size of metastasis 0.6 cm; negative for extracapsular extension
— Benign thymic tissue

Comment:
The frozen section diagnosis is confirmed.

Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis:
An intraoperative consultation was requested by Dr. from
at on

FSAl: Lymph node, superior thyroid pole, biopsy

— Follicular neoplasm with features suspicious for follicular
variant of papillary carcinoma

— No lymphoid tissue present, but cannot exclude metastatic

tumor
- Dr. concurs
Drs. at
Frozen Section Pathologistz, MD
Clinical History:
-year-old female with left thyroid nodule. FNA shows

malignancy favoring papillary carcinoma.

Gross Description:

 

 

Specimen A is received in one appropriately labeled containers,
additionally

labeled "superior thyroid pole lymph node" and holds a 0.4 x 0.2
x 0.1 cm

pink/tan soft tissue fragment that is entirely frozen as FSAl,

Specimen B is received in one appropriately labeled container,
additionally

labeled superior thyroid pole lymph node 2 and holds a white/tan
lymph node

candidate that measures 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The lymph node
candidate is

sectioned and entirely submitted in block Bl,

Specimen C:
Specimen fixation: Formalin
Type of specimen: Total thyroidectomy

Size and weight of specimen: Overall 7.2 x 5.4 x 2.8 cm; right
lobe

(4.4 x 2.2 x 2.4 cm); left (5.2 x 4.2 x 2.8 cm); weight: 29
grams.

Orientation: Anterior/blue, posterior/black, isthmus/yellow. The
specimen is oriented noting that the tumor is located in the
left lobe.

Tumor location: Left lobe
Focality: Unifocal

Tumor description: A very firm solitary unencapsulated mass (4.5
x 2.5

x 2.0 cm) is noted expanding the mid portion of the left thyroid
lobe. The cut

surface is yellow/tan, solid and lobulated with scattered
calcifications. No

areas of hemorrhage or necrosis are grossly observed. The mass
appears

well—circumscribed with compression of the adjacent residual
thyroid parenchyma.

Tumor size: 4.5 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm

Confinement/non-confinement: Confined

Distance of tumor to surgical margins: The mass grossly abuts
the blue ,

inked and black inked anterior and posterior margins,
respectively. No

extension into the isthmus is grossly identified.

Appearance of thyroid gland away from tumor: The remainder of
thyroid

parenchyma in the left lobe is red/tan and compressed. The
isthmus and right

thyroid lobe are grossly unremarkable.

Parathyroids: Not identified

Tissue submitted for special investigations: Tumor was collected
for tissue
procurement.

Lymph nodes: N/A
Digital photograph taken: N/A

Block Summary:

C1-C5 — Representative mass with margins and adjacent thyroid
C6 ~ Left thyroid lobe at edge of tumor, in continuity with
grossly

identified tumor

C7 — Isthmus

C8-C9 - Representative sections of right thyroid lobe

Specimen D is received in one appropriately labeled container,
additionally

labeled "central lymph nodes and thymus" and holds a firm,
nodular pink/tan

tissue fragment that measures 4.0 x 2.2 x 0.3 cm. The tissue
fragment has a

matted appearance and with gentle palpation separates into three
tissue

fragments. The largest fragment is composed of grey—tan
lobulated tissue and

presumed to represent thymic tissue. The remaining fragments are
presumed to

represent the "central lymph nodes" and submitted per block

 

 

summary.
