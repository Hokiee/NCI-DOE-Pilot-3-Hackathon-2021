CLINICAL HISTORY:
Not provided.

A. "Left axilla non-sentinel node (AF1)". Received fresh for frozen section is

a 1.8 x 1 x 0.6 cm tan—yellow lymph node candidate which is bisected and
frozen as AF1, the frozen section remnant is submitted in block A1.

are three tan—yellow lymph node candidates. The larger lymph node candidate (2
x 1.2 x 1 cm) is bisected and frozen as BFl, and frozen section remnant is
submitted in block 81. The remaining two lymph node candidates (0.5 x 0.5 x
0.3 cm and 1 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm lymph node candidate) are submitted in toto as
frozen section BF2, and the frozen remnant is submitted in block 32.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC Edition): pTZ pNZa pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely

a .. -- c. n .—

upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.
