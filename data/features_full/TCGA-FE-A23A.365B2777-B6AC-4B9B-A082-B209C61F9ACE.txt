*****GROSS DESCRIPTION:‘**'*

The specimens are received in five properly labeled containers. four of
which are frozen .ections, with the patient‘ 5 name and accession number.

- The specimen is designated "midline neck node" and consists of:
a 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm tan-pink lymph node. The specimen is entirely

submitted for frozen section and resubmitted as received in cassette AFl.
TE 1

g The specimen is designated "RT paratracheal nodes" and consists
o a 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm aggregate of tan—red soft tissue. Upon dissection

 

 

 

 

reveals five lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 cm up to 0.7 cm in greatest
dimension. The l ph nodes are entirely submitted for frozen section and
resubmitted as rec ived in cassette BFl. TE 1

- The sp cimen is designated "midline neck nodes" and consists of.
a 2.1 x 1.4 x 0.5 m aggregate of tan—red soft tissue that reveals six
lymph nodes rangin from 0.3 to 0.9 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen
is entirely submit ed for frozen section and resubmitted as received in
cassette CFl. TE

The sp cimen is designated “total thyroid" and consists of a
25.9 gram total th roid that is 5.5 x 5.0 x 2.3 cm. The external surface
is tan-red and slightly shaggy with no parathyroid tissue or lymph nodes
identified. The right lobe is inked blue and the left lobe is inked black.
The specimen is serially sectioned from right to left. The right lobe
contains a previou 1y incised tan—pink, friable, well—cirCumscribed nodule
that is 2.7 x 2.2 2.0 cm. The nodule abuts the thyroid capsule and is
not grossly encaps lated. A random section of the nodule is submitted for
frozen section an resubmitted as received in cassette DF1. The left lobe
contains a tan-white well-circumscribed nodule that is 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm.
The left lobe nodule abuts the thyroid capsule and is not grossly
encapsulated. Th remaining cut surfaces of the thyroid are tan—pink and
lobulated. L

Summary of Cassettes: DFl, frozen section of right lobe nodule: D1—6,
remainder of right lobe nodule; D7, entire left lobe nodule: 08. uninvolved
right thyroid lob : D9. isthmus; D10. uninvolved left thyroid lobe

- The specimen is designated “right paratracheal lymph node“ and
consists of a 1.4 m 0.9 x 0.5 cm tan—pink lymph node. TE 1
