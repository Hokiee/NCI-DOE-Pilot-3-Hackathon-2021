Gross Descrigtion:
‘ ”.0.

1. The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "total thyroidectomy short stitch - right superior pole. long stitch - left lower pole"
and consists of a thyroid weighing 33.5 g. The right lobe measures 5.1 x 3.1 x 2.3 cm . the left lobe measures 4 x 2.8 x 1.1 cm
and the isthmus measures. 5.2 x 3x 2.2 cm. The external surface is covered by a thin ﬁbrous capsule. The posterior surface of the
specimen is inked black. and the anterior ls inked blue. Sectioning reveals the right lobe is predominantly replaced by a pink-tan
soft nodule measuring 4.6x 2.9x 2.6 cm (nodule 1). Immediately adjacent to the nodule is a second nodule (2 x 1.2 x 1 cm) with a
thick capsule and ﬁlled with yellow-brown translucent ﬂuid. The isthmus has a third nodule (3.5x 2.8x 2.3 cm) with a
heterogeneous cut surface composed of pale pink tissue with granular tan tissue. The remaining thyroid parenchyma is red tan
and beefy. Representative sections of nodule one and nodule three are submitted for TPS. The nodules are entirely submitted
and the ieﬂ lobe is representativeiy submitted.

Summary of sections:

N1 - nodule. right lobe
N1/2- nodule one and two
N2- nodule, right lower lobe
N3-nodule, isthmus

LL - leﬂ lobe

MD.

2. The specimen is received fresh, "left inferior parathyroid tissue?” and consists of a fragment of pink—tan tissue (0.4 x 0.2 x 0.2
