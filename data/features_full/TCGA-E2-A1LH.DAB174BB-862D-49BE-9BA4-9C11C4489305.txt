ADDENDUM

The ER/PRIHER2 status of the invasive breast carcinoma was determined by immunohistochemistry
and quantitated via ACIS (image analysis). Results are as follows:

ER 0%
PR 0%
HER2 0.0%

A separate ACIS report has been generated.

NOTE: FISH analysis for HER2 gene ampliﬁcation has not been ordered.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:

A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 RIGHT AXILLA

Touch prep: No tumor seen on touch prep

B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE BIOPSY #2 RIGHT AXILLA

Touch prep: No tumor seen on touch prep, reported to Dr. by Dr. a

C. WIDE EXCISION RIGHT BREAST

Gross only: Tumor about 0.8cm. from anterior margin, reported to Dr. by Dr.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE BIOPSY #1 RIGHT AXILLA

Received fresh in a single container labelled and designated "sentinel lymph node bx #1 right axilla"
and consists of a single 1.5x1.1x0.4cm. lymph node with tan cut surfaces and associated unremarkable
adipose tissue. A touch preparation is made from the lymph node. The entire specimen is submitted in
a single cassette labelled A1.

B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE BIOPSY #2 RIGHT AXILLA

Received fresh in a single container labelled and designated "sentinel lymph node bx #2 right axilla"
and consists of a single 1.3x1.3x0.4cm. lymph node with tan cut surfaces and associated unremarkable
adipose tissue. Touch preparations are made from the lymph node. The entire specimen is submitted
in a single cassette labelled B1.

C. WIDE EXCISION RIGHT BREAST

Received fresh in a single container labelled and designated "wide excision right breast cancer with
needle localization" and consists of a single 8.5x7.5x3.0cm. resected portion of breast tissue. A single
stitch of suture indicates the anterior aspect and a double stitch indicates the lateral aspect. A

TSS.

localization wire is present within the specimen. A radiograph is also received with the specimen and
shows a radiographic density in the region of the tip of the wire. The margins of resection is inked as
follows: inferior orange, superior red, lateral yellow, anterior blue, medial green, posterior black. The
specimen is serially sectioned from superior to inferior and a 1.5x1.5x1.2cm. tan grey well
circumscribed tumor is identiﬁed. The tumor does not approach any of the margins grossly. However,
it is within approximately 0.8cm. of the anterior (blue) margin. The tumor is at least 1.5cm. away from
all the other margins. A small portion of tumor is submitted for tissue procurement as well as a portion
of uninvolved breast parenchyma. The remainder of the cut surfaces are remarkable only for multiple
small cystic nodules all 0.3cm. in diameter or less. Multiple sections including approximately 95% of the
tumor are submitted and labelled as follows:.
Code of sections:

C1-CZ: tumor approaching anterior margin

CS: tumor

04-05: tissue adjacent to medial margin

06-09: breast with cystic nodules
D. RIGHT BREAST CYST.excision
Received in formalin in a single container labelled and designated "right breast cyst" and consists of a
single portion of ﬁrm tan yellow ﬁbrofatty tissue measuring 3.7x2.7x2.20m. No orientation is given. The
resection margin is inked. The specimen is serially sectioned and located centrally is a 1.2cm. diameter
cyst. The inner lining is smooth and tan. The remainder of the cut surfaces are composed of
unremarkable adipose tissue with streaks of breast parenchyma. All of the cyst is submitted in
cassettes D1 through D6.
E. RE-EXCISION INFERIOR LATERAL MARGIN RIGHT BREAST
Received in formalin in a single container labelled and designated "re-excision inferior lateral margin
right breast" and consists of a portion of tissue measuring 2.0x1.7x1.5cm. A short stitch of suture
indicates the inferior aspect of the specimen and a long stitch indicates the lateral aspect which is the
new margin. The new margin submitted in a single cassette labelled E1 en face. The remainder of the
specimen is serially sectioned and the cut surfaces show unremarkable adipose tissue and breast
parenchyma.Remainder of specimen submitted and labelled E2-E9.
