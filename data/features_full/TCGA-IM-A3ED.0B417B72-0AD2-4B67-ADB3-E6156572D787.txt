Specimen(s) Received:

A: Left thyroid lobe with nodule

B: Portion of midline nodule; parathyroid versus lymph node
C: Thyroid isthmus

D: Right lobe of thyroid

E: Right paratracheal node

Gross Description:

A. Received in formalin and labeled "left thyroid lobe with nodule" is an unoriented, partial thyroidectomy specimen, which
weighs 4.8 grams and measures 3.0 x 2.7 x 0.5 cm. There is a tan. granular, well~circumscribed nodule that extends to
the capsule and measures 1.7 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm. The nodule has been submitted in toto in cassettes 1-5.

B. Received fresh and labeled “portion of midiine nodule; parathyroid versus lymph node” is a tan. soft tissue specimen
measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. Submitted in 1010 in one cassette for frozen section.

C. Received in formalin and labeled “thyroid isthmus“ is a soft tissue measuring 1.8 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm. Specimen bisected and
submitted in toto in one cassette.

D. Received in formalin and labeled “right lobe of thyroid” is an unoriented partial thyroidectomy specimen inked in black,
which measures 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm, The specimen has been serially sectioned to reveal an unremarkable parenchyma.
Representative sections submitted in two cassettes.

E. Received in formalin and labeled “right paratracheai node" is a ﬁbroadipose tissue specimen measuring 1.2 x 0.6 x 0.4
cm. which contains lymph nodes. The specimen is bisected and submitted in cassette one along with the remainder of the
tissue submitted in loto.

F. Received in formalin and labeled "left upper paralracheal node" Is a ﬁbroadipose specimen measuring 3.2 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm.
No lymph nodes were identiﬁed grossly. Stromal sections submitted in cassettes 1-3.
