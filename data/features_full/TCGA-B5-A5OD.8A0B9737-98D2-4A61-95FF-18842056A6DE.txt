GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Uterus, cervix, bil tubes and ovaries (AF1)", received fresh for frozen
section and placed in formalin at is a 104 gram, 7.8 x 5.5
x 3.8 cm hysterectomy specimen with attached bilateral tubes and ovaries. The
tan endometrium (0.1 cm thick) is remarkable for a 3.4 x 2.1 x 1.5 cm,
multifocal, tan-brown, papillary, friable mass involving the anterior and
posterior surfaces. The mass invades 0.7 cm into the myometrium (1.2 cm
thick, tan, trabeculated). A representative full—thickness section of the
mass is frozen as AFl, with the frozen section remnant submitted in A1. The
foci appear to involve the anterior and posterior lower uterine segments, but
do not grossly involve the endocervical canal (tan—white and trabeculated).

 

    
   

The myometrium is also remarkable for six intramural, well~circumscribed,
tan—white nodules with whorled cut surfaces, ranging from 0.5 cm up to 3.2 cm
in greatest dimension. The serosa is tan, smooth, and glistening, and
displays one pedunculated, subserosal nodule (2.4 x 2.3 x 1.9 cm) with a
whorled cut surface.

The attached cervix is 2.3 cm wide with a 0.5 cm patent cervical os. The
attached left fimbriated fallopian tube (5.3 cm long x 0.7 cm in diameter)
displays six paratubal cysts containing clear serous material. The left ovary
is 1.4 x 1 x 0.8 cm and is remarkable for one unilocular cyst, 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4
cm, that contains a clear serous material. The right fimbriated fallopian
tube is 3.9 cm long x 0.6 cm in diameter and displays multiple paratubal cysts
containing clear serous material. The right ovary is 1.5 x l x 0.7 cm and is
grossly unremarkable.

B. "Left pelvic nodes", received fresh and placed in formalin at

is a 3.9 x 3 x 0.9 cm aggregate of six fragments of tan-yellow adipose
tissue containing five lymph nodes, ranging from 0.8 cm up to 3.5 x 1.6 x 0.7
cm.

33—4— one lymph node, bisected

C. "Right pelvic lymph node", received fresh and placed in formalin at

on: is a 5.6 x 4.1 x 1 cm aggregate of four fragments of tan~yellow
soft tissue containing five lymph nodes ranging from 0.8 up to 3.4 x 1.1 x 0.5
cm.

Cl— two lymph nodes (one inked blue and bisected)

e—‘i

   

 

 

C2— one lymph node candidate, bisected
C3— one lymph node, bisected
C4—5— one lymph node, bisected

D. "Right aortic lymph node", received fresh and placed in formalin at

is a 3.2 x 1.9 x 0.6 cm aggregate of two fragments of tan~yellow
adipose tissue containing three lymph node candidates, ranging from 0.7 up to
2.2 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is submitted entirely in D1-2.

E. "Left aortic lymph node", received fresh and placed in formalin at

is a 3.6 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm fragment of tan—yellow adipose tissue
containing two lymph node candidates, both 2 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is
submitted entirely in El.

  
 

 

 

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
A. "Uterus, cervix, tubes, and ovaries": AFl— (rep full—thickness)-
high—grade (FIGO grade 3) adenocarcinoma invading more than one—half way
into the myometrium ).

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: Hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo~oophorectomy, lymph node sampling

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 7th Edition): ple pNZ pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.
