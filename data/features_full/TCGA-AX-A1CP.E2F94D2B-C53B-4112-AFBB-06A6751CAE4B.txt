GROSS DESCRIPTION:

1) Received labeled with the petient's name and 'right external iliac', is a 1.7 x 1.0 x
0.3 cm aggregate of yellow-gold lobulated adipose tissue dissected for possible lymph
nodes. No lymph nodes are grossly identifiable. Specimen is entirely submitted in
one cassette.

2) Received labeled with the patient's name and 'right common ilisc', is a 3.0 x 1.2 x
0.5 cm aggregate of yellow-gold lobulated adipose tissue, dissected for possible lymph
nodes. One possible lymph node is identified that is 2.6 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm. The
specimen is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette 2A.

3) Received labeled with the patient's name and "right para—aortic”, is a 3.0 x 2.7 x 1.5
on aggregate of yellow-gold to pink-tan tibrosdipose tissue, dissected for possible
lymph nodes. Six possible lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.4 to 3.0 cm in
greatest dimension. Submitted as follows:

CASSETTE SUMMARY:

Cassette 3A: Three possible lymph nodes.
Cassette 33: one lymph node, bisected.
Cassette 3C: One lymph node, bisected.

0.3 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette 4A.

Received labeled with the patient's name and "right obturator', is a 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.2
cm aggregate of yellow-gold to pink-tan lobulatsd adipose tissue, dissected for
possible lymph nodes. Three possible lymph nodes are identified, ranging from 0.7 to
2.0 cm in greatest dimension. Submitted as follows:

CASSETTE SUMMARY:

Cassette 5A: one possible lymph node.
Cassette 58: One lymph node, bisected.
Cassette 5C: One lymph node, bisected.

Received labeled with the patient's name and I'left pelvic lymph nodes', is a 3.5 x 2.7
x 0.5 on aggregate of yellow-gold to pink~tan fibroadipose tissue, dissected for
possible lymph nodes. one lymph node identified that is 2.0 x 1.7 x 0.6 cm. The
specimen is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette 6A.

Received labeled with the patient's name and "left obturator', are three portions of
yellow-gold to pink-tan fibroadipose tissue, ranging from 1.9 to 2.8 cm in greatest
dimension. The specimen is dissected for possible lymph nodes. Two possible lymph
nodes are identified, ranging from 3.0 to 3.3 cm in greatest dimension. Submitted as

Received fresh. labeled with the patient's name, number and I'uterus. bilateral tubes
and ovaries“, is a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen
consisting of uterus (6.0 x 4.0 x 3.0 cm), right fallopian tube (4.5 a 0.5 am), right

ovary (2.0 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm), left fallopian tube (5.5 x 0.5 cm), and left ovary (2.5 x ~

1.5 x 0.9 cm). Bilateral fallopian tubes are pink-tan, focally hemorrhagic and
otherwise unremarkable. Right ovary has yellow-tan to pink, glistening external
surface and upon sectioning reveals a white-tan, homogeneous parenchyma. Left ovary
has white-tan to pink, smooth external surface and upon sectioning reveals a white—tan
to pink. homogeneous parenchyma.

The external surface of the uterus is pink-tan, focally hemorrhagic, smooth and
otherwise unremarkable. The ectocervix is red—tan, hemorrhagic, irregularly shaped
and has an external as opening of 1.0 cm in maximum diameter. Upon opening the uterus
the endocervical canal is pink-tan, focally hemorrhagic and measures 2.0 x 0.6 cm.

The endometrial cavity is 4.0 x 1.5 cm. pink—tan, focally hemorrhagic and has a
polypoidal growth encompassing the entire endometrial cavity. The polypoidal growth
is soft to firm, focally hemorrhagic with the stalk of attachment to posterior uterine
