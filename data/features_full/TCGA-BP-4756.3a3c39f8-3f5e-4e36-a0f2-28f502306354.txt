. The specimen is received labeled "Right kidney, ureter and part of adrenal“. It conslsts of a kidney with attached
perirenat fat and a portion of Gerote's fascia. The entire specimen weighs 250 grams. The entire specimen measures 12 x 725 x
4 cm. The kidney itself measures ’10.5 x 7 x 3.5 cm. Present In the interior pole at the tr'rdney. is a friable variegated yellow
focally hemorrhagic mass extending from the cortex up to the petvis measuring 6.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension, This mass

extends up to the renal capsule, pushing the renal capsule. but not protruding through it. The tumor abuts the salyees and the
renal pelvis but does not appear to invade them. The portion of ureter attached to the kidney measures 5 cm ln tength and 0.3 cm
