CLINICAL INFORMATION:

Pre- 0p Dx: Bladder carcinoma
Post-Op Dx: Same

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Right ureter". It
consists of a 0.3 cm length of ureter measuring 0.4 cm in diameter. The outer

surface is inked black and the specimen is entirely submitted in cassette AFS,
following frozen section.

NQHEQMEQQ

B: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Left ureter". It

consists of a 0.3 cm length of ureter measuring 0.4 cm in diameter. Entirely
submitted in cassette BPS, following frozen section.

C: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled "Prostate + bladder".
It consists of a SSO—gram cystoprostatectomy specimen consisting of bladder (10 x
6.5 x 3.2 cm). attached peritoneum (14 x 10 x < 0.1 cm), attached right ureter (4 x
0.4 cm), attached left ureter (4.5 x 0.4 cm), prostate (4 x 4 x 3.5 cm), right
seminal vesicle (2.5 x 1 3 x 0.8 cm) and left seminal vesicle (2.5 x 1 x 0.6 cm).
Opening the prostate and bladder anteriorly reveals a ulcerated and centrally
necrotic tan- -white tumor (12 x 9. 5 x 3. 2 cm) involving the entire right half of the
bladder wall and extending to the dome, posterior wall, and inferiorly to the right
anterior proximal prostate. Tumor diffusely replaces the bladder wall and extends
into the perivesical fat with thickness of 3. 2 cm. Tumor comes within 1 mm of the
inked right resection margin. The mucosa beyond the central ulceration is granular
and the uninvolved left lateral wall mucosa is edematous and smoOth. The right
ureter is impinged upon by tumor for a length of 2 cm from the ureterovesical
junction. The mucosa of the bilateral ureters is Otherwise unremarkable. The

tumor causes a large area of retraction at the peritoneal surface but does not
grossly transgress the peritoneum. The prostatic urethra measures 3.5 x 1.3 cm and
the verumontanum measures 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The urethral mucosa is unremarkable.
Serial sectioning through the prostate reveals bilateral periurethral tan—white
nodularities. Tumor is again noted extending to the right anterior proximal

prostate. The seminal vesicles are uninvolved by tumor. Representative sections
are submitted in 20 cassettes.

D: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Left external iliac LN". It
consists of a 5 x 3.5 x 1 on aggregate of tan-yellow fat and soft tissue. Three

lymph nodes are identified ranging in size from 1 cm to 2.3 cm. Entirely submitted
in three cassettes.

E: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled “Left LN of cloquet". It

consists of a 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm tan-white apparent lymph node. Entirely submitted
in one cassette.

F: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Left obturator/hypogastric
LN“. It consists of a 3.5 x 2.5 x 1 cm aggregate of tan-yellow fat and soft
tissue. Multiple lymph nodes are identified ranging in size from 0.2 cm to 0.7 cm.
Entirely submitted in three cassettes.

G: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right LN of cloquet". It

consists of a 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm lymph node which is bisected and entirely
submitted in one cassette.

H: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right external iliac LN".

It consists of a 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm aggregate of tan-yellow fat and soft tissue. A
single 1.2 cm lymph node is identified. The lymph node is bisected and submitted
in cassette H1. The remaining tissue is submitted in cassette H2..

I: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled “Right obturator/hypogastric
LN". It consists of a 3 x 2.5 x 1 cm aggregate of tan -yellow fat and soft tissue.
Multiple lymph nodes are identified ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 2.5 cm. The
largest lymph node is bisected and submitted in cassettes 11 and 12. The remaining
tissue is submitted in cassette 13.

J: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled “Left proximal ureter". It
consists of a 1.5 cm length of ureter measuring 0.5 cm in diameter. Serially
sectioned and entirely submitted in one cassette.

K: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled 'Rt proximal ureter". It
consists of a 0.8 cm length of ureter measuring 0.5 cm in diameter. Serially
sectioned and entirely submitted in one cassette.
