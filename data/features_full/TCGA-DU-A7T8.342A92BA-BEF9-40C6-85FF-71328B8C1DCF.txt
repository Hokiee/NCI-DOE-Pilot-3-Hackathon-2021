PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS :

A. BRAIN, RIGHT FRONTAL, EXCISIONAL BIOPSIES: GLIOMA WITH ATYPICAL
FEATURES.

B. BRAIN, RIGHT FRONTAL, EXCISION: MIXED OLIGOASTROCYTOMA,
ANAPLASTIC. MIB—l PROLIFERATION INDEX 3%.

SEE COMMENT.

Operation/Specimen: Brain, right frontal, excision.

Clinical History and Pre—Op Dx: year old man with large right
frontal brain tumor with focal enhancement.

GROSS PATHOLOGY: '

A. Received fresh, three fragments, 1.5 cm across in aggregate.
Soft, mucinous, grayish—pink. #leS.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, smears: Glioma.

B.

SPECIMEN: Brain tumor permanent.

FIXATIVE: Saline.

GENERAL: Two glassy to pale tan soft tissue fragments, 1.0 cm. in
greatest dimension, and 2.0 X 1.0 x 0.7 cm. Largest

fragment is sectioned.

SECTIONS: All submitted in cassettes 6 and 7.

COMMENT: In part A there is a moderately cellular neoplastic
proliferation of glial cells. The neoplastic cells are predominantly
round, somewhat pleomorphic and disposed in a mucinous background with
microcystic change. Mitotic figures are rarely observed and
microvascular cellular proliferation or necrosis is absent.

In part B there are focal areas of a similar neoplasia. In addition,
there are zones with a better defined astrocytic or oligodendroglial
phenotype. In this specimen, however, there are zones of tumor
necrosis and microvascular cellular proliferation.

The findings are interpreted as a glial neoplastic proliferation,
probably mixed oligoastrocytic but predominantly astrocytic, that has
undergone focal anaplastic transformation (WHO grade III).
Microvascular proliferation and mitoses in the WHO classifications of
astrocytomas merit a grade IV category.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP, CD34, p53,
and MIB—l were performed on sections from block #7. The GFAP
demonstrates sparse gliofibrilogenesis by neoplastic cells. The CD34
depicts the rich vascularity within the neoplasm. About 5% of cells
over—express the p53 antigen. With the MIB—l, a proliferation index of
3% is determined in the more cellular areas.
