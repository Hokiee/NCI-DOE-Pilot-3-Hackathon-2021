GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. 4L LYMPH NODES
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and “4L” are two fragments of yellow~tan

soft tissue, 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm and 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm. A touch prep is performed and the
specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis in cassette FSA.

B. 4R LYMPH NODES
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and “4R” are 4 fragments of yellow-tan

soft tissue ranging from 0.1 cm in diameter to 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. A touch prep is performed and
the specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis in cassette FSB.

C. RIGHT UPPER LOBE
Received fresh labeled with the patient’s identification and “right upper lobe” is the product Of a

lung lobectomy, 291—gm and 16.5 x'».13.8 X 5.5 cm. The bronchial margin is entirely submitted
for frozen section. There is a puckered area of pleura with two adjacent 0.2 cm subpleural
nodules along the apical segment. The pleura is inked black overlying this area. On sectioning, a
2.0 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm inﬁltrative, gray-White, gritty tumor is present, invading into but, not through
the pleura. The additional subpleural nodules appear to be bulging extensions of the tumor.
Approximately 90% of the tumor is submitted for procurement. The tumor is at least 8 cm from
the bronchial margin. The parenchyma adjacent to the tumor exhibits bleb formation, up to 0.8
cm in diameter. Bulging into but, not invading into the hilar vein, less than 1 cm from the
margin is a lobulated tumor nodule, 1.3 x 0.7 cm. A second hilar nodule, 2.0 x 1.5 x l.5 cm,
adjacent to the bronchial margin is a lymph node with tumor, exhibiting extranodal extension.
The remaining parenchyma is anthracotic t0 red—brown displaying multifocal, 0.1—0.2 cm, firm
anthracotic nodules, distal to the apical segment tumor. Representative sections:

(ll—frozen section, bronchial margin, shave

C2-C5—remaining tumor/adjacent nodules to closest pleura and parenchyma

C6—bleb adjacent to tumor

C?-hilum, tumor nodule to vessel

C8-C10-hilum, second tumor nodule/lymph node

Cl l—six intraparenchymal nodules, distal to tumors

D. MEDIASTINAL LYMPI—I NODES 4R AND 2R
Received in formalin labeled with the patient’s identiﬁcation and “mediastinal lymph nodes 4R

and 2R” are three tan-pink lymph nodes ranging from, 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm to 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.
Entirely submitted, DI.
