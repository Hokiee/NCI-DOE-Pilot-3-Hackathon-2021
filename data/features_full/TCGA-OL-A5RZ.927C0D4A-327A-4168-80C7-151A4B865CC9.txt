~ Invasive ductal carcinoma, SBR grade III arising in a background of

ductal carcinoma in situ, high nuclear grade, solid type, with central necrosis.

See parameters.

- Uninvolved breast parenchyma with rare microcalciﬁcations associated

with benign acini and focal apocrine metaplasia

Breast Pathologic Parameters
1. Invasive carcinoma:

A. Microscopic measurement: 7mm

B. Composite histologic (modified SBR) grade: III

— Architecture: 3
- Nuclear grade: 3

— Mitotic count: 2

C. Associated intraductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): present

— Intermediate and high nuclear grades, solid type with central necrosis

- Extent of DCIS microscopically is consistent with the 10.2 x 5.4 x 3.5 cm

of non-mass like enhancement seen radiographically.

2. Excisional biopsy margins: Free of tumor

- Invasive carcinoma >1cm from closest margin

- DCIS 8mm from anterior margin, superior aspect
3. Blood vessel and lymphatic invasion: Absent

4. Nipple and skin: Unremarkable

5. Skeletal muscle: Absent

6. Axillary lymph nodes: Negative (0/3)

7 Special studies (invasive component, current specimen)
- ER: weak expression in 30% of cells

- PR: no expression

— Ki—67: 10—20%

- HER2 (FISH): pending

8. pTNM (AJCC, 7th edition, 2010): ple, N0(sn), MX

Clinical History:

The patient is 3 year-old female who presented with an abnormal screening
mammogram on , that revealed a large area of pleomorphic calcifications
biopsied as ductal carcinoma in situ, high grade, solid type with central

necrosis. Left breast MRI on evealed segmental clumped non-mass
enhancement with mixed kinetics measuring 10.2 x 5.4 x 2.5 cm associated with a
lateral biopsy clip. A 0.7 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm mass with washout kinetics, suspicious

for invasive component was seen just posterior to the biopsy clip. The patient

undergoes simple mastectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy and breast

reconstruction.

Specimens Received:
A: Left sentinel lymph node #1
B: Sentinel node #2 left axilla

C: Left breast

Gross Description:
The specimens are received in three containers each labeled with the patient's

name and medical record number.

A. The first container is additionally identified as, 'left sentinel node #1'.

Received fresh for intraoperative diagnosis is a 4.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm segment of
tan-pink fibrofatty tissue that is dissected for lymph node candidates. Frozen
section diagnosis is 'lymph node, no tumor‘ per . The frozen section
remnants are entirely submitted in cassettes A1 FS and A2 F5. The remaining

tissue is entirely submitted in cassettes A3 and A4.

B. The second container is additionally identified as, 'sentinel node #2, left
axilla'. Received fresh for intraoperative diagnosis is a 3 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm

segment of tan-brown rubbery tissue grossly consistent with a lymph node. The

cut section reveals an unremarkable surface. The entire lymph node is frozen.
Post section diagnosis is 'lymph node, no tumor' for '. The frozen

section remnant is entirely submitted in cassette BlFS.

C. The third container is additionally identified as, 'left breast'. Received
fresh and placed in formalin is a 2640 gm mastectomy specimen measuring 32.5 cm
from medial to lateral, 32.5 cm from superior to inferior and 5.3 cm from
anterior to posterior. There is 80 cm long by 0.7-6.5 cm wide tan—brown,
wrinkled skin ellipse on the anterior surface, with ashort suture designating
the superior pole and a long suture designating the lateral pole. The areola
measures 5.5 x 3.5 cm areola and the nipple 1.5 cm in diameter. The nipple
areolar complex displays no evidence of ulceration or retraction. No axillary
tail is present with the specimen. The deep surface is inked black, the
anterior-superior surface blue and the anterior-inferior surface green and the
breast is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 11 slices. There is a

1.1 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm, gray-tan mass in slices 7 and 8, 5.5 cm from black ink and
2.0 cm from blue ink. A metallic clip is identified in slice 7. A 1.5 cm

(greatest dimension) biopsy site is identified, adjacent to the lesion, with a
probable metallic clip (vs. staple) within the node. Additional masses or

nodules are not noted. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

C1-8: Representative sections of lesion, slice 7 and 8 (clip in C1, C3
closest approach to blue ink)
C9: lntramammary lymph node, adjacent to mass, bisected

C10: Representative slice 6, medial to mass

C11: Representative slice 9, lateral to mass
C12: UOQ, slice # 10

C13: UIQ, slice # 3

C14: LOQ slice # 9

C15: LIQ, slice # 2

C16: Representative skin

C17-18: Nipple

Tissue fixed for at least 6 hours in 10% NBF and no more than 72 hours.
