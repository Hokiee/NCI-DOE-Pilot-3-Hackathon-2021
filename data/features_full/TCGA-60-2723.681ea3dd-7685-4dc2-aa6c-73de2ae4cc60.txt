GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. 4R RIGHT DISTAL PARATRACHEAL LYMPH NODE

Received fresh for frozen section is a tan—pink lymph node, 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is

bisected, touch preps are taken and the specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section in FSAl.
B. 4R RIGHT DISTAL PARATRACHEAL LYMPH NODE

Page I of 3

 

  

Received fresh for frozen section is a tan-pink fatty lymph node, 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm. The
specimen is bisected, touch preps are taken and the specimen is submitted entirely for frozen
section in FSBl.

C. 4L LEFT DISTAL PARATRACHBAL LYMPH :NODE

Received fresh for frozen section are multiple tan-pink soft tissue fragments aggregating to 0.8 x
0.4 x 0.3 cm. Touch preps are taken and the specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section in
FSCI. " ' ‘

D. LEVEL 7 SUBCARINAL LYMPH NODE

Received fresh for frozen section are multiple tan—pinkssoft tissue fragments aggregating to 0.6 x
0.4 x 0.3 cm. Touch preps are taken and the specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section in
FSDI.

E. 2R RIGHT PROXIMAL PARATRACHEAL LYMPH NODE

Received fresh for frozen section are multiple pieces of tan-pink soft tissue fragments, 0.6 x 0.4 x
0.3 cm. Touch preps are taken and the specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section in FSEl.

F. RIGHT MIDDLE LOBE
Received fresh is a 73 gm right lobe excision, 14 x 17 x 2.2 cm with stapled margins. The
pleural surface is tan—pink, smooth and remarkable for 2 possible nodules. The bronchial margin
is shaved and submitted for frozen section. The pleural surface is inked blue. The specimen is
serially sectioned to reveal 2 gray-white well circumscribed nodules, 1.5 cm and 2.5 cm in
greatest dimension. The smaller nodule is closest .to the pleural surface at 0.1 cm and is
surrounded by staples. The larger nodule measures 2.0 cm from the bronchial margin. Nodule 1
and nodule 2 measures approximately 0.8 cm away from each other. The area in between the 2
nodules is also firm, possible also involved by tumor. The remainder of the lung parenchyma is
grossly unremarkable. 3 possible hilar lymph nodes are grossly identiﬁed ranging from 0.2 x 0.2
x 0.2 cm to 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. A portion of the Specimen is submitted for tissue procurement.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

F SF]: bronchial margin submitted for frozen section

F2-F 3: nodule #1 (smaller nodule)

F4: section in between nodule #1 and nodule #2

F5—F6: nodule #2

F7-F8: uninvolved lung parenchyma

F9-12: possible peri-bronchial lymph nodes

DIAGNOSIS:

A. 4R RIGHT DISTAL PARATRACHEAL LYMPH NODE, EXCISION:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

B. 4R RIGHT DISTAL PARATRACHEAL LYMPH NODE, EXCISION:
— ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

C. 4L LEFT DISTAL PARATRACHEAL LYMPH NODE, EXCISION'.
~ ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

 

D. LEVEL 7 SUBCARINAL LYMPH NODE, EXCISION:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
E. 2R RIGHT PROXIMAL PARATRACHEAL LYMPH NODE, EXCISION:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
F. RIGHT MIDDLE LOBE, LOBECTOMY:
— SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED,
OVERALL TUMOR SIZE 4.8 CM.
- BRONCHIAL MARGIN, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
- SEE NOTE AND TEMPLATE. ~

NOTE — Thorough examination ofperi-bronchial areas failed to identify any pen-bronchial
lymph nodes.
