Clinical History
The patient is a man with a malignant neoplasm of the bladder. He undergoes a radical
cystoprostatectomy and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection.

Gross Description
The specimen is received in nine parts, each labeled with the patient‘s name and medical record number.

Part A is received fresh and is additionally labeled ‘right ureter." It consists of a single unoriented, irregular
fragment of pink-tan, soft tissue. measuring 0.9 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted for
frozen section diagnosis as FSl, with the frozen section remnant submitted in cassette A1.

Part B is received fresh and is additionally labeled “left ureter."l it consists of a single unoriented, irregular
fragment of pink-tan, soft tissue, measuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted for
frozen section diagnosis as F32. with the frozen section remnant submitted in cassette B1.

Part C is received fresh and is additionally labeled “4 . bladder." it consists of a bladder with a small
portion of prostate, weighing 259 gm and measuring 13.6 cm from superior to inferior. 12.1 cm from right
to left, and 4.0 cm from anterior to posterior. The bladder itself measures 6.3 cm from superior to inferior,
5.5 from right to left. and 5.5 from anterior to posterior. The specimen is inked as follows: green ink
anterior right, blue ink anterior left, and black ink posterior. The bladder is opened from the anterior

aspect to reveal a fungating, tan~wh1te tumorin the inferior leftand right bladder wall: the tumor measures
4.2 cm from superior to inferior, 4.5 cm from right to left, and 1.8 cm from anterior to posterior. 1t
approaches the deep margin within 0.5 cm. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Cassette Cl: Remnant tissue from frozen section (F83).

Cassettes C2cC3: Tumor in relationship to its closest approximation to the inferior, black-inked margin
(0.9 cm).

Cassette C4: Junction with normal mucosa.

Cassette C5: Right anterior.

Cassette C6: Right wall.

Cassette C7: Right anterior.

Cassette C8: Left wall. .

Cassette 09: Tn'gone/inferior bladder with base of prostate.

Cassette 010: Left wall with tumor approaching the inked margin within 0.3 cm grossly.

Cassette C11: Right inferior.

Cassette C12: Left seminal vesicle.

Cassette 013: Right inferior edge, <1 mm from green-inked margin.

Cassette 014: Right seminal vesicle.

Cassettes C15-C16: Candidate lymph nodes.

Part D is additionally labeled "peripelvic fat." it consists of two unoriented, irregularly shaped fragments of
tan-yellow ﬁbrofatty tissue, measuring 2.2 x 1.3 x 0.3 cm and 2.1 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is entirely
submitted in cassettes D1 and D2.

Part E is received in formalin and is additionally labeled '3) Left pelvic lymph node.“ It consists of an
irregularly shaped, unon'entcd ﬁbrofatty lymph node packet, measuring 1.5 x 1.3 x 0.4 cm. The specimen

is entirely submitted in cassettes El through E4, with one bisected lymph node inked in blue in cassette
El.

Part F is received in formalin and is additionally labeled "right pelvic lymph node." [1: consists of multiple
unoriented, irregularly shaped fragments of ﬁbrofatty lymph node packet, measuring 3.2 x 3.6 x 2.1 cm in
aggregate. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes F1 through F4, with F 1 representing a bisected,
blue-inked lymph node.

Part G is received in formalin and is additionally labeled ”urethra-linked end is distal." It consists of a
segment of urethra, measuring 5.7 cm in length and with a diameter ranging between 1.1 cm and 1.5 cm,
with blue ink at one end. The distal half is inked in blue, and the proximal half is inked in yellow.
Representative sections from l-cm intervals are submitted in cassettes 61 through G4 as follows:
Cassette 0.1: Distal blue-inked margin.

Cassette G2: Representative sections from distal half.
Cassette G3: Representative sections from proximal half.
Cassette G4: Yellow-inked proximal resection edge.

Part B is received in formalin and is additionally labeled "8) Final left ureter." It consists of a single
unoriented, irregularly shaped fragment of ureter with attached ﬁbrofatty tissue. The tan-white ureter
measures 0.5 cm in diameter and 0.6 cm in length. The overall dimensions of the specimen with the
attached fibrofatty tissue is 2.5 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is inked in blue, the ureter is bisected and is
submitted in cassette H1, and the remainder of the tissue is entirely submitted in cassette H2.

Part I is received in formalin and is additionally labeled ”#9 ﬁnal right ureter." It consists of a single
unoriented, irregularly shaped fragment of tan~white ureter, measuring 0.3 cm in diameter and 0.6 cm.
The overall dimensions of the specimen with attached fibrofatty tissue is 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The specimen
is inked in blue, sectioned, and entirely submitted in cassette ll.

Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. Final dlag nosls made by attending pathologist
following review of all pathology slides.
