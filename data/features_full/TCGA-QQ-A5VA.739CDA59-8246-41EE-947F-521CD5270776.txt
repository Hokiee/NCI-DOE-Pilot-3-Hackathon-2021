GROSS DESCRIPTION: 59“)
1. OMENTUM:

Received in formalin bottle labelled with patient’s name,

and labelled, "#1, omentum" is a yellow-tan,

hemorrhagic portion of omentum, measuring in overall dimension,
25 .Oxl 1.0x3.0 cm. There are multiple ﬁrm white nodules studding
the entire portion of the omentum and ranging in size from the
largest,5.0x4.0x2.5 cm. to 1.0 cm. in greatest dimension.
Representative sections are taken and submitted in cassettes
labelled, "1A" through "1C."

2. FS#2 PELVIC MASS:

Received are two fragments of yellow-white, ﬁrm tissue measuring
0.8 and 1.1 cm. in greatest dimension, respectively. Both are
submitted in toto as "FSZ."

3. TUMOR FROM 4TH PORTION OF DUODENUM:

Received in formalin bottle labelled with patient’s name,

and labelled, "#3, tumor from 4th portion of

duodenum" is brown—tan, white, ﬁrm, lobulated tumor mass
measuring 12.0x6.0x5.0 cm. in greatest dimension. On cut
section, small portion of duodenum in the center of the lobulated
tumor measures 4.0x3.0x0.5 cm. The mucosal surface appears

grossly normal. Serosal surface is attached to the tumor mass,
but grossly the tumor does not appear to penetrate the mucosa of
the duodenum. The cut surface of the tumor has a firm white-
yellow, gritty appearance grossly. Representative sections are
taken and submitted in cassettes labelled, "3A" through "3C."
4. SMALL BOWEL WITH TUMOR:

Received in formalin bottle labelled with patient's name,

and labelled, “#4, small bowel with tumor" is a

portion of small bowel with attached tumor nodule, measuring
51.0 cm. in length by 6.0x3.0 cm. Tumor mass measures
9.0x8.0x3.5 cm. Mucosal surface appears grossly normal.
The tumor is attached to the serosal surface. Grossly, it does
appear to penetrate through the mucosa of the small bowel. One
portion of the small bowel has an old, well-healed anastomotic
site. Representative sections are taken as follows:

T1 and T2: small bowel adherent to tumor

DM: distal margin

PM: proximal margin

SMl and 8M2: random sections of small bowel

AN: anastomotic site

5. PERI RECTAL SEROSAL NODULE:

Received in formalin bottle labelled with patient's name,

and labelled, "#5, peri rectal serosal nodule“ are

multiple white-tan yellow fragments of fibroadipose tissue and
tumor nodule. The fragments of ﬁbroadipose tissue measure

5.0 cm. in aggregate. The tumor nodule measures 4.5x3.8x2.2 cm.

On cut section, tumor nodule is ﬁrm, white and yellow.
Representative section is taken and submitted as Cassette #5.
