CLINICAL HISTORY: _ _
Abdominal pelvic swelling, ascites. BSA 29 17“
GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Left tube and ovary (AF1)", received fresh for frozen section is a 376

gram, 10 x 8.5 x 4 cm ovary which was received opened and disrupted from the
operating room. There is no recognizable fallopian tube or ovarian tissue and

the entire specimen is composed of solid, tan. papillary friable tissue. The

serosa is grossly intact where it is recognizable. A representative section

was frozen as AFl and the frozen section remnant is submitted in block A1.

Further representative sections are submitted in blocks A2—A8. The serosa is

inked blue in block A2.

,3. "Uterus, cervix, right tube and ovary", received fresh and placed in
formalin is a 204 gram, 12 x 7 x 5.5 cm uterus. The cervix measures 2.5 cm in
length and there is a 1 cm patent 03. The right ovary measures 3 x 2 x 1.4 cm.
and the truncated fallopian tube measures 3 x 0.4 cm; the right tube and ovary
are grossly unremarkable on the exterior surface but sectioning of the ovary
reveals a 1 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm cavitary area filled with tan papillary tissue
which does not extend beyond the ovarian parenchyma. The uterus is grossly
unremarkable except for a 2 x 2 x 1 cm tan friable area at the attachment
point of the left tube and ovary which does not grOssly invade into the
myometrium. The soft tissue margin along the cervix and lower uterine segment
is inked blue.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Bl—BZ- representative sections of tan friable section were left tube and ovary
where attached.

BB” representative sections of grossly anterior cervix.

B4— representative sections of grossly unremarkable posterior cervix.

B5—B6— representative sections of grossly unremarkable fallopian tube along

with representative sections of sectioned ovary.

BTHBB— full thickness, bisected representative section of posterior
endomyometrium with endometrial side in block B7 and serosal side in
block B8.

BSwBlO~ full thickness representative sections of anterior endomyometrium with

1.5 cm intramural leiomyoma.

C. "Left pelvic side well", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 6 x 4 x
3 cm fragment of brownwtan fibroadipose tissue which consists mostly of tan,
friable, papillary tissue. Representative sections are submitted in blocks

Cl-CZ.

D. "Omentum", received fresh and placed in formalin is an 18 x 14 x 7.5 cm
aggregate of brown-tan fibroadipose tissue. There are multiple areas
throughout which are composed of tan, friable, papillary tissue.
Representative sections are submitted in blocks D1-D3.

E. “Tumor nodule left diaphragm", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 5
x 3 x 2.5 cm tan, smooth mass with a small amount of yellow lobulated adipose
tissue attached. Sectioning reveals pale tan—red tissue which is completely
necrotic. Representative sections are submitted in blocks E1-E3.

F. "Small bowel", received fresh and placed in formalin is an unoriented 11 x
3 cm section of small bowel with a 7 x 6 x 3 cm tan, friable, papillary mass
adhered to the serosa. The mass does not penetrate into the mucosa.
Representative sections of the mass are submitted in blocks Fl—F2. The grossly

 

 

 

uninvolved mucosal margins of the unoriented sections of the bowel are
submitted in blocks F3—F4.

,G. "Pelvic tumor", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 7 x 5 x 4 cm
fragment of unoriented brown—tan fibroadipose tissue with multiple areas of
tan, friable, papillary tissue. Representative sections are submitted in

blocks G1—G2.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
A. "Left tube and ovary": AF1~ consistent with papillary serous carcinoma

 
 

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: bilateral salpingo~oophorectomy, hysterectomy and partial small
bowel resection.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE {AJCC 6th Edition): pT3C pNX pMX

NOTE: Information on atholo sta e and the o erative procedure is

accreditation by the Pathology stage is based solely

upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.
