ADDENDA:
Addendum
Molecular Anatomic Pathology resting:
Block 3A, microdissection target 1 (Tl): '
A. Loss of heterozygoeity is IDENTIFIED at chromosome Sq (37%).
3. Fractional Allelic Loss is 8% (1 locus with loss/12 informative loci).
Block 43. microdissection target 2 (T2):
A. Loss of heterozygosity is IDENTIFIED at chromosome 19 (32%).
3. Fractional Allelic Loss is as (l locus with loss/12 informative loci).

Note:

L08 0: high amplitude is considered when more than 75% of cellular DNA is
affected.

Loss of heterozygoeity of tumor suppressor gene alleles is known to occur in
liver neoplasias and to correlate with tumor progression. As reported in the
literature, benign neoplasms (hepatic adenoma and focal nodular hyperplssia)

fractional allele loss ~30?) (1,2).

PAL or <30t are associated with indolent biological behavior and PAL 0! >30}
with an aggressive biological behavior(3-5). LOH mutations are reported as
high amplitude when more than 75% of cellular DNA is affected. Some see with
low amplitude LOH mutations and PAL 25-35 I considered to be indeterminate
biological behavior. However, not all tumors reveal such a correlation and.
theretore, the Lou profile should be interpreted in the context of the
cytologic and histologic Eindings and the patient' s clinical history.

Sample Preparation and Lou Analysis

Manual microdiesection of the tissue sample was performed to include tumor
tissue and normal adjacent tissue (it available) or a blood sample. DNA was
isolated using standard laboratory procedure. Specimens with the minimum of
50! or tumor cells in a microdissection target are accepted for the analysis.
Optical density readings were obtained.

Eighteen microsatellitc markers (listed below) that have been previously found
to be involved in liver neoplasia and/or co-localize with known tumor
suppressor genes were used for analysis. PCR was performed using

fluorescently labeled primers and the products of amplitication were detected
using capillary electrophoresis on ABI3730 platform. Relative fluorescence was
determined for individual alleles and the ratio of peaks was calculated

. Normal tissue was examined to determine whether the
patient is heterozygous at the marker (genetically informative) and neoplastic
tissue was then analyzed to detect loss of heterozygosity. Thresholds for
significant allelic imbalance were determined using normal (non-neoplastic)
specimens for every marker. Loss of heterozygoeity was determined using (NL /
NS)/ (TL/TS) formula and reported when allelic ratio tor a particular marker
was below 0.5 or above 2.0. when normal tissue was not available, peak height ‘
ratios falling outside of 2 SDI beyond the mean for each polymorphic allele
paring were assessed as showing loss of heterozygosity.
