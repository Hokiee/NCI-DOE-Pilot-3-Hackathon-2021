=e== ROSS DESCRIPTION: ====================
FL; Received in formalin is a kidney with attached'peri renal adipose
issue and adrenal glands. The specimen weighs 1,204 grams and measures 24.0
‘x 15.0 x 7.0 cm in overall dimensions. ‘The kidney measures 11.0 cm from
.superior to inferior, 8.5 cm from medial to lateral. and 4.5 cm from anterior
to posterior. The kidney weighs 350 grams. Located at the hilum is a 1.3 cm
in length x 0.4 cm in diameter portion of artery which is adjacent to a
portion of renal vein which is bifurcated and measures 2.0 cm in length x 0.3
cm in diameter. The ureter measures 10.0 cm in length x 0.2 cm in diameter.
The external surface consists of a large amount of bosseiated-tan—yellow
perirenal adipose tissue. On sectioning. a fairly well circumscribed mass is
identified within the lower pole which measures 5.5 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm in overall
dimension. The cut surface consists of soft, diffusely congested, red golden
yellow tissue with scattered irregular, gray—tan, cystic areas. The solid
tissue comprises approximately 60% of the cut surface and the cystic portion
40%. The lesion lies subjacent to the renal pelvis and shows possible focal
extension into the adjacent hilar fat. This focal extension is located
adjacent to a portion of the renal artery. The mass involves 50% of the lower
pole and also shows irregular satellite lesions composed of soft golden
yellow—red tissue which range in size from 0.2 to 0.8 cm in greatest
dimension. The mass is located 4.0 cm from the renal artery/renal vein
margin. The mass measures 1.0 cm from the radial soft tissue margin. The
capsule surrounding the mass strips with ease.‘ The remainder of the renal
parenchyma is pink—brown with a distinct corticomedullary junction. The
cortex measures 0.5 cm in thickness and the medulla measures 1.2 cm in
thickness. The cortical surface is pink—tan. smooth and glistening. The

glistening. and does not appear involved by the lesion. The renal artery is
yellow—tan and focally calcified. On sectioning through the hilum. a 0.8 cm
possible pink~tan lymph node is identified. The adrenal gland measures
approximately 2.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. On sectioning. the cut surface consists of
golden yellow parenchyma. Sectioning is otherwise unremarkable.
Representative sections are submitted in eleven cassettes as follows:
_ cassette 1 - vascular and ureterai margin; cassette 2 - mass with overlying
pelvic mucosa; cassettes-3 through 5 — mass. with possible extension into
. pelvic fat in cassette 3; cassettes 6 and 7 ~ satellite lesions; cassettes 8
.and 9 ~ upper and lower pole uninVOlved; cassette 10 — adrenal gland; cassette
11 — additional adrenal gland_and possible lymph node.“

meme ICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTEON: ==============

“1 The tumor consists of cells with abundant ciear cytoplasm. Nuclei are
mo erately large with very irregular contours. Some have a moderately coarse
chromatin pattern with prominent nucleoli. The tumor has a lobulated pattern
and is present multifocally. Some areas of tumor necrosis are present. Tumor
extends into the peripelvic fat of the renal sinus. Extensive involvement of
large veins is present. Areas of prominent calcification and thickening of
renal artery are present. No involvement of vessels from the hilar margin is
seen, The parenchyma adjacent to some of the tumor has extensive numbers of
globally sclerotic glomeruli with chronic inflammation. The grossly described
satellite lesions consist-of tumor within veins. No lymph node is present.
The adrenal gland is normal in appearance. The other tissue with adrenal. in
slide 11. consists of abundant ganglion cells. The renal parenchyma away from
tumor shows little pathologic change. Some areas with globally sclerotic
glomeruli are present however most glomeruli are within normal limits. In
addition, there are some areas of interstitial fibrosis and there is some
arterial wall thickening.
