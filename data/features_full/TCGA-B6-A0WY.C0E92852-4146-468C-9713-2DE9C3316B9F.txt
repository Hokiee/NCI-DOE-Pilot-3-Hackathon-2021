CLINICAL HISTORY:
Breast lesion.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Left breast excision, long lateral, short superior", in formalin. The

specimen consists of a 9.5 x 8.8 x 2.3 cm sample of firm, white, fibroadipose

tissue with an attached skin ellipse measuring 4.8 x 0.7 cm. The skin

includes a 3.5 cm scar. The specimen is inked as follows: superior margin

blue; inferior margin black; deep surgical margin green. The specimen is d
sectioned serially from medial to lateral revealing a firm, white, scirrhous

lesion diffusely involving the entire specimen and extending to all margins.

There are focal areas of punctate hemorrhage and cyst formation.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

A1 representative sample of tissue from extreme medial portion of sample.
A2—A6 representative slices of tissue through mid medial portion of sample
showing approach to all surgical margins, divided into five portions.

A7-All representative slice of tissue taken from mid—lateral portion of
sample, showing approach to all surgical margins, divided into five portions.
A12 representative sample of tissue taken from extreme lateral portion of
sample.

B. "Axillary dissection", fresh. The specimen consists of a 7.5 x 7.0 x 2.0
cm sample of fibroadipose tissue. Several sutures are attached, however, the
specimen is unoriented. Twenty—one lymph node candidates were identified
(% within the samples. The largest measures 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm and is firm in
conSIStency. “5453c-9713-ZDE9c331639F
