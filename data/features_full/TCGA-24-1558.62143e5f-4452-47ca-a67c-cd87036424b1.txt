***Report Electronically Reviewed and Signed Out By

Intraoperative Consultation: An intraoperative non—microscopic consultation was obtained and
interpreted as: Specimen weighs 110 grams.”

FSlA: Left ovary, excision ~ “Carcinoma,"—
FSlB: Endometrial polyp “ “Benign endometrial polyp, "_,

MicroscOpic Description and Comment: Histological sections of both ovaries show a poorly
differentiated carinoma, consistent with serous adenocarcinoma, in which the tumor cells

are arranged predominantly in sheets. with occasional slit—like to rounded glandular

spaces. The epithelial nature of the neoplasm is substantiated by positive immunostains for
panucytokeratin and EMA, while immunostains for vimentin and inhibin are negative in the
tumor cells. The tumor is present on the serosal surface of the uterus, with Epcal extension
into the underlying myometrium. The endometrial cavity is not involved. Extensive metastatic
deposits are present in the omentum. The soft tissue around the appendix is also involved

by carcinoma. Areas of tumor in the omentum display psammoma bodies. The endometrium shows
cystic atrophy with a single large endometrial polyp 6?.5 Cm) with no areas of malignancy.

   

History: The patient is a Qith ascites, ovarian mass, multiple nodules
in abdomen, pleural effusion and abdominal pain. Operative procedure: Laparotomy, total
abdominal hysterectomy. bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy, tumor debulking, omentectomy,
appendectomy.

 

Specimen(s) Received:
A: UTERUS,CERVIX,BOTH TUBES AND OVARIES
B: OMENTUM, ROUTINE
C: APPENDIX

Gross Description The specimens are received in three formalin—filled containers, each
labeled with the patient's name. The first container is labeled “uterus, cervix, both tubes
and ovaries.“ It consist of a 110 gram previously opened uterus with attached ovaries_

and tubes. The right ovary measures 3.5 X 2.5 x 1.8 cm and has been previously opened.

The external surface and parenchyma is tanwbrown to grey, nodular, and friable. The

right fallopian tube measures 4.5 cm in length and up to 0.7 cm in diameter. The external
surface has multiple cysts ranging from less than 0.1 to 0.4 cm. Sections of the tube

show unremarkable luminal surface. The left ovary measures 2.3 x 1.4 x 0.8 cm and external
surface is tan—pink, smooth with a lobulated appearance. Sections show a tan—pink. firm
parenchyma grossly involved by tumor. No normal ovarian parenchyma is identified. The

left fallopian tube measures 3.5 cm in length and up to 0.6 cm in diameter and is grossly
unremarkable. Sections show unremarkable luminal surface. The uterus measures 10.3 cm in
length, 4.3 cm cornu~t0"cornu and 3.4 cm anteroposteriorly. The serosal surface is tan—pink
and smooth with 0.1 to 0.2 cm subserosal cystic lesion. The cervix measures 3 cm in length
and up to 2.5 cm in width and is grossly unremarkable. The endocervical canal measures 2.5
cm in length and up to 1.3 cm in diameter and is grossly unremarkable. The endometrial
cavity measures 4 cm in length and up to 3.8 cm in width and has a single, 7.5 x 3.5 x

1.5 cm tan—pink, firm fleshy polyp adherent to the posterior endometrium and fundus. The
rest of the endometrium is unremarkable and is up to 0.1 cm thick. The myometrium contains

a single, 1.4 cm in diameter leiomyoma and posterior surface. The rest of the myometrium

is unremarkable and is up to 1.5 cm thick. Labeled A1 to A3 — right ovary; A4 ~ right
fallopian tube; A5 to A7 — entire left ovary; A8 H left fallopian tube; A9 H anterior
cervix; A10 H anterior endomyometrium; A11 - pesterior cervix and lower uterine segment;

A12 k posterior endomyometrium full thickness; A13 H endometrial polyp with section of
posterior endometrium: A14 to A24 — entire endometrial polyp (21, 22 and 23 with endometrium
at fundus). Also received in the same container are two cassettes, the first is labeled
FSlA and contains a 1x0.9x0.1cm tan firm tissue fragment. Labelled A25. The second cassette
is labelled FSlB and contains two, 1cm and l.8xlx0.1cm tan grey , firm tissue fragment.

The second container is labeled "omentum," and contains a 28.5 x 13.5 x 2 cm yellow—pink

segment of omentum. The external surface has multiple tan—pink to white firm nodules ranging

from less than 1 cm to 1.5 cm. Sections show the entire omentum to be tan-white and firm and

grossly involved by tumor. No normal fat is identified.

[

The third container is labeled “appendix," and contains an 8 cm long, up to 0.6 cm in
diameter appendix with attached up to 1.5 cm of fat. The serosa and muscularis are missing
for a length of 3.4 cm, from 1.8 cm proximal to the tip to 2 cm distal to the resection
margin. The serosal surface of the rest of the appendix is tan—pink with multiple firm
nodules. Sections show unremarkable luminal surface of the appendix with tan—white firm
tumor mass in the adjacent fat. Labeled Cl — section of appendix at tip and luminal random
section.
