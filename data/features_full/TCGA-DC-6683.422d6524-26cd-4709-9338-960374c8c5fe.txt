Gross Description:

1). The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "Sigmoid and upper rectum
including portion of left abdominal wall, left vas deferens, and gonadal
vessel." It consists of a rectosigmoid colon that measures 29 cm in length
and 8.5 cm in circumference at the distal margin. The serosal surface has a
4.5 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm soft tissue mass attached. Identified adjacent to the
mass is 5.0 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm tubular structure consistent with vas deferens.
The surface of the mass is inked blue, and the radial resection margin is
inked black. The specimen is opened to reveal a tumor that is located 9.5 cm
from the proximal margin and 13.0 cm from the distal margin. The tumor
measures 4.0 cm in length and 2.1 cm in width and has raised rolled borders.
Serial sectioning reveals that the tumor invades through the serosa into the

soft tissue mass. The tumor invasion extends to a depth of 3.0 cm, which is
0.4 cm from the surface of the soft tissue mass and 7.0 from the closest
radial margin. The adipose tissue surrounding the tumor is indurated. The
remaining mucosa is tan-pink with normal folds. Pericolic and peri-rectal
adipose tissue is submitted for lymph node dissection, and all possible
nodes are submitted. Representative sections are submitted. TPS is
submitted. Gross photographs are taken.

Summary of sections:

PM - proximal margin

DM - distal margin

RM - radial margin

VD--possible vas deferens (block 7 possible vas deferens margin)
WM--whole mount

SM--soft tissue mass

T - tumor

A--adipose tissue adjacent to tumor

U - uninvolved mucosa

S1--serially sectioned lymph node adjacent to tumor
Bl--bisected lymph node adjacent to tumor

LN - lymph nodes

BLN - bisected lymph node

2). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Distal anastomotic ring,"
and consists of a ring of pink tan soft tissue measuring 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm.
Multiple sutures and staples are attached. The mucosal surface is pink tan
and focally hemorrhagic. The sutures and staples are removed, and the soft
tissue is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U - undesignated

3). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Proximal anastomotic
ring," and consists of a silver metal anastomotic pin measuring 7.5 x 2.8 x
1.5 cm. At the center of the pin, a white plastic piece is noted. A ring
of pink tan soft tissue is attached measuring 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The mucosal
surface is pink tan and focally hemorrhagic, and the serosal surface is pink
tan and smooth. Several sutures and staples are noted. The sutures and
staples are removed, and the soft tissue is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U - undesignated

Addendum Diagnosis
#1) SITE: LARGE BOWEL

- Immunohistochemical stains for DNA mismatch repair proteins have been
performed. The results are as follows:

MLH1: staining present in tumor
MSH2: staining present in tumor
MSH6: staining present in tumor
PMS2: staining present in tumor

Conclusion: Immunohistochemical staining for the tested DNA mismatch repair
proteins is retained in the tumor.

Some of the immunohistochemistry and ISH tests were developed and their
performance characteristics were determined by the Department of Pathology.
They have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is
not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not
be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified
under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of -(CLIA ' - as
qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.
