Papillary thyroid cancer.

Gross Description

Specimen Material: A- Total thyroidectomy and pretracheal lymph node, B—
Right paratracheal lymph node for permanent, C- Left paratracheal lymph node
for permanent.

The case is received in three parts labeled with the patient’s name, medical record number and
given accession numbei '

p and it is accompanied by a requisition form labeled with the same name
and same accession number.

Part A: The specimen is received in one container labeled as "TOTAL
THYROIDECTOMY PRETRACHEAL LYMPH NODE". The specimen is a 160 gram, 9.8
cm

right to left, 6.4 cm superior to inferior, and 1.7 cm medial to lateral

total thyroid with a possible attached node measuring 3.5 x 2.4 x 1.1 cm.
The surface of the thyroid is tan-red to tan-brown, multinodular, hard and
hyperemic. There are no parathyroid glands identiﬁed. The specimen is
inked blue anterior and black deep. The right lobe at the inferior aspect
displays a tan—red to tan-brown, ﬁnely nodular ovoid, peripheral
calciﬁcation smooth and glistening 2.1 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm abutting the margin.
The left lobe displays a 0.3 cm tan-white to tan-yellow calciﬁcation
abutting the superﬁcial surface. The isthmus displays tan-pink ﬁrm tissue
measuring 3.0 x 2.6 x 1.6 cm with 0.4 cm calciﬁcation, 0.2 cm from the
superﬁcial surface. The possible lymph node is 2.4 x 2.3 x 1.3 cm with a
cut surface tan-yellow to tan-gray, ﬁne nodular, ﬁbroadipose tissue. No
hemorrhage or necrosis are identiﬁed.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

A1: right lobe superior, uninvolved

A2: right lobe middle area of calciﬁcation

A3: right lobe tumor to margin

A4: left lobe superior, uninvolved

A5: left lobe medial calciﬁcation of possible additional tumor
A6: left lobe inferior, bisected slice

A7-A9: isthmus, additional tumor

A10: possible additional lymph node

Al l-A12: largest, possible node bisected with tan nodular tissue

Part B: The specimen is received in formalin labeled as "RIGHT PARATRACHEAL
LYMPH NODES FOR PERMANENT". The specimen consists of a tan-yellow to
tan-brown multinodular, ﬁrm piece of adipose tissue measuring 3.1 x 2.4 x

0.3 cm. Six possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed measuring from 1.0 x 0.7 x

0.2 cm to 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm. Two lymph nodes are bisected and the cut

surface displays a tan-yellow a tan-brown irregular surface.

Representative sections are submitted as follows: two bisected possible

lymph nodes in cassette Bl , two possible lymph nodes in cassette BZ, and two
possible lymph nodes in cassette B3.

Part C: The specimen is received in formalin labeled as "LYMPH NODE, PART
C". The specimen consists of tan-yellow to tan-pink, 1.6 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm,

ﬁrm multinodular piece of adipose tissue. Two possible lymph nodes are
identiﬁed measuring 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm and 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.1 cm.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

C1: one possible lymph node
C2: one possible lymph node
