DIAGNOSIS:
AMENDED REPORT

Report is amended to correct formatting issues. The diagnosis
remains unchanged.

CASE AMENDED: to report the final diagnosis on parts A
and B after outside consultation.

A. Left renal vein, thrombectomy:
Papillary renal cell carcinoma.
B. Left kidney and para—aortic lymph nodes: ~ f)
Papillary renal cell carcinoma (4.2 cm), type 2, invading into BMTSS, Mara—<5 ".
wall of renal vein and into perinephric/periadrenal adipose tissue. 90%
Margins, free of tumor.
Metastatic carcinoma to multiple hilar lymph nodes.

Renal synoptic report:

Procedure/laterality: Left radical nephrectomy and para-aortic
lymphadenectomy.

Histologic type: Papillary renal cell carcinoma, type 2.

Nuclear grade (Fuhrman, 1-4): 4.

Tumor size: 4.2 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm.

Tumor site: Lower pole.

Tumor focality: Unifocal.

Sarcomatoid features: Present (5—10%).

Tumor necrosis: Present (10% of tumor).

Macroscopic extent of tumor: Tumor involves renal vein and
perinephric (including periadrenal) adipose tissue.

Microscopic tumor extension: Tumor involves wall of renal vein
and invades perinephric and periadrenal adipose tissue.

Surgical margins: Free of tumor.

Lymphovascular invasion: Present.

Lymph nodes: Metastatic carcinoma to multiple (matted) hilar
lymph nodes. No extranodal extension identified.

taken).

Blocks containing malignancy suitable for additional testing:

C. Left common iliac lymph nodes, excision:

Metastatic carcinoma to one lymph node (1/1).
No extranodal extension identified.

D. Descending colon and sigmoid, segmental resection:
Segment of colon with serosal fibrovascular adhesions.

DIAGNOSIS COMMENT:
This supplemental report is being issued to provide the final
diagnosis for parts A and B after consultation with

and after performing a FISH study to rule out Xp1l.2
translocation-associated renal cell carcinoma.

The tumor exhibits a predominant papillary architecture, lined by
cells with a variably eosinophilic to clear cytoplasm. Areas with
solid pattern of growth, also with clear cell features, are present.
Scattered calcifications are seen. Within the solid areas, some
tumor cells exhibit spindling and atypia, compatible with focal
sarcomatoid de—differentiation. lmmunohistochemical stains for the
tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin 7, EMA (focal), racemase
(p504s), vimentin and PAX—8 (focal). A stain for p63 is negative.
The overall cytoarchitectural features and immunohistochemical
profile are compatible with a papillary renal cell carcinoma, type
2. Although focal areas are suggestive of Xpll translocation
carcinoma, the immunohistochemical profile (positivity for EMA and
cytokeratin 7) do not support this impression, and FISH for the
detection of rearrangement of the TFE3 gene locus at chromosome
Xp11.2 is negative. Please see their report for full
details.

....Original Diagnosis Comment....
The morpholoqic features of the tumor are unusual. The tumor
exhibits a predominant papillary architecture, lined by cells with a

Page 4 of 8

Page 5 of 8

variably eosinophilic to clear cytoplasm. Areas with solid pattern
of growth, also with clear cell features, are present. Scattered
calcifications are seen. Within the solid areas, some tumor cells
exhibit spindling and atypia; however, no definitive sarcomatoid
de‘differentiation is identified.

lmmunohistochemical stains for the tumor cells are positive for
cytokeratin 7, EMA (focal), racemase (p504s), vimentin and PAX—B
(focal). A stain for p63 is negative.

The overall cytoarchitectural features and immunohistochemical
profile are compatible with a renal cell carcinoma; subtyping of the
tumor is difficult. The tumor predominantly exhibits features of a
papillary renal cell carcinoma (type 2). Although focal areas are
suggestive of Xpll translocation carcinoma, the immunohistochemical
profile (positivity for EMA and cytokeratin 7) do not support this
impression. This case will be sent to for
expert consultation. Their findings and final diagnosis will be
reported in a supplemental report.

including the surrounding perinephric fat and attached periaortic
lymph node tissue. The kidney without attached fat is 295 g and 12.5
x 8 x 6.5 cm. The attached ureter is 10 x 1 cm. The kidney has a
circumscribed exophytic mass in the lower pole that is 4.2 x 3.5 x
3.5 cm. The mass grossly appears to extend into the adjacent
perinephric fat. There is not definitive gross extension beyond
Gerota's fascia. The tumor does not definitively extend into the
renal sinus fat. The hilar vasculature and intrarenal vessels are
thrombosed. The renal vein also contains thrombus and is somewhat
suggestive of tumor thrombus. The leading edge of the thrombus
within the renal vein is rounded and the margin is not grossly
involved by tumor. Within the hilar soft tissue and adjacent 5
tissue is a matted mass of tumor—replaced lymph nodes. This is up to
14 x 5.5 x 5 cm. Additional tumor nodules are identified within the
perinephric fat and immediately adjacent to the attached adrenal
gland. The renal pelvis is hyperemic and slightly granular; however,
there is no grossly evident mass. Sampled in nineteen cassettes
