DIAGNOSIS:

UTERUS (abdominal hysterectomy):
Endometrial adenocarcinoma, polypoid

—High grade with serous features
—Focal invasion into the very superficial myometrium
—Dense lymphoid infiltrate within tumor
—Cervix negative for carcinoma

Multiple myomas

Adenomyosis

OVARIES AND FALLOPIAN TUBES (resection):
Negative for carcinoma

Thecosis, ovaries

Small fibrothecoma, right ovary

Small dermoid cyst, left ovary

No significant histologic changes, tubes

OMENTUM (biopsies):
Negative for carcinoma

LYMPH NODES, pelvic, periaortic/precaval (excision):
Negative for carcinoma

RIGHT GUTTER (biopsy):
Negative for carcinoma

HISTORY: Uterine carcinoma

MICROSCOPIC:

A-L. Omental fat with small foci of fibrosis, few small lymphoid
aggregates, and small foci of reactive mesothelial cell hyperplasia.
Suture (K). No metastatic carcinoma seen.

M-FF,OO. High grade mullerian adenocarcinoma with serous fea ures
com rises the entire endometrial polypoid lesion. The tumor shows
solid, micropapillary, acinar, and fused acinar patterns. Relatively
small areas show clear cell change; cytoplasmic material in some
other tumor cells suggests mucin. A dense lymphoid/lymphoplasmacytic

with tubular, cystic, and some ciliated metaplastic glands.
Adenomyosis, focally cystic, and several leiomyomas (submucosal,
intramural, and subserosal) without histologic atypia. Hyalinization
and focal calcification within some myoma profiles. Mild chronic
cervicitis with several mucus cysts, focal microglandular

-hyperplasia, and tubal/ciliated metaplasia in occasional

endocervical glands. The cervix, parauterine vessels, adnexae, and
soft tissues appear Clear of tumor. Both ovaries show nodular
thecosis, corpora albicantia, a few dystrophic cortical
calcifications, and small cysts. The right ovary contains a small
collagenized fibrothecoma (R) and the left ovary contains a small
mature cystic teratoma/dermoid with respiratory and apocrine type
epithelium, seromucinous glands, and histiocytic reaction in
relation to small cysts that are devoid of an epithelial lining. A

GG—MM. Varying degrees and combinations of fatty changee, sinus
histiocytosis, fibrosis, and dystrophic calcification in lymph node
profiles. Lymph nodes are present in all specimens. No metastatic

NN. Fibroadipose tissue. No lymph node. No tumor seen.

7: UTERUS, BOTH TUBES AND OVARIES
Labeled ”uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries", received in the

The uterus measures 8.5 cm from ectocervix to fundus, 8 cm from
cornu to cornu, and 5 cm anterior to posterior. The right fallopian
tube measures 5 cm in length and 0.3 to 0.6 cm in diameter. The
serosal surface of the fallopian tube is pink—tan and unremarkable.

Sectioning reveals multiple corpora albicantia. No areas suggest
tumor. The left fallopian tube measures 6.5 cm in length and 0.3 to
0.6 cm in diameter. The serosal surface is unremarkable. Sectioning
reveals a pinpoint lumen and a 0.2 to 0.3 cm thick wall. The left
ovary measures 2 x 1.3 x 1 cm and has a yellow-tan, slightly
corrugated surface. Cut section shows a 0.8 cyst with a smooth
lining. No areas suggest tumor. The serosal surface of the uterus
is distorted by multiple subserosal leiomyomata ranging from 1.5 to
4.5 x 4 cm in diameter. The cervix measures 2.5 cm in length and
3.5 cm in diameter at the ectocervix. The external os measures 0.7
x 0.5 cm. The ectocervical mucosa is pale tan—pink with focal
hemorrhage around the external 0s. The endocervical canal measures
2.5 cm in length and is lined by a pink—tan mucosa with multiple
nabothian cysts. The endometrial cavity measures 3.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm
and is distorted by multiple leiomyomata, one of which is submucosal
and 2.6 cm in diameter; it has a tan—white whorled cut surface

polypoid pink-tan tumor with pink granular surface. Myometrial
invasion is not apparent on cut section. The uninvolved endometrium
measures up to 0.1 cm in thickness. The myometrium ranges from 0.7
