Gross Description:
Five parts

Container labeled ‘-1 - right lower lobe wedge #1"
is a previously sectioned wedge shaped portion of recognizable
pulmonary parenchyma with a closed staple line as the margin of
resection. The specimen as received weighs 4.3 grams and on
reconstruction measures approximately 4.5 x 1,6 x 1.4 cm. The
pleura is wrinkled gray red. The cut surface is rubbery to spongy
and pink red without discrete gross mass lesion. The portion
submitted for frozen section is reported as "no neoplasm consistent
with organizinq pneumonia" reported to ____- Positive

wrinkled gray pink with an eccentric 2.5 x 2.5 cm plaque like area
of tan gray discoloration and umbilication noted 0.8 cm from the
nearest staple line margin. This is sectioned to reveal a well
deﬁned iobulated gritty gray tan fibrotlc lesion with focally
anthracotic gritty gray tan ﬁbrotic cut surface measuring 2.7 x 2.5
x 2.0 cm. This grossly extends to but not through the pleura. The
remaining parenchyma is spongy and pink red. The portion submitted
for frozen section is reported as "adenocarcinoma" reported to Dr.

_ , ositive patient in. by Dr.‘ in addition. there
are three tissue cassettes within the specimen container labeled

The frozen residue is submitted labeled A. The

remaining lesion and surrounding tissue is submitted labeled B-H.
Representative remaining parenchyma is submitted labeled l-J.

Container labeled ’“3 - right upper lobe wedge“

has a 15 gram wedge shaped portion of recognizable pulmonary
parenchyrna with a closed staple line as the margin of resection.

The specimen is 6.0 x 3.0 x 2.1 cm. The pleura is slightly wrinkled
pink red with marked anthracotic streaking and a few areas of
apparent plaque like thickening up to 0.8 cm which are poorly

defined. On sectioning in the central portion of the specimen there

is an intraparenchymai 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm lobuiated gray tan

ﬁbrotic nodular lesion noted 0.4 cm from the nearest staple line
margin. This has a gritty gray tan ﬁbrotic cut surface. The

remaining parenchyma is spongy congested and markedly anthracotic
streaked with moderate honeycombing. The specimen is also sectioned
and entirely submitted in 10 cassettes.

Container labeled '-4 - level 4 lymph node" are
1.6 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm of gray brown to black fleshy tissue fragments
which are entirely submitted in a single cassette.

Container labeled ’— 5 — level 7 lymph node“ are
4.0 x 2.2 x 1.1 cm partially fragmented lobuiated portion of ﬂeshy
grey black tissue with a slightly mottled ﬂeshy grey black out
surface. This is received along with 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm of similar
irregular tissue fragments. The largest portion is sectioned and
submitted labeled A-E while the smaller portion is entirely
submitted labeled F.

Microscopic Description:

Sections of specimen #2 show a large cell malignant neoplasm that in
areas shows prominent gland formation. These glandular area blend
into more solid nests of neoplastic cells. These are supported by a
dense fibrous stroma and alternate with areas of necrosis. The
neoplasm extends into the pleural but not onto the pleural surface.

Sections of the neoplasm within the right upper lobe specimen #3
show a large cell malignant neoplasm with a distinctly different
growth pattern. in this neoplasm the cells form sheets that have
irregular borders. The cells have a moderate amount of eosinophilic
cytoplasm and enlarged pieornorphic nuclei.

Sections of the lymph node specimens show no areas of metastatic
carcinoma.

lmmunohistochemical stains are performed on the neoplasm in the
right lower lobe specimen and right upper lobe specimen. The right

 

lower lobe specimen shows the neoplasm to be positive for CK? and
negative for CK20. Some of the cells are strongly positive for

Tl’F1. These are in the more glandular areas. The more solid areas
are negative for this marker. The more solid areas do express
positivity for CDX«2 where the glandular areas tend to be negative
for this marker. The cells are negative for p63. This staining

pattern would support this being an adenocercinoma of pulmonary
origin. It is unclear why some of the cells mark with the

colorectal marker CDX-2. This same panel performed on the right
upper lobe specimen show the neoplastic cells to be negative for
both CK7 and CK20. The cells are negative for CDX‘Z and TTF1. The
cells are strongly positive for p63. This staining pattern would
support this being a squamous carcinoma that is very poorly
differentiated. The immunohistochemical control slides stain
appropriately.

Final Diagnosis
Right lung lower lobe wedge biopsy #1 with frozen section:
Negative for carcinoma.
Alveolar changes focally with pneumocyte hyperplasia consistent

Comments >

The tumor morphoiogy present in specimen three shows focal areas
with morphoiogy compaﬁbie with a pocriy differentiated
adenocarcinoma. The possibiiity of focal squamous differentiation
cannot be comp|etely excluded.
