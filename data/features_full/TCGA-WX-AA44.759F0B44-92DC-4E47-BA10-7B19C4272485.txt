SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

 

   

Clinical History and impression:
Hepatocellular carcinoma.

 

Specimen(s) Received:
LEFT LATERAL SEGMENT LIVER

FINAL DIAGNOSIS
1) LIVER, LEFT LATERAL SEGMENT, PARTIALLY HEPATECTOMY:

 

- HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, MODERATELY TO POORLY

( DIFFERENTIATED, ARISING IN A BACKGROUND OF MINIMALLY ACTIVE
‘ CIRRHOSIS

- 3.5 CM IN DIAMETER V

— NO VASCULAR INVASION IDENTIFIED .

— MARGIN OF RESECTION AND VASCULAR MARGIN NEGATIVE FOR
CARCINOMA

- NON-NEOPLASTIC LIVER WITH MICRONODULAR CIRRHOSIS, OF
*INDETERMINATE ETIOLOGY WITH MILD ACTIVITY, SEE NOTE

- PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 2010, 7TH ED.): pT‘I NX (AT LEAST STAGE I)
~ SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT

NOTE: The uninvolved hepatic parenchyma exhibits architecture distorted by ﬁne ﬁbrotic
septa surrounding nodules of regenerative hepatocytes. The septa have a moderately
severe lymphocytic infiltrate and there is focal mild interface hepatitis. There is minimal
macrovesicular steatosis. Iron stain is negative. DPAS stain shows no evidence of
alpha-1—antri-trypsin accumulation. The inflammatory infiltrate and the near absence of

steatosis are not typical of NAFLD-induced cirrhosis and raise questions regarding the
etiology of the cirrhosis.

Gross Specimen Gross Specimen

Gross Description:

Received fresh labeled with the patient's name. "left lateral segment liver" is a 270 g, 15.0 x 10.0 x 4.5 cm segment of liver
with a 10.0 x 5.0 cm unremarkable cauterized resection margin with a 0.4 cm segment of unremarkable vascular margin. -
The smooth capsule exhibits multiple tan-white nodules which measure 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm in aggregate Upon sectioning.
contiguous with the aforementioned nodule. is a 3.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm well delineated nodular lesion coming to within 1.5 cm
the black Inked resection margin. The remaining parenchyma is ten brown and slightly nodular with the nodules ranging

 

from 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections of the tumor and uninvolved parenchyma are saved

for ancillary studies. Representative sections are submitted in 5 cassettes, with the en face vascular margin in cassette
one. and the uninvolved parenchyma in cassette 5.
