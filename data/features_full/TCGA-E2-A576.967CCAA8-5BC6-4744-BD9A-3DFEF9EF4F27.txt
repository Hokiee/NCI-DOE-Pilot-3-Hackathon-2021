CLINICAL HISTORY:
Leﬁ breast inﬁltrating lobular carcinoma with Nottingham grade 2; LCIS with
comedonecrosis at the 2:00 position. Ultrasound revealed 12 mm x 15 mm 9 mm lesion.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:
A-excisional biopsy left breast needle localized: Lesion identiﬁed 0.5 cm (gross) from
superior margin. Diagnosis called by Dr. to Dr.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. BREAST, LEFT, NEEDLE LOCALIZATION WIDE LOCAL EXCISION:
- MULTIFOCAL INVASIVE LOBULAR CARCINOMA, NOTTINGHAM
GRADE 2.
- 1.7 CM AND 0.1 CM IN SIZE.
— DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), MICROPAPILLARY TYPE,
NUCLEAR GRADE 2, WITH MICROCALCIFICATIONS, MINOR
COMPONENT.
- LOBULAR CARCINOMA IN SITU (LCIS), PLEOMORPHIC AND CLASSIC
TYPES.
— MARGINS, NEGATIVE FOR INVASIVE CARCINOMA, DCIS, AND
PLEOMORPHIC LCIS.
- VESSELS WITH MICROCALCIFICATIONS.

NOTE: The size of the tumor (1.7 cm) was determined by measuring the tumor in slides
A4 and A5. A 0.1 cm non-contiguous focus of invasive carcinoma was also seen in slide
A12.

B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 1, LEFT AXILLA, BIOPSY:
- FOUR LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/4).

C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 2, LEFT AXILLA, BIOPSY:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (O/l).

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. EXCISIONAL BIOPSY LEFT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZED

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "excisional biopsy left breast
needle localized" is a previously inked, oriented (single stitch-anterior, double stitch-
lateral, triple stitch-superior) 54 g, 3.1 x 3 x 2.9 cm needle localized excision with
radiographs. Ink code: Anterior—yellow, posterior-black, medial-green, lateral-right,
superior-blue, inferior—orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial
into 7 slices revealing a 1.5 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm ﬁrm tan stellate mass that is closest to the
superior margin at 0.5 cm and a biopsy clip in slice 3. Tissue is procured; representatively
submitted as per the attached diagram (time placed in formalin):

A1: perpendicular sections of lateral margin

A2: slice 2, mid section

A3: slice 3, anterior superior with mass

A4: slice 4, anterior superior with mass

A5: slice 4, posterior superior with mass

A6: slice 4, anterior inferior

A7: slice 4, mid inferior

A8: slice 4, posterior inferior

A9: slice 5, mid superior

A10: slice 5, posterior superior

Al 1: slice 5, mid section

A12: slice 5, mid inferior

A13: slice 6, anterior superior

A14: slice 6, anterior inferior

A15: perpendicular sections of medial margin

B. SLN #1 LEFT AXILLA

Received fresh labeled with patient‘s identiﬁcation and "SLN #1 left axilla" is a piece of
yellow-tan soﬁ tissue, 6.2 x 3.1 x 1.2 cm containing 4 lymph nodes ranging from 0.4 x
0.3 x 0.2 cm to l x 0.7 x 0.6 cm. The lymph nodes are sectioned and submitted entirely
and separately in 81-84.

C. SLN #2 LEFT AXILLA

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "SLN #2 left axilla" is a 1.5 x
0.9 x 0.7 cm lymph node. It is sectioned and submitted entirely in C1.
