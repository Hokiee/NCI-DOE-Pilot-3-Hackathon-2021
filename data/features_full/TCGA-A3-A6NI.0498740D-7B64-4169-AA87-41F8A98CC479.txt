lllllIllIlllllllllllllllllllllll|lllllllllHlllllllllllllllll
SPECIMEN:

Left kidney.

HISTORY i>C?
Renal mass
(Stage Iv chronic kidney disease with history of renal transplant)

GROSS
Received fresh in a container labeled 'left kidney“ is a kidney with
a moderate amount or attached perinephric fat (12.5 x 8 x 4.8 cm).
The kidney by itself (9.5 x 3.8 x 3.2 cm). weighs 78 grams. Hilar
vessels are up to 0.8 cm long, 2.5 cm in diameter. The renal vein
lumen is widely patent. The attached ureter (2.5 cm long. 0.4 cm in
diameter) has a metal clip across the lumen adjacent to the margin.

The interior pole of the kidney has a 4 cm in diameter discrete
tumor nodule with a mottled, spongy orange gray cut surface.
Scattered areas of hemorrhage are present throughout. The tumor has
a discrete pushing margin, which produces a bulge in the overlying
intact capsule. Extension into the adjacent perinephric fat is not
apparent. The overlying adventitia margin is marked with black ink.
Superiorly. the tumor margin is within 0.2 cm of the renal sinus
fat. Direct extension into perinephric fat is not apparent. The
remaining renal parenchyma has a thin. atrophic firm tan cortex (up
to 0.5 cm thick) and numerous cortical cysts containing clear fluid
and old. brown blood. Renal pyramids are atrophic. major and minor
calices along with the renal pelvis are lined by mildly striated
gray-white mucosa.
