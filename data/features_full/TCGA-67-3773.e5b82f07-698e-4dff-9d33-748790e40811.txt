underlying the puckered pleural surface. Sectioning reveals a 1.5 x 1.3 x
1 cm pale tan firm mass 0.4 cm from the stapled margin and abutting the
pleural surface. The pleural surface is inked black and the stapled
margin is inked blue. No additional masses or lesions are identified.

FINDINGS: There is a noncalciﬁed soft tissue mass density in the left lower lobe series 3 image #44 measured atgi
x 1.3 cm. This is of concern for neoplasm. There are bilateral apical opacities right greater than left. There is
mammal pleural based density bilaterally right greater than left. This may be due to scarring. Mass or inﬁltrate
cannot be excluded and followuup is advised. The lungs appear hyperexpanded with peribronchial thickening and
prorninence of the interstitial markings. There are other regions in the right upper lobe with interstitial density
suggesting scarring. There is a posterior pleural based density as seen on image #25. There may be a nodular density
in the right upper lobe on image #30 versus scarring measuring 7 mm. There is a very small nodular density lateral
portion right upper lobe on image #33. There is no evidence of pleural ﬂuid. There are degenerative changes in the
spine. There is vascular calciﬁcation. There are a few nodes in the mediastinum. There is a pretracheal node
measuring 1.8 x 0.8 cm. There are a few smallernodes at the AP window. Evaluation of the hiia is somewhat limited
without contrast. There is vascular calciﬁcation including coronary involvement. Adrenal glands appear mildly
thickened without deﬁnite mass.

iMPRESSION:

1. There is a noncalciﬁed mass density of concern for a neoplasm in the left lower lobe posterioriy.

2. There are bilateral apical opacities right greater than left which may be due to scarring. In fight of asymmetry a
superimposed mass cannot be excluded. PET scan may be helpful to evaluate the various abnormalities. The lungs
appear hyperexpanded and there are regions of peribronehial thickening and interstitial density which are consistent
