COMMENT:

Part 5: A cytokeratln immunostain and Ieveis were performed on one lymph node with subcapsuiar fibrosis and giant cell
reaction. However, no micrometestases are noted, and this focus is essentiaily gone on levels.

Part 7: While there is no definitive tumor noted, cautery artifact makes histologlc assessment suboptimal.
