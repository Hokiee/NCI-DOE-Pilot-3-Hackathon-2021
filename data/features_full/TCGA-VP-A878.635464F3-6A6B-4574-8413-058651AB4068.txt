DIAGNOSIS:
PROSTATE, RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY
— ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON GRADE 4 + 5 = SCORE 9 INVOLVING ALL FOUR
QUADRANTS AND APPROXIMATELY 40% OF SAMPLED TISSUE (SEE SYNOPTIC)
- LYMPHATIC AND PERINEURAL INVASION IDENTIFIED
- TUMOR PRESENT AT RESECTION MARGIN
— NO EXTRAPROSTATIC EXTENSION IDENTIFIED
— RARE NON—NECROTIZING GRANULOMA
LYMPH NODES, BILATERAL PELVIC, DISSECTION
- METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA IN ONE OF THREE LYMPH NODES (1/3)
SEMINAL VESICLES, BILATERAL, RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY
— NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY

By this signature, I attest that the above diagnosis is
based upon my personal
examination of the slides(and/or other material indicated in the
diagnosis).

***Report Electronically Reviewed and Signed Out By
Intraoperative Consultation:
An intraoperative non—microscopic consultation was obtained and interpreted as:
"Called to pick up 'prostate' consisting of a 55 gram, 5 x 4.5 x 4.5 cm prostate
with attached bilateral seminal vesicles measuring 3 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm, on the
right, and 3.4 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm on the left. The right vas deferens measures 2 x
0.4 X 0.4 cm and the left vas deferens measures 3 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm. Inked.
Tissue t=beh From 1eft and right lobes for research. Rest for permanents," by

Microscopic Dec-ription and Comment:
Microscopic examination substantiates the above cited diagnosis.

History:

The patient is a year old man who has prostate carcinoma. Operative
procedure: Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.

Specimen(s) Received:

A: PROSTATE

B: LYMPH NODE, BILATERAL PELVIC

Gross Description
The specimens are received in two formalin—filled containers, each labeled

The first container is labeled "prostate." It contains a
65—gram, 5 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm prostate with attached bilateral seminal vesicles
measuring 3 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm, on the right, and 3.4 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm on the left.
The specimen has been previously inked black and there are defects in both lobes
where tissue has been previously taken for research, measuring 2.5 cm, on the
right, and 2.0 cm on the left. The prostate is sectioned to show a tan,
unremarkable cut surface. The urethral mucosa is tan and smooth. The seminal
vesicles are sectioned to show unremarkable cut surfaces. Labeled A1 and A2 —
right prostate apex; A3 and A4 — right base; A5 and A6 - left apex: A7 and A8 -
left base; A9 — right seminal vesicle; A10 — left seminal vesicle; All — right
apical margin; A12 - left apical margin; A13 — right bladder base margin; A14 —
left bladder base margin. Jar 2.
The second container is labeled "bilateral pelvic lymph nodes." It contains
numerous fragments of yellow—tan fibroadipose tissue measuring, in aggregate,
8.5 x 6.0 x 1.7 cm. Multiple, unremarkable lymph nodes are dissected measuring
up to 3.7 cm. Labeled B1 to 82 — multiple lymph nodes; BB — single section of

largest lymph node; B4 — half of bisected lymph node; B5 — half of bisected
lymph nndn 3:? 1
