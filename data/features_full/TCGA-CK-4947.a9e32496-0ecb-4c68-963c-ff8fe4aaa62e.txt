DIAGNO IS: . “ - ' ' -~
SPECIMEN LABELED "SIGMOID COLON (14. 5 cm)":
ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE COLON, moderately differentiated
(4.0 cm in greatest dimension).
The tumor invades through the muscularis prepria into pericolonic
adipose tissue and is present at the serosal surface.
Lymphovascular invasion is not present.
Non—neoplastic colonic mucosa with no significant pathologic change.
Proximal resection margin is free of carcinoma.
METASTATIC CARCINOMA in three (3) of twelve (12) lymph nodes.

SPECIMEN LABELED "DISTAL COLON WITH MARGIN":
Distal resection margin is free of carcinoma.

AJCC staging: T4 N1 Mx

CLINICAL DATA:

History: Colon CA invading L ureter for palliative resection.
Operation: sigmoid colectomy, left ureterolysis — frozen section.
Clinical Diagnosis: Sigmoid colon cancer, left ureteral stricture.

TISSUE SUBMITTED: l. sigmoid colon — open end is distal. -

2. Distal colon with margin.

O.R. CONSULTATION:

SPECIMEN LABELED “1) SIGMOID COLON — OPEN END IS DISTAL” (GROSS ONLY):
Circumferential lesion consistent with adenocarcinoma.

The proximal and distal mar ins are free f carcinoma.
GROSS DESCRIPTION; #
The specimen is receive in two separate containers, each labeled with the
patient's name and medical record number.

Part one is designated "sigmoid colon open end is distal". The specimen
consists of a single segment of colon (14.5 cm length x 3 cm diameter) with
attached fat and mesentery (6.5 cm in maximum diameter). Distal resection
margin is 2.3 cm. Proximal resection margin is 2.2 cm. There is a
circumferential mass that measures 4 x 3 x 1.8 cm, appears groesly to invade
through full thickness and causes serosal puckering. This mass is present 4.5
cm to distal resection margin and 4 cm to proximal resection margin.
Representative sections are taken for tumor bank. Representative sections are
submitted for histologic evaluation.

Micro 1—3: tumor at area of deepest invasion, 3 s, -.
Micro 4: tumor towards distal margin, 1 frag,

Micro 5: tumor towards proximal resection margin, fr -
Micro 6: proximal resection margin, en fac frags, a
Micro : distal resection margin, 1 frag,

Micro 8:3 potential lymph nodes, 3 frags,
Micro 9: 4 potential lymph nodes, 4 frags,

Part two, receiVed designated “distal colon with margin". The specimen
consists of a single portion of colon (1 cm length x 3 cm diameter). stapled
resection margin measures 4 cm in length. Resection margin is inked in black.

Micro 10: stapled resection margin, en face, 2 frags, -
