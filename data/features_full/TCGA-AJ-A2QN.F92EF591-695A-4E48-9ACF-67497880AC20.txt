GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received labeled ind '#1' is a 5.1 x 2.8 x
0.9 cm aggregate of fibroadipose tissue bearing four
irregular tan-yellow firm tissues consistent with probable
lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm to 4.8 x 1.4 x
0.8 cm. The specimen is sectioned and representative
sections are submitted, to include the lymph nodes in their
entirety as labeled: block 1. three whole probable lymph
nodes; blocks 2 - 5. one lymph node serially sectioned. The
blocks are labeleo

B. Received in formalin labeled and ‘#2' is a
4.2 x 1.3 x 0.6 cm aggregate of iibroadipose tissue bearing
four Irregular tan-yellow iirm tissues consistent with
probable lymph node ranging from 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm to 1.4 x
0.6 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is sectioned and representative
sections are submitted to include the lymph nodes in their
entirely as labeled: block 1, three whole probable lymph
nodes; blank 9 one lvmoh node bisected. The blocks are
labeled .

C. Received In formalin labeled and '#3 left
pelvic lymph node' is a 4.8 x 4.2 x 1.0 cm aggregate of
tibroadipose tissue bearing a 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm irregular
tan-yellow firm tissue consistent with probable lymph node.
No additional obvious lymph nodes are identified. The
specimen is submitted in its entirely as labeled: block 1.
one whole probable lymph node: blocks 2 ~ 5. ﬁbroadipose
tissue. The blocks are labeled

D. Received in formalin labeled . .- and ‘#4 right
pelvic lymph node‘ is a 5.5 x 5.3 x 1.3 cm aggregate of
ilbroadipose tissue bearing four irregular tan—yellow firm
tissues consistent with probable lymph nodes ranging from
0.7 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm to 4.3 x 1.6 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is
sectioned and representative sections are submitted to
include the lymph nodes in their entirety as labeled: block

E. Received labeled and ‘#5 uterus cervix
tubes and ovaries“ is a 138.0 9, previously opened '
hysterectomy specimen consisting of a 7.1 x 6.5 x 4.7 cm
uterine body and an attached 3.8 x 2.4 x 1.5 cm cervix.

The serosa is smooth and tan-pink. The ectocervix is smooth
to wrinkled and gray-white with a 1.1 cm slit—like 03. The
endocervical canal is tan-red and 2.8 cm in length. The
endometrial cavity is approximately 4.3 cm from cornu to
cornu and 5.0 cm in length. The cavity diffusely consists of
a 4.8 x 4.6 cm gray-white ﬁrm mass which possibly extends
into the lower uterine segment. The cut surface of the mass
is gray-white and involves the underlying myometrium with a
depth of 2.2 cm. The mass appears to approach the serosa. No
uninvolved endometrium is identified. The myometrium is
trabeculated. tan-pink to white, and ranges in thickness
from 2.1 cm to 2:7 cm.

The 1.6 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm left ovary has a lobulated tan outer
surface. The cut surface is tan with gray-white corpora
albicans and two smooth lined serous ﬂuid tilled cysts
measuring 0.5 cm and 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. The
attached 4.2 x 0.3 cm flmbrlated left fallopian tube has a
tan-pink serosa and a pinpoint lumen. -
The 2.2 x 1.6 x 0.6 cm right ovary has a lobulated tan outer
surface. The cut surface is tan with gray-white corpora
albicans. The attached 3.2 x 0.3 fimbriated right fallopian
tube has a tan-pink serosa and a pinpoint lumen.

The specimen is inked. serially sectioned and representative
sections are submitted as labeled: block 1. anterior

cervix; block 2, posterior cervix; block 3, anterior lower
uterine segment; block 4, posterior lower uterine segment;
blocks 5 - 6, anterior full thickness mass in each; blocks 7 .
- 8, posterior full thickness mass bisected; blocks 9 — 10,
posterior full thickness mass bisected: block 11. left
parametrium; block 12, right parametrium; block 13, left
ovary and fallopian tube; block 14, right ovary and

fallopian tube. The blocks are labeled Also
received in the same container is a green and yellow
cassette labeled 7 __ for genomic research study.
