Microscopic Description:

Sections demonstrate sheets of poorly cohesive, large cells. These have large atypical, somewhat open
nuclei, usually with multiple nucleoli. They have only a modest amount of cytoplasm. Numerous mitotic
ﬁgures are seen. individual apoptotic cells are seen without frank necrosis. The tumor has an expansive

interface with the surrounding parenchyma but an angiocentric pattern is also appreciated. Areas of
apparent glial and ﬁbrous scarring are also noted.

Diagnosis:

Brainstem Tumor: diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma, B-cell type

GROSS DESCRIPTION I

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION :
l, 2. Sections demonstrate sheets of poorly cohesive, large cells. These have
large atypical, somewhat open nuclei. usually with multiple nucleoli. They
have only a modest amount of cytoplasm. Numerous mitotic figures are seen.
Individual apoptotic cells are seen without frank necrosis. The tumor has an
expansive interface with the surrounding parenchyma but an angiocentric
pattern is also appreciated. Areas of apparent glial and fibrous scarring are
a so noted.

The neoplastic cells are immunoreactive for CD45 and C020. confirming B-cell
lymphocytic origin. They are negative for GPAP, 8-100 and oytokeratin 8/18.

The neoplastic cells demonstrate aberrant expression of the T-cell marker CD43
but are negative for CD3 and CD45 :0. They demonstrate BCL2 and BCL6
posgtivity but are negative for CD10. Overall, the immuncphenotype is
consistent with a diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma.
