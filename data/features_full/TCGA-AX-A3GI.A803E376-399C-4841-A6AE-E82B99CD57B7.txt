2 measures 2 x 1.2 x 1 cm and is located on the anterior
1 ~' subserosal nodules have tan white firm out surfaces. The
...aininq a zonal surface is pink—tan and smooth. The cervix measures 4
cm in lenutx x 2.5 cm in diameter. The cervical 05 is slit-like and
measures u.z cm in diameter. The anterior surface is inked yellow and
the posterior surface is inked black for microscopic evaluation. The
uterus is opened to reveal hemorrhagic fluid and a tan—pink/red friable
mass occupy.nq all the endometrial cavity on both anterior and posterior
aspects. The endometrlal cavity measures 9 cm in length x 7.5 cm in
width. The mass grossly appears involving the lower uterine segment and
not involving the cervix. The mass is about 1.4 cm from the anterior
paracervica soft tissue margin and approximately 4 cm from the cervical
as. The mans grossly appears involving the superficial myometrium with a
maximum depth of invasion approximately 1 cm out of 5 cm thickness of
the anterlor endomyometrium. The mass has a maximum depth of invasion
on the ponturior aspect of approximately 1.5 cm out of 4 cm
endomyometrlum thickness. Multiple tan~white firm intramural nodules
are ident:f;ed ranging in maximum dimension from 0.5 cm to 5 cm, the
largest one measures 5 x 4 x 3.5 cm and is located on the posterior
side. Some of these nodules are calcified. The endomyometrium ranges in
thickness from 1.5 to 5.2 cm. The right fallopian tube measures 6.5 cm
in length x approximately 0.6 cm in diameter. The serosal surface is
pink~tan and smooth. Serial sectioning reveals a pinpoint lumen. The
right ovary measures 3 x 2 x 1 cm and it is serially sectioned to reveal
a tan-yellow nodule measuring 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm. The left fallopian
tube measures 7 cm in length x approximately 0.6 cm in diameter. The
serosal surface is pink—tan and smooth. The fallopian tube is serially
sectioned to reveal a pinpoint lumen. The left ovary measures 3 x 2 x 1
cm. The left ovary is serially sectioned to reveal unremarkable
tan—pink Cut surfaces. Representative sections of the specimen are
submitted as follows:
Cassettes l— the anterior cervix,
Cassettes 2 and 3* the anterior lower uterine segment,
Cassette 4- the closest tumor to the anterior paracervical soft tissue
margin,

Within the {at there are two tan-pink possible lynph nodes measuring 0.7
