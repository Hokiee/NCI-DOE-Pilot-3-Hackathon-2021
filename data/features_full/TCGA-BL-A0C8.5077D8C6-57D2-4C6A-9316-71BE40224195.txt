SPECIMEN
Bladder tumor

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Bladder cancer per op report in
Procedure, partial cystectomy of tumor in dome of the bladder.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
Received fresh for tissue procurement labeled "bladder
tumor" is a 10.5 x 5.5 x 5 cm dusky tan—red to gray-brown
mass of tissue. On sectioning, focal areas of soft papilliferous
white—pink tissue in keeping with tumor are identified. A portion
of the presumptive tumor is submitted for tissue procurement as
requested. Received separately within the specimen container is a
copious amount of red—brown clot. No anatomic structures are
evident. Random representative sections focusing on the apparent
tumor are submitted in eight blocks. RS-B. RR1—8 additional
sections submitted to evaluate for the presence or absence of
muscle
invasion.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Microscopic examination reveals extensive high grade
urothelial carcinoma with some clear cell differentiation.
The tumor is extensively exophytic. Invasion of lamina propria is
identified in tissue block 6 and RR3. Muscularis propria is
present. And some foreign body giant cell reactions are identiifed
in the muscularis propria sections. However, no diagnostic
invasive
tumor is identified in those sections of muscularis propria. The
lack of orientation of the specimen precluded accurate margin
evaluation. The exophytic friable nature of the tumor also
precluded accurate margin evaluation.
