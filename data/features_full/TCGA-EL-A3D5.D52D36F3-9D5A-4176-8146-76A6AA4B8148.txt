sectioned; 84, representative adipose tissue. "
(C) RIGHT NECK DISSECTION LEVEL lll - One piece of adipose tissue (6.5 x 4.5 x 0.7 cm). Eight potential lymph nodes are
palpated, ranging In size from 0.2 - 1.5 cm In greatest dimension.

SECTION CODE: Ct, ﬁve potential lymph nodes; C2-C4, single potential lymph node in each.
(D) RIGHT NECK DISSECTION LEVEL IV - yellow-tan adipose tissue (3.5 x 3 x 1 cm). Eight potential Iympn nodes are
palpated, ranging in size from 0.5 - 1.6 cm in greatest dimensions. The largest lymph node has a cystic cut surface, possibility

x 4 x 2 cm), isthmus (2 x 2 x 0.7 cm) and left thyroid lobe (3 x 2 x 2 cm). In the right thyroid lobe, there are two ﬁrm nodules:

. The lower nodule (2.5 x 1.5x ‘1 cm) with a cavity ﬁlled with hemorrhagic material and 3 upper nodule (2.2 x 1.5 x 1 cm), The

two nodules are next to each other. In the left thyroid lobe, one well-circumscribed, tanebrown nodule is present (0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4
cm). The capsule is intact, smooth, otherwise unremarkable.
SECTION CODE: F1, right lower nodule with a central cavity; F2, F3, contains both nodules showing their relationship;
F4, F5, upper nodules; F6, F7, representative sectioning of right lobe; F8, F9, representative sectioning of isthmus; F10, F11,
