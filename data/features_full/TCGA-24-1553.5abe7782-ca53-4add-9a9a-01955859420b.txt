F8, lymph node eriaortic, biopsy — Poorly differentiated
carcinoma by h

 

Microscopic Description and Comment:

Histologic sections from both ovaries show poorly differentiated
adenocarcinoma of mixed epithelial type. The majority of the
tumor is composed of solid nests with poorly differentiated,
focally pleomorphic and multinucleated cells. In areas, definite
papillary serous differentiation is identified. other areas show
back—to-back glandular structures diagnostic of endometrioid
carcinoma. In many of these glandular areas, the central lumina
are filled with mucin-type material. Metastatic adenocarcinoma
with identical histologic features are present in both fallopian
tubes, on the serosal surface of the uterus with extension into
myometrium, in deep cervical soft tissue, and in right parovarian
soft tissue. A single 2 mm. nodule of metastatic adenocarcinoma
is present in the omentum. Both specimens of peri-aortic lymph
node contain metastatic adenocarcinoma of identical histology.

Gross Description;

The specimens are received in six containers of formalin, each
labelled with the patient's name. The first is labelled "FS." It

contains two fragments - asuring 2.5 x 2.0 x
0.2 cm in aggregate.

The second container is labelled "X, periaortic lymph node." It

contains a sin 1e iece of tan—white tissue measuring 2.5 x 1.7 x

The third container is labelled "periaortic lymph node." It
contains three fragments of white—tan tissue measuring 5 x 3.5 x

3.5 cm in aggregate. r white—tan tissue with
focal yellow areas.

The third container is labelled "left ovary." It contains an ovary
measuring 8.7 x 6.5 x 4.8 cm. The serosal surface is smooth,
white—tan with a small amount of attached soft tissue. No
fallopian tube is seen grossly. Sections show a single serous
filled cyst measuring 4.0 cm in diameter with a smooth lining. On
either side of the cyst is firm, yellow—whitewtan nodular tissue
grossly consistent with tumor. Residual ovarian tissue appears
compressed along one edge.

 

The next container is labelled "uterus, cervix, right tube and
ovary." It contains a specimen consisting of uterus, right ovary
and fallopian tube. and a large amount of soft tissue adherent to
the right ovary and posterior uterus. The entire specimen weighs
480 grams. The uterus measures 10.0 cm superior to inferior x 4,0
cm cornu to cornu x 3.7 cm anterior to posterior. The left
fallopian tube is also identified in the specimen measuring 5.0 cm
in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. ‘The distal end shows no
fimhriae and is contiguous with the soft tissue mass. The left
fallopian tube measures 11 cm in length x 0.8 cm in diameter. A
fimbriated end is apparent and grossly involved by tumor. The

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT I _ _ '
right ovary measures 5.5 x 4.0 x 3.0 cm. The superior serosal
surface is smooth but the inferior portion of the ovary is
contiguous with the attached soft tissue. The attached soft
tissue measures 12 x 9 x 8 cm and is diffusely involved by
white-yellow~tan tumor with some focal hemorrhage and fat
necrosis. The cervix measures 3 x 2.2 X 3.5 cm and appears
grossly unremarkable. The endometrium measures 0.1 to 0.2 cm in
thickness and also appears grossly unremarkable. The myometrium
measures 1.8 cm in thickness. Sections through the posterior
myometrium show invasion of tumor from the serosal surface into
the serosal one—third of the myometrium. Labelled Ci, anterior
cervix; C2, posterior cervix; El, anterior endomyometrium; E2,
posterior endomyometrium; LT left fallopian tube: RT, right
fallopian tube; R01, R02, right ovary: 3T1 and STZ, soft tissue
with tumor.

 

The fifth container is labelled "omentum." It contains a sheet of
fibroadipose tissue measuring 35 x 12 x 1.0 cm. A single, firm,
white nodule measuring 0.2 cm in diameter, grossly suspicious for
tumor is present. The remainder of the tissue is unremarkable.
Labelled 01, omentum with suspicious nodule; 02—05, unremarkable

omentum.
