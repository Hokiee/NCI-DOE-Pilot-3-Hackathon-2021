Surgical Pathology Report

Fina! Diagnosis

A, a) EPIDURAL MASS. RESECTION:
- PARAGANGUOMA, WITH FOCAL COAGULATIVE NECROSIS CONSISTENT WITH RECENT ISCHEMIA.
- WTOSES ARE NOT IDENTIFIED.
- TUMOR EXTENDS TO RESECTION MARGINS.

C] SCALP TUMOR, RESECTION:
- PARAGANGLIOMA (6 CM GREATEST DIMENSION). METASTATIC TO SKULL.

- TUMOR EXTENSIVELY INVOLVES THE BONE OF THE SKULL AND INVADES THROUGH THE BONE
BOTH EXTERNALLY AND INTERNALLY. THE OVERLYING SKELETAL MUSCLE AND ADIPOSE TISSUE
OF THE SCALP IS DISTENDED BY A PUSHING BORDER OF TUMOR, BUT ONLY FOCALLY INVADED. -
' LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IS PROMINENT (SLIDE C12).

— THERE IS EXTENSIVE TUMOR NECROSIS.

- MITOSES ARE VARIABLY PRESENT (UP TO 3 PER HIGH POWER FIELD IN SOME FOCI) BUT ARE
RARE OVERALL.

- KI~6? LABELING IS APPROXIMATELY 10% IN AREAS OF HIGHEST LABELING.

- TUMOR EXTENDS TO BONE AND SOFT TISSUE MARGIN AT THE SHORT AXIS OF THE BONE
EXCISION (BEST SEEN IN C 12).

- IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINING FOR SDHB IS NEGATIVE IN TUMOR CELLS AND POSITIVE IN
ENDOTHELIAL CELLS, CONSISTENT WITH A SDHX GENE MUTATION.

- IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINS FOR CHROMOGRANIN A AND TYROSINE HYDROXYLASE ARE
DIFFUSELY POSITIVE.

Comment:
A" controls show appropriate reactivity.

Gross Description

A. T2-3 EPIDURAL MASS (FRESH) The specimen. labeled with the pallent'o name and medlcal record number.
is a fragment 0! dark red to brown soft tissue (2.5 x 1.5 x 0.2 cm). The specimen Is processed for Intmoperatlve frozen section
diagnosis and entlrely submitted In cassettes A1-2 (A1 a frozen section remnant).

B. EPIDURAL TUMOR (#2 ADDITIONAL PIECE OF TUMOR) (FRESH): The specimen, labeled with the patient”: name
and medical record number. consists ol‘ mulllple fragments of red to brown soft tlssue (0.5 x 0.4 x 0.‘ cm). The specimen
is entirely submitted In cassette 81.

c, SCALP TUMOR (FRESH); The specimen. labeled with the patter-it‘s name and medaal record number,
consists of an ovold salt tissue mass (6 x 5 x 2 cm) attached to an ovoid fragment of skull (5.6 x 4 x 0.4 cm). The cut Surface
reveals a well circumscribed tan-punk mass dlstendlng but not invadlng the overlying ﬁbrous tissue and skeletal muscle (6 x 4.5 x 2
cm). The mass penetrate: through the bone at the mid portion of the specimen. closest to the resection marglns along the short
axle. Resection margins along the long axis appear to be free of tumor. The Specimen is serially secttorled along the short axis and
entirely submitted consecutively from cassettes 01-17. The cut surface of the mass ls pink-tan with patchy yellow areas at
necrosis. Anproxlmately 20% of the tumor appears necrotic.
