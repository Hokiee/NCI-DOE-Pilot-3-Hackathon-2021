CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE — OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:

M smoker (100 pack-years) with hx of prostate cancer ( ) and
COPD, now with a 1.5 cm RML mixed solid and ground-glass nodule and
multiple additional bilateral lung nodules.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh, in six parts, each labeled with the
patient's name.

1. Part one is labeled 'right middle lobe nodule'. It consists of a
wedge shaped portion of lung measuring 11 x 5 x 2 cm. There is a
staple line identiﬁed on the specimen, measuring 10 cm in length.
There is a cut identiﬁed on the specimen measuring 1.5 cm in
length. On further sectioning there is a gray white ill deﬁned area
measuring 1.1 x 1 cm is identiﬁed. This area is 0.3 cm from the
staple line and 0.4 cm from the pleural surface. The staple line is
inked blue. Further sectioning of the lung reveals spongy tan maroon
parenchyma. One portion from the ill deﬁned area is submitted for
frozen section analysis. Representative sections are submitted.

2. Part two is labeled ’station #9 lymph node'. It consists of a
single lymph node measuring 2.4 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The cut surface is
grey~black. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

3. Part three is labeled ’station #10 lymph node'. It consists of
multiple irregular fragments of grey-black lymph nodes measuring 1.5
x 0.8 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

4. Part four is labeled 'completion of right middle lobectomy'. It
consists of a lobe of lung measuring 10.5 x 5.5 x 2 cm and weighing
38 grams. Two staple lines, measuring 8 cm and 6 cm in length are
noted. The bronchial and vascular margins are identiﬁed. The
serosal surface is grey-purple and shows a subpleural grey-black
nodule measuring 0.9 x 0.8 cm. Sectioning reveals an unremarkable

red beefy lung parenchyma. The subpleural nodule likely represents
the lymph node. No discrete mass lesions are noted. Representative
sections are submitted.

5. Part ﬁve is labeled 'station #4 lymph node'. It consists of

three irregular segments of grey—black lymph nodes ranging from 0.2
to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. Entirely submitted in one

cassette.

6. Part six is labeled 'station #7 lymph node'. It consists of a
single grey-black lymph node measuring 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. Entirely
submitted in one cassette.

KRAS, EGFR and ALK FISH were sent on

The test is to be performed on tissue from case
. The case report, slides, and blocks for the cited

accession number were retrieved from archives. The pathologist whose
signature appears below reviewed the original pathology report,
examined candidate H&E slides, and selected block 1A appropriate to
the speciﬁcations of the ordered molecular analysis. x1 H&E and x9
unstained slides were prepared and forwarded to _

ADDENDUM #2:

MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY
KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS

Referring Physician

Body Site: Right middle lobe of lung
Specimen Type: Slides

Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma

RESULTS: Wild—type gene.

INTERPRETATION:
No mutations were identiﬁed at codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene.

COMMENT:
Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to be associated with poor

prognosis, and resistance to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor
therapies in patients with non—small-cell lung cancer (N SCLC). KRAS
mutations occur in 15-30% of NSCLC patients and are strongly
associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking history.

This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;
based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are
expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of

the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low
percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated

for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in
fresh, frozen, or formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn embedded tissue. In
particular the test performance has been established in samples of
colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma which harbor
these mutations, although several other tissues are also known to
harbor KRAS mutations (e. g. tumors of pancreas, bile duct, ovary,
appendix, etc.).

Analysis of EGFR mutation or gene ampliﬁcation status may provide
additional information regarding this patient's probability of
response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, if

clinically indicated. See references.

METHOD/LIMITATION:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantiﬁed
and ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single
nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;
primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

ADDENDUM #3:

EGFR Mutation Analysis

Referring Physician:

Body Site: Right middle lobe of lung

Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma

RESULTS: NO mutation detected.

INTERPRETATION. No mutations were identiﬁed in the sample provided
for analysis. Fewer than 5% of non- -small cell lung carcinoma

patients without identiﬁable mutations are reported to be
responsive to EGF R tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.

COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more tumor cellularity is Optimal
for this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 70% tumor
cellularity upon pathologist review.

A frequently occurring sequence change 2361>GA (Q7 87Q) was
identiﬁed. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical
signiﬁcance.

Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reported to be associated with
differential responsiveness or resistance to EGF R tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) therapies. The objective response rate among
patients with a sensitizing mutation ranges from 55 to 82%.

This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;
based on the current literature, most mutations in non-small-cell

lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are expected to occur in these exons.
Mutations present in less than 10-20% of extracted DNA may not be
detected by this method. Mutation status in a sample may change
during tumor progression or the course of therapy; therefore, this
result cannot be used to infer the presence or absence of a mutation

in another sample or sub—sample Obtained from this tumor.

This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The
clinical signiﬁcance and utility of this test in other tumor types
is unknown.

METHOD:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is
selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantiﬁed
and ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to
exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene. PCR products are analyzed by
bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using capillary gel
electrophoresis and ﬂuorescence detection. False positive or
negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants
or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

ADDENDUM 4:

INTEGRATED ONCOLOGY
Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH)
Referring Physician

Body Site: Right middle lobe of lung
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma

INTERPRETATION:
Negative for a rearrangement involving the ALK gene.

Probe #Nuclei Examined % Positive Nuclei %
Control values
2p23(ALK) 50 0.0 <15

A total of 50 cells were scored.

FINDINGS:
FISH was performed on parafﬁn embedded tissue sections using the
Vysis ALK Break Apart Probe for the ALK gene at 2p23 (

FDA approved). When a rearrangement involving ALK is
present, either inversion or translocation, one of the two fusion
signals separates as one red and one green signal. In this
specimen, separated signals were present in 0% of the nuclei scored.
This result is within the normal limits.

COMMENTS: Three to four copies of ALK were Observed in 26.0% of
cells. This gain of intact ALK fusion hybridization signals

represents an aneuploid population with extra copies of chromosome
2/2p ALK region. Additional copies of ALK are not uncommon in
NSCLCs, although the signiﬁcance of extra copies of the ALK gene in
lung carcinoma is unclear at this time (Salido M. et al. J Thorac

Oncol. 2011;6z21-27).
