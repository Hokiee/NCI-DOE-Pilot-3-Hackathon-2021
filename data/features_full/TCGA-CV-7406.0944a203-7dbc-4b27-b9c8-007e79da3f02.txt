GROSSDESCWPUON

(A) LEFT NECK #1 — Salivary gland with attached adipose tissue, 4.0 x 2.8 x
1.0 cm. within the surrounding adipose tissue, two possible lymph nodes are
identified that are 0.3 and 0.6 cm in greatest dimension.

SECTION ' , cross—section of salivary gland; A2, two possible
lymph nodes.

(3) COMPOSITE RESECTION LEFT MANDIBLE AND BASE OF TONGUE — Consists of a
portion of left mandible, 7.0 X 5.5 x 1.6 cm, and a separate portion of base
of tongue (3.5 x 2.8 x 3.3 cm).

An ulcerated tumor, 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm, is Eresent in the posterior
portion of the base of tongue corresponding to t e left tonsillar area. The
tumor is present within 0.2 cm from the posterior lateral margin of the
specimen (not the true margin), 0.7 cm from the anterior/inferior margin, 0.8
cm from the lateral margin and 1.2 cm from the medial margin. The tumor comes
within approximately 1.0 mm of the deep margin which appears to be free.

INKING CODE: B aCk—deep margin; red—medial margin; yellow-lateral margin;
blue—superior margin; green—inferior margin.

SECTION CODE: Bl, tumor—superior margin, perpendicular section; 32,
tumor—lateral margin; B3, tumor—inferior margin; B4, medial margin, en face;
