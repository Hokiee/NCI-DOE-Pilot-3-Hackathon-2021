INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:
A-WLE right breast: Gross examination only. tumor is 0.8 cm from the nearest superior margin.
TPB/TPC-SLN #1, #2: Touch imprints only, negative for tumor cells.
Diagnoses called by Dr. to Dr. at . (A, B, C).

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. WLE RIGHT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "WLE right breast needle localization" is a
previously inked, oriented (single suture-anterior, double suture-lateral) 76 g, 3.7 x 3.6 x 2.9 cm needle
localized lumpectomy with radiograph. Ink code: Anterior-yellow, posterior-black, medial-green, lateral-
red, inferior-blue, inferior-orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 7 slices
revealing a 1.8 x 1.3 x 1.1 cm tan, stellate nodule that is closest to the superior margin at 0.8 cm.
Tissue is procured. Representatively submitted:
A1-A2: lateral margin, perpendicular sections
A3: slice 2, anterior superior
A4: slice 2, posterior superior
A5: slice 2, posterior superior
A6: slice 2, mid posterior
A7: slice 3, anterior superior (mass)
A8: slice 3, posterior superior (mass)
A9: slice 3, mid anterior (mass)
A10: slice 3, mid posterior (mass)
A11: slice 3, inferior
A12: slice 4, mid anterior (mass)
A13: slice 4, mid posterior (mass)
A14: slice 4, mid inferior
A15: slice 4, posterior
A16: slice 5, anterior
A17: slice 5, inferior
A18: slice 5, posterior
A19: slice 6, superior
A20-A21: slice 6, anterior
A22: slice 6, inferior
A23: slice 6, posterior
A25-A25: medial margin, perpendicular sections
B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 RIGHT AXILLA
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "SLN #1" is a 1.5 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm lymph node.
It is sectioned, a touch prep is performed, lymph node is submitted entirely in cassette B1.
C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2 RIGHT AXILLA
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "SLN #2" it is a 1.7 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm lymph
node. It is sectioned, a touch prep is performed, submitted entirely in cassette C1.
D. ADDITIONAL LATERAL POSTERIOR MARGIN
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "additional lateral-posterior margin” is an
oriented (suture at ﬁnal margin) 9 g, 5 x 3 x 1.2 cm ﬁbrofatty tissue. Final margin is inked blue. Serial
sectioning reveals no discrete lesions. Entirely submitted in cassettes 81-58.
