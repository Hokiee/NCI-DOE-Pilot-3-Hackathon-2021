Gross Descrigtion:

1. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "urethral margin". and consists of a fragment of yellow tan soft tissue measuring 2.5 x
0.7 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is entirely frozen.

Summary of sections:
FSC — frozen section control

2.The specimen is received in formalin. labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes" and consists of multiple pink tan firm lymph nodes ranging
from 0.2 to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. All identiﬁed lymph nodes are submitted (specimen submitted for lymph node
dissection).

Summary of sections:
LN - lymph nodes
BLN - bisected lymph nodes

3. The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Bladder. prostate and seminal vesicles". It consists of a bladder measuring 7 cm
from superior to inferior. 5 cm laterally and 4 cm from anterior to posterior. The left aspect of the bladder and prostate is inked
blue and the right aspect is inked green. The prostatic urethral margin is shaved and submitted. The bladder is opened along the
anterior midline to reveal an ulcerated area measuring 3 x 2 cm which is grossly situated within the right posterior I lateral wall.
The ulceration is located 2.5 cm from the left oriﬁce and 0.7 from the right. Both ureters are probe patent measuring up to 0.2 cm
in maximum diameter. The lesion is sectioned to reveal that the ulceration is limited to the mucosa with underlying dense fibrosis,
extending to the peri-vesical fat . The remaining bladder mucosa is unremarkable. Perivesical adipose tissue is submitted for
lymph node dissection and possible discrete perivesical lymph nodes are grossly not identiﬁed. The prostate is serially sectioned
to reveal a multinodular cut section. Representative sections are submitted including three sections from each prostatic quadrant
and transition zone. The specimen is photographed.

4). The specimen is received in formalin labeled "left ureter" and consists of an unoriented 8.5 X 0.4 cm gray-white smooth
portion of ureter with attached fatty tissue. The specimen is sectioned to reveal a 0.1cm lumen. No discrete lesions or gross
abnormalities are identiﬁed. Representative sections to include both margins are submitted.

Summary of sections:

5). The specimen is received in formalin labeled "distal right native ureter" and consists of a 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm clipped gray-white
soft tissue with attached fatty tissue. The specimen is sectioned to reveal a 0.1 cm possible lumen. The specimen is submitted
in its entirety.
