attached 4.0 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm epididymis, and attached 4.9 x 1.6 cm of spermatic
cord. The visceral layer of the tunica vaginalis is tan-pink, smooth and
glistening. Sectioning reveals a 4.3 x 3.5 x 3.1 cm tan to pink, soft,
heterogeneous, ill-deﬁned testicular mass which does not appear to extend
outside the testicle. Rete testis involvement is indeterminate. The uninvolved
testicle is tan, soft and homogeneous. The seminifercus tubules string with
ease. The spermatic cord on sectioning is unremarkable.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:
1 spermatic cord margin taken en face;
2 mass to Rete testis;
3,4 mass to visceral layer of tunica vaginalis and epididymis;
5 mass to uninvolved testis;
6 proximal spermatic cord.

Please note, a gross photograph is taken.
