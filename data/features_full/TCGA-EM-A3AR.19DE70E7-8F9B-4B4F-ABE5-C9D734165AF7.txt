The dominant tumor is a widely invasive classical variant with multiple tumor deposits in the left lobe. There are many regions
which are highly suspicious tor lymphatic invasion, but there is no deﬁnitive evidence of vascular invasion. There is one lymph
~rode on the ieit side which is nearly completely replaced by metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma

i. The specimen labeled with the patients name and as ”total thyroid stitch marks left superior pole" consists cl a thyroid gland
hat is oriented with a suture and weighs 34.9 g. The right lobe measures 5.0 cm SI x 2.7 cm ML x 2.0 cm AP. the left lobe
neasures 5.1 cm Si x 3.0 cm ML x 2.2 cm AP and the isthmus measures 5.5 cm Slx1.5 cm ML x 1.3 cm AP. The external
rurfaces have ﬁbrous adhesions. No parathyroid glands and/or lymph nodes are identiﬁed grossly. The extemai surface is

tainted with Silver nitrate. The left lobe contains a well delineated nodule that measures 0.7 cm Si x 1.2 cm ML x 1.1 cm AP. The
smainder of the thyroid tissue is grossly normal. Sections of the nodule and normal tissue are stored frozen. The remainder of
he specimen is submitted as follows:
