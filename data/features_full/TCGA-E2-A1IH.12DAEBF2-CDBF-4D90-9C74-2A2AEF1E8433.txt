Specimen: Surgical Excision
Block Number:

 

ER: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3
PR: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3

 

COMMENT:

The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the
proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of
cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining. 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak
intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining. 3 = strong intensity of staining). with a scoring
range from 0 to 8.

ERIPR positive is deﬁned as an Allred score of >2 and ERIPR negative is deﬁned as an Allred score
of less than or equal to 2.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
lmmunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 105, 1:100) and PR (PGR
136, 1:100) provided by following the manufacturer 5 instructions. This
assay was not modiﬁed. Interpretation of the ERIPR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published
results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal
review of staining performance.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit

using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modiﬁed. External kit-slides

provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-
house known HER2 ampliﬁed control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well
preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identiﬁed for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2
immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided
by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.

This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from
A800 and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force.

' takes full responsibility for this test's performance.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
woman with Left Breast Ca: Invasive Ductal 11 o’clock. 1.7cm on mammogram.
PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left Breast Ca
INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
TPA/T PB: Negative for tumor. Diagnosis called to Dr at _ By Dr.
C. GROSS INSPECTION: 1.5cm mass 0.6cm from the closest deep margin, 0.7cm from anterior
margin. Diagnosis called to Dr. at . by Dr.
D. GROSS INSPECTION: New medial margin. Negative for tumor. Diagnosis called to Dr. at 'I by
Dr.
ADDENDUM:

FISH for HER-2 ampliﬁcation for this case was attempted multiple times using multiple blocks from this
case. In each instance the tissue would not remain on the slide for analysis. As a result of this one block
will be sent to another laboratory for further testing.

This case was sent to the for second opinion for HER-2 FISH. The results reported below are the
verbatim results of this referral.

Reason For Referral

r/o HER2 gene ampliﬁcation

Fixative Fonnalin

Method:
FISH using probes for HER2 (17q12) and a chromosome 17 centromere (D1721) control probe
(Patthsion, Two technologists score Signals in 60 total nuclei from invasive or
metastatic tumor and concurrent controls.

Results:

nuc ish (D17Z1x2, Hel2x3-5)
The HER2 to D1721 ratio is 2.28
Interpretation:
The invasive tumor nuclei have an ampliﬁed HER2D17Z1 ratio (per ASCO/CAP

TSS ID

guidelines). The HER2D17Z1 ratio is 2.28. In our opinion, this result may not
reﬂect true HER2 ampliﬁcation. Most nuclei have 2 copies of the chromosome
17 centromere and 3-5 copies of the HER2 gene. This result indicates the tumor has
additional copies of the HER2 gene (i.e., duplication), but does not have sufﬁcient
oppies to suggest high level HER2 ampliﬁcation. It is not known if HER2
duplication is associated with HER2 over-expression in breast adenocarcinoma.
ASCO/CAP reporting guidelines (Wolff et al. Arch Path Lab Med 131218-43, 2007).
A HERZD17Z1 ratio less than 1.8 indicates absence of HER2 gene ampliﬁcation.
A HER2D17Z1 ratio from 1.8-2.2 is equivocal for HER2 gene ampliﬁcation.
A HERZD17Z1 ratio greater than 2.2 indicates HER2 gene ampliﬁcation.
DISCLAIMER: This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined
by Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, It is intended as
an adjunct to existing prognostic clinical and pathologic information for breast cancer
patients. This test is not intended to diagnose or screen for breast cancer. Per ASCO/
CAP guidelines, HER2FISH test results are valid for non—decalciﬁed parafﬁn embedded
specimens ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin between 6 and 48 hours. Results from
specimens ﬁxed outside these parameters should be interpreted accordingly.
