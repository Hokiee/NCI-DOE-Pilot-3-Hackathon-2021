CLINICAL HISTORY: .
Malignant neoplasm corporis uteri.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries". Received fresh is a 116 gm,
9.5 x 6.4 x 4.1 cm uterus with bilateral attached adnexa. The opened specimen
discloses an exophytic 6 x 4.5 cm white—tan tumor in the anterior endometrial
cavity, extending from the fundus to the lower uterine segment. The tumor is
1.2 cm thick and penetrates 0.1 cm into the underlying 2.1 cm thick
myometrium. The remainder of the endometrial cavity (6.5 x 4 cm) is lined by a
thin 0.1 cm endometrium overlying a focally trabeculated myometrium. The
endocervical canal is trabeculated yellow—tan with no apparent gross lesions
and the exocervix is smooth and glistening with a patent 0.9 05. A
representative section of the mass has been frozen as AFl and AFZ and the
frozen section remnants are submitted in blocks A1 and A2. Additional
representative sections submitted as follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY:

A3— anterior cervix

A4- anterior endocervical canal

A5— posterior cervix

A6- posterior endocervical canal

A7—All tumor and wall (block A7-A10 are two slides, bisected)
A12— uninvolved posterior endomyometrium

fimbriated fallopian tube with attached mesentery and an attached 4 x 1.5 x 1
cm white-tan ovary. Sectioning demonstrates a grossly unremarkable cut
surface and representative sections are submitted in A13.

0 The left adnexa is composed of a discontinuous 2.5 cm long, 0.5 cm in diameter

The right adnexa is composed of a discontinuous 2.1 cm long, 0.5 cm in
diameter fimbriated fallopian tube with an attached 3 x 2 x 1.7 cm white—tan
ovary. Sectioning demonstrates a grossly unremarkable cut surface and
representative cross sections are submitted in block A14.

B. "Left pelvic nodes“, received fresh and placed in formalin is a 10 x 8.5 x
2 cm aggregate of yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue dissected for apparent lymph
node candidates. Twenty-three lymph node candidates are identified from 0.3
to 2.2 cm in greatest dimension and are submitted as follows:

C. "Right pelvic nodes", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 12 x 9 x 5
cm aggregate of pink-tan fibrofatty tissue dissected for apparent lymph node
candidates. Twenty lymph node candidates are identified from 0.4 to 4 cm in

' greatest dimension and are submitted as follows:

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:

A. "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries:
AFl—Z (0.1 cm into a 2.1 cm) thick myometrium full—thickness, bisected-low
grade adenocarcinoma superficially invasive into myometrium (less than one

fourth). Can not completely exclude a serous adenocarcinoma —

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: HYSTERECTOMY, OOPHORECTOMY & LYMPHADENECTOMY

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 6th Edition): ple pNO pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
. information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).
