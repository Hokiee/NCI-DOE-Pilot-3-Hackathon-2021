Block #2 Al, representative sections

 

Container B is additionally labeled "segment II, excisional biopsy. " The specimen consists of a yellow/tan
ovoid rubbery liver tissue fragment measuring 2.2 x 1.7 x 1.6 cm. A 1.0 x 1.0 cm white area is noted on the
only smooth surface. Serial sectioning reveals a well circumscribed white/pink soft nodule measuring 1.8 x
1.5 x 1.0 cm. The irregular margins are inked black and the specimen is serially sectioned. (Blocks Bl-B4

Container C is additionally labeled "right adrenal." The specimen consists of an adrenal gland with
surrounding adipose tissue all together measuring 4.5 x 3.8 x 1.3 cm. Serial sectioning reveals a
yellow/orange adrenal gland measuring 4.0 x 2.0 x 0.6 cm. (Blocks C1-C6,

Container D is additionally labeled "liver, suture medial margin." The specimen consists of a segment of
liver measuring 21.0 x 14.0 x 11.0 cm and weighing 1200 grams. The external surface is tan, wrinkled with
a bosselated appearance and some slightly pale areas noted. Serial sectioning reveals one white well

 

 

 

 

circumscribed nodule measuring 10.5 x 10.0 x 8.5 cm. The cut surface of the nodule is yellow/red,
consistent with necrosis and hemorrhage. The nodule appears friable and appears to extend to or very close
to the medial margin. The remaining cut surface is homogeneous brown with dilated vessels. A suture is
noted indicating medial and the entire margin is inked black. (Blocks Dl-D9, representative sections)

Light Microscopy:
Light microscopic examination is performed.

Sections of the tumor reveal large cells with abundant pink cytoplasm. A moderate degree of cytologic
atypia is observed. The tumor cells are arranged in trabeculae, many of which are greater than three cell
layers. Focal necrosis is observed, and occasional mitotic ﬁgures are seen. Lymphovascular space invasion
is not identiﬁed. The adjacent liver does not show cirrhosis. There is minimal steatosis and a patchy, mild,
chronic inﬂammatory inﬁltrate in some portal areas.

Signature:
I have personally conducted the evaluation of the above specimens and have rendered the above
diagnosis(es).
