A. LEFT BREAST LUMP (GROSS MARGINS) —
PORTION OF BREAST TISSUE WITH TUMOR (3.2 X 3.1 X 3.0 CM.) EXTENDING TO
LATERAL SURGICAL MARGIN AND WITHIN 0.1 CM. OF THE MEDIAL SURGICAL

MARGINS.
ALL OF THE REMAINING DESIGNATED SURGICAL MARGINS ARE WITHIN 0.6 CM.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS

A. LEFT BREAST LUMP -
BREAST TISSUE DISPLAYING INVASIVEPOORLY DIFFERENTIATED DUCTAL
ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE BREAST. 3+3+3, 3.2 CM. IN GREATEST DIMENSION.
TUMOR EMBOLI SEEN IN ANGIOLYMPHATIC SPACES.
MARGINS ARE FREE.
THE NEAREST MARGIN IS 0.1 CM. TO THE TUMOR AS REPORTED IN THE GROSS
EXAMINATION.

B. AXILLARY CONTENTS LEFT -
LYMPH NODE, METASTATIC DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA IN TWO LYMPH
NODES FROM A TOTAL OF TWELVE LYMPH NODES (2112).
THE LARGEST NODE WITH TUMOR IS 1 CM. IN GREATEST DIMENSION.
THE TUMOR TOTALLY OCCUPIES THE NODE WITH EXTRACAPSULAR
EXTENSION TO THE FAT.

C. ADDITIONAL AXILLARY CONTENTS, LEFT -
LYMPH NODES, TWO REACTIVE.

D. ADDITIONAL LATERAL WRGINS -
FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE AND BREAST TISSUE, NO TUMOR SEEN; HOWEVER, THERE IS
MICROSCOPIC FOCUS OF TUMOR EMBOLI SEEN IN ANGIOLYMPHATIC SPACES.

. GROSS DESCRIPTION

The specimen Is received in ﬁve separate containers labeled , Jesignated A
through E.
A The container is received fresh unﬁxed labeled “left breast lump” and consists of a 30 gm. ovoid

mass of apparent fatty and ﬁbrous-encased tissue which is 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.8 cm. in greatest overall
dimension. There is a single short suture indicating superior margin inked with orange. inferior is
inked red. There Is a single long suture Indicating lateral margin Inked with black dye. medial is
inked blue. There are two short sutures indicating anterior margin inked with green dye, deep Is
inked yellow. Sectioning reveals a tumor. a gray-white irregular bordered tumor which is 3.2 x 3.1
x 3 cm. in greatest overall dimension and has scattered yellow-tan chalky areas varying up to 0.3
cm. in greatest dimension and a central 0.4 cm. slightly gelatinous hemorrhagic area. The tumor
mass grossly appears to involve the lateral/black margin is 0.1 cm. from the medial/blue. 0.5 cm.
from the anterior/green. 0.5 cm. from the deep/yellow. 0.5 cm. from the superior/orange and 0.5
cm. from the inferior/red. Gross margins are obtained by Dr. The entire specimen is
submitted in seventeen blocks.

Key Note Block Summary: 1—lateral/black, 2—medial/blue. 3—anterior/green. 4-
deeplyellow, 5—superior/orange. 6—inferior/red (all are perpendicular), 7 through 17—remaining.

B. The container is received ﬁxed labeled “left axillary contents“ and consists of an irregular mass of
apparent fat 3.5 x 3 x 2.5 cm. Sectioning reveals pink-tan nodules varying up to 2 cm. in greatest
dimension. The larger nodes are hemisected and placed in cassettes 2 through 5.

C. The container is received ﬁxed labeled "additional axillary contents“ and consists of an irregular
mass of apparent fatty tissue which IS ‘I x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. Sectioning reveals a 0.4 cm. pink-tan
nodule. The entire specimen is submitted as one section in one block.

. D. The container is received fresh unﬁxed labeled "additional lateral margin" and consists of an 8
gm. ovoid mass of apparent fatty and ﬁbrous encased tissue is 3 x 2.5 x 2 cm. in greatest overall
dimension. There is an attached suture indicating new lateral margin inked with red dye.
Sectioning reveals fat and a scant amount of ﬁbrous tissue. The entire specimen is submitted in
four blocks.

E. The container is received fresh unﬁxed labeled "additional medial margin - suture on new medial
margin' and consists of an 8 gm. ovoid mass of apparent fatty and ﬁbrous encased tissue is 3 x 3
x 2.5 cm. in greatest overall dimension. There is a suture Indicating new medial margin inked
with blue dye. The entire specimen is submitted in four blocks.
