COMMENTS:
Appropriately controlled immunohistochernical stain for P53 performed on block G1 is negative. While this does not exclude the possibility of a serous
carcinoma. primary serous carcinomas of the cervix are very rare and these lesion moreﬂlrkely represents a high grade endocervical adenocarclnome.
