BRAIN, LEFT TEMPORAL LOBE, BIOPSY: ASTROCYTOMA, ANAPLASTIC.

Operation/Specimen: Brain, left temporal lobe.
Clinical History and Pre—Op Dx: None given.

GROSS PATHOLOGY: One container labeled with the patient‘s MRN and
name

and including 3 small fragments of grayish white semifirm tissue.
After taking a small sample for the Intraoperative Consultation, the
entire specimen is submitted in cassettes l and 2.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Glioma, anaplastio. _

MICROSCOPIC: Three fragments of cerebral cortex showing similar

appearance. The normal architecture of the cortex is effaced by an

infiltrating neoplasm composed of medium sized cells, many of which

have abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and elongated thin processes.

Nuclear pleomorphism and occasional atypical mitoses are present.
Many

of the blood vessels show hypertrophy of the endothelial lining.

Areas
of coagulation necrosis are not visible but there are scattered recent

and small hemorrhages. A few multinucleated cells are scattered
throughout this specimen. Mineral salt deposits are not visible.

iifdMENT: The specimen was received in the afternoon of—

Operation/Specimen: A. Left temporal lobe, B. Left temporal uncus, C.
Left parahippocampus, D. Left hippocampus.

Clinical History and Pre—Op Dx: None given.
GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. "Left temporal lobe", discoid portion of cerebral cortex and white
matter, 4.5 x 4 x 1.5 cm, semifirm. Submitted in total, 1—13.

B. "Left temporal uncus", four fragments, aggregating to l x 1 x 0.3
cm. Semifirm, tanish—white. In total, 14.

C. "Left parahippocampus", one fragment, 1 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm. Tanish—
white. In total, 15.

D. "Left hippocampus", five fragments, aggregating to 3 x 2.2 x 0.9
cm. Semifirm, tanish—white. In total, 16d19.

MICROSCOPIC: A. Portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white
matter

which are focally extensively infiltrated by a neoplastic
proliferation

of glial cells. The neoplastic cells have rather small nuclei with
moderate nuclear pleomorphism, and diffusely permeate the white matter
and cortex with prominent perineuronal satellitosis and focal subpial
accumulation. Mitotic figures are occasionally seen, however,
microvascular cellular proliferation or necrosis is absent.

B. Fragments of brain tissue extensively infiltrated by a neoplasm
similar to that described for part A. The cellularity is higher and
the nuclear pleomorphism is more prominent in this specimen, and
mitotic figures are also observed. Again, microvascular cellular
proliferation and necrosis are absent.

C. Portions of brain tissue extensively infiltrated by a neoplasm
similar to that described for part A.

D. Portions of hippocampus which are focally infiltrated by a
neoplasia similar to that described for part B, which is effacing the
dentate gyrus and pyramidal cell layer.

SPECIAL STAINS: MIB—l and factor VIII AA immunoperoxidase methods
were
preformed on blocks 5 and 14.

With the MIB—l, a labelling index of about 15% was determined on
section 14 in areas of solid tumor. With the FVIII AA, no endothelial

 

microvascular proliferation was demonstrated.

COMMENT: In all the four specimens, there is extensive infiltration
of

the gray and white matter by a fibrillary astrocytoma. The tumor
effaces the normal cortical architecture with the presence of
prominent

satellitosis and focal subpial accumulation. The neurons present
throughout the specimens are considered to be native entrapped
neurons,

not part of the neoplasm. The tumor is moderately cellular with
moderate nuclear pleomorphism, and is not difficult to find mitotic
figures. However, microvascular cellular proliferation and necrosis
are absent. The cellularity, degree of nuclear atypia and presence of
mitoses with a high MIB~1 labelling index of 15%, justify a diagnosis
of anaplastic astrocytoma. The absence of endothelial proliferation,
however, probably places this neoplasm at the low end of the spectrum
of anaplastic astrocytomas.
