Gross Description
1. The specimen is labeled with the patient's name and as "right internal iliac node". It consists of

a piece of fatty tissue measuring 5 x 1.5 x 2.0 cm. Multiple nodes identiﬁed, the largest of which

measures 3 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm. lntraoperative consultation performed on a frozen by quick section.
The nodes are submitted in toto.

1A-1 C frozen section nodes

1 D largest node bisected

2. The specimen is labeled with the patient's name and as "right obturator node". it consists of
multiple lymph nodes the largest of which measures 1.7 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. lntraoperative
consultation performed on a frozen by quick section.

2A-2B frozen section nodes in toto

3. The specimen is labeled with the patient's name and as "uterus cervix tubes and ovaries". It
consists of a uterus with bilateral adnexa weighing 159 g and measuring 9.8 SI x 5.6 ML x 5
APcm. The cervix measures 4.6 cm in diameter and the slit as measures 1.2 cm in length. The
right ovary measures 2.5 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm on the right fallopian tube measures 5.4 x 0.5 cm. The
left ovary measures 2.6 x 1.7 x 1.2 cm and the left fallopian tube measures 5 x 0.6 cm.

The serosal surface of the uterus is smooth and grossly unremarkable. The exocervix is
slightly congested partly. The cervical canal appears normal. A papillary polypoid partly friable
white lesion occupies the posterior endometrium, fundus and primarilary the right aspect. This
lesion measures 3.7 SI x 3.5 ML x 1.7APcm. The myometrium is 0.9cm thick. Two white fibroids
with whorl like appearance identified as intramural in the anterior aspect measuring 1.0 to 1.8 cm
in diameter.

The right ovary is smooth on the outer surface and on sectioning it is fibrous and
unremarkable. The right fallopian tube is unremarkable and the other surface and patent on cut
surface. The left ovary show some tiny parovarian cyst measuring 0.1 cm in diameter on the
surface. On sectioning 1 follicular cysts measuring 0.9 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm is identiﬁed. The left
fallopian tube is unremarkable. Representative sections submitted.

4. The specimen container, labeled with the patient's name and as "left proximal external iliac",
contains a piece of fibrofatty tissue and a node measuring respectively 1.4 x 0.6 x 0.1 and 2 x 1 x
0.5 cm, received in 10% NBF. The node is submitted in toto.

4A bisected node

5. The specimen container, labeled with the patient‘s name and as "left pelvic”, contains a piece
of fibrofatty tissue measuring 3.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm, received in 10% NBF. This contains 3 lymph node
measuring 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm to 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. The nodes are submitted in toto.

5A 1 node bisected

5B one node bisected

SC one node

6. The specimen container, labeled with the patient's name and as "left obturator node", contains
2 pieces of fibrofatty tissue measuring 1.3 x 1 x 0.7 and 2.4 x 1 x 0.7 cm, received in 10% NBF.

This contains 3 lymph node measuring 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm to 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is
submitted in toto.
