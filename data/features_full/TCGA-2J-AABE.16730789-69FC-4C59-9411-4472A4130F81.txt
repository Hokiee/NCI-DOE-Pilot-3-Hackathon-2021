DIAGNOSIS: D” 5 I

A. Soft tissue, falciform ligament, excision: Benign elastotic _, V3 5] 5// 4}
nodule. " ’

B. Pancreatic body and tail and spleen, partial pancreatectomy and
splenectomy: Invasive moderately differentiated ductal
adenocarcinoma is identiﬁed forming a mass (5.8 x 3.6 x 3.3 cm)
located in the pancreatic body. The tumor extends beyond the
pancreas to involve the peripancreatic soft tissue. Perineural

invasion is present. Tumor necrosis is absent. All surgical

resection margins are negative for tumor (minimum tumor free margin,
2.] cm, proximal pancreatic margin). The adjacent non-neoplastic
pancreatic parenchyma contains PanIN 1A. Multiple (23) regional
lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

C. Lymph node, peripancreatic, excision: A single (1) lymph node
is negative for tumor.

With available surgical material, [A] CC pT3N0] (7th edition, 2010).

This ﬁnal pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic
examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the
specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are
reviewed to conﬁrm these ﬁndings. Any substantive changes
identiﬁed on permanent section review will be reﬂected in a
revised report.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received fresh labeled "falciform ligament" is a 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2
cm fragment of tan soft tissue. All submitted. Grossed by

B. Received fresh labeled "spleen, distal pancreas" is a distal
pancreatectomy specimen consisting of 10.8 x 5.3 x 2.0 cm portion of
pancreas and a 170.0 gram, 11.5 x 8.8 x 2.5 cm partially morcellated
spleen. A 5.8 x 3.6 x 3.3 cm tan-white, solid, and cystic, ﬁrm

mass is present within the pancreas, 2.1 cm from the proximal
pancreatic margin. The mass does not appear to be conﬁned to the
pancreas, grossly. The peripancreatic soft tissue is inked.
Peripancreatic lymph nodes and splenic hilar lymph nodes are
identiﬁed. The spleen is grossly unremarkable. Representative
sections are submitted. Grossed by '

C. Received fresh labeled "peripancreatic lymph nodes" is a 2.6 x
1.1 x 0.8 cm aggregate of adipose tissue, lymphatic tissue not

identiﬁed grossly. All submitted. Grossed by
