Gross Description (Verified)
"FSA." All frozen section tissue is submitted in cassette "FSA,".

"FSB." All frozen section tissue is submitted in cassette "FSB,".

”FSC." All frozen section tissue is submitted in cassette "FSC,". ‘
“D. Bladder." The specimen consists of a previously opened bladder with attached fatty tissue with an overall measurement of 10.1 x 7.2 x
3.7 cm. Upon reconstruction, the bladder measures 4.4 x 6.4 x 4.5 cm. The urethral margin is inked black. shaved, and submitted. The
bladder has previously been opened along the anterior aspect to reveal a 1.5 1.3 cm pale tan, ﬁrm, well circumscribed mass located on the
left central anterior aspect of the bladder wall. The anterior soft tissue margin is inked black. On sectioning. this mass measures 0.9 cm in
thickness. grossly appears to extend through the bladder wall and comes to within 0.1 cm of the inked soft tissue margin. The left ureteral
orifice is identified and was probe patent. A possible right ureteral oriﬁce is identiﬁed. The mass does not grossly appear to involve the left or
right ureteral oriﬁces. The remaining bladder mucosa has a pale ten to gray-tan appearance. No cysts or areas of interest are identiﬁed.
"D1," urethral margin; "DZ-03." mass to include anterior soft tissue margin; "D4," mass to include left ureteral oriﬁce; ”D5,” possible right
ureteral oriﬁce; "06," posterior bladder; "D7," trigone; "DB," right bladder wall. representative. NOTE: Please see attached drawing.

“E, Right pelvic lymph node.“ The specimen consists of 2 yellow-tan fatty fragments measuring 3.8 x 0.7 x 0.8 cm and 3.8 x 2.2 x 1.2 cm.
On examination, 6 possible lymph nodes are identified. These range in size from 0.7 to 2.2 cm. Representative sections are submitted into
cassettes "E1-E2." representative.

“F. Appendix." The specimen consists of a 5.3 x 0.4 cm appendix with a small amount of attached periappendiceal fat. The serosa is
gray-tan with no adhesions. On sectioning, the lumen has a pale tan thickened appearance. No fecaliths or perforations are identiﬁed. The
margin is inked black. "F." fragments, representative.

"6, Left pelvic lymph node." The specimen consists of a 4.4 x 3.8 x 1.8 cm aggregate of yellow«tan fatty tissue. On examination. 3 possible

lymph nodes are identiﬁed. These range in size from 0.5 to 3.8 cm. The 2 smaller lymph nodes are submitted in toto. A representative
confinn of the larger lymph node is submitted. Free in the container is a 3.0 x 0.4 cm tan-brown cylindrical vessel. ”G." 4p, representative.
