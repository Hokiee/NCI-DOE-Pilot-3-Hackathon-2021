INTERPRETATION AND DIAGNOSIS:

1. LUNG, RIGHT UPPER LOBE (LOBECTOMY): INFILTRATING MODERATELY
DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA (1.7 CM). THE TUMOR DOES NOT INVADE
THE PLEURA. BRONCHIAL AND VASCULAR MARGINS, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. TWO
(2) HILAR LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. TWO (2) HYALINIZED
PLEURAL PLAQUES IN THE NON—NEOPLASTIC LUNG. SEE NOTE.

2. LYMPH NODE, R4 (EXCISION): ONE (1) LYMPH NODE AND ASSOCIATED
FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

3. LYMPH NODE, R7 {EXCISION): ONE (1) LYMPH NODE AND ASSOCIATED
FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

PART #1: FS: RIGHT UPPER LOBE
Resident Pathologist:

FS: RIGHT UPPER LOBE: INFILTRATING POORLY DIFFERENTIATED CARCINOMA,
FAVOR NON— SMALL CELL.

Attending:
Pa:

The specimen is received fresh labeled “ and designated
right upper lobe. It consists of a grossly recognizable lobectomy
specimen weighing 180 gms, and measuring 17.7 x 9 x 2.4 cm. There is
a firm nodule palpable in the medial portion of the lower lobe. The
pleura superficial to the area is inked black. On cut section, there
is a firm tan gray nodule measuring 1.5 x 1.3 x 1.7 cm. The tumor
approaches the inked pleural margin. The nodule measures 3.2 cm from
the hilar structures, and 6.5 cm from the stapled margin. A portion
of this nodule is submitted for frozen section diagnosis. There is a
row of staples in the superior portion of the lung at the hilum. This
row of staples measures 3.5 cm in length. The staples are removed,
and the underlying pulmonary parenchyma is inked blue. There is a
white circular nodule on the lateral pleural surface measuring 0.4 cm
in maximum dimension. This nodule is located 6 cm from the apex and
approximately 4 cm from the hilar structures. On cut section, the
nodule is firm and gray—white in color. There is a second nodule on
the lateral pleural surface approximately 4 cm from the inferior
portion of the specimen. This nodule measures 0.7 cm in maximum
dimension. It measures approximately 7 cm from the hilar structures.
On cut section, the remainder of the non-neoplastic lung is tan red
brown and spongy with focal anthracotic pigmentation. No other
lesions are identified. A portion of the tumor is harvested for
tissue banking purposes. Representative sections of the tumor and
non—neoplastic lung are submitted.

PART #2: R-4
Resident Pathologist:

The specimen is received in formalin labeled m and
designated R-4 lymph node. It consists of one piece of tan pink
fibroadipose tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. On cut section, the

specimen is consistent with an anthracotic lymph node. The specimen
is submitted in its entirety.

SUMMARY OF SECTIONS:

PART #3: R—7
Resident Pathologist :

The specimen is received in formalin labeled and
designated 12-7 lymph node. It consists of one piece of tan pink
tissue with anthracotic pigmentation measuring 1 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm.

On cut section, the specimen is consistent with an anthracotic lymph
node. The specimen is submitted in its entirety.

INTERPRETATION AND DIAGNOSIS:
1) #1 (PROSTATE BX, )

2) MINUTE FOCUS OF ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE PROSTATE, GLEASON GRADE
3+3=6. SEE NOTE.

NOTE: The diagnosis of carcinoma is supported by the failure of

immunoperoxidase staining for high molecular weight cytokeratin to
demonstrate basal cells in the atypical glands.
