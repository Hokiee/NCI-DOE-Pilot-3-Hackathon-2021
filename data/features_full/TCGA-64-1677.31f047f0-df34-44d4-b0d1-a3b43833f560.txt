Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled #2, ”wedge resection right upper lobe”
Frozen Section Diagnosis: 2FS~ SUBPLEURAL SCAR; NO TUMOR SEEN.

Gross Description: Received fresh in a container labeled with patient's

name and medical record number labeled "wedge resection right upper lobe".
It consists of a wedge of dusky gray lung tissue measuring 5 x 2 x 1.5

cm. The specimen is received previously sectioned. Sections disclose an
ill-deﬁned area measuring 2.3 cm. The pleura in this area is somewhat
thickened. No obvious lesions or masses are identiﬁed. One representative
section was submitted for frozen sectiOn and the residue is submitted in

2FS. Additional tissue is submitted in ZA—ZC.

Source of Tissue: 3. Labeled #3, "RLL"

Frozen Section Diagnosis: 3FS— LYMPH NODE ADJACENT TO'BRONCHIAL MARGIN
WITH METASTATIC CARCINOMA, ACTUAL MARGIN FREE OF TUMOR.

Gross Description: Received fresh in a container labeled with patients

 

name and medical record number labeled "right lower lobe”. It consists of
a 224 gram dark-red lobe of lung measuring 17 x 9 X 7 cm. Half of the
margin is procured for frozen section and the residue is submitted in 3FS.
The diaphragmatic surface is unremarkable. Lateral and slightly inferior,
there is a large area of pleura. Also in this area there is a marked area

of fullness. Sections disclose a 4 x 4 x 3 cm pink ﬁrm tumor. The tumor
is 4.5 em from the margin. Elsewhere the pleura and remaining lung tissue
is grossly unremarkable. At the hilum, the vascular margins are normal.
The bronchial tree is opened and is grossly free of any tumor. A few

hilar and peribronchial lymph nodes are found measuring up to 1 cm. A
lymph node adjacent to the bronchial margin was submitted for frozen
section.

Designation of Sections: 3A—3B- tumor in relatiOnship to pleura, 30 tumor
in relationship to adjacent uninvolved lung tissue, 3D— vascular margins,

3E- hilar nodes, 3F— uninvolved lung tissue
