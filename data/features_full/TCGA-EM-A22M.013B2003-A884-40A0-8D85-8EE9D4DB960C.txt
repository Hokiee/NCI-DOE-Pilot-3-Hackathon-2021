dominant 0.7 cm;

*Pathologic Staging is based on AJCC/UICC TNM, 7th Edition

 

M

The dominant tumor is a widely invasive mixed follicular and columnar cell variant with focal tall cell

change and Warthin-like component.

The focal tall cell change and Warthin-like component represent

less than 10% of the tumor area. The dominant tumor is strongly positive for HBME-1 (membranous and

apical), cytokeratin 19

(membranous) and galectln-3 (cytoplasmic and focal nuclear).

The dominant tumor also exhibits a very prominent lymphoplasmacytic background and the infiltrate
shows a reactive staining pattern for kappa and lambda, and is composed of a mixed population of
predominantly IgG and lgA cells. These cells are present at the interface with tumor and background
thyroid but do not form deﬁnitive lymphoepithelial lesions with obliteration of epithelial islands. In
summary, the features are of a reactive immune inﬁltrate.

Clinical History '

Papillary thyroid ca

Gross Description
1. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as “Parathyroid right lower 03" consists of a piece

of soft tissue that is not weighed and measures 0.5 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm.
1A frozen tissue resubmitted

2. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as 'Total thyroidectomy left paratracheal node stitch
marks left upper pole" consists of a thyroid gland that is received oriented with a suture and weighs 25.5
g. The right lobe measures 5.0 cm SI x 2.7 cm ML x 1.6 cm AP, the left lobe measures 5.9 cm SI x 2.5 cm
ML x 1.3 cm AP and the isthmus measures 2.8 cm Si x 1.2 cm ML x 0.9 cm AP. There is a piece of
adipose tissue at the inferior aspect of the left lobe that measures 1.2 x 1.7 x 0.5 cm. The external
surfaces have fibrous adhesions and are painted with silver nitrate. No parathyroid glands are identified
grossly. Two query lymph nodes measuring 0.7 cm and 1.0 cm are identiﬁed grossly in the adipose tissue
at the inferior aspect of the left lobe. Both lobes and the isthmus contain multiple poorly delineated
nodules that measure from 0.7 to 1.7 cm. The largest nodule in the isthmus contains a focal area of
calcification. The remainder of the thyroid tissue is pale pink-tan. Sections of a nodule from each lobe and
normal tissue are stored frozen. Representative sections of the remainder of the specimen are submitted
as follows:

2A—F right lobe, superior to inferior

ZG-l isthmus, in toto. except a focal area of calciﬁcation

2J-N left lobe, superior to inferior

20 2 lymph nodes

Microscopic Description

The dominant tumor is positive for HBME-1 (membranous and apical), cytokeratin 19 (membranous) and
galectin-3 (cytoplasmic and focal nuclear). The prominent background plasma cell inﬁltrate shows a
reactive staining pattern for kappa and lambda, and is composed of a mixed population of predominantly
lgG and lgA cells.
