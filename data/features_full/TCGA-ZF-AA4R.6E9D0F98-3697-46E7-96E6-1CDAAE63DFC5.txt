SPECIMEN (bﬂm®,ﬂamm aéﬂﬂos 9/90 )5

Bladder and prostate.

2 - Right obturator. 6:12 '_ WMA ”(53 C (a 7. 5]

‘3 - Right external ileac. ~ . . '
4 - Left distal ureteric margin. 9%“) ZHﬁL‘J/i L/
5 - Right distal ureteric margin.

CLINICAL DETAILS

Bladder cancer. Clinically involved obturator nodes right, cystectomy & right
lymphadenectomy.

MACROSCOPY

1 - Cysto-prostatectomy specimen measuring 125 mm supero-inferiorly x 110 mm
medic-lateral x 65 mm antero—posteriorly. The prostate measures 30 mm superior
to inferior and 45 mm media] to lateral. On sectioning there is a tumour

situated on the right side. The tumour abuts the perivesical fat and measures

20 mm x 6 mm. The background mucosa appears haemorrhagic and possibly
abnormal.

The prostate shows nodularity with the most prominent nodule extending towards
bladder urethral oriﬁce. The seminal vesicles appear spared by tumour, as well
as the prostate.

2 - A piece of ﬁbrous tissue measuring 55 x 38 x 22 mm. Sectioning shows 2
lymph nodes, the larger 40 mm in maximum dimension. Both nodes appear
inﬁltrated by tumour.

3 - A piece of ﬁbrofatty tissue 48 x 20 x 8 mm. 4 lymph nodes are identiﬁed,
the largest 8 mm in maximum dimension.

4 - A piece of ureter 7 mm long. All embedded.

5 - A piece of ureter 10 mm long. All embedded.

MICROSCOPY

Specimens 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5

The sections of the bladder show grade 3 transitional cell carcinoma that
extends into the perivesical fat. Perineural and vascular are present. The
ureteric, urethral and soft tissue margins are clear. The prostate shows areas

of granulomatous inﬂammation which would be in keeping with BCG treatment.
The background urothelium is reactive but no carcinoma in situ is identiﬁed.

6 lymph nodes have been identiﬁed. 2 right obturator nodes contain metastatic
tumour while 4 right external iliac nodes are negative.

SUMMARY

Cystoprostatectomy with right obturator and external iliac nodes - completely
excised grade 3 transitional cell carcinoma, with 2 positive right obturator
lymph nodes; G3, pT3a, N2, Mx
