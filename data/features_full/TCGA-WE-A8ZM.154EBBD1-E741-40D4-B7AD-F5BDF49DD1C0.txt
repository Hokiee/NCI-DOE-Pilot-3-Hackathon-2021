CYTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

LAB No:

CASE HISTORY:

Malignant melanoma of right index finger in Primary excision
done. Metastasis in right antecubital fossa in and axillary
dissection in Now has a thickening in right axilla. ?

scarring ? melanoma.

MACROSCOPIC:
3 air dried slides dated

MICROSCOPY:

Cellular preparations show atypical, spindle to polygonal cells with
nuclei harbouring multiple nucleoli and nuclear pseudo inclusions.
No excess of lymphoid cells seen in the background. The features are
in keeping with metastatic malignant melanoma.

DIAGNOSIS:
FNA, RIGHT AXILLA: METASTATIC MALIGNANT MELANOMA.

**SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT
LAB N0:

CASE HISTORY:
Metastatic malignant melanoma

MACROECOPIC:
Adipose tissue 13 x 11 x 4cm with attached muscle up to 5cm. It

contains a 3cm lymph node with a haemorrhagic centre (A).

MICROSCOPY:

The largest node contains metastatic melanoma, up to 20 mm diameter.
Tumour is present within perinodal fibrous tissue which I suspect
is the recent FNA track. 14 other lymph nodes are uninvolved

DIAGNOSIS:
LYMPH NODE, RIGHT AXILLA: METASTATIC MALIGNANT MELANOMA

REPORTED BY:
Dr Consultant Histopathologist

REPORT DATE:

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT: , ,V.
The case was sent to for BRAF
testing. reports

Sequencing analysis of the BRAF gene has revealed NO MUTATIONS
within codon 600 of BRAF gene.

MELANOMA: NO EVIDENCE OF MUTATION WITHIN CODON 600 OF BRAF.

HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

LAB No:
Tissue Bank No:

CASE HISTORY:
Tissue banking specimen taken. Stitch to reorientate.

MACROSCOPIC:

Right axilla. Skin ellipse 12.5 x up to 3.1 cm with underlying
tissue 11 x 17 cm and to a depth of 3.5 cm. An area on the deep
aspect has been inked green and sutured presumably where tissue bank
samples have been taken. Deep margin inked green and peripheral
margin inked blue. Serial sectioning reveals a pale fibrous area at
one peripheral aspect of the specimen. There is a circumscribed pale
nodule superior to the sutures and just above the deep margin, 1.1 x

0.9 x 0.8 cm. A — area of fibrosis, peripheral and deep margin. B
and C = nodule and deep margin.

MICROSCOPY:
There is a single subcutaneous deposit of metastatic melanoma with a

maximum dimension of 10mm.

No lymphovascular invasion is
identified.

The surgical margin has been disrupted by tissue
banking and as result precise measurement of excision is difficult.
The lesion is probably completely excised (within the limits imposed
by disruption) by approximately 2mm.

DIAGNOSIS:
RIGHT AXILLA: A SINGLE IOMM DEPOSIT OF METASTATIC MELANOMA.
