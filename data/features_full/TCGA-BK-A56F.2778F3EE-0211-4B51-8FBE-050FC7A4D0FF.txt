Final Surgical Pathology Report

Procedure:

Diagnosis

A. Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes, hysterectomy with bilateral
salpingo~oophorectomy: Endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma,
FIGO grade 1, with invasion into 60% of the myometrial wall;
negative margins of excision.

B. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, regional resection: Seven negative
lymph nodes (0/7).

C. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, regional resection: Three negative
lymph nodes (0/3). ‘

D. Lymph nodes, periaortic, regional resection: Three negative lymph
nodes (0/3).

Microscopic Description:
Histologic type: Endometrial adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type~/
Histologic grade: FIGO grade I
Myometrial invasion:
11 mm depth of invasion
18 mm depth of myometrial thickness
60 % of myometrial wall
Cervix: Negative for malignancy or dysplasia
Primary tumor (pT) TNM (FIGO): ple
Margins of resection: Negative
Vascular invasion: Not identified
Regional lymph nodes: Thirteen lymph nodes negative for carcinoma
(0/13)
Additional findings: Unremarkable ovaries and fallopian tubes;
adenomyosis; leiomyoma.
MSI testing: Ordered on block AFSl

Specimen

A. Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries
B. Right pelvic lymph nodes

C. Left pelvic lymph nodes

D Periaortic lymph nodes

Clinical Information
Endometrial cancer ~ For grade and depth of invasion J

Intraoperative Consultation
Uterus, ovaries and tubes, TAH/BSO: Grade 1 endometrioid
adenocarcinoma, with 50% myometrial invasion.

Gross Description
A. Received unfixed for frozen section and tissue procurement, labeled
uterus, cervix, tubes, and ovaries, is a uterus with bilateral adnexae.
The uterine corpus is 69 grams and 8 cm from fundus to cervix, 6 cm
from cornu to cornu, and 4 cm in maximum AP dimension. The ectocervix
is 3.5 cm in diameter, with slit— —like 05, l 4 cm. No ectocervical
lesions are identified. The endocervix is 4 cm long, without lesions.
The endometrial cavity is distorted by an anterior and posterior wall
mass lesion, and fibrotic mural nodule, with depth of invasion of at
least 50% of the myometrium. The myometrial thickness is 2. 2 cm. The

right ovary is 4 x 3.2 x 1.0 cm. No mass lesions identified. There is
an attached right fallopian tube, 6.5 cm long and 0.5 cm in diameter at
the isthmus, with fimbriated end. The left ovary is 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.0
cm, with an attached left fallopian tube, 6.0 cm long and 0.5 cm in
diameter at the isthmus, with fimbriated and. Representative sections
as follows: AFSl ‘ full thickness mass lesion; 1 right adnexa, 2 left
adnexa, 3—4 cervix, 5‘9 representative tumor.

B. Received fresh labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes" is a 6.5 x 5.3 x
2.2 cm aggregate of soft, lobulated tan gold adipose tissue. Several
slightly rubbery tan—pink—gold tissues in keeping with lymph nodes
ranging from minute up to 5.4 Cm in greatest dimension are recovered.
The lymphoid tissues are entirely submitted. RS 8

Summary: 1 — one lymph node, 2 — 3 lymph nodes, 3 and 4 — l bisected
lymph node per cassette, 5 through 8 — largest lymph node

C. Received fresh labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes" is a 6.4 x 5.0 x
2.3 cm aggregate of soft, lobulated tan gold adipose tissue. A few
soft tan«pink—gold tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to
4.3 cm in greatest dimension are recovered. The lymphoid tissues are
entirely submitted. as 5

Summary: 1 — 1 bisected lymph node, 2 and 3 a 1 bisected lymph node, 4
and 5 — largest lymph node

D. Received fresh labeled "periaortic lymph nodes" is a 4.0 x 3.5 x 1.8
cm aggregate of soft, lobulated tan gold adipose tissue. A few soft
tan—pink-gold tiSSues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 1.3
cm in greatest dimension are recovered. The lymphoid tissues are
entirely submitted. Rs 3

Summary: 1 — 2 lymph nodes, 2 and 3 — 1 bisected lymph node per
cassette
