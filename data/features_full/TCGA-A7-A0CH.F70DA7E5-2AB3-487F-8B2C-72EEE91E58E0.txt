SPECIMEN
A. Sentinel node left breast
B. Left breast
C. Left sentinel node

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Left breast cancer

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS
A. Benign on frozen section.
C. Benign on frozen section.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Received fresh in a container labeled "A. sentinel
node
left breast" is a portion of soft to rubbery tissue, 2.6 x
2 x 0.7 cm. Externally much of the specimen is fatty. On cut
surface, there is some tan-pink lymph node tissue, with prominent
fat replacement. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen
section in three blocks.

B. Received fresh in a container labeled "left breast" is

a 33 x 16 x 3.5 cm mastectomy specimen, partially surfaced
by a 20 x 11 cm tan—pink wrinkled skin ellipse, with a 1.6 cm in
diameter everted nipple. There is no gross lesion on the skin
surface. There is an arrow indicating superior. The deep aspect of
the specimen is inked and the specimen is serially sectioned,
revealing a 3.3 x 3.3 x 2 cm tan—white firm indurated mass which is
1.3 cm from the deep margin. The mass is located centrally but
slightly laterally, with the closest margin the aforementioned deep
margin, with the tumor not grossly near a margin. The specimen
outside the mass lesion consists of yellow adipose tissue with
interspersed tan-white tissue, without additional focal lesion. No
lymph nodes are identified with the breast. RS—lO.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
BLOCK SUMMARY: B1,BZ * entire nipple, and skin; B3 — deep margin
deep to tumor; 84—86 ~ tumor (sections do not include margin); B7 —
inner upper quadrant; B8 — inner lower quadrant; B9 - outer lower
quadrant; BlO — outer upper quadrant.

C. Received fresh in a container labeled "left sentinel
node" is a portion of soft to rubbery tan—yellow tissue, 2
x 1.5 x 0.7 cm. On cut surface, the specimen is predominantly
fatty,
with some identifiable tan—pink lymph node tissue. It is entirely
submitted for frozen section in two blocks.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
A,C. The lymph nodes are negative for malignancy. In
addition to examining serial H&E stained sections,
immunostains with antibodies to keratin (AEl/AEB) are examined,
without specific staining, supporting the interpretation that the
lymph nodes are negative for malignancy.

B. The following template summarizes the findings in this
part:

Invasive carcinoma: Present in the mass lesion in the breast in
part
B
Histologic type: Invasive ductal carcinoma
Histologic grade:
Overall grade: 1
Architectural score: 2
Nuclear score: 2
Mitotic score: 1

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Greatest dimension (pT): 3.3 cm (pT2)
Specimen margins: Negative for tumor
Vessel invasion: Not identified
Calcification: Present focally
Nipple: Negative for tumor
Invasion of skin or chest wall: Not identified

Ductal carcinoma in situ: Present very focally, with the vast
majority of the carcinoma in this specimen invasive carcinoma.
Histologic pattern: Cribriform
Nuclear grade: 1—2
Central necrosis: Absent
Specimen margins: Negative
Calcification: Not identified within DCIS

Description of non—tumorous breast: Fibrocystic changes.

Prognostic markers: Previously performed on a prior specimen at an
outside institution.

4X3,l4x2,15x3,20X5

DIAGNOSIS
A,C. Lymph nodes, left sentinel, excisions -
Negative for malignancy.

B. Breast, left, excision -

Invasive ductal carcinoma (see microscopic description).
Skin, nipple, and margins negative for malignancy.
