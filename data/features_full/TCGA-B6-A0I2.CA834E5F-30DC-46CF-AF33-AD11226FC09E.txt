CLINICAL HISTORY: ll
Bilateral carcinoma of the breast. H
GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. "Medial margin right breast biopsy", fresh. The Specimen consists of 3.7 x
2.2 x 0.6 cm disc of firm white, unremarkable breast tissue; four sutures
denote the true margin, which is inked black. Serial radial sections are
submitted as follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Al frozen section remnant Afl
A2 frozen section remnant AF2.
A3 frozen section remnant AF3.
A4 additional tissue.

B. "Right breast biopsy sample". Contains an irregular 10 x 0.5 x 1.7 cm disc
tan-brown coarsely papillary tissue. Portions are submitted for ER/PR and for
tissue bank and for frozen section. Frozen section remnant submitted in Block
Bl.

"Left breast tumor, wide reexcision, long suture lateral, short suture
superior", fresh. The specimen consists of a 4.5 x 4.3 x 2.2 cm wide
reexcision of the breast. The long suture denotes the lateral aspect of the
specimen and a short suture the superior. The superior pole of the tissue is
inked black, and the inferior blue.

On cut section, there is a 1.3 x 1.3 x 1 cm round, white, firm, gritty,
sharply-circumscribed tumor in the superior portion of the resection. The

a tumor extends to within 2 mm of the superior margin, and does not approach
closely to any other margin. The remainder'of the breast consists of firm,
white and tan admixed breast parenchyma. Tissue is divided into deep (towards
chest wall) and superficial (towards skin) halves and submitted from medial to
lateral as follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY:

C1 frozen section remnant Cfl.

C2—C8 superficial half from medial to lateral.
- gkc9-c15 deep half from medial to lateral.

D. "Right axillary dissection and wide reexcision", fresh. The specimen
consists of an excisional breast biopsy and attached axillary dissection. The
biopsy is incised, to obtain tissue for frozen section, ER/PR, and tissue
bank, prior to receipt by pathology. The biopsy measures 6.7 x 6.5 x 3.2 cm.
The axillary tail measures 10 x 2.3 x 0.9 cm. The medial surface (not a true
margin) is inked in red, the inferior margin black and the superior margin in
blue.

On cut section, there is a 4.5 x 2.3 x 2.5 cm white firm tumor, composed of
tan—yellow loose aggregates of tumor. The tumor approaches to within 3 mm of
the inked superior margin of resection and to within 1 cm of the superior and
5 mm of the inferior margin. Tumor approaches to within 4 mm of the deep
margin of resection. The remainder of the breast is unremarkable

The axillary dissection is divided into low, mid and distal level. There are
numerous lymph nodes, ranging from 0.3 to 1.4 cm, none grossly involved by
tumor.

E. "Left axillary dissection, silk on apex", fresh. The specimen consists of
a 6 x 9 x 1.7 cm lymph node dissection, with a black suture at one pole. The
lymph node dissection is divided into three sections, lower, middle and
distal. Numerous lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.3 to 1.7 cm in
greatest dimension. None grossly contains tumor

BLOCK SUMMARY:
