.CGA—BH-5764
Diagnosis

1. Poorly differentiated bilateral adenocarcinoma of the prostate across the organ, mainly in
the peripheral zone (Gleason 4+3=7, tertiary grade 5). Gleason 4: 5%, Gleason 5: <5%.
Max. tumor diameter 31 mm. Tumor inﬁltration of reetolateral periprostatic fatty tissue on
both sides in three successive steps (inﬁltration depth up to 1.5 mm, infiltration width up to
6 mm). Bilateral inﬁltration of seminal vesicles. Extensive tumor involvement of perineural
sheaths.

Tumor-free surgical preparation margins.

 

Additional foci of a prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and signs of
myoglandulai prostatic hype1plasia.U1othelium of p1 ostetrc ulethra without dysplasia
2. Five tum01—f1 ee lymph nodes on the right (0/5).

3. Three tumor—free lymph nodes on the left (0/3).

Tumor classiﬁcation
p‘I3b, max. tumor diameter 31 mm. Gleason 4+3=7, tertiary grade 5 (Gleason 4: 70%,
Gleason 5: <5%), R0, pNO (0/8)

Remark

No further carcinoma was detected in the prior frozen section analysis.

Carcinoma tissue was detected in the punch biopsies. Here, too, a Gleason 4 pattern was
predominant. Gleason 5 patterns were not observed.

Follow—11p report

Immunohistology: D2—40, CD31 (BRl, BR2).

Additional immunohistological investigations Were carried out to establish whether there was
vessel invasion. No evidence ofeithcr lymph or blood vessel invasion was detected.

Final tumor classification:
pT3b, maximum tumor diameter 31.0 mm, Gleason 4+3=7 tertiary grade 5 (Gleason 4: 70%,
Gleason 5: < 5%), L0, V0, R0, pNO (0/8).
