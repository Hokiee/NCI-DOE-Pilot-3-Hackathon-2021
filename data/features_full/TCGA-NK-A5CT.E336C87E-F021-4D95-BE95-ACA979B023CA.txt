FINAL DIAGNOSIS

A. (Lymph node, level 9; biopsy): Fragments of lymphoid tissue, negative for

malignancy

B. (Lymph node, level 7; biopsy): Fragments of lymphoid tissue, negative for

malignancy.

C. (Lymph node, level 7; biopsy): Fragments of lymphoid tissue, negative for

malignancy. '

D. (Lymph node, level 11; biopsy): Fragments of lymphoid tissue, negative for
malignancy.

E. (Lung, left lower lobe; Iobectomy): Moderately differentiated squamous

cell carcinoma, measuring 2.8 x 2.7 x 2.1 cm, with associated necrosis. No

convincing lymphovascular invasion noted. Visceral pleura, bronchial margin,

and vascular margin are free of tumor. Eight benign peribronchial lymph nodes.
Stage pTlNOMx. See note.

F. (Lymph node, level 5; biopsy): Fragments of lymphoid tissue, negative for

malignancy.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. The specimen is labeled "level 9 node." Received fresh is a < 1 g
specimen, consisting of a fragment of yellow and black soft tissue (0.9 x 0.5
x 0.3 cm). The entire specimen is wrapped and submitted in cassette A1. DB
B. The specimen is labeled "level 7 lymph node." Received fresh is a < 1 g
specimen, consisting of a single fragment of red-black soft tissue (0.6 x 0.3
x 0.3 cm). The entire specimen is wrapped and submitted in cassette Bl. DB
C. The specimen is labeled ”level 7 lymph node." Received fresh is a < 1 g
specimen, consisting of multiple fragments of red and black soft tissue (1.4 x
0.4 x 0.3 cm). The entire specimen is wrapped and submitted in cassette C1.

D. The specimen is labeled "level 11L lymph node." Received fresh is a < 1 g
specimen, consisting of two fragments of red-black soft tissue (1.2 x 1.1 x

0.7 cm in aggregate). The entire specimen is wrapped and submitted in
cassette D1.

E. The specimen is labeled "left lower lobectomy." Received fresh for frozen
section is a 192 g specimen, consisting of a Iobectomy (22 x 15 x 4.5 cm). The
surface of the specimen is inked red. The specimen is sectioned to show a
well-circumscribed, tan-gray, nodular mass (2.8 x 2.7 x 2.1 cm) located 1.1 cm
from the visceral pleura and > 1 cm from the bronchial margin. The remainder
of the specimen shows a homogenous, red—brown, soft cut surface. No other

lesions or masses are present. Gross pictures are taken.

A representative section of the tumor is submitted for frozen section with the
remnant placed in cassette E91. The remainder of the sections are submitted
as follows: E1 bronchial margin; E2 vascular margin; E3 tumor with nearest
visceral pleural margin; E4 through E7 representative sections of the tumor;
E8 lung parenchyma away from the tumor; E9 three peribronchial lymph nodes;
and E10 three peribronchial lymph nodes.

F. The specimen is labeled level 5 lymph node. Received fresh for frozen, is
a fragment of yellow~blacl< soft tissue (1.1 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm). One touch prep
and one smear are obtained. The specimen is bisected and submitted in its
entirety for frozen section with a remnant placed in cassette F91.
