RENAL CELL CARCINOMA ADMIXED WITH FIBRIN. RED BLOOD CELLS AND BLOOD VESSELS CONSISTENT WITH A
TUMOR THROMBUS.
(B) LEFT KIDNEY, RENAL VEIN THROMBUS, ADRENAL:
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, PAPILLARY TYPE 2, FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 4 WITH FOCAL SARCOMATOID
DEDIFFERENTIATION (APPROXIMATELY 10%).

RESECTION MARGIN.
Renal artery, ureteral and peripheral soft tissue resection margins. free of tumor.

No extranodal extension is present.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) IVC TUMOR THROMBUS - An unoriented friable 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm portion of soft tissue, entirely submitted in A.

(B) LEFT KIDNEY, RENAL VEIN THROMBUS. ADRENAL - A radical nephrectomy specimen (19.5 x 12.0 x 5.0 cm) including the
kidney (11.0 x 6.0 x 8.5 cm), a segment of renal artery, renal vein containing thrombus and ureter (10.0 cm length x 0.5 cm
average diameter and adrenal gland (3.1 x 2.0 x 0.7 cm).

There is a 4.8 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm well circumscribed variegated tumor in the midportion of the kidney that is yellow-tan to
white-tan with extensive areas of hemorrhage and necrosis present predominantly at the periphery of the tumor. The tumor is
conﬁned to the kidney but appears to distend the renal capsule as well as Gerota's fascia (black). The tumor does not appear to
invade into perinephric adipose tissue. The tumor abuts the renal sinus and appears to extend into the renal vein.

The adjacent kidney parenchyma is unremarkable apart from simple renal cortical cyst ranging in size from 0.5 to 3.0 cm
in greatest dimensions.

The pelvicalyceal system is smooth and devoid of any lesions. No lymph nodes are identiﬁed in the hilum of the kidney.
Serial cross sections of the left adrenal gland show unremarkable cortex and medulla.

INK CODE: Black - Gerota's fascia closest to tumor.

SECTION CODE: B1, ureter, renal artery and renal vein margin, en face; 82, B3, renal sinus and tumor; B4-B5, tumor in
relationship to Gerota's fascia and perinephric fat; 86, tumor in relationship to kidney; B7, tumor in relationship to perinephric fat;
BB, BQ, unremarkable kidney with renal cysts; B10, adrenal gland.

(C) PARA—AORTIC LYMPH NODES - A 5.0 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm portion of ﬁbroadipose tissue. The specimen is dissected to reveal
twenty possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 up to 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is submitted entirely.

SECTION CODE: C1, ﬁve possible lymph nodes: C2, ﬁve possible lymph nodes; C3, four possible lymph nodes; C4,
three possible lymph nodes; C5, two possible lymph nodes; C6, one possible lymph node bisected.
