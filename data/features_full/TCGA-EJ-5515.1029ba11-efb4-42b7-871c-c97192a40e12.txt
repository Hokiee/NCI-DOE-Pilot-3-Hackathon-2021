NO EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASIA IN THREE LYMPH NODES EXAMINED (013).

PART 2:
LYMPH NODES, LEFT PELVIC, EXCISION -
NO EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASIA IN SEVENTEEN LYMPH NODES EXAMINED (ONT).

PART 3:

PROSTATE AND BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES, RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY -

A. INVASIVE POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 3 + 4 = TWITH MINOR GLEASON
GRADE 5 COMPONENT COMPRISING 2% OF THE ENTIRE TUMOR VOLUME AND SHOWING FEATURES OF
DUCTAL CARCINOMA (See synoptic).

THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES THE RIGHT LOBE ONLY AND HAS A GREATEST NODULAR DIAMETER OF 1.6 cm.

' THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES APPROXIMATELY 5% OF THE EXAMINED PROSTATE VOLUME. .

THE CARCINOMA SHOWS FOCAL EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IN THE POSTERIOR RIGHT MID (SLIDE 3U} AND
POSTERIOR RIGHT BASE (SLIDE 3V} CAPSULAR MARGIN REGIONS. '

BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA. ‘

THE CARCINOMA IS PRESENT WITHIN 2 CELL LAYERS FROM THE INKED POSTERIOR RIGHT MID CAPSULAR
MARGIN, HOWEVER ALL EXAMINED SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA.
MULTIFOCAL PERINEURAL INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

NO ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IS IDENTIFIED. .

MULTIFOCAL HIGH GRADE PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA IS IDENTIFIED.

PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT3a NO Mx. ‘

TNM HISTOLOGIC GRADE = 03-4..

BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERTROPHY AND CHRONIC iNFLAMMATION ARE NOTED.
