Gross Description: /
Received in three parts. ./
Source of Tissue: 1. Labeled #1, "retroperitoneal mass with left kidney"

Frozen Section Diagnosis: lFS- SPINDLE CELL NEOPLASM PER

Gross Description: Received fresh for frozen section evaluation with
patient name and medical record number labeled "retroperitoneal mass with
left kidney" is a 26.0 x 20.0 x 12.5 cm mass having a tan to pink-red
smooth to irregular outer surface. It is sectioned to reveal a 20.0 cm in
greatest dimension multiloculated cyst containing serosanguineous ﬂuid.
The inner lining is gray—tan and irregular with the cyst wall averaging

1.5 cm in thickness. The wall is tan and rubbery ﬁrm. Firmly adherent
to this cystic mass is a 9.0 x 5.5 x 4.5 cm kidney. There is a 1.5 x 0.3

cm fragment of attached ureter having a lumen, 0.2 cm. which is probe
patent to the renal hilum. The kidney is bivalved to reveal tan-brown
renal parenchyma having a well-deﬁned cortico-medullary junction. The
parenchyma and pelvis are not distorted and the adjacent tumor does not
appear to arise from the kidney itself. Further sectioning of the cystic
mass in the area of the kidney reveals areas which are focally calciﬁed.
There is a 5.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm attached adrenal gland which is sectioned to
reveal golden-yellow-orange unremarkable cut surfaces. Representative
sections are submitted in eighteen blocks.

Designation of Sections: lFS- frozen section cystic mass, lA- ureter and
vascular margins, kidney, lB-lC- random kidney with adjacent mass, 1D-
adrenal gland, lE-IR- representative sections cystic mass

Summary of Sections: multiple

Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled #2, "intra aortocaval lymph node"

Gross Description: Received ﬂesh with patient name and medical record
number labeled "intra aortocaval lymph node" are 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm of
yellow-tan ﬁbroadipose tissue. There are two palpable lymph nodes, 1.8 cm
in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted in three
blocks.

Designation of Sections: 2A-2B- one lymph node, 2C- one lymph node

Summary of Sections: multiple

Source of Tissue: 3. Labeled #3, "para aortic lymph node"

Gross Description: Received fresh with patient name and medical record
number labeled "para aortic lymph node" is a 1.5 cm in greatest dimension
red—purple soft lymph node which is entirely submitted in one block.

Designation of Sections: Block 3

Summary of Sections: undesignated—Z

**#************************************#*********#**********************
Final Diagnosis:

1. Retroperitoneal mass with left kidney, resection:

- High-grade spindle cell sarcoma consistent with CD117 positive

leiomyosarcoma (20.0 cm), see comment.

- The tumor surrounds, but not invades into, left kidney, ureter and

adrenal.

- Kidney with chronic pyelonephritis. Adrenal gland with no pathological
changes.

Comment: The morphology at the tumor suggests leiomyosarcoma. Tumor cells
stain strongly positive for SMA, weakly positive for CD417. They are

negative for Desmin and CD34. The case is reviewed by f

' nd he concurs with the diagnosis.

2. lntra aortocaval lymph nodes, biopsy:

— Two lymph nodes, no tumor seen (0/2).

3. Para aortic lymph nodes, biopsy:

— One lymph node, no tumor seen (011).
