Left eye enucleation

Macroscopy

The eye ball mesures 25 by 25 by 23 mm and presents a posterior segment of optic
nerves measuring 5 mm. At the section, the tumor measures 18 mm main line.

Samples have been frozen for genetic studies then the piece has been ﬁxed and
included entirely.

Microscopy

The tumor observed macroscopically corresponds to an uveal melanoma, mainly
composed of epithelio‘id cells. The cell cytoplasm is often pigmented with melanin.
The cyto/nuclear atypia are severe. Presence of large areas of necrosis and
hemorragy, in particular at the centre of the tumor.

The lesion is located at a large distance of the optic foramen and the optic nerve on
its entire course and cut end is free of tumor. The tumor infiltrates all of the thickness
of the sclera but there is no extra-scleral tumor extension. Presence of one intra-
scleral endovascular tumor embolism. The ciliary body, the iris and the anterior
chamber are free.
