DIAGNOSIS:
SIGMOID COLON, - . .
INVASIVE ADENOCARCINOMA of the colon (3.5 x 2.5 x 0.6 cm} poorly

differentiated,, invading into the subserosa.

Margins of resection are negative for tumor.
Tumor is 0.1 cm from radial margin.
METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA in 3 of 20 lymph nodes.
Tumor deposits present in serosa.
The AJCC classification is T3 N1 Mx.

CLINICAL DATA:

History: None given.

Operation: sigmoid resection

Clinical Diagnosis: Rectal ca

TISSUE SUBMITTED: 1. S
GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh, labeled wit e pa lent's name, unit number,

and "sigmoid colon", is a segment of colon (12 cm in length x 3 cm in diameter)
with one stapled resection margin (3.5 cm} and one open end. There is an

cm from the opened end and 9.5 cm from the stapled resection margin. The tumor
extends into the muscularis propria, grossly. No extension through to the

the colon segment is unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted.
