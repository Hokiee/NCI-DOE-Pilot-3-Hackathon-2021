Gross Description

A. Specimen A, is labeled "fat adjacent to tumor“. The specimen is received fresh and consists of

a 3 x 2 x 1 cm, soft, yellow—tan irregular fragment of adipose tissue which is sectioned and entirely
submitted asAt and A2.

8. Specimen B is received fresh for frozen section analysis labeled ”deep margin left kidney“.
The specimen consists of a 1 it (1.2.x 0.1 cm, soft. Drown-tan irregular fragment of renal paremhyma
which is entirely submitted for frozen section as F831.

C. Specimen C is received fresh for frozen section analysis labeled "left partial nephrectomy“.
The specinen is receiver: fresh and consists of a 2.5 x 2.5 x 1 cm, rubbery, brown—tan irregular
fragment of renal parenchyma. The surgical margin of resection is marked with black lnlc Serial
sections reveal a soft, bright-yellow mass (1.5 x 1 x 1 cm). The remainder of the cut surface consists
of a red—brown grossly unremarkable renal parenchyma. A representative section of the tumor is
submitted to Tissue Procurement iaboratory. A representative frozen section is taken and submitted

as F3831. The remaining tissue is entirely submitted as:
