Gross description:

1. (Prostate gland): Prostate gland: Weight: 55 9, Volume: 50 ml, Size: 4.9 x 5.1 x 4.5 cm. Adherent
seminal vesicles and deferent duct: right side: 2.8 cm. left side: 2.7 cm. The surface is marked with
green ink on the right side. blue ink on the left side. Apical pen-urethral a funnel shaped 1.1 x 1 cm
tissue defect marked with red ink. Total of the cross sections: 1.4 cm'.

2. (Lymph nodes. right side): 5.2 x 4.2 x 1.3 cm measuring adipose tissue containing 9 nodes.

3. (Lymph nodes, left side): 5.5 x 4.5 x 1.2 cm measuring adipose tissue containing 5 nodes.

Microscopy:

1. Apex right and left: Right 8 tissue blocks, left 7 tissue blocks (total 15 tissue blocks). 3 cross
sections: Right 18 tissue blocks, left 18 tissue blocks (total 36 tissue blocks). Basis right and left: Right
8 tissue blocks, left 12 tissue blocks (total 20 tissue blocks). Seminal vesicles right and left: Right 2
tissue blocks, left 2 tissue blocks (total 4 tissue blocks). Deferent ducts right and left: Right 1 tissue
block, left 1 tissue block (total 2 tissue blocks).

2. Frozen lymph nodes right: 12 tissue blocks.

3. Frozen lymph nodes left: 6 tissue blocks.

Diagnosis:

1. (Prostate gland): Poorly differentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma. Gleason 4+5=9. (Gleason 4: 80%,
Gleason 5: 20%). Tumor involves both lobes. Maximum tumor diameter: 49 mm. Extensive perineural
invasion. Tumor inﬁltration into peri-prostatic adipose tissue in 7 tissue blocks with the main focus
posterior, right side. Tumor inﬁltration into both seminal vesicles and right deferent duct with positive
surgical margin. Positive surgical margin in 6 blocks (contact length 4 mm; Gleason 4+5). Negative
peri-urethral surgical margin.

Urothelium of the prostatic urethra without dysplasia. Tumor-free left deferent duct.

2. (Lymph nodes. right side): Three lymph node metastases in 10 lymph nodes (3/10).
3. (Lymph nodes, left side): Five tumor-free lymph nodes (0/5).

Tumor classiﬁcation

(in consideration of the intraoperative frozen-section and immunohistochemical analyses):

pT3b, Gleason 4+5=9 (Gleason 4: 80%, Gleason 5: 20%), maximum tumor diameter: 49 mm, tumor
volume approx. 47.5 ml (Gleason 4: 38.0 ml, Gleason 5: 9.5 ml), pN1 (3/15), L1, V0, R1

Comments:

Tumor inﬁltration into peri-prostatic adipose tissue (tissue blocks AR3B, AR4B. R1C, R1 D. R2D. R3C,
BR4A).

Tumor inﬁltration into both seminal vesicles (tissue blocks BRZB. SBR1-2, SBL1-2).

Positive surgical margin in 6 tissue blocks with the main focus in the base. as well as in the deferent
duct of left side (tissue blocks R3A, R3C, BRZA, BL2A, BL3A, SBR1,DDL).

The preceding intraoperative frozen section "Dennonvillier’s-fascia with perirectal adipose tissue
attached” showed tumor-free soft tissue.
