1. (Prostate gland): Prostate gland: Weight: 26 9, Volume: 21 ml. Size: 4.2 x 4.3 x 2.6 cm.
Adherent seminal vesicles and deferent duct: right side: 2.5 cm, left side: 2.4 cm. The surface
is marked with green ink on the right side. blue ink on the left side. On the right recto-lateral
surface a 2.5 x 2.5 cm measuring tissue defect marked with yellow ink. On the left recto-

Gross description:

lateral surface a 3.2 x 2.4 cm measuring tissue defect marked with yellow ink. Apical peri-
urethral a funnel-shaped 1.0 x 1.2 cm measuring tissue defect marked with red ink. Total of
the cross sections: 2 cm.

2. (Lymph nodes, right side): 4.5 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm measuring adipose tissue containing four
nodes measuring up to 4.5 cm.

3. (Lymph nodes, left side): 2.2 x 1.3 x 0.7 cm measuring adipose tissue containing three
nodes measuring up to 2.2 cm.

Microscopy:

1. Apex right side and left side: Right side 5 tissue blocks. left side 6 tissue blocks (total 11
tissue blocks). 3 cross sections: Right side 8 tissue blocks, left side 8 tissue blocks (total 16
tissue blocks). Basis right side and left side: Right side 5 tissue blocks, left side 7 tissue
blocks (total 12 tissue blocks). Seminal vesicles right side and left side: Right side 5 tissue
blocks, left side 4 tissue blocks (total 9 tissue blocks). Deferent ducts right side and left side:
Right side 1 tissue block, left side 1 tissue block (total 2 tissue blocks).

2. 9 tissue blocks.

3. 5 tissue blocks.

Diagnosis:
1. (Prostate gland): Moderately differentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason 3+3=6.
Tumor involves both lobes. Maximum tumor diameter: 17 mm. No perineural invasion. No

tumor infiltration into prostatic adipose tissue. Negative surgical margin (circumference and
peri—urethral)

Remaining prostatic tissue with small foci prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (high grade PIN)
and signs of myoglandular hyperplasia of the prostate. Urothelium of the prostatic urethra
without dysplasia. Tumor-free seminal vesicles and deferent ducts on both sides.

2. (Lymph nodes, right side): Nine tumor—free lymph nodes (0/9).
3. (Lymph nodes, left side): Nine tumor-free lymph nodes (0/9).

Tumor classiﬁcation

(in consideration of the intraoperative frozen-section, parallel report and immunohistochemical
analyses):

pT2c, Gleason 3+3=6, maximum tumor diameter: 17 mm, tumor volume approx. 2.2 ml, pNO
(0/18), LO, V0. R0
Comments:

In the intraoperative frozen-section examination of the recto-lateral circumference tumor was
identified on both sides with negative surgical margins on both sides.

lmmunohistochemical analyses (DZ-40, CD31) were performed on tissue blocks 2E and ZG
to exclude lymphatic and venous invasion.

One macroscopic image for tumor mapping.
