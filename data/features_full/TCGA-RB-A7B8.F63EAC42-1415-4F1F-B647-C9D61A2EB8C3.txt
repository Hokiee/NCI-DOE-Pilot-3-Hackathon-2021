* Final Report '

- CARCINOMA INVOLVES THE PERIPANCREATIC SOFT TISSUE.
- PERINEURAL INVASION IS PRESENT.
- LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IS NOT IDENTIFIED.

- CARCINOMA EXTENDS TO THE RETROPERITONEAL EDGE; REFER TO SPECIMEN ‘C' FOR STATUS OF
RETROPERITONEAL MARGIN.

- COMMON BILE DUCT EDGE AND PANCREATIC NECK EDGE ARE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA; REFER TO PARTS
'A' AND '8' FOR STATUS OF BILE DUCT AND PANCREATIC NECK MARGINS. RESPECTIVELY.
- PROXIMAL AND DISTAL DUODENAL MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.

- EIGHT OF TWENTY-THREE LYMPH NODES ARE POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (8123).
- SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT AND COMMENT.

Comment

There is a cystic component to the tumor (approximately 20% grossly) which is not clearly an intraductal papillary mucinous

neoplasm (IPMN). The differential diagnosis includes colonization of a retention cyst or large duct by carcinoma versus IPMN
replaced by carcinoma.

Some of the positive lymph nodes appear to be positive by direct extension of the tumor.
The micropapillary component accounts for approximately 10% of the tumor.

Selected slides from this case have been reviewed at our daily with
concurring with the diagnosis.

Gross Description
Five specimens are received, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.

Specimen A is received fresh for intraoperative consultation. identiﬁed with the patient‘s name and medical record number and
designated as "bile duct margin." The specimen consists of luminal soft tissue measuring 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The entire

specimen is submitted for frozen section diagnosis and the contents of the cryoblock are transferred to cassette "A1FS."
Dictated by

Specimen B is received fresh for intraoperative consultation. identiﬁed with the patient's name and medical record number and
designated as "pancreatic neck margin." The specimen consists of a fragment of soft tissue measuring 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm. The

entire specimen is submitted for frozen section diagnosis and the contents of the cryoblock are transferred to cassette "Bl FS."

Specimen C is received fresh for intraoperative consultation, identiﬁed with the patient‘s name and medical record number and
designated as "retroperitoneal margin." The specimen consists of a fragment of soft tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.1 cm. The

entire specimen is submitted for frozen section diagnosis and the contents of the cryoblock are transferred to cassette "C1FS."

aaorennln 1 2 v 0 R v n 9 cm. The specimen is submitted entirely. wrapped in lens paper in cassette "D1." Dictated by

Specimen E is received fresh and is labeled "Whipple." lt consists of a pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen with duodenum
measuring 195 cm in length and 5.5 cm in circumference and pancreatic head measuring 4.5 cm anterior/posterior, 5.4 cm
superiorpto-inferior and 5.0 cm from duodenal edge to neck edge. The stomach and gallbladder are not present. The common
bile duct is dilated and measures 2.9 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter. The pancreatic duct measures 3.0 cm in length and up
to 0.2 cm in diameter. The two ducts open to different ampullae through separate oriﬁces. The accessory ampulla measures 0.5
x 0.4 cm, does not communicate with the common bile duct nor the cystic duct, and is 1.0 cm from the proximal duodenal margin.
There is a mass located predominantly in the pancreatic head that has both solid (80%) and cystic components (20%). The mass
is tan-white with well-deﬁned borders and measures 2.3 x 2.2 x 2.0 cm. Areas of necrosis are not identiﬁed. There are no

' polypoid or soft friable papillary areas. The mass does not involve the ampulla. The mass abuts the common bile duct and
invasion cannot be grossly ruled out. The mass grossly involves the pancreatic duct causing constriction at 1.0 cm from the
ductal edge. The mass does not involve the duodenum and is grossly conﬁned to the pancreatic head. The mass is located 1.0
cm from the pancreatic neck edge and abuts and possibly involves the retroperitoneal edge and vascular bed. The mass abuts
the free posterior lateral surface and is 0.8 cm from the free anterior surface. The accessory ampulla is uninvolved by the mass.
A representative section of the mass as well as uninvolved duodenum is submitted to The
specimen is inked as follows: vascular bed-blue, retroperitoneal edge-black. accessory ampulla-green, serosal surface-blue.
Representative sections are submitted as stated below.
