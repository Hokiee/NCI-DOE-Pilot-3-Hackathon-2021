PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, ACINAR TYPE. GLEASON SCORE 3+4=7, WITH A TERTIARY FOCUS OF
GLEASON PATTERN 5 PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA (See comment).

CARCINOMA INVOLVES BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT LOBES OF THE PROSTATE GLAND AND HAS A MAXIMAL
TUMOR DIAMETER OF 2 CM IN A HISTOLOGIC SECTION.

CARCINOMA COMPRISES APPROXIMATELY 15% OF THE SAMPLED PROSTATE GLAND VOLUME.

FOCAL CARCINOMATOUS EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IS PRESENT IN THE RIGHT POSTERIOR MID AND
RIGHT POSTERIOR BASE PROSTATE (SECTIONS 3V, 3WW).

MULTIFOCAL CARCINOMATOUS PERINEURAL INVASION IS PRESENT.

NO ANGIOLYMPHA‘I‘IC INVASION IS PRESENT. ‘

MULTIFOCAL HIGH-GRADE PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAI'. NEOPLASIA.

BENIGN SEMINAL VESICLES AND DISTAL VASA DEFERENTIA.

ALL SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF NEOPLASIA.

NON-NEOPLASTIC PROSTATE WITH MILD NODULAR HYPERPLASIA AND FOCAL GLANDULAR ATROPHY.
TNM PATHOLOGIC STAGE: T3a N0 MX.

TOLOGIC GRADE: G3-4 {See synoptic).

COMMENT:
Part 3: There is a small (0.3 cm) focus of Gleason pattern 5 carcinoma present in the left mid anterior-posterior prostate

(slides 30, 3V). This likely represents a small focus of dedifferentiation of the prostatic adenocarcinoma. Gleason 4 and
5 components comprise approximately 20% of the total sampled tumor volume.
