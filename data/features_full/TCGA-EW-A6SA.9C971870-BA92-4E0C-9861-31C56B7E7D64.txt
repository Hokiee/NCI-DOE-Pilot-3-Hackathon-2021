E. Received in formalin and labeled 3LEFT BREAST/ 1 SHORT STITCH
SUPERIOR; 1 LONG STITCH LATERAL (FRESH)4 is a lumpectomy specimen oriented with
two sutures by surgeon as dictated. Specimen is inked as follows: superior,
blue; inferior, green; deep, black; lateral, orange; medial, red. Specimen

0.1 cm. The other margins are as follows: 0.5 cm from superior, 0.5 cm from
inferior, 1.2 cm from lateral, 2.5 cm from medial, 0.1 cm from deep and is
covered in the anterior aspect by the overlying skin. There is a. segment of dark
brown skin ellipse with nipple measuring 6.5 x 2.5 cm overlying the lesion.
