The eyeball presents a tumor exhibiting the morphology of an uveal melanoma
composed of fusiform (40%) and of epithelioid cells (60%). Important melanotic
pigmentation. The mitotic index is very low. There is no necrosis.

The tumor invades the ciliary body. The sclera, the optic nerve on its entire course,
the meningeal sheath and the end cut of the optic nerve are free of tumor. There is
no extrascleral extension.

The tumor size is 12x7 mm main lines

Conclusion:

Uveal melanoma composed of fusiform and of epithelioid cells.
Tumor size: 12x7 mm.

Low mitotic index.

Tumor extension of the ciliary body

No extrascleral extension.

Sclera, optic nerve in its entire course. cut end of the optic nerve and meningeal
sheaths free of tumor.
