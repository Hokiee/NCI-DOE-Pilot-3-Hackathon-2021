Operation/Specimen:

Clinical History and Pre-Op Dx:

GROSS PATHOLOGY:

1. Multiple 0.2—0.5 cm tissue fragments. Frozen section diagnosis:

Glioma, in #1,2.

2. Multiple 0.4—0.6 cm tissue fragments. Frozen section diagnosis:
Glioma, in #3,4.

3.

SPECIMEN: Right frontal tumor.

FIXATIVE: Formalin.

GENERAL: A 5.5 x 2.8 x 2.2 cm. fleshy pinkHtan soft wedge
resection. Serial sectioning shows a homogeneous,
glistening, pinkwgray cut surface.

SECTIONS: Representative sections submitted in blocks X1—X6.

4.

SPECIMEN: Medial frontal tumor.

FIXATIVE: Formalin.

GENERAL: A 1.8 x 1.8 x 1 cm. fragment of gray—pink pasty tissue.
Serial sectioning shows a uniform cut surface.

SECTIONS: Submitted in total in blocks X7HX8.

MICROSCOPIC: A—D. Sections show an oligodendroglioma involving the
white matter and cortex where scattered neurons and subpial extension

are identified. Microcystic changes are present. Microcalcification
is not seen. The tumor is composed of a large number of
minigemistocytes. The tumors are hypercellular in many sections
where

nuclear pleomorphism and hyperchromasia are frequent. Mitotic figures
are identified, about 2 per 10 HPF. Vascular hyperplasia is present
in

some hypercellular regions. Tumor necrosis is not seen.
Minigemistocytes are positive for GFAP but other neoplastic cells are
negative. Proliferative index (MIB—l) is about 6%.
