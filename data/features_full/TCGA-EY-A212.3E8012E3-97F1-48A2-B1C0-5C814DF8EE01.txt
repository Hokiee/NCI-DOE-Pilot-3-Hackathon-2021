Ovary, right, oophorectomy:
—Surface inclusion cysts with tubal metaplasia
—No evidence of malignancy

Ovary, left, oophorectomy:

—Focal micrometastatic adenocarcinoma involves ovarian cortex,
<0.l mm in size

(A3)

-Surface inclusion cysts

Fallopian tube, right, salpingectomy:
—Not identified grossly or microscopically

Fallopian tube, left, salpingectomy:
—Benign paratubal cysts

—No evidence of malignancy (floaters present)

B: Lymph node, right para-aortic, removal

—No metastatic carcinoma identified in thirteen lymph nodes
(0/13)

C: Lymph node, left para-aortic, removal
—No metastatic carcinoma identified in six lymph nodes (0/6)

D: Lymph node, right pelvic, removal
-No metastatic carcinoma identified in seventeen lymph nodes
(0/17)

E: Lymph node, left pelvic, removal

-One out of 16 lymph nodes shows focal metastatic
adenocarcinoma, 0.7 mm in

size, confirmed by immunohistochemical stain for pancytokeratin
(1/16)

COMMENT:

Immunostains for pancytokeratin (AEl/AE3) are performed on
several lymph nodes

to rule out micrometastases (E5, E1, E2, and D7). Focal
micrometastatic

adenocarcinoma is noted in one node in block E5 (the rest of the
immunostains

show no evidence of metastatic carcinoma).

reagents. These were
