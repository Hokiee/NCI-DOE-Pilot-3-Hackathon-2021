CLINICAL DATA:
Cervical cancer.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A) Received in formalin designated "right external iliac node" are
multiple

fragments of fatty tissue measuring 2 x 2 x 1 cm in aggregate. Three
potential

lymph nodes are identified and submitted in cassette A1.

B) Received in formalin designated "right obturator node" are multiple
fragments of fatty tissue measuring 3 x 2 x 1 cm in aggregate. Several
potential lymph nodes are identified and submitted in cassette Bl.

C) Received in formalin designated "right common para—aortic nodes" are
multiple fragments of soft tissue measuring 1 x l x 1 cm. No lymph nodes
are

identified and the specimen is entirely submitted in cassette Cl.

D) Received in formalin designated "left ovary" is an ovary without
attached

tube measuring 3.5 x 3 x 2.5 cm. Multiple cysts (up to 0.8 cm) and
adhesions

are identified on the surface. The specimen is bivalved and cut surfaces
reveal

a cyst measuring 1 cm. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes
D1

and D2.

E) Received in formalin designated "left external iliac nodes" are
multiple

fragments of fatty tissue measuring 4 x 2 x 1 cm in aggregate. Several
potential lymph nodes are identified and submitted in cassettes E1—E3.

F) Received in formalin designated "left obturator nodes" are multiple
fragments of fatty tissue and blood clot. No lymph nodes are identified
and the

specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes F1 and F2.

G) Received in formalin designated "left common iliac nodes" are multiple
fragments of fatty tissue measuring 2 x 1 x 0.8 cm in aggregate. One
lymph node

is identified and submitted in cassette G1.

H) Received in formalin designated "right parametria" is a fragment of
fibroadipose tissue measuring 2 x 2 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. The specimen
lS

submitted in toto in cassette H1.

I) Received in formalin designated "uterus, tube, ovary and parametrium"
18 a
uterus with attached ovary and fallopian tube measuring 11 x 6 x 5 cm and
weighs
190 grams. The uterus is covered with pink, smooth, glistening serosa
with no
focal lesions identified. The ectocervix has a pink, smooth mucosa; the
cervical canal is patent. The cervix measures 3.5 x 3.5 cm. The
parametrium
area is inked as follows: anterior blue, posterior green. No lymph
nodes
are identified in the parametrium. Bivalving the specimen reveals a 5 x
1.5 cm.
endometrial cavity The endometrium measures up to 0.2 cm in thickness and
the
myometrium measures up to 2.5 cm. in thickness. The specimen is sectioned;
sequential cut surfaces reveal multiple small leiomyomas in the myometrium
measuring up to 1.5 cm in diameter. A firm, predominantly submucosal tumor
mass,
which measures up to 1.5 cm in depth, 2.5 cm in length and which
circumferentially involves all the quadrants of cervix, is identified
within the
parenchyma of the cervix. The cut surfaces appears homogeneously white.
Grossly,
The lesion does not extend to the surgical resection margin; the nearest
margin
is 0.4 cm from the lesion. Representative sections are submitted as
follows: 11

vaginal cuff, anterior; 12 vaginal cuff, posterior; 13 parametrium,
anterior; I4 parametrium, posterior; 15-16 cervix, anterior left
quadrant;
17—18 anterior right quadrant. Cassettes I9-I10 cervix posterior
right
quadrant. Cassettes Ill—112 cervix posterior left quadrant. 113 lower
segment of uterus; 114 uterus, fundus portion and representative
sections of
leiomyoma.

J) Received in formalin designated "left post vaginal margin" is a
fragment of mucosa measuring 4 x l x 0.5 cm. A suture is identified on
one side of the specimen. The specimen is sectioned and the margin near
the suture is submitted in cassette J1.

K) Received in formalin designated "right post vaginal margin" is a
fragment of mucosa measuring 5 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is sectioned
and submitted in toto in cassette K1.

L) Received in formalin designated "appendix" is an appendix with
attached fatty tissue measuring 7.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. The appendix measures
6.5 x 5 x 5

cm. The appendix is covered with pink, smooth serosa. No focal lesions
are identified. Representative sections of the tip, mid portion, and
resection margin are submitted in cassette L1.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

A) Right external iliac node, resection: Three lymph nodes, negative for
tumor.

B) Right obturator node, resection: Six lymph nodes, negative for tumor.
C) Right common para—aortic nodes, resection: Two lymph nodes, negative
for

tumor.

D) Left ovary, resection: Serous cystadenoma (1.0 cm in diameter).

E) Left external iliac lymph node, resection: 4 out of 13 lymph nodes
positive

for metastatic tumor.

F) Left obturator nodes, resection: Four lymph nodes, negative for
tumor.

G) Left common iliac nodes, resection: One negative lymph node.

H) Right parametrium, resection: Fibroadipose tissue; no evidence of
malignancy.

I) Uterus, tubes, ovaries, and parametrium, resection:
Moderately—differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix

with the following features:

1. Proportionate depth of invasion: Maximum depth of invasion is 88% of
the

1.7 cm thick wall (1.5/1.7 cm); tumor is circumferential.

2. Parametrium: One positive lymph node in anterior parametrium; no
tumor

invasive of soft tissue of the parametrium.

3. All surgical margins are free of tumor; nearest margin 0.2 cm from
the

tumor; vaginal cuff resection margin free of tumor.
4. Microscopic angiolymphatic invasion is present.
J) Left post-vaginal margin, resection: Negative for tumor.
K) Right post-vaginal margin, resection: Negative for tumor.

L) Appendix, resection: Appendix without diagnostic abnormality.
