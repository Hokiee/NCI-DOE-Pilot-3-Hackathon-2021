Prostate cancer

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
A—E: See ﬁnal microscopic-diagnosis.

F: Sections of the bladder and prostate show a poorly differentiated, invasive urothelial carcinoma. The tumor
cells grow in trabeculae and display a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio and a high mitotic rate. Nuclear
pleomorphism is moderate and nuclear irregularities are present. The chromatin is coarsely clumped with areas
of irregular clearing 'with moderate to sparse eosinophilic cytoplasm. Cell borders are indistinct. Tumor cells deep
invade the prostatic parenchyma approaching to within 0.1 cm of the inked prostatic capsular radial margin (F17).

G-V: See ﬁnal microscopic-diagnosis.

cm length of ureter 0.5 cm in diameter. Entirely submitted In one cassette for frozen section.

B: The specimen is received fresh from the OR. and labeled “Left uretheral margin" (sic). it consists of a 0.3 cm
length of ureter 0.2 cm in diameter. Entirely submitted in one cassette for frozen section.

D: The specimen is received fresh from the OR. and labeled "Inferior urethral margin." It consists of a 0.4 x 0.4 x
0.2 cm, tan tissue fragment. Entirely submitted for frozen section.

E: The specimen is received fresh from the OR. and labeled "Posterior urethral margin." It consistsof a 1 x 0.5 x
0.4 cm. tan tissue fragment. Entirely submitted for frozen section.

F: The specimen is received fresh from the OR. and labeled "Bladder & prostate." it consists of a 20 x 13.5 x 5.5
cm cystoprostatectomy specimen. The peritoneum measures 17 x12 cm and is grossly uninvolved. The bladder
measures 5 x 5 x 3 cm. The prostate measures approximately 2 3 x 3 x 3 cm to palpation but is firmly attached to
a 5 x 4 x 3 cm. palpable mass at the neck of the bladder. The specimen is opened along its. anterior surface to
reveal the following: A 5 x 4 x 3 cm,_ Iobulated, exophytic mass that is located in the portion of the bladder inferior
margin. A portion of the mass detached from the specimen upon opening. The surface of the mass displays
stellate ulceration and necrosis. The mass is located at the interface between the bladder and the prostate. Serial
section reveals a flat demarcation between the mass and the prostate. The cut surface of the mass is ﬁrm and
white-tan and displays an interface with the prostate parenchyma. The prostatic parenchyma is not Iobulated;
however. ﬁne, protruding, yellow-white, punctate areas are present in the right lobe cf the prostate. The prostatic

' urethra measures 1.5 cm in length and is grossly involved. The verumontanum is excavated. The uninvolved
bladder mucosa is purple and edematous. No other lesions are noted. The uninvolved wall is 0.6 cm in
thickness. The maximum depth of invasion is 1.1 cm. The bladder wall thickness in the area of invasion cannot

be measured as it occurs in the bladder neck. Representative sections are submitted in 25 cassettes (see
summary).

It consists of a 1.4 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm, tan tissue fragment. Entirely submitted for frozen section.

0.7 cm aggregate of greasy, yellow tissue fragments. Entirely submitted in one cassette.

K; The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right obturator lymph nodes.“ It consists of 7 x 3.5 x 1.4 cm
of greasy, yellow tissue. Entirely submitted in ﬁve cassttes.

L: The specimen is received in formalin and labeled "Right internal iliac lymph nodes." It consists of 5 x 4 x 1 cm

BFS: Left ureteral margin:
- no carcinoma in situ identiﬁed

CFS: Peritoneal mass:
- fat necrosis

DFS: Inferior urethral margin:
- focus of carcinoma in situ in gland duct

'EFS: Posterior urethral margin: .
- carcinoma in situ in periurethral gland

GFS: Posterior urethral margin:
- no carcinoma in situ

HFS: Anterior urethral margin:
. - carcinoma in situ in periurethral glands

IFS: Lateral urethral margin:
- no carcinoma in situ

DIAGNOSIS COMMENT:

On specimen D. the frozen section shows a focus of carcinoma in situ in a gland. This is not present on the
permanent section.

There is a low grade papillary urothelial carcinoma in the region of the bladder neck andmid region of the bladder.
A morphologically distinct high grade tumor arises in the bladder neck and prostatic urethra. This is a high‘ grade
tumor that invades the prostate and bladder neck. The low grade tumor is noninvasive.
