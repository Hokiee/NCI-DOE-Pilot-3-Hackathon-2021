A. SPECIMEN LABELED "LEFT KIDNEY":
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CLEAR CELL TYPE (5.5 cm), Fuhrman nuclear grade III.

Tumor is confined to the kidney; no capsular invasion identified.
Vascular and ureteral margins negative for tumor.

No lymphovasCular invasion identified.

Adrenal gland with no tumor present.

B. SPECIMEN LABELED "REGIONAL LYMPH NODES":
Four (4) lymph nodes negative for tumor.

AJCC Classification (6th Edition): T1 N0 MX.

CLINICAL DATA:

Nep rectomy.
Operative Findings:
Clinical Diagnosis: As above.

ORGANS/TISSUE SUBMITTED:
1. Left kidney.
2. Regional lymph nodes.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh, in two parts,

name, unit number.

each labeled with the patient's

Part A, "#1 left kidney", and consists of a 685.5-gram radical left nephrectomy
specimen including a left kidney (13.8 x 9.0 x 6.0 cm) with a portion of ureter
(10 cm in length x 0.3 cm in diameter), renal vein (1.7 cm in length x 0.9 cm
in diameter). renal artery (3.2 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter), and adrenal
' gland (4.5 x 1.3 x 0-3 cm). The kidney is inked and bivalved to reveal an
encapsulated tan/yellow focally microcystic and focally hemorrhagic mass in the
renal cortex in the anterior mid pole (5.5 cm x 4.7 cm x 3.1 cm). The mass is
2.6 cm to the renal vein. 3.8 cm to the renal artery, and 13.0 cm to the ureter
margins. The mass abuts the capsule and is 0.2 cm to the inked margin. The
adrenal gland is received grossly disrupted. There are no lesions or masses
appreciable within the disrupted adrenal gland. Representative sections of
tumor are submitted for electron microscopy, cytogenetics, and tissue banking.
Representative sections of normal kidney are submitted for electron microscopy,
immunofluorescence, and tissue banking. A representative section of tumor is

also submitted for quick fix.

Micro A1: Vascular and ureteral margins, 3 frags, ESS.

Micro A2: Quick fix tissue, 3 frags, ESS.

Micro A3 through A5: Tumor with respect to capsule and perirenal fat, 3 frags,
RSS.

Micro A6: Tumor with relation to renal calyx, 1 frag, RSS.

Micro A7: Tumor with respect normal kidney, 1 frag, RSS.

Micro A8: Normal kidney, 1 frag, RSS.

Micro A9: Adrenal gland, 1 frag, RSS.

Part B, "regional lymph nodes", and consists of a single fragment of tan/pink
“ ' ti~~na measuring 5.0 x 3.0 x 1.8 cm. Four lymph node candidates

 

ADDENDUM
RENAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION OF NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY PARENCHYMA

LEFT KIDNEY, NEPHRECTOMY:~

VERY MILD CHRONIC CHANGES OF THE KIDNEY PARENCHYMA, MOST LIKELY AGE-

RELATED, INCLUDING:
—GLOBAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS, MILD (7%)
-TUBULAR ATROPHY AND INTERSTITIAL FIBROSIS, MILD
(< 10%)OF THE PARENCHYMA
-ARTERIAL AND ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS, MILD (SEE NOTE)

NOTE:

The non—neoplastic kidney parenchyma sam e s o ' ‘ vel of chronic
damage, within the expected range for a There is mild
global glomerulosclerosis (7% of glomeru l , minima tu ular atrophy and

interstitial fibrosis (less than 10% of the parenchyma), and a mild degree of
vascular sclerosis.

The kidney parenchyma has been reviewed by _, Renal

Pathologist.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin—embedded tissue (block A8) were evaluated

using H&E, PAS, Jones silver methenamine, and AFOG (trichrome) stains.

The sample consists of cortex and medulla. There are 285 glomeruli present, of
which 18 (7.0%) are globally sclerosed. The remaining glomeruli are mildly
enlarged, and show focal mild expansion of the mesangial areas. There are no
discernible craters or double contours of the glomerular capillary wall
basement membranes. Several of the distal tubules contain PAS-positive hyaline
casts. Less than 10% of the cortical parenchyma shows tubular atrophy and
interstitial fibrosis. Arteries and arterioles exhibit a mild degree of

sclerosis.

 

 

KARYOTYPE: 44,X,-Y,—3,+S,-8[5]
METAPHASES COUNTED: 5 ANALYZED: 5 sconsn: o BANDING: -

INTERPRETATION:
All metaphases contained clonal aberrations including loss of the short arm of
chromosome 3, which is a characteristic finding in renal cell carcinoma, clear

cell type.

COMMENTS:
Mosaicism and small chromosome anomalies may not be detectable using the
standard methods employed. Chromosome analysis was performed at a level of

400 bands or greater.
