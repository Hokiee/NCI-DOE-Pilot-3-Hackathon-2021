PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Renal carcinoma.
POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: Same.

ERIE; Right nephrectomy.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

PART 1: ‘

KIDNEY. RIGHT, PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY ‘-

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR CELL) TYPE.
FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE IS 4 OF 4.

THE GREATEST DIAMETER OF THE NEOPLASM IS 10.6 cm.

THE CARCINOMA FOCALLY INVADES INTO THE RENAL SINUS FAT.
ND INVASION OF THE RENAL VEIN IS IDENTIFIED.

NO EVIDENCE OF ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

ALL. SURGICAL MARC-PINS ARE FREE OF THE NEOPLASM.

THE NON»~NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY SHOWS CHANGES RELATED TO PROXIMITY TO THE TUMOR AND MILD
CHRONIC VASCULAR CHANGES. APPROPRIATE FOR AGE.

I. TNM ETAGE: pTSa NX NIX.
