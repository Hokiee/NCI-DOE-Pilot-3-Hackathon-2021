GROSS DESCRIPTION:

Received fresh for Tissue Banking. labeled with the patient‘s name and designated "left
breast”. Received with two inserted needle localization wires is a 586 gram. 21.0 x 14.0 x
4.5 cm iibrofatty breast. The breast is received with an overlying 20.5 x 12.0 cm skin
ellipse. The skin is tan/white and mottled with an eccentric, lateral 9.0 x 8.0 cm areola
and indurated 1.5 cm nipple, There are focal pigmented papules on the skin surface. The
breast has been oriented with a short suture at one pole of the skin ellipse designating
medial. a short double suture designating superior and a double long suture designating
deep. The deep margin will be inked blue with the superior margin inked black. the inferior
margin inked red. medial is inked yellow and lateral green. The skin surface has an
indurated 8.0 x 2.5 cm area extending medial from the nipple. There are focal skipped
areas on this lesion with the medial most lesion being 1.5 cm at the medial pole.
Sectioning of these indurated areas shows tumor associated with the skin. The tumor extends
from beneath the nipple medially with the medial most lesion being 1.2 cm from the inferior
skin edge and approximately 2.2 cm from the medial pole of the skin. No additional areas of
induration extend close to the skin margin. The breast is serially sectioned from medial
to lateral to have a tumor mass extending across the breast for approximately 5.0 cm. The
mass extends from the lateral aspect beneath the nipple medially where it goes from being
approximately 1.0 cm in thickness to 2.5 cm. The tumor extends and becomes 5.5 x 5.0 x 3.0
cm and comes within 2.5 cm of the nearest deep margin. The tumor is 3.0 cm from inferior.
is approximately 4.5 cm from superior. is 3.0 cm from medial and is approximately 6 cm from
lateral with the skin lesion coming within 4.5 cm of lateral. The parenchyma is glistening
yellow and fatty with scant white fibrous tissue. The white fibrous tissue makes up less
than 10% of the parenchyma. The tumor predominantly involves the central medial aspect of
the breast. Representative sections are sampled as labeled in the following cassettes:

l — nipple trisected
2 — en face section of areola where nipple has been removed
3 — sections with darker papules to include section with subcutaneous tumor
adjacent to nearest inferior medial margin
4*5 — additional sections of subcutaneous tumor
6 — sections extending lateral and medial from the area where the nipple has
been removed
7 — lateral most extension of tumor to include overlying skin
8 - nearest deep margin
9—11 ~ near full cross sections of largest area of tumor sampled
12 — upper/outer quadrant sampled
13 — lower/outer quadrant sampled
14 — upper/inner quadrant sampled
15 — lower/inner quadrant sampled
