SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

 

DIAGNOSIS:

A. UTERUS, BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES, RADICAL HYSTERECTOMY WITH
BlLATERAL SALPINGO—OOPHORECTOMY:
- Malignant mixed mesodermal tumor (MMMT)
- The tumor extensively involves the entire endometrial cavity (uterine fundus, anterior
and posterior uterine corpus and lower uterine segment) and measures 16.0 x 15.0 x
10.0 cm
- The tumor invades the full thickness of the muscular uterine wall and penetrates the
serosa
- Extensive lymphovascular space invasion identiﬁed
- The tumor involves the inked amputation site (point of transection of lower uterine
segment) '
- The left parametrium is involved by tumor
- Portion of omentum attached at the fundus is involved by tumor
- Right ovary shows a focal parenchymal involvement (0.2 cm), a 0.1 cm tumor deposit in
the Hilar region and a 1.5 cm nodule in the right mesosalpinx
- The right ovary in addition shows surface epithelial inclusion glands, surface reactive
mesothelial hyperplasia, ﬁbrin and crushed nuclear debris
- Right fallopian tube shows surface involvement and foci of epithelial dysplasia (check
this)
- Left ovary shows surface fibrin and detached tumor cell clusters
- Left fallopian tube shows adhesions with foci of atypia and mild hydrosalpinx
- Stage : pT3a Nx Mx

B. CERVICAL VAGINAL TUMOR, EXCISION:
- Fragments of fibromuscular soft tissue diffusely inﬁltrated by malignant mixed
mesodermal tumor (MMMT)
- Excision includes portion of squamous mucosa
- Due to the fragmented nature of excision, margins cannot be assessed

NOTE: The malignant epithelial component is a mixed high-grade serous and endometrioid
adenocarcinoma. The sarcomatous component is a high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma with features
suggestive of a rhabdoid differentiation and ﬁbrosarcomatous-type differentiation

A. UTERUS, BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES

Labeled with the patient‘s name. labeled "uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries", and received fresh in the OR for
intraoperative gross consultation and subsequently ﬁxed in formalin is a uterus with attached bilateral tubes and
ovaries weighing 2400 grams. The uterus measures 19.0 cm from fundus to amputation site, 16.0 cm from right to
left, and 10.0 cm from anterior to posterior. The endometrial cavity measures 12.0 cm in length and up to 1 1.0 cm
in width. The right ovary measures 2.2 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm. The right fallopian tube measures 9.0 cm in length and up to
1.0 cm in diameter. The left ovary measures 2.3 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm. The left fallopian tube measures 9.0 cm in length
and averages 1.0 cm in diameter. A portion of omentum attached at the fundus measures 11.0 x 6.0 x 1.0 cm.

The endometrial cavity is ﬁlled with a large soft tan-red focally hemorrhagic and necrotic tumor mass which
protrudes from the amputation site and measures 16.0 x 15.0 x 10.0 cm. The tumor extends to the anterior and
posterior amputation sites which are inked black, extends through the uterine wall and focally invades the overlying
serosa which is inked black. An area of serosal involvement on the posterior surface measures 3.0 x 2.0 cm.
Several subserosal tumor nodules are found at the attachment site of the omentum to the fundus. The entire
endometrium is involved by tumor. Sectioning of the tumor reveals a solid soft tan—red necrotic focally
hemorrhagic and focally cystic cut surface.

The remaining serosa shows focal hemorrhage and scattered ﬁbrous adhesions. The right ovary shows a few serosal
adhesions. The right fallopian tube is timbriated and the mesosalpinx contains a soft ovoid tansred nodule which
measures 1.5 x 1.3 x 1.3 cm. The leﬁ ovary shows some hemorrhagic adhesions. The distal 3.3 cm of the left
fallopian tube is cystic and dilated and measures up to 1.8 cm in diameter. Sectioning portal ﬁbrosis the distal end
reveals a unilocular cavity ﬁlled with clear watery ﬂuid. The lining shows focal soft pink-tan nodules which
measure up to 1.0 cm. No timbria are identiﬁed. A few additional smooth-walled paratubal cysts measure up to 1.3
cm. The myometrium measures up to 3.5 cm in thickness. No deﬁnite cervical tissue is identiﬁed.
