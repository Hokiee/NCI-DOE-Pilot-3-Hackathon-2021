1) The specimen is received.in formalin, labeled "Recto sigmoid colonn and
consists of a piece of large bowel measuring 14.0 cm in length and 6.5 cm in
circumﬁezence. The specimen has one stapled end arbitrarily designated
proximal with an opened end designated distal. The serosa is pinkntan and
smooth with attached yellow lobulated adipose tissue. 0n sectioning a 4.0 x
3.5 x 1.5 cm fungating. polypold tumor is identiﬁied, 3.5 cm item the distal
margin and 7.0 cm from the proximal margin. The depth at invasion in 0.5 cm.
The remaining mucosa is tan~pink and with the normal ﬁelds with multiple
minute palypoid structures identified. Pericolio adipose tissue is
thoroughly examined ﬁor lymph nodes, and all possible nodes are submitted. A
portion of the tumor is previously taken for TPS.

Summary of sections:

2) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "yroximal ansstomotic ring"
and consists of a ring of pink tan soft tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.5x 0.9 cm.
Multiple sutures and staples are attached. The mucosal surface in pink tan
and focally hemorrhagic. The sutures and staples are removed and the suit

tissue is entirely submitted.

and consists of a ring of tink tan soft tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.83
