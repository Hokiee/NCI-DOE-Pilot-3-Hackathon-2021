SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
Patient: Specimen #: 1

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh, labeled with the patient’s name,

designated "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1" and consists of a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm
lymph node. One half of the node is submitted for the CBCP protocol. The
remainder is submitted in cassette A1.

B. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient’s name,

designated "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2" and consists of a 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.4 cm
fragment of fatty tissue containing a 0.2 cm lymph node. The specimen is
bisected and submitted in its entirety for paraffin section in one
cassette. .

C. Received fresh, labeled with the patient’s name, _ designated
"RIGHT BREAST ONE TAG MEDIAL, TWO TAGS SUPERIOR" and consists of a 505.0
gram simple mastectomy specimen, measuring 19.7 cm superior to inferior,
19.8 cm medial to lateral, and 2.2 cm anterior to posterior. The overlying
ellipse of nipple bearing skin measures 10.5 x 5.2 cm, which is tagged for
its abnormalities. Ink code: Superior superficia1=blue, inferior
superficial=orange, deep=black. Sectioning reveals a 2.4 x 2.4 x 1.7 cm
well-circumscribed, tan tumor in the central portion of the upper outer
quadrant, 0.6 cm from the deep margin. The tumor is surrounded byidense
fibrous tissue, which extends medially to the inner portions of the
breast. Within this fibrous tissue in the central portion of the breast
(1.0 to 2.0 cm from the tumor and 1.5 cm from the deep margin) is a 0.7 cm
Mammomark site without associated mass. Representative sections are
submitted in 13 cassettes as follows:

C1: Skin, lateral tip.
C2: Tumor, upper outer quadrant.

C3: Tumor with deep margin upper outer quadrant.
C4: TUmor with deep margin upper outer quadrant.
C5: Fibrous tissue immedial medial to tumor.

C6: Mammomark biopsy site.

C7: Mammomark biopsy site.

C8: Deep margin underlying Mammomark site.

C9: Random fibrous tissue lower inner quadrant.
C10: Random fibrous tissue upper inner quadrant.
C11: Random fibrofatty tissue upper outer quadrant peripheral.
C12: Random fibrofatty tissue lower outer quadrant.
C13: Cross section of nipple.
