MACROSCOPY

1 - 5 g of ﬁrm and friable tissue.
2 - 4 pieces of tissue, the largest 4 mm.

MICROSCOPY

Part 1

Grade: 3 poorly differentiated with necrosis.
Growth pattern: Solid with a very focal papillary area.
Type: Transitional cell carcinoma.

Muscularis propria present: Yes.

Stromal invasion: Invasion of muscularis propria (pT2).
Vascular channel invasion: Not identiﬁed.

Background urothelium: Carcinoma in situ is present in ﬂat
urothelium.

Summary: Transitional cell carcinoma G3 pT2, CIS.
Part 2

All the tissue was processed and consists of 4 pieces of bladder wall with a
heavy acute on chronic inﬂammatory cell inﬁltrate. Some areas there is
nuclear smearing due to crush artefact but there is no morphologically evidence
of invasive transitional cell carcinoma in the multiple tissue planes examined.
No immunohistochemistry has been done.

Part 3

Bladder wall tissue with no evidence of invasive transitional cell carcinoma.
No lining epithelium was included in the biopsy.

SUMMARY

Transitional cell carcinoma G3 pT2, CIS.
