Gross Description:

GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received fresh for frozen section evaluation is a 1031

gram, 22.0 x 12.5 x 6.00m left pneumonectorny. It is covered by a red—purple focally
anthracotic stained pleura having a 7.5 X 7.5 x 0.80m fragment ofyellow-tan attached parietal
pleura in the superior segment of the lower lobe. There is up to 1.50m of attached bronchus
and the bronchial margin is submitted for frozen section evaluation and the frozen section
residue is submitted in one block. On sectioning the lung at the junction of the upper and
lower lobes, there is a 9.5 x 7.5 x 6.5cm ﬁrm mass. This lies beneath the previously described
parietal pleura. The out surfaces of the mass are tan to gray-tan, variegated, ﬁrm and nodular
with focal anthracotic stain. The margins are irregular. The remaining cut surfaces of the upper
lobe are red—purple, glistening and soft. On sectioning the lower lobe the cut surfaces range
from pink-red to golden yellow having focal areas of a yellow-tan exudate. There are several
palpable hilar lymph nodes, 1.0 to 2.00m in greatest dimension. The cut surface of each is tan
to gray-black and focally anthracotic stained. A representative section of each lymph node is
submitted. Representative sections are submitted in thirteen blocks.
