ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: Emphysematous changes

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
Specimens A and B are received in the non-fixed state in the operating room.

A is labeled "R4 lymph node“. The multiple red-black fragments of tissue aggregate to 0.8
cm, entirely frozen in block A.

B is labeled "level 7 lymph node". The two reddish fragments of tissue aggregate to 0.5
cm, entirely frozen in block B.

C. Received in the unfixed state in the operating room labeled with the patient’s name and

Adhesions are present on the pleural surface. Staple line is removed. Cross sections
demonstrate a grayish—yellow stellate area measuring about 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm. A
representative piece is frozen along with a smear imprint.

D. Labeled “4L lymph node" is a single 0.4 cm brownish node, entirely submitted in
cassette D.

E. Labeled "level 7 lymph node" is a 0.8 cm irregular, yellowish—black piece of tissue,
entirely submitted in block E for permanent section.

Four additional parts are received. The first three parts are received in formalin labeled
with the patient's name.

F. Labeled "additional level 7 lymph node" is a 1.6 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm focally disrupted

anthracotic, gray—black lymph node. The node is bisected and entirely submitted in
cassette Fl.

G. Labeled "level 10 lymph node" is a 1.4 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm nodular, purple—red to black
anthracotic portion of tissue. The tissue is trisected to be consistent with lung
parenchyma, entirely submitted in cassette 61.

H. Labeled "level 9" is a 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm tissue biopsy. The biopsy is bisected to

have a somewhat cystic appearance with associated yellow adipose, entirely submitted in
cassette H1.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: (Continued)

I. Received fresh for frozen section and for tissue banking designated "right lower lobe"
is a 270 gram, 18.0 x 11.0 x 3.5 cm lobe of lung. The staples are removed from the
bronchial margin, and the bronchial margin is sectioned to be submitted for frozen section
diagnosis. The pleural surface has a mottled purple, congested to pink—tan and spongy

 

 

appearance. There is scant anthracotic marbling. The lung is sectioned to have a 2.8 x
2.6 x 2.5 cm indurated, nodular tumor mass. The tumor mass is centrally located and comes
to within 1.1 cm of the bronchial margin. The mass focally obliterates the bronchus and
surrounds the vasculature. The tumor does not involve the pleural and comes to within 0.3
cm of the pleural surface. The remainder of the lung is sectioned to have a red—brown to
tan—brown, focally, peripherally spongy appearance. No additional lesions are identified.
There are scant hilar lymph nodes present on the specimen. A portion of tumor is selected
for tissue banking. Representative sections are sampled as labeled:

Il — frozen section residue (bronchial margin)
12 - vascular margins and hilar lymph nodes
13—16 — sections of tumor to bronchus perpendicular to sections submitted for

frozen section diagnosis (to include obliterated bronchus and
surrounding vessels)

I7-I9 — sections of tumor to normal parenchyma and nearest pleura
I10 - sections from superior aspect of lower lobe

Ill - sections from mid aspect of lower lobe adjacent to tumor
112 — sections of inferior lower lobe sampled

J. Part 10, received fresh for frozen section diagnosis and labeled ”right middle lobe"

of the lung has a separate, diffusely stapled 4. 0 x 3.0 x 2. 0- -cm area of parenchyma with a
2.0- -cm bronchial stem. The staples are removed and the bronchial margin is submitted for
frozen section diagnosis. The staples are removed from the area from where the lower lobe
bronchus inserts. There is focal anthracotic lymphoid tissue surrounding the bronchus.
The lateral surface of the middle lobe has a purple mildly congested appearance with a
peripheral pink-tan spongy appearance. There is a focal area of possible cauterized
adhesions on the surface of the middle lobe. The middle lobe is sectioned to have a
pink-tan to yellow—brown spongy appearance. No tumor-like masses or lesions are
identified. There is a focal area of congestion at one pole. Representative sections are
sampled from across the lobe to include perpendicular sections down the bronchus with the
proximal previously removed margin inked blue as labeled:

Jl - bronchial margin frozen section residue

J2 - bronchial margin from lower lobe insertion and hilar lymph nodes
J3,J4 — perpendicular sections along middle lobe bronchus

J5 - described pleural adhesions

J6,J7 — sections of middle lobe parenchyma from a cross specimen.

Specimens K, L and M are submitted in formalin containers labeled with the patient's name.

K is labeled “level 10 lymph node". The irregularly shaped blackish-red piece of tissue
measures 0.8 cm, entirely submitted in cassette K.

L is labeled "level 10 lymph node“. The single reddish-black 0.6 cm piece of tissue is
entirely submitted in cassette L.

M is labeled "level 10 lymph node". The specimen consists of an irregular, triangular
piece of tissue. Multiple staples are present in it. The specimen measures 1.6 cm. A
lymph node is not grossly identified. The tiesues are fairly well macerated by the time I

 

removed the sutures to get enough tissue for submission for histology. These pieces are
submitted in cassette M.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
C: The fibrous adhesion on the wedge of the upper lobe demonstrates chronic fibrous
adhesions associated with fibroadipose vascular connective tissue and a large nerve.
