Gross Descrigtion:

i). The specimen is received frdsh for frozen section. labeled "tail radicai nephreclomy' and consists of three fragments of a total
nephrectorny specimen with attached ureter. renal vessels and parlnephric fat weighing 641 g in total. The kidney fragments
measures 8.0 to 10.0 cm a greatest dimension. The attached ureter measures 0.4 cm in diameter. The attached renal vein
measures 0.2 cm in length and 0.8 cm in diameter. The renal vessels and ureter margins are grossly unremarkabie. No adrenal
gland is identified on the specimen. The externai surface of the specimen is inked biaci-t. Sectioning of the kidney fragments
reveals a 5.6 x 4.0 x 3.5 cm tumor in the mid portion of the kidney. Sectioning through the tumor reveals a light ten to orange to
maroon soft, variegated out sorta e. Grossty, the tumor appears to extend to the perirenal adipose tissue. The renal capsule is
noticeabie for a 3.5 x 3.0 cm rate tion cyst which is tilled with clear ﬂuid. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a
pink-brown parenchyrna, with a wall-defined cortico-medullaryjunction. The renal pelvis is not identiﬁable. The cortex measures
0.7 cm and the caiyces appear ndrmal. No iyrnph nodes are identiﬁed in the pan‘nephric fat. Representative sections 'are
submitted. 5
