Comment:

The axillary lymph nodes reveal lymphoid paracortical expansion,
which is

favored to be reactive in nature by H & E stains. Scattered
pigmented

histocytes are present suggestive of dermatopathic
lymphadenitis. Additional

immunohistochemical stains are pending to further evaluate this
process, results

of which will follow in an addendum report.

FSA1,A2: Lymph node, right axillary SLN #1, biopsy
- No tumor seen

Drs. at

Frozen Section Pathologistz, MD

Clinical History:

with right poorly differentiated invasive
ductal carcinoma, Grade 3.

Gross Description:
Received are three appropriately labeled containers.

Container A is additionally labeled "right axillary SLN #1, hot
+ blue." The

specimen is a 6 x 4.5 x 1.5 cm fatty soft tissue fragment.
Examination of the

fat reveals a 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm blue lymph node candidate. This
candidate is

serially sectioned and submitted entirely in blocks FSAl and
FSAZ.

Container B:

Specimen fixation: formalin

Time in fixative: 28.5 hours

Type of mastectomy: simple mastectomy

Weight of specimen: 950 grams

Size of specimen: 26.0 cm medial to lateral, 26.7 cm superior to
inferior,

4.0 cm anterior to posterior

Orientation of specimen: Sutures: Short=superior, long=lateral
Inking: anterior=blue, posterior=black, lateral=yellow

Skin ellipse dimensions: 18.6 x 9.3 cm

Nipple/areola: Nipple, 1.0 cm; areola, 3.1 cm

Axillary tail: submitted separately

Biopsy site: present; Location is central breast/lower outer
quadrant;

Size: 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm

Appearance: Biopsy site (clip identified) is in the center of a
white/tan, firm area. Hemorrhage and fat necrosis

are noted in this area. Additional residual tumor is present.

Discrete Mass(es): present

Number of discrete masses: one

Size of mass (es)/biopsy site: 2.5 x 2.0 x 3.5 cm
Location of mass(es): subareola/lower outer quadrant

Distance of mass/biopsy site from surgical margin: The mass
measures 1.9 cm to

posterior margin, 8.5 cm to inferior margin, 10.5

cm to superior margin, 2.8 cm to anterior margin and is widely
clear

of medial/lateral margins.

Gross involvement of skin or fascia/muscle by tumor: absent

Descriptin‘ remaining breast: consistent with yellow/tan
fibroad‘;,,: ;iSSU€

with increased fibrous areas noted in the subareolar

area; no other masses are identified

Other remarkable features: none

Tissue submit‘zd for special investigations: yes; Tumor to
Tissue Pr' ment

Block Summary:
(Inking: blue=anterior, black=posterior, yellow=lateral)

B1 — nipple

B2 - areola

B3 — biopsy site

B4 — medial aspect of mass

B5-B8 — central portion of mass

B9 - lateral aspect of mass

B10 — mass to posterior margin

B11 - representative dense fibrous tissue posterior to nipple
and anterior to mass

B12 - closest skin margin (inferior areola)
B13 - upper inner quadrant
Bl4 — lower inner quadrant

815 — lower outer quadrant
B16 — upper outer quadrant
Bl7 - mass to normal breast, superior
818 - mass to normal breast, inferior

Container C is additionally labeled "right axillary contents."

The specimen

consists of two fragments of yellow/tan fibroadipose tissue that
measures 9.5 x

6.5 x 3.0 cm in aggregate. Within the fibroadipose tissue,
fifteen lymph node

candidates are identified. These range in size from 0.4 up to
1.5 cm in greatest

dimension. The largest lymph node candidate measures 2.3 x 1.5 x
1.0 cm.

Block summary:

C1 — six lymph node candidates

C2 — five lymph node candidates (bisected node inked black)
C3 — three lymph node candidates (bisected nodes inked black,
blue and

yellow)

C4 — one lymph node candidate, sectioned

C5 — one lymph node candidate, sectioned

C6 — one lymph node candidate, sectioned

C7,C8 — largest lymph node candidate, sectioned

Procedures/Addenda:
Addendum

Addendum
Immunohistochemical studies were performed on representative
blocks of axillary

lymph nodes (C6 and C7) and the results are as follows:

CD20: Highlights many small lymphocytes in a generally nodular
distribution

CD3: Highlights majority of lymphocytes with focal expansion of
the paracortex

Interpretation: The immunohistochemical studies highlight an
essentially normal

pattern of distribution of B cells and T cells in the lymph
nodes, with primary

follicles composed predominantly of small B lymphocytes and a
paracortex

populated by predominantly small T lymphocytes. Morphologic and
immunohistochemical findings are compatible with reactive lymph
nodes and do not

support a diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative disorder. The mild
paracortical

expansion can be seen as a feature of dermatopathic
lymphadenopathy.
