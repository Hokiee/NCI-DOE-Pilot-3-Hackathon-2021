IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINS WERE PERFORMED ON FORMALIN-FIXED TISSUE WITH
THE FOLLOWING RESULTS FOR INVASIVE CARCINOMA (BLOCK 5T5):

ESTROGEN RECEPTOR (6F11, 90% NUCLEAR STAINING WITH
STRONG INTENSITY

PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR (1E2; 60% NUCLEAR STAINING WITH
MODERATE INTENSITY

HERZ (HERCEPTEST; DAKO): NEGATIVE (STAINING
INTENSITY OF 0)

CONTROLS ARE SATISFACTORY.

COMMENT: HERCEPTESTTN (DAKO) IS AN FDA-APPROVED METHOD FOR
ASSESSMENT OF HERZ PROTEIN OVEREXPRESSION IN BREAST CANCER TISSUE ROUTINELY
PROCESSED FOR HISTOLOGICAL EVALUATION. THE HERB TEST RESULTS ARE REPORTED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE ASCO/CAP GUIDELINE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HERZ TESTING IN
BREAST CANCER (J CLIN ONCOL 2007; 25(1):1-28).

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

1.) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled “level 3 left axillary
lymph nodes" and consists of two irregularly shaped fragments of yellow
lobulated adipose tissue measuring 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm in aggregate. No
lymph nodes are identified grossly. The specimen is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U-undesignated

2.) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "level 2 left axillary
lymph nodes" and consists of one irregularly shaped fragment of yellow
lobulated adipose tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 0.3 cm. Three possible lymph
nodes are identified, ranging from 0.3 cm to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension.
The lymph nodes are entirely submitted.

Sumary of sections:
U -- undesignated

LD.

3.) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "lateral left breast
skin” and consists of one irregularly shaped fragment of yellow to tan
fibroadipoae tissue measuring 10.3 x 2.9 x 1.4 cm. No skin is identified
grossly. Serial sectioning reveals a grossly unremarkable fibroadipose
tissue with a single possible lymph node measuring 0.4 cm in greatest
dimension. Representative sections are submitted.

Sumary of sections:
U—undesignated

..D.

4.) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "right upper abdominal
skin tag" and consists of one polypoid shaped fragment of brown skin
measuring 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted.

Sumary of sections:
U-undesignated

A.D.

5.) The specimen is received fresh, labeled I‘left breast and level 1
axillary lymph nodes, stitch marks level 1 axillary lymph nodes'I and
consists of a breast with attached axillary tail. The breast measures 22.2
x 16.0 x 3.5 cm with overlying skin ellipse measuring 16.6 x 7.9 cm.
situated eccentricelly on the skin surface is an everted nipple measuring
1.2 x 1.1 x 0.3 cm and areola measuring 4.9 x 4.1 cm. The skin shows no
scars. A suture demarcates the axillary tail which measures 9.8 x 5.5 x 1.5
cm. The posterior surface of the breast is inked black and the specimen is
serially sectioned to reveal an irregularly shaped white-tan firm mass

measuring 11.0 x 6.5 x 4.8 cm, involving upper outer. lower outer and upper
inner quadrants, located 0.6 cm away from the deep resection margin. The
remaining breast tissue shows predominantly yellow lobulated adipose tissue
admixed with scant white-tan fibrous soft tissue with no other grossly
identifiable lesions. The axillary tissue is dissected to reveal multiple
lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.5 cm to 2.5 cm. The specimen is
submitted for lymph node dissection. Representative sections of the
mastectomy specimen and all identified axillary lymph nodes are submitted.
Tissue submitted for TPS.
