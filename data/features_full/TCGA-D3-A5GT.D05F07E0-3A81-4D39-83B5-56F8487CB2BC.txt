GRoss DESCRIPTION

(A) LABELED “RIGHT INGUINAL CONTENTS WITH EN BLOC CONTINUITY 2 CM MARGIN MELANOMA, RIGHT MEDIAL
GROIN" - A surgeon oriented right groin dissection specimen that includes medial scrotal aspect with overall dimensions (21.0 x
9.5 x 4.1 cm). The hairy curved tan portion of skin includes the inguinal/groin contents and scrotal aspect along the medial
aspect. The curved skin ellipse measures 21 cm in length and 6 cm in depth.

There is a skin mass that is dark red to black, measuring 2.2 x 2.0 x 1.7 cm which is located 1.5 cm from the superior
margin, 1.5 cm from the medial scrotal skin margin and 2.0 cm from the inferior skin margin. There Is pigmented dark brown flat
area of lateral extension in an area, measuring 2 x 1 cm. The lab tissue bank from this primary skin melanotic lesion will
be submitted as well as a metastatic lymph node as the #2 source. There are multiple enlarged groin lymph nodes, the largest
measures 4.0 x 3.5 cm and will be harvested. The margins are inked, serially sectioned, medial to lateral to reveal additional
lymph nodes that range from 0.3 cm up to 3 cm, some have gross fatty replacement. All of the possible groin lymph nodes are
submitted.

INK CODE: Blue — superior margin; yellow — inferior margin; red — inferior aspect of the medial skin melanotic lesion, not
a true margin, for orientation purposes/inferior aspect of lesion.

SECTION CODE: A1, A2, en face skin, superior margin, ink side up; A3, A4, en face, medial skin margin, ink side up; A5,
A6, en face, inferior skin margin, ink side up; A7, lateral skin apical tip, ink side up; A8—A15, primary skin lesion in consecutive
order; A16, A17, deep margin, beneath primary skin lesion, ink side up; A18, A19, lymph node with metastatic melanoma and
closest inked deep margin; A20, A21, largest lymph node with melanoma infiltrates (harvest site #2); A22, three possible intact
lymph nodes; A23—A25, one possible bisected lymph node, each cassette; A26, A27, one possible bisected lymph node; A28, one
possible bisected lymph node; A29-A31, one possible serially sectioned lymph node. .

(B) RIGHT ILIAC AND OBTURATOR CONTENTS - Three pink-red irregular pieces of soft tissue aggregating 5.5 x 3.5 x 1.1 cm.
There are multiple pink-red lymph nodes that range from 0.3 cm up to 5.0 cm in greatest length.

SECTION CODE: B1, 82, three possible intact lymph nodes, each cassette; 83, one possible bisected lymph node; B4-

B7, one possible serially sectioned lymph node; 88-812, one possible serially sectioned lymph node.
