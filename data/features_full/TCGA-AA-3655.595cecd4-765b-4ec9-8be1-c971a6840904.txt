Diagnosis/ diagnoses:

Resection material from (sigmoid) colon shows a colon carcinoma characterized
histologically as a moderately differentiated colorectal adenocarcinoma, extending to
within 6.5 cm of a resection margin at most and measuring 4 cm in diameter at the widest
point. Infiltrative tumor spread within all parietal layers of the colon to the bordering
mesocolic fatty tissue. In addition, the mucous membrane of the colon has a small
tubulovillous adenoma with moderate epithelial dysplasia (synonym: low-grade epithelial
neoplasia). The oral and aboral resection margins are tumor-free.

Twenty-two mesocolic local lymph nodes are tumor-free with uncharacteristic reactive
lesions.

The tumor stage is pT3 pNO (0/22) LOVO; G2
