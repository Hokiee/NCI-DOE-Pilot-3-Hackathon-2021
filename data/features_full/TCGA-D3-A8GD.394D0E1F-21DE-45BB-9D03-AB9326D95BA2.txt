METASTATIC MELANOMA INVOLVING DERMIS AND SUBCUTANEOUS SOFT TISSUE, INKED TISSUE EDGES
APPEAR FREE. (SEE COMMENT)

TUMOR SIZE: 8 X 6 X 6 MM (PER GROSS DESCRIPTION).
Tumor borders predominantly pushing.
Associated focal lymphoid tissue is present.

Multiple incidental macular seborrheic keratoses, some irritated, some present at inked tissue edges.
Solar elastosis and actinic changes.

Folliculitis.

Stasis changes.

COMMENT

(A—C) The tumor cells in each part above demonstrate prominent cherry-red nucleoli and scattered intranuclear pseudoinclusions,
and they have similar (epithelioid) morphology as the patient’s known melanoma involving the right leg (see case a). In

parts (A) and (B), focal intracytoplasmic melanin pigment is identiﬁed, and in part (A), tumor necrosis is seen. These ﬁndings
altogether support the above diagnoses of melanoma.

In part (A), the largest tumor masses may each represent one lymph node which has become replaced by metastatic tumor or
multiple matted lymph nodes which have become replaced by tumor. Clinical - pathologic correlation is necessary.

In part (C), residual melanoma associated with the changes of healing surgical wound and scar is not identiﬁed. There is a
separate focus of melanoma involving the dermis and subcutaneous soft tissue. No overlying in situ component or direct
connection by the tumor with the epidermis is seen. Associated focal lymphoid tissue is present. This tumor may represent a
metastasis/satellite lesion involving the dermis and subcutaneous fibroadipose tissue or a lymph node which has become

replaced by metastatic tumor. Clinical — pathologic correlation is necessary. In the sections submitted for permanent section
evaluation, the inked tissue edges appear free of this focus of melanoma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) RIGHT INGUINAL CONTENTS — One portion of fibroadipose tissue (26.0 x 10.0 x 4.0 cm) with overlying ellipse of pink—tan
skin (22.0 x 2.0 cm). The skin appears grossly unremarkable. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal four separate tumor
nodules involving subcutaneous tissue that range from 3.0 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm up to 7.0 x 4.0 x 3.0 cm. Several of these nodules may
each represent one or several lymph nodes which have become replaced by tumor. Multiple additional possible lymph nodes are
dissected from the specimen that measure from 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm up to 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm. Portions of the two largest tumor

nodules are submitted to the tissue bank for research purposes, and representative sections of these nodules as well as all
possible lymph nodes are submitted for permanent section evaluation in A.

SECTION CODE: A1, A2, representative sections of largest tumor nodule; A3, A4, representative sections of second
largest tumor nodule; A5, representative sections of third tumor nodule; A6, representative sections of fourth tumor nodule; A7,
three possible lymph nodes; A8, four possible lymph nodes; A9-A11, additional possible lymph nodes; A12, representative section
of skin with subcutaneous tissue; A13, A14, each ﬁve possible lymph nodes; A15, four possible lymph nodes; A16, three possible
lymph nodes; A17, one possible lymph node, bisected.

(B) RIGHT ILIAC AND OBTURATOR CONTENTS -— Multiple portions of fibroadipose tissue (8.0 x 7.0 x 5.0 cm in aggregate),
from which multiple possible lymph nodes are dissected that measure from 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm up to 6.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. There is a
ﬁrm, tan tumor nodule identified (4.5 x 4.2 x 2.5 cm) that may represent a lymph node which has become replaced by tumor. A
portion of the tumor nodule is submitted to the tissue bank for research purposes, and representative sections of this nodule as
well as all possible lymph nodes are submitted for permanent section evaluation in B.

SECTION CODE: B1, B2, representative sections of tumor nodule; B3, B4, each four possible lymph nodes; B5, one
possible lymph node, bisected; BS, one possible lymph node, serially sectioned; B7-BQ, one possible lymph node, serially
sectioned.

(C) 2 CM MARGIN, MELANOMA, RIGHT LATERAL KNEE WITH RESECTION IN TRANSIT NODULE, SHORT - PROXIMAL 12
O'CLOCK, LONG — INFERIOR 3 O'CLOCK - An ellipse of pink-tan skin with underlying subcutaneous tissue (11.0 x 5.0 x 2.0
cm), which is oriented by the surgeon with a short suture stitch to denote proximal 12 o’clock and a long stitch to denote inferior 3
o'clock. Centrally located on the surface of the skin is a linear, well-healed scar (7.0 cm in length) that measures 1.8 cm from the
6 o’clock tissue edge and 2.0 cm from the 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, and 9 o'clock tissue edges. The specimen is inked and serially
sectioned to reveal a separate tumor nodule (0.8 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm) within the proximal half of the specimen that measures 1.5 cm
from the nearest 9 o‘clock tissue edge and 1.4 cm from the scar. Half of this tumor nodule is submitted to the tissue bank for
research purposes. The remaining portion of the nodule as well as the entire area of scar (the latter en bloc) are submitted for
permanent section evaluation in C.

INK CODE: Blue - 12-3-6 o'clock half; yellow — 6-9-12 o'clock half; green - 3 o'clock side of en bloc area of scar (for
orientation purposes, not a margin).

SECTION CODE: C1, the tumor nodule relative to nearest 9 o'clock tissue edge, perpendicular section; C2, nearest deep
tissue edge underlying tumor nodule; CS, skin and subcutaneous tissue relative to tumor nodule and deep tissue edge,
perpendicular section; C4, 12 o'clock tissue edge, inked side up; CS, 6 o'clock tissue edge, inked side up; 06, 3 o'clock tissue
edge, proximal half, inked side up; C7, 3 o'clock tissue edge, distal half, inked side up; C8, 9 o'clock tissue edge, proximal half,
inked side up; C9, 9 o'clock tissue edge, distal half, Inked side up; C10, skin and subcutaneous tissue proximal to scar; 011-618,
the area of scar, entirely submitted from proximal to distal; C19, skin and subcutaneous tissue distal to scar. ’
