CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Left breast cancer.
CLINICAL HISTORY: Left breast cancer.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS
FSA) Left sentinel node - Two of three lymph.nodes positive for
metastatic carcinoma (2/3).

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Submitted fresh for frozen section as "left sentinel
node" are two portions of fatty tissue, the larger of the
two is 2 cm. in size, the smaller 1.2 cm. in size. The section
through the tissue reveals three small nodules which may be lymph
nodes varying in size from 6 mm. to a centimeter. All three
submitted for frozen section.
B. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin labeled
"left breast tissue" is a 7.8 x 7.5 X 4.0 cm. yellow
lobular fatty tissue fragment which is partially covered with a 4.0
x 1.2 cm. pink-tan wrinkled skin ellipse. The specimen has a long
suture designating lateral and a short suture designating superior.
The specimen is inked as follows: Superior orange, anterior blue,
posterior black, inferior green and the specimen is sectioned from
medial to lateral to show a yellow lobular fatty cut surface with
minimal fibrous tissue. There is also a white tan firm nodule
which
is centrally located, measuring 3.5 X 2.5 x 2.5 cm. This comes
within 2 cm. of superior-inferior margin and comes within 1.5 cm.
of .
the anterior and posterior margin. This was located equal distance
between the medial and lateral margins. Representative sections of
the specimen are submitted as follows: Block 1 — representative

medial margin; block 2 — representative lateral margin; block 3-10

representative sections additional margins and skin. RS-lO.

C. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin labeled
"axillary content" is a 7 x 6 x 1.5 cm. aggregate of
yellow
lobular fatty tissue fragments which are palpated to identify
possible lymph nodes. Multiple lymph nodes are grossly identified
which range from 0.5 cm. to 2.0 cm. in greatest dimension. The
lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows: block 1 - two

possible lymph nodes; block 2 - three possible lymph nodes; block 3
— two possible lymph nodes; block 4 - one possible lymph node
bisected. RS4.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
A. Sections of the left sentinel lymph nodes demonstrate
metastatic carcinoma involving 2 of 3 lymph nodes. The
largest metastasis is 1.2 cm and extracapsular extension is
present.

Invasive Carcinoma: Present
Histologic type: Infiltrating ductal carcinoma
Histologic grade:
Overall grade: 3

 

Architectural score: 3

Nuclear score: 3

Mitotic score: 3
Greatest dimension: 3.5 cm (pT2)
Specimen margins: Negative, nearest 1.3 cm, posteriorly
Vessel invasion: Present

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Calcification: Present

Ductal carcinoma in situ: Present
Histologic pattern: Solid and comedo
Nuclear grade: 3

Central necrosis: Present

%DCIS of total tumor: Less than 10%

Extensive intraductal component (present/absent): Absent
Specimen margins: Negative

Calcification: Present

Description of non-tumorous breast: Proliferative changes.
Comments: None
Prognostic markers: Previously performed.

 

 

There is no evidence of metastatic disease present in
