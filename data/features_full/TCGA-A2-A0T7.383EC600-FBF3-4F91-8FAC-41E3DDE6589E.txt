PART A: RECEIVED FRESH LABELED LEFT BREAST MASTECTOM'Y, STITCH AT 1200 IS A
SIMPLE MASTECTOMY SPECIMEN MEASURING 15 X 14.5 X 4 CM IN GREASTEST
DIMENSIONS. THE NIPPLE IS UNREMARKABLE WITHIN A 6.3 X 3.6 CM SKIN
ELLIPSE. THE SUPERFICIAL MARGIN IS MARKED BLUE WHILE THE DEEP ASPECT IS
MRKED WITH BLACK INK. SECTIONING REVEALS CENTRAL FIBROSIS WITH MULTIPLE
CYSTIC AREAS CONTAINING GREY MUCINOUS FLUID. THIS AREA IS MEASURES 10.5 X
9 X 3 CM AND IS SURROUNDED BY GROSSLY UNREMARKABLE YELLOW FATTY TISSUE.
REPRESENTATIVE SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS: Al-NIPPLE; A2-CENTRAL
DEEP MARGIN; A3-4 UPPER OUTER QUADRANT; A5-6 UPPER INNER QUADRANT; A7-8
LOWER INNER QUADRANT AND A9-10-LOWER OUTER QUADRANT.

PART B: RECEIVED FRESH LABELED SENTINEL NODE #1 HOT AND BLUE IS AN OVOID
FRAGMENT OF BLUE COLORED TISSUE AND SURROUNDING YELLOW FAT MEASURING 2 X 1

1.7 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION. A PORTION IS TAKEN PER PROTOCOL AND THE
REMAINDER IS SUBMITTED LABELED B.

PART C: RECEIVED FRESH LABELED SENTINEL NODE #2 HOT IS AN OVOID PORTION OF
YELLOW FA'I'I'Y TISSUE MEASURING 2 X 1 X 1 CM. SECTIONING REVEALS
UNREMARKABLE NODAL TISSUE SUBMITTED ENTIRELY LABELED C.

PART D: RECEIVED FRESH LABELED IGHT BREAST MASTECTOMY,
STITCH AT 12 O’CLOCK IS A SIMP MEN MEASURING 17 X 15 X
5.0 CM. THE NIPPLE IS GROSSLY UNREMARKABLE WITHIN A 6 x 3 CM SKIN ELLIPSE.
THE SUPERFICIAL ASPECT IS MARKED IN BLUE INK. THE DEEP MARGIN IS MARKED
IN BLACK INK. SECTIONING REVEALS A FIRM FIBROUS NODULE IN THE UPPER INNER
QUADRANT MEASURING 2.5 X 1.5 X 1. 5 CM. THE LESION GROSSLY EXTENDS TO
WITHINO. 8CMOFTHEMOSTMEDIALMARGINANDISO.7CMFROMBOTHTHE
SUPERFICIAL AND DEEP MARGINS. THE CENTRAL PORTION OF THE BREAST CONSISTS
OF DENSE FIBROUS TISSUE WITH NUMEROUS CYSTIC AREAS AND THIS SURROUNDED BY
BLAND YELLOW FATTY TISSUE. THE CENTRAL AREA MEASURES 13 X 10.5 X 3.0 CM.
