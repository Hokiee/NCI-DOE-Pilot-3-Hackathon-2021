The specimen is received in the fresh state in three parts for immediate gross evaluation.

A. This specimen is received for tumor banking and evaluation of the surgical margins and
consist of an excision of breast tissue which measures 4 x 4 x 2.5 cm. Present on the
surface is an ellipse of light brown skin measuring 3 x 0.7 cm. The surgeon has tagged the
surgical margins. With this as reference. I have inked the margins as follows:

Blue is lateral
Yellow is inferior
Black is medial
Red is superior
Orange is deep

Sectioning reveals a firm. stellate. tan tumor which measures 13 mm in greatest dimension.
The tumor focally touches the lateral margin. The next nearest margin is medial at 2 mm.
The remaining margins are greater than 1 cm from tumor. A representative section of the

tumor is submitted for tumor banking.

A recent biopsy site is present in the tumor.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: (Continued)
Representative sections are submitted as blocks A1 through A5.

E. This is an excision of breast tissue which measures 2 x 2 x 1 cm, The surgeon has
tagged the new lateral margin. I have applied blue ink to this margin. NO gross evidence
of residual tumor is present in this specimen. Representative sections are submitted as
blocks Bi and BZ.

C. This is a soft. tan lymph node which measures 15 x 10 x 5 mm. sectioned and totally
submitted as block Cl for sentinel node protocol. There is no gross evidence of metastatic
tumor. '

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
IMMEDIATE GROSS EVALUATION A (BREAST EXCISION):
— FOCAL TUMOR PRESENT AT LATERAL MARGINS WITH REMAINING MARGINS FREE OF TUMOR

IMMEDIATE GROSS EVALUATION B [RE—EXCISION LATERAL MARGIN);
— NO GROSS EVIDENCE OF TUMOR

IMMEDIATE GROSS EVALUATION C (SENTINEL NODE):
— NO GROSS EVIDENCE OF TUMOR
