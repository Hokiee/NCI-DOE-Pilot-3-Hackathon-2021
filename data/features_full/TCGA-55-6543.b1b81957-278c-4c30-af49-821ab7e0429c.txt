GROSS DESCRlPTlON: -
The specimen is received in four containers labeled with the

Container A IS additionally labeled "level 10 lymph node"

and contains a 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm, yeliow—tan, ﬁrm, fatty
nodule consistent with possible lymph node. The Specimen is
bisected to reveal a black. anthracotic cut surface. The
_snectmen is entirely submitted in cassette A labeied t

Container B is additionally labeled "level 11 lymph nodes"
and contains a 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. tan—brown, rubbery nodule
bisected to reveal a gray—black anthracotic cut surface.

The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette B labeled

container C is additionally labeled "right upper lobe" and
contains a 13.0 x 10.5 x 4.0 cm, purple-pink, moderately
anthracotic lung lobe featuring an 8.5 cm in length stapled
parenchymal margin as well as an additional stapled vascular
margin and stapled bronchial margin, each measuring 0.5 cm
in length by” 1.5 cm in diameter. The bronchus is opened to
reveal a yeilow—tan striated endothelium. No discrete
masses are identiﬁed. The stapled line is removed and the
underlying parenchyrna is inked black. The specimen is
serially sectioned to reveal a 3.0 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm,

yellow—tan, giistening, mucoid mass that abuts the inked
pleura and approaches to within 2.5 cm of the vascular,
bronchial and inked parenchymal margins. The remainder of
3 the cut surface is beefy red and congested with no

3 additional lesions. Five possible anthracotic parabronchial
lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 cm in

- greatest dimension. A representative section of the mass is
