Diagnosis y /
A. Thyroid, total thyroidectomy: /Ad /sﬁy(

Multifocal papillary carcinoma, involving the right and left lobes,
largest focus 2.8 cm.

B. Central cervical lymph nodes, resection:

Metastatic carcinoma involving 11 of 14 lymph nodes (ll/l4).

Microscopic Description:

Microscopic examination performed.

A.

Histologic type: Papillary carcinoma, papillary and follicular variant,
multifocal

Primary tumor (pT): The tumor is multifocal. The largest focus is 2.8
cm, located in the right lobe

Margins of resection: Extremely close, less than 0.5 mm

Vascular invasion: Present

Regional lymph nodes (pN): Positive as described below, le

Distant metastasis (pM): Cannot be evaluated by the specimen, pMX
Other findings: None

B. The central cervical lymph nodes demonstrate metastatic carcinoma
in 11 of 14 lymph nodes. Many of the metastases are present in the
form of a few subcapsular nests of malignant cells.
IImmunohistochemistry for pankeratin was performed on blocks Bl through
B3 to highlight the metastatic cells. The largest focus is 3.5 mm.

Specimen
A. Total thyroid — silk marks left upper pole
B. Cervical-central node dissection

Clinical Information
Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid

Gross Description

Received fresh in a container labeled total thyroid - silk marks the
upper pole is a complete thyroidectomy. It measures 9 x 7.5 X 4 7 m in
greatest dimensions. A silk stitch marks the left upper pole. The
specimen is inked and serially sectioned. The left lobe contains a
firm white gritty tumor measuring 1.2 x l x 0.8 cm. The isthmus is
unremarkable. The right lobe contains a well-circumscribed soft
yellow—tan nodule measuring 2.8 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. A portion of this
nodule is submitted for tissue procurement. The thyroid is entirely
submitted in 20 blocks. BLOCK SUMMARY Al — A5 left lobe: A6 — A8
isthmus; A 9 - A.20 right lobe.

B. Received in formalin labeled "central cervical node dissection" is a
2.4 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm aggregate of fragmented soft, lobulated golden
yellow adipose tissue and slightly rubbery tan-pink tissues measuring
up to 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. Multiple slightly rubbery tan—pink
tissue using keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 0.8 cm are
present. The specimen is entirely submitted in 4 blocks as labeled.
Summary: 1 and 2~5 whole lymph nodes per cassette; 3—one bisected lymph
node; 4—residual tissue.
