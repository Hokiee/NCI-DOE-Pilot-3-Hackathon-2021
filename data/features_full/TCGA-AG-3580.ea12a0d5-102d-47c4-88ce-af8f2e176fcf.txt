colorectal type measuring a maximum of 6 cm in diameter, with infiltration of the
tunica submucosa. Tumor-free local lymph nodes. Tumor-free colon resection
margins. In addition, two tubular colon mucosa adenomas with low-grade and high-
grade dysplasia (synonym: low-grade and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia).

Stage of tumor: pTl pN0 (0/22) pMX; G2, L0, V0, R0
