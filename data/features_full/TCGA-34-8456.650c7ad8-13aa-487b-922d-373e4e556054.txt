PART 8:AZYGOS. RESECTION —
PORTION OF VESSEL, SMALL NERVE FASCICLES AND FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, FREE OF TUMOR.

COMMENT: '

The neoplasm is subpleural and peripheral, located grossly at 6.5 cm. from the bronchial and vascular margins of
resection. Microscopic examination of the margin shows a small ctuster of tumor cells in a vessel.
