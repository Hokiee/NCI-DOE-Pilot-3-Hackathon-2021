9.) Whe specimen is receiveﬂ fresh. labeled 'left lower lobe of lung". It
consists of a 15 x 9 x 3.5 cm lung lobe with attached bronchus aha blood
vessels straddled by multiple staple lines. which weighs 103.5 gm following
Eixation. The attached bronchus measures 1 cm in length. Th3 pleural
surface is smooth and glistening with a puckered araa over a. subpleural
tumor. The specimen is received partially opened. The pleural surface is
inked black. Sarial sectioning rsvasls a 3.6 x 1.8 a 1.6 cm white—tan,
stellata tumor. The tumor has irregular borders. The tumor is situahad in
the peripheral lung paranchyma, located 6.5 cm from the bronchial margin and
3.5 cm from the closest staple line. whe tumor grassly does not involve the
bronchus. The bronchial mucoaa is smooth and glistsning. Peribsonchial
anthracotic lymph nodes are identified ané submitted. The uninvolvea lung
parsnchyma shows congestion. Representativo sections are submitted. TPS is
submitted and photographs are taken.
