* Final Report *

Comment: This large, partially necrotic, diffusely infiltrating, high-grade transitional cell
carcinoma shows diffuse areas of squamous differentiation. The tumor extends to the inked
radial margin of excision. This case corresponds to a pathological AJCC stage of T3a,N0.

Gross Description (Veriﬁed)
"FSA." All frozen section control tissue is submitted in cassette "FSA.".

"FSB." All frozen section control tissue is submitted in cassette "FSB,".

"C. Additional apical tissue.” The specimen consists of 3 unoriented soft gray-pink fragments ranging in size from 1.6 x 1.6 x 0.7 cm to 2.4 x
1 x 0.8 cm. inked black. "01-02." fragments. representative.

"D. Bladder.” The specimen consists of an 11.8 x 9.5 x 6.6 cm bladder with attached fat. Attached is the prostate gland. Bilateral distal
ureters have previously been submitted for frozen section. The specimen is opened on the anterior aspect and there is a 5.5 x 3.5 cm soft
red-tan friable ulcerated mass on the posterior bladder wall which extends to the right aspect of the bladder. The mass grossly appears to
extend into the bladder musculature to a depth of 2.5 cm and grossly appears to abut the radial margin. The radial margin has been inked
black. The mass does not grossly appear to involve the left and right ureteral orifices. The remaining bladder mucosa is red-tan and
edematous and no additional areas of interest are grossly identiﬁed in the bladder. The attached prostate gland measures 4.2 x 4 x 1.8 cm.
The posterior apex will be inked orange. The remaining prostate is inked black. The seminal vesicles and vas deferens will be submitted at
their Junction with the prostate. The prostatic parenchyma is tan and no discrete yellow masses are grossly identiﬁed. "D1," distal urethral
margin; "02-05." bladder mass with adjacent radial margin (NOTE: Cassette deeply represents 1 full-thickness section submitted in steps);
"DB," mass: "D7." left bladder mucosa; "DB." bladder dome; "D9." right bladder mucosa; "D10." trigone; "D11." left seminal vesicle and vas
deferens: "D12." right seminal vesicle and vas deferens; "D13,“ left anterior prostate; "D14," right anterior prostate; ”D15," left posterior
prostate: "D16.” right posterior prostate.

"E. Left lymph node." The specimen consists of a 3.6 x 3.6 x 2 cm aggregate of yellow lobuiated tissue. On sectioning, 7 possible lymph
nodes are identiﬁed. These range in size from 0.3 to 1.5 cm. "E1—E3." fragments, representative.

“F. Right lymph node." The specimen consists of a 4.4 x 3.2 x 1.5 cm aggregate of yellow lobuiated tissue. On sectioning. 4 possible lymph
nodes are identified. These range in size from 0.4 to 1.8 cm. "Ft-F2," fragments. representative.
