1. Distal gastric section with an ulcerated gastric carcinoma of maximum diameter 7.5 cm
extending up to 5 cm from the oral and 4 cm from the aboral resection margin and localized
on the greater curvature side, of the histologicai type of a moderately differentiated
adenocarcinoma (gastric carcinoma of the intestinai type). Invasive tumor dissemination
within all gastric wall layers into the perigastric fatty tissue, subserosa and localized
contiguous inﬁltration of all wall layers of the transverse colon adhering to the gastric wall
with the formation of a gastrocolic ﬁstula.

Oral and aboral resection margin of the distai gastric resection specimen as well as of the
coion and greater omentum tumor—free.

One of nineteen perigastric and mesocolic lymph nodes with metastasis from the gastric
carcinoma and otherwise uncharacteristically reactive changes.

Antral mucosa with fairiy minor, ﬂorid, moderately chronic gastritis and foveolar
hyperplasia, and corpus mucosa with non—ﬂorid, fairly minor chronic gastritis of the .
superficial type with evidence of Helicobacter pylori. _ I '
2.: Smali wedge excision specimen of the liver including a subcapsularly localized biliary

hamiatoma (von Meyenburg complex).

3.: Proximal partial gastric resection specimen including the esophageal cuff without

further fragments of the carcinoma mentioned under 1.

4.: Five tumor-free lymph nodes (hepatic artery) with uncharacteristically reactive changes.

Therefore tumor stage: pT4 le (1/24), I
