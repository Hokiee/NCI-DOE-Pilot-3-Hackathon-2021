Microscopic Description:

Sections demonstrate gray and white matter that is diffusely infiltrated by a mildly to moderately
hypercellular glial neoplasm. The majority of the tumor cells have round nuclei with only mild atypia.
Perinuclear halos are prominent in most. A minority component is a fibrillary astrocytoma phenotype or
a gemistocytic phenotype. In these sections, no mitosis are seen and there is no microvascular

proliferation or necrosis. A neo plastic ganglion cell component is not seen. Eosinophilic granular bodies
are not identiﬁed.
