CLINICAL HISTORY:
Ovarian cyst — 11 x 9 x 6,0m-left adnexal mass per

Ebrowser. CA 5 increased T9 at 888 also per Ebrowaer.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

" ' d ovary (AF1)", received fresh and placed in formalin on
m is a 304 gram, 12 x 9 x 5 cm well—encapsulated ovarian
. surface is pink-tan. The tumor, which is largely solid (AFl

Frozen section; remnant in A1, additional blocks A2—7), contains cysts filled
with serous fluid. There only residual normal ovarian parenchyma is a single
corpus albicans (AB). The 1.7 cm long, 0.4 cm in diameter fallopian tube is
unremarkable {A9}.

B. "Left tube and ovary", receiVed in formalin is a 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm pink-tan,
lobulated ovary, which.upon sectioning shows a 1.6 x 1 cm intraparenchymal,
tanwyellow, solid mass that_expands but does not penetrate the capsule. The
remainder of the parenchyma is grossly unremarkable.

Attached to the ovary is'a 3.4 cm long x 0.4 cm in diameter.grossly
unremarkable fimbriated fallopian tube and soft tissue. Representative
sections of ovary are submitted in blocks 81—2 and fallopian tube ian3.

C. "Uterus and cervix", received in formalin is a ?3 gram, 7.6 x 6.1 x 3.4 cm
uterus. The serosa is pink—tan, erythematous, and contains a 1.3 x l x 0.5 cm
subserosal nodule. The ectooervix (4 x 3.7 cm) is pink—tan with a patent 1 cm
05. The endometrial cavity (1.5 x 3.5 cm) is lined by a 0.2 cm red, smooth
endometrium overlying a 2 cm thick myometrium. The myometrium has two
tan—white, homogeneous, whorled nodules ranging from 1 cm to 1.5 cm in
greatest dimension.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Cl— anterior cervix

€29 anterior endomyometrium with nodule
€3- posterior cervix

C4- endomyometrium with nodule

C5— subserosal nodule

D. "Omentum", received in formalin is a 16 x 12 x 2 cm fragment of
unremarkable yellow lobulated adipose tissue represented in block Di.

E. "R-ight peritoneal biopsy of polyp", received fresh in formalin—
—is a 3.8 x 1 x 0.6 cm fragment of tan.r hemorrhagic soft tissue is
submitted entirely in block E1. .

F. "Ri ht par ' 'c lymph node", received fresh and placed in formalin on
- is a 7.3 x 3 x 2 cm fragment of Yellow. lobulated adipose
tissue, is dissected for lymph nodes. One lymph node candidate is grosaly
identified (3.8 x 1.9 x 0.6 cm), and has a yellow—tan, soft cut surface. The
lymph node candidate is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in blocks

Fln6.

G. "Right common iliac lymph node", received in formalin is a 4 x 2 x 1.1 cm
fragment of yellow lobulated adipose tiesue, dissected for lymph nodes. One
lymph node candidate is grossly identified {2.5 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm), is bisected
and submitted entirely in block G1, and the remainder of the adipose tissue in

block GZ.

H. "Right gutter peritoneum", received in formalin is a 2.4 x 1 x 0.8 cm

 

rage 4 OJ. 3

fragment of yellow-tan soft tissue and is submitted entirely in block H1.

‘5 a 4.4 x 2.5 x 1.3 cm fragment of yellow, lobulated adipoae tissue,
is 158 cted for lymph nodes. One lymph node candidate is grossly identified
(3.1 x 0.9 x 0.1 cm), is bisected and submitted entirely in block 11 and the
remainder of the adipose tissue in blocks and 12-3.
