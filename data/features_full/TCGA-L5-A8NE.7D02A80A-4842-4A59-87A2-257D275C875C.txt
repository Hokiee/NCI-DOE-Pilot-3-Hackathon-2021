ACCESSION: UPER DATE: RED DOC:

PROCEDURE: VERIFIED BY:

A -year-old male with distal esophageal adenocarcinoma, likely arising in
\ Barrett's mucosa associated with longstanding GE reflux.

‘\

PROCEDURE: VERIFIED BY:

1. ”Thoracic esophagus" A 9 cm distal esophagus with attached 5 cm proximal
stomach contains a well-circumcribed 5.7 x 4.5 cm polypoid tan-brown tumor
occupying 80% of the circumference, and is 1.1 cm from the distal gastric
margin and 7.2 cm from the proximal esophageal margin. The tumor is 2/3 within
the esophageal space and 1/3 in the gastric space. Adjacent to the tumor and
contiguous with it is a 1.8 x 1.2 cm area of ulceration at the GE junction.
The reminder of the esOphageal and gastric nucosae appear unremarkable. Deep
margin inked black, distal margin inked blue. The tuner is 1.8 cm thick and
penetrates into the surrounding adipose. There are several lymph nodes up to 1
cm in the adipose.

1A.-D. Tunor at its greatest extent.

1E. Tumor in relation to esophagus.

1F. Tumor in relation to stomach and distal margin.

16. Ulcer adjacent to tumor.

1H. Lynph nodes.

11. Lymph nodes.

2. ”Cervical esophageal margin” A 1 cm length of esophagus is received with

a stapled end and an opened end. Opened end inked blue. .V .. 1» ¢
