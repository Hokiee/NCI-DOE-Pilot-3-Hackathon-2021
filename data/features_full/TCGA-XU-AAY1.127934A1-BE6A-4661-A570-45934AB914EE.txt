areas of bland spindled cells without significant lymphocytic
infiltration, and areas of polygonal epithelioid cells admixed with small
round lymphocytes. There is focal microscopic invasion of the capsule
with extension into adjacent mediastinal fat. By immunohistochemistry,
the epithelial cells are positive for keratins (CK5/6, AEl/AE3) and p63.
The infiltrating lymphocytes stain positive for CD5. CD20 shows focal
positive staining of lymphocytes and occasional epithelial cells. CD1a
is non-reactive. The overall morphological and immunohistochemical
profile of this lesion is consistent with a mixed thymoma (WHO type A32),
modified Masaoka stage IIa.

CLINICAL HISTORY
Mediastinal tumour

GROSS DESCRIPTION

1. The specimen container is labeled with the patient's name and as
ninnominate vein lymph node" contains one lymph node received in 10%
buffered formalin. The lymph node measures 0.5 x 0.5 x 2.3 cm.

1A specimen submitted in toto.

'2. The specimen container is labeled with the patient's name and as
"thymoma" contains a thymus gland received in 10% buffered formalin. The
thymus measures 12.5 x 6.1 x 3.0 cm and weighs 71 g. The specimen
margins are painted with silver nitrate. 0n sectioning, there is
presence of a well-circumscribed tumor measuring 7.0 x 5.0 x 3.5 cm. The
tumor appears to be grossly encapsulated; the capsule is mobile on the

- surface of the tumor. The cut surface of the tumor is whitish tan in
color and appears to be firm and solid. The rest of the thymus tissue is
yellowish tan in color and is predominantly fatty. No other nodules are
identified grossly.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:
2A—2G representative sections of the tumor including capsule and adjacent
apparently normal thymus tissue.
2H—2I representative sections of the apparently normal thymus.
