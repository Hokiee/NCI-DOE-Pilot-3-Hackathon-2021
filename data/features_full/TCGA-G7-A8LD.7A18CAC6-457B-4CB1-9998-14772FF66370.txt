GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. LEFT KIDNEY
Received fresh labeled with the patient’s identiﬁcation and "left kidney" is a 1036 g kidney with attached
perinephric fat, 24 x 9 x 8.3 cm. The adrenal gland is golden-orange and measures1 .4 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.
The ureter is 9.5 x 0.3 cm; it is probe patent and contains a green Teﬂon catheter. The specimen is
inked black; it is bisected. The kidney is 19 x 7.8 x 5.5 cm. The renal pelvis is dilated and protruding
from the calyx into the pelvis is a friable brown-tan hemorrhagic mass. The lower pole contains a friable,
papillary, hemorrhagic golden tan necrotic mass, 7.5 x 6.3 x 6.1 cm. The mass grossly extends into the
renal pelvis and pushes on the capsule. The renal fat surrounding the mass is edematous. The soft
tissue surrounding the dilated renal pelvis has a white-yellow discoloration. The remainder of the
parenchyma is unremarkable. Photograph is taken and tissue Is procured; representatively submitted:

A1: shave of ureter margin

A2: shave of vasculature margins

A3: adrenal gland

A4-A6: mass and relationship to renal sinus and pelvis

A7: hemorrhagic and necrotic a portion of the mass

A8—A10: mass in relationship to capsule and perinephn‘c fat

A11-A12: mass and edematous fat

A13: area of discoloration surrounding renal pelvis

A14: normal appearing parenchyma

B. LEFT PERIAORTIC LYMPH NODES

Received without ﬁxative in a container labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated
"periaortic lymph nodes" are multiple fragments of ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 8.5 x 7.9 x 1.8 cm in
aggregate. Sectioning shows multiple possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.4 up to 3.2 x 1.2
x 1.2 cm. Cassettes are submitted as follows:

31: 3 possible lymph nodes

BZ: 2 possible lymph nodes

33: One lymph node

84.35: One lymph node

B6: Representative sections. one lymph node

B7: Representative sections. one lymph node

B8: Representative sections one lymph node

89-310: One lymph node
