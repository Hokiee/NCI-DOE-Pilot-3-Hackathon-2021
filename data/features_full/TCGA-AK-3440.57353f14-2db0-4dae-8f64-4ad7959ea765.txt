Results—Comments

CYTOGENETIC ANALYSIS REPORTS

DIAGNOSIS: Renal Mass

KARYOTYPE: Specimen inadequate for cytogenetic analysis.

RESULTS: Four cultures were established from the renal mass specimen.
After three hours, all four flasks exhibited rampant bacterial
contamination. The specimen was not delivered to the cytogenetics
laboratory until the neXt day.
