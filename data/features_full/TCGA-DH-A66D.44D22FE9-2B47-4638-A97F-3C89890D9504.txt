» A. Frozen Section Charge
CLINICAL HISTORY: A year old, white female here for right craniotomy
for brain tumor.
DIAGNOSIS:

A. "Brain tumor, right posterior frontal, oraniotomy for
resection":

Anaplastic astrocytoma, WHO Grade III (See comment)

COMMENT: Sections Show an infiltrating glioma with prominent nuclear and
cellular pleomorphism and non—uniformity and a microcyetic background.
Many tumor cells display gemistooytic morphology. Focally, the tumor
appears to extend into the Subarachnoid space {slides "A5" and "A6").
Mitoses are easily identified on routine HﬁE sections and immunostudy for
the mitoses specific antibody PHH3 reveals a maximum of 7 mitoses per 10
high power fields. Ki~67 (MIB~1) shows an elevated proliferation index
of up to 10—15% approximately. Tumor cells and tumor cell processes are
strongly immunoreective for GFAP. The tumor is poeitive for mutated
isocitrate dehydrogenase l (IDHl). PS3 is immunoreactivo in the majority
of tumor cello (more than 50%). There is focal individual tumor cell
iecrosis; however, definitive areas of geographic or pseudopalisading
necrosis are not seen in the sections examined. Definitive microvasoular
proliferation is not identified in this material. These findings support
the diagnosis of anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO Grade III).
Clinioopathologio correlation i3 recommended.
GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received the following specimen in the Department of
Ratholoqy, labeled with the patient'e name and hospital #

A. Brain tumor
A. The Sp ’mon is received fresh for frozen section, designated "Brain
tumor" and c .eiste of a 6.2 x 4.0 x 1.5 om, irregular fragment of
tanewhite soft tiosue admixed with blood clot. Set ioning through this
tissue reveals a gray—ten to tan—white, illedefinod CJt surface. A
copreeentative piece is submitted for frozen section evaluation, FSAl.
Frozen eection diagnosis is "Diffuse infiltrating glioma,"q...l.h
m Residual frozen section tissue i5 submitted in cassette E‘SA‘L and
the remaining tissue is eubmitted entirely in cassettes A2~A9. A portion
of the specimen was frozen for the brain bank. ~
