Addendum Microscopic Description. c940, gym/IL}

Additional sections have been reviewed and the case has been consulted with Drs. All reviewers agree
with the initial interpretation. The process is an invasive thymoma. Based on the macroscopic
involvement of the pericardium (clinically) and the invasion of the pleura, the process would be
considered stage III. The resection margins appear negative.

Addendum Diagnosis:

Thymus and lung, resection: Invasive Thymoma.

Invasion: Present (Microscopically invasive of pleura; macroscopically invasive of pericardium per op
report). Approximately 8.5cm. Spindle cell (WHO A). Degree of cytologic Atypia: Mild. Vascular Invasion:
Not idenitified. Resection Margins: Negative for diagnostic neoplasm.

Microscopic Description:

Sections of mediastinal tissue demonstrate a thymoma. The neoplasm is arranged as lobulated nests of
spindled cells, divided by fibrous bands of varying thickness. There is no significant cytologic atypia and
mitotic figures are few. There is extension into the pleura. No definitive lympovascular invasion is
appreciated. The neoplasm demonstrates zones of infarct/necrosis, as well as lobulated hyalinization.
The inked peripheral resection margin and pulmonary resection margin are negative for diagnostic

neoplasm. Per operative note, there was extension of the lesion into the pericardium as well. Additional
sections are pending.

Pathological Diagnosis (provisional):

Thymoma- Invasion-present (microscopically invasion of pleura, macroscopically invasive of pericardium
per operative report)- additional sections pending. Maximal Tumor Dimension- Approx 8.5cm Histologic

Type: Spindle cell (who A). Degree of Cytologic Atypia- Mild. Vascular Invasion— Not identified. Resection
Margins- Negative for diagnostic neoplasm.
