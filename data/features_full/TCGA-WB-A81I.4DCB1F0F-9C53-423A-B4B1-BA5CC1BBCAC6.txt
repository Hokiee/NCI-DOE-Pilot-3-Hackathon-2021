Grossly, there is a red and light tan tumor with a diameter of 2.1 cm.

Histologically, the tumor was composed of pleomorph medium sized cells with slightly
enlarged nuclei. chromatin and prominent nucleoli. Single cells display more pronounced
pleomorphy and more enlarged nuclei. The tumor is well separated from adjacent tissue,
partly by a ﬁbrous capsule. Single cells have hyaline globules. No signiﬁcant increase in the
number of mitoses, no evidence for necrosis, vessel invasion or capsule destruction.
