B: Sentinel node #2 _ )- FS

C: Right breast mass oriental with 1 short stitch superior. 1 long stitch lateral

Gr ss Desc tion:
A. Received fresh is a pale tan to light brown lymph node, 1 x 0.8 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto in two cassettes

for frozen section.

B. Received trash is a pale tan lymph node. 1.2 x 1 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto in one block for frozen section.

Received in formalin is a yellow-tan ﬁbroadipose tissue fragment, 110 grams, 9 x 6.5 x 4 cm. The specimen is oriented
with a short stitch superior and a long stitch lateral margin. The specimen is inked as follows: superior margin - black,

inferior margin — yellow. posterior margin — green. anterior margin — blue. lateral margin — orange. and medial margin —
red. Cross sections through the specimen show a yellow—tan cut surface. Located 4 mm from the anterior and superior
margin is an ill-deﬁned. markedly firm. slightly hemorrhagic mass. 2.4 x 2.3 x 1.9 cm. No other iirm masses are grossly
identiﬁed. The large iii-defined mass does not appear to grossly involve any surgical margin. Sections are submitted as

follows:

1 Anterosupericr margin
2 Inferior margin

3 Deep margin

4 Anterior margin

5 Lateral margin

6 Medial margin
