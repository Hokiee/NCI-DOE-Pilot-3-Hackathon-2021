CLINICAL DATA: Composite resection for leﬂ tonsil squamous cell carcinoma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: A) Received in formalin designated level IA is a 3.5 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm
portion of ﬁbrofatty tissue. Lymph nodes are dissected and submitted in the following cassettes:
Al - ﬁve possible lymph nodes; A2 - four possible lymph nodes; A3 - three possible lymph
nodes. B) Received fresh designated leﬁ selective neck dissection, double long level IIB, single
stitch level IV is a 13.0 x 3.5 x up to 2.0 cm portion of ﬁbrofatty tissue. A 3.0 x 1.0 cm portion
of vein is present beginning at the inferior aspect of level II and extending to level III. Adjacent
to the vein is a 2.5 cm nodule. Sections are submitted in the following cassettes: Bl - four
possible level IIB nodes; BZ - two possible level IIB nodes, one bisected and inked black; B3 —
two possible level IIA nodes, one bisected and inked black; B4 - six possible level IIA nodes; BS
- grossly positive node with adjacent vein; B6 - three possible level 111 nodes, one bisected and
inked black; B7 - three possible level III nodes; B8 - ﬁve possible level IV nodes; B9 - three
possible level IV nodes. C) Received in formalin designated left submandibular gland is a 4.2
x 3.0 x 2.0 cm lobulated portion of tan tissue consistent with salivary gland. Sectioning
demonstrates lobulated parenchyma with no gross lesions. Representative sections are submitted
in cassettes C1 and C2. D) Received in formalin designated left facial node is a 1.0 cm
nodule, which is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette D1. E) Received in formalin
designated left lingual nerve is a 0.3 cm portion of pale tan soft tissue, which is wrapped and
entirely submitted in cassette El. F) Received fresh designated peristyloid tissue is a 0.4 x
0.1 x 0.1 cm portion of pink soft tissue, which is entirely submitted for frozen section evaluation,
thawed, and subsequently submitted in cassette FFS l. G) Received fresh designated left
composite resection, single short stitch uvula, double short left tongue, and single long hard
palate mucosa is a 5.5 x 4.3 x 4.0 cm resection specimen. The uvula is present at the right
posterior aspect of the specimen indicated by a single short stitch. A double stitch is present on
the anterior left aspect, indicating the hard palate mucosa. A double short stitch indicates the
tongue where there is a bundle of skeletal muscle at the inferior aspect of the specimen. The left
lateral aspect is partially covered by skeletal muscle. The mucosa, which forms the medial aspect
of the specimen, has an irregular ulcerated lesion spanning at least 2.5 cm superior to inferior x
1.7 cm anterior to posterior. The specimen is inked as follows: Superior and inferior black,
anterior and lateral yellow, medial blue, posterior green. Sectioning demonstrates that pale tan,
ﬁrm tissue inﬁltrates throughout the entire specimen and closely approaches all surgical margins.
Sections are submitted in the following cassettes: Gl - uvula; G2 - hard palate mucosal margin;
G3 - tongue mucosal margin; G4, G5 - horizontal cross section with lateral, anterior, posterior
and medial margins; G6, G7 - horizontal cross section inferior aspect of specimen; G8 - lesion in
relation to inferior margin. H) Received in formalin designated level V node is a 2.0 x 1.0 x
1.0 cm portion of ﬁbrofatty tissue. Lymph nodes are dissected and submitted in the following
cassettes: H1 - one nodule, bisected; H2 - remaining fatty tissue. 1) Received in formalin
designated styloid process is a 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm portion of ﬁbrofatty tissue. The specimen is
serially sectioned demonstrating focal bone within the specimen. The entire specimen is
submitted in cassettes 11 and I2 after brief decalciﬁcation.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: FFS: Markedly cauterized biopsy with single nest of

cauterized atypical epithelium versus nerve; cannot rule out squamous cell carcinoma, ﬁnal
diagnosis deferred. 7

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

A-D, H) Lymph nodes, level 1A, left selected neck, submandibular gland, leﬁ facial node, level
5 node, dissections:

l. Metastatic carcinoma present in four of 34 lymph nodes: 0/7 level IA, 0/4 level IIB (see
below), 1/8 level IIA, 2/8 level 111, 1/5 level IV, 0/2 leﬁ facial, 0/1 level IV.

2. Foreign body giant cell reaction within one of the level IIB nodes suggestive of reaction to
necrotic tumor.

3. Submandibular gland with no evidence of carcinoma.
E) Leﬁ lingual nerve, biopsy: Large nerve fascicle with no evidence of carcinoma.
F) Peristyloid tissue, biopsy: Atypical cells suspicious for carcinoma.

G) Left tonsil fossa, composite resection: Squamous cell carcinoma with the following:

I. 5.0 cm greatest dimension.
2. Moderately to poorly differentiated.
3. Carcinoma inﬁltrates salivary glands and skeletal muscle (including tongue).

4. Carcinoma is extensively present at the cauterized superior aspect of the lateral surgical
margin (G2), focally at the cauterized posterior margin (G6), closely approaching the

inferolateral margin (G8), less than 0.1 cm to the medial uvula margin, and 0.4 cm from the
medial tongue margin. '

H) Styloid process, excision: Carcinoma present in soft tissue; adjacent bone uninvolved.

COMMENT: Minimum pathologic stage: pT4aN2bMX (AJ CC 2002) Procedures used to
establish the diagnosis: I Submit tissue for decalciﬁcation

ADDENDUM REASON: This addendum is issued to report the size of the involved lymph
nodes (all from part B) and the presence of extracapsular extension for the purpose of a clinical
trial enrollment. It was also noted that one of the level designations (part H, in bold below) and
the total number of nodes was incorrect in the ﬁnal diagnosis. The remaining parts remain
unchanged. The corrected diagnosis with the additional requested information is as follows:

A-D, H) Lymph nodes, level 1A, leﬁ selected neck, submandibular gland, leﬁ facial node, level
5 node, dissections: Metastatic carcinoma present in four of 35 lymph nodes: 0/7 level IA, 0/4
level IIB (see below), 1/8 level IIA, 2/8 level III, l/5 level IV, 0/2 left facial, O/l level V. Foreign
body giant cell reaction within one of the level IIB nodes suggestive of reaction to necrotic
tumor. Submandibular gland with no evidence of carcinoma. The largest positive node is 2.5 cm
(level III) measured grossly. The three other positive nodes (level IIA, III, and IV) are

approximately 1.5 cm, 1.2 cm and 1.1 cm based on microscopy. Both level 111 nodes and the
level IIA node have extracapsular extension.
