SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Patient: Specimen #:

FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued):

D. BREAST, LEFT LOWER INNER QUADRANT, EXCISION:
- BENIGN BREAST TISSUE; NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

Comment: There is no change in the original pathologic diagnosis. This
amendment is issued to reflect a change in the HER2 immunohistochemical
status. The original report stated that the HER2 was positive
based on the core biopsy material . However, that core biopsy
material has been recently amended to reflect that the HER2 is actually
negative (further supported by confirmatory FISH study showing no
amplification).

‘ ** Report Electronically Signed Out **

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY:
—year—old female with left breast cancer, and strong family

history, desires prophylactic bilateral mastectomy.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient’s name,

designated "RIGHT BREAST TISSUE, LONG = LATERAL, SHORT = SUPERIOR" is a
300 gram right mastectomy specimen oriented with a short stitch superior,
and long stitch lateral. The specimen measures 16.0 X 16.0 x 3.0 cm, and
displays an 8.5 x 3.0 cm lightly pigmented skin ellipse on the superficial
surface. The centrally located everted nipple measures 1.5 cm and is free
of discharge. The deep margin is inked in black. Serial sections reveal
markedly dense, pink—white, fibrous tissue involving 70% of the cut
surface. The tissue is slightly nodular, however, no discreet mass or
lesion is identified. No lymph nodes are identified. Representative
sections are submitted as follows:

Cassette Key:

Al: Skin.
A2: Upper outer quadrant.
A3: Lower outer quadrant.
A4: Lower inner quadrant.
A5: Upper inner quadrant.
6: Central.
atched sections of Al through A6 are submitted in OCT for CBCP protocol.

GROSS DESCRIPTION (continued):

A7: Nipple.

A9: Lower outer quadrant.

A10: Lower inner quadrant.

A11: Upper inner quadrant. 11C11

B. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient’s name,
designated "LEFT AXILLA SENTINEL NODE" is a single 1.8 x 1.8 X 0.6 cm
pink—tan lymph node. The lymph node is trisected, and entirely submitted
in cassettes B1 and B2. Matched section of B1 is submitted in OCT for
CBCP protol.

C. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient’s name,
designated "LEFT BREAST TISSUE, LONG LATERAL, SHORT SUPERIOR" is a 284
gram left mastectomy specimen oriented with a short stitch superior and
long stitch lateral. The specimen measures 14.5 cm medial to lateral,
14.0 cm superior to inferior, and 2.5 cm anterior to posterior. The
lightly pigmented superficial skin ellipse measures 7.0 X 3.2 cm and
displays a centrally located, everted nipple measuring 1.8 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm.
The nipple is free of discharge. The deep margin is inked in black, and
the superficial inferior half is inked in blue. Serial sections reveal a
1.9 x 1.6 X 1.6 cm well defined, pink—tan, gritty, indurated mass in the

superficial margin. The remainder of the specimen is composed of 70% of
markedly dense, diffusely nodular fibrous tissue with scattered gray-blue

Cassette Summary:

Cl: Skin.
C2: Nipple.

C3: Mass, lower outer quadrant.

C4—C6: Deep and superficial margins of C3.

C7: Mass with superficial margin.

C8: Additional superficial margin.

C9: Adjacent normal with cyst (lower outer quadrant).
C10: Upper outer quadrant.

C11: Upper inner quadrant.

C12: Lower inner quadrant.

Matched sections of C1-C3, C7, and C9—C12 are submitted in OCT for CBCP
protocol.

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Patient: 1 Specimen #:

GROSS DESCRIPTION (continued):

D. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient’ 5 name,

designated "LEFT BREAST TISSUE LOWER INNER QUADRANT" are multiple
fragments of yellow, lobular, adipose tissue. The first fragment measures
5.5 X 3.0 X 0.4 cm. The second fragment measures 5.0 X 2.5 X 0.5 cm.
Serial sectioning is remarkable for an area of focal hemorrhage measuring
0.4 X 0.3 X 0.2 cm located 0.2 cm from the nearest inked margin.
Representative section is submitted in cassette D1. Also noted is a
fibrotic band measuring 0.4 X 0.4 X 0.2 cm abutting the closest inked
margin. Two representative sections are submitted in cassette D2. The
second specimen is inked in blue, and is serially sectioned to reveal

unremarkable, yellow, cut surfaces. Representative sections are submitted
in cassettes D3-D4. 4CF ‘
