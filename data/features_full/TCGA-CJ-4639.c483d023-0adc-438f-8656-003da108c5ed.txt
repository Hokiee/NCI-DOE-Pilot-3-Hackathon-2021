DIAGNOSIS

(A) 12TH RIB:
Unrernarkable segment of rib (gross examination only).
(B) PERINEPHRIC FAT:
Mature adipose tissue, no tumor present.
(C) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL:
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (717 CM MAXIMUM DIMENSION), CONVENTIONAL TYPE
(100% CLEAR CELLS).
FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 2, CONFINED TO THE KIDNEY. (SEE COMMENT)
Adrenal gland. no tumor present.
Margins of resection free of tumor.

COMMENT

The renal cell carcinoma in the left kidney is conﬁned to the kidney
and does not invade into the renal vein, perinephric adipose tissue or
renal sinus adipose tissue.

 

JROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) 12TH RiB, GROSS ONLY - A segment of bone (3.2 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm).
which is grossly unremarkable.

(B) PERINEPHRIC FAT - A segment of adipose tissue (16.0 x100 x 0.5
cm). No discrete lesion is identiﬁed. Representative sections are

submitted in 81—83.

(C) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL — A radical nephrectomy specimen (26.0 x
16.5 x 5.5 cm), including the adrenal gland (7.0 x 5.0 x15 cm). The

adrenat gland appears unremarkable.

A tan-yellow, locally gelatinous tumor (7.? x 7.0 x 5.5 cm) is
present in the lower pole of the kidney. The tumor does not appear to
involve the renal vein or the renal sinus. It is conﬁned by a capsule
and the closest external surface is 0.3 cm away. The uninvolved renal
parenchyma appears unremarkable.

INK CODE: Black - external surface close to the tumor.

SECTION CODE: Ct, ureter, renal vein, renal artery margins; C2.
representative sections of adrenal gland: C3-C4, sections of tumor and
renal sinus; C5—C8, sections of tumor with closest perinephric fat
surface; 09-010, representative sections of tumor; 011612,
representative sections of uninvolved kidney. -

CLINICAL HISTORY
Left renal mass.
