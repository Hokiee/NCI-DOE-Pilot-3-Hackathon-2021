SPECIMEN

E. Left periaortic lymph node

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Endometrial carcinoma

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Received fresh for tissue procurement labelled "uterus,
bilateral tubes and ovaries, cervix" is a 119 gram, 5.5 x
4.5 x 4.5 cm symmetrical uterine corpus with attached 2.8 cm cervix
and bilateral adnexa. The serosa is smooth tan—pink—red. The
circular 3.7 cm white—pink ectocervix surrounds a 0.4 x 0.3 cm
ovoid
patent os. Endocervical mucosa is moderately trabecular tan—pink
with a moderate amount of adherent blood—tinged mucus. The
triangular, 4.5 X 3.9 cm uterine cavity contains a copious amount
of
ectophytic soft pale tan tumor. The tumor dominates within the
anterior uterine cavity extending to the anterior lower uterine
% segment. A portion of tumor and a portion of normal endometrium
are
submitted for tissue procurement as requested. On sectioning, the
tumor has a maximal thickness of 2.5 cm, grossly involving the
upper
one-third of the myometrium anteriorly. The scanty normal—
appearing
endometrium is flat, tan-pink with an average thickness of 0.2 cm.
The myometrium is smooth to mildly trabecular tan—pink and measures
up to 2.9 cm in thickness. A few well—circumscribed rubbery
whorled
tan—white—pink intramural leiomyomata measuring up to 1.3 cm in
greatest dimension are present. Bilaterally, the tan—pink—gold
ovaries average 2.3 x 1.4 x 0.9 cm. The stroma of both ovaries is
tan-pink with identifiable corpora albicantia. The fimbriated
tan—pink right and left fallopian tubes average 6.3 cm in length
and

0.5 cm in diameter with pinpoint to stellate lumina on sectioning.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION

Representative sections are submitted in 14 blocks as labelled.
RS—14.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — anterior cervix; 2 — anterior LUS (point of
continuity with cervix inked blue); 3-6 — representative anterior
endomyometrium including lesion full—thickness sequentially from
fundus to LUS; 7 — posterior cervix; 8 — posterior LUS (point of
continuity with cervix inked black); 9—12 - representative

posterior

is

in

endomyometrium including lesion full—thickness sequentially from
fundus to LUS; 13 - right tube and ovary; 14 — left tube and ovary.

B. Received fresh labelled "right pelvic lymph node" is a

5.4 x 3.6 x 1.9 cm aggregate of fragmented soft lobulated
gold and yellow adipose tissue. Several soft to slightly rubbery
tan—pink—gold tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to
1.6 cm in greatest dimension are recovered. The lymphoid tissues
are entirely submitted in four blocks as labelled. RS—4.
BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - five whole nodes; 2 — two whole nodes; 3—4 — one
bisected node per cassette.

C. Received fresh labelled "right periaortic lymph node"

a 2.4 x 2.0 x 1.3 cm aggregate of soft, lobulated gold and
yellow adipose tissue. Two slightly rubbery tan-pink—red tissues

keeping with lymph nodes measuring 0.3 and 0.6 cm in greatest
dimension are recovered. The lymphoid tissues are entirely
submitted in one block. AS—l.

D. Received fresh labelled "left pelvic lymph node" is a

5.2 x 4.2 x 1.7 cm aggregate of soft, lobulated gold and
yellow adipose tissue. Several soft tan-pink-gold tissues in
keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 2.9 cm in greatest
dimension are recovered. The lymphoid tissues are entirely
submitted in three blocks as labelled. RS-3.
BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — three whole nodes; 2 — five whole nodes; 3 -
bisected largest node.

E. Received fresh labelled "left periaortic lymph node" is

GROSS DESCRIPTION
a 2.3 x 1.9 x 0.6 cm aggregate of soft, lobulated gold and
yellow adipose tissue. Three soft tan-red tissues in keeping with
lymph nodes measuring up to 0.6 cm in greatest dimension are
recovered. The lymphoid tissues are submitted in toto in one
block.
RS-l.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Histologic type: Endometroid adenocarcinoma with squamous
differentiation.
Histologic grade: Well differentiated (FIGO grade 1).
Myometrial invasion:
1 cm. depth of invasion
2.5 cm. depth of myometrial thickness
40% of myometrial wall
Cervix: Free of involvement by tumor.
Primary tumor (pT) TNM (FIGO): Tumor involves less than one half
of
the myometrium (ple) (18).
@ Margins of resection: Negative.
Vascular invasion: Negative.
Regional lymph nodes (pN): Right and left pelvic lymph nodes and
right and left periaortic lymph nodes are negative for metastatic
carcinoma (pNO).
Distant metastasis (pM): Can not be assessed. (pr).
Other findings: Leiomyomata.

DIAGNOSIS
A. Uterus, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries, hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy:
Invasive well differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma with

DIAGNOSIS
squamous differentiation involving the inner 40% of the
myometrium.
The uterine cervix, both fallopian tubes and ovaries are free
of involvement by tumor.
Leiomyomata.

B. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, resection:
Nine lymph nodes negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/9).

C. Lymph nodes, right periaortic, resection:
Two lymph nodes negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/2).

D. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, resection:
Nine lymph nodes negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/9).

E. Lymph nodes, left periaortic, resection:
Two lymph nodes negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/2).
