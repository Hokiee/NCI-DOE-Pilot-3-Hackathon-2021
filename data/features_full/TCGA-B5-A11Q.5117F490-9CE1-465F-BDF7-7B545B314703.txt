CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm corpus uteri 182.0 (FIGO I endometrioid adenocarcinoma—per
surgeon).

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries (AF1—4). Received fresh for
frozen section is a detached left adnexa (AF1&2 frozen section; remnant in
A1&2). Also received is a 83 gram, 4.3 x 4 x 3.8 cm supracervical
hysterectomy specimen opened to demonstrate an endometrial cavity (4 x 3.2 cm)
totally effaced by an exophytic 6 x 6 cm exophytic brown mass (AF3). The
tumor is maximally 2 cm thick, 0.1 cm of which invades into a 1.7 cm
myometrium. No uninvolved endometrium is grossly noted. The myometrium
contains a well—circumscribed, whorled, 3 x 3 x 2.7 cm intramural nodule. No
additional lesions are noted. The attached presumed right adnexa consists of a
4.2 cm long fimbriated fallopian tube with attached mesentery and an attached
4 x 3.5 x 2 cm ovary. The surface of the ovary is lobulated, white—tan, and
upon sectioning demonstrates a cut surface effaced by a mucinous brown—tan
mass that does not extend to the surface. The unattached 24 gram left adnexa
consists of a 3 cm long, 0.5 cm in diameter fimbriated fallopian tube with an
attached 7 x 3 x 1.7 cm lobulated, white ovary. Alro received is an amputated
5 x 2.5 x 2.2 cm cervix (14 gram) demonstrates a smooth, glistening exocervix
and an unremarkable endocervical canal (AF4)

B. "Left pelvic lymph nodes", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 6 x 6

candidates from 0.3 to 3.8 cm in greatest dimension are identified and
submitted as follows:

C. "Left gutter peritoneum", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 3 x
1.5 x 1 cm fragment of red-brown fibromembranous tissue. The specimen is
sectioned and submitted entirely in blocks C1-2.

D. "Right pelvic lymph node", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 6 x 4

candidates from 0.2 to 3.7 cm in greatest dimension are identified and

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: HYSTERECTOMY, OOPHORECTOMY & LYMPHADENECTOMY

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 6th Edition): pT3a pNX pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.
