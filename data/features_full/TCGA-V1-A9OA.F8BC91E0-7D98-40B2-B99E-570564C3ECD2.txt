DzProstate and seminal vesicles (fresh)
E:Posterior urethra

Clinical History

The patient is a "with a history of prostate cancer by core biopsy, Gleason grade
ranging from 4 +4 (8) to 5 +4 (9). The patient undergoes a radical retropubic nerve-sparing
prostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection.

Gross Description

The specimen is received in ﬁve parts, each labeled with the patient's name and unit number. Parts A-C
and E are received in formalin; Part D is received fresh.

Part A, additionally labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes," consists of two soft-to-firm, yellow-tan, ﬁbrofatty
tissue fragments measuring 3 x 2 x 1.0 cm in aggregate. A single lymph node candidate is identiﬁed,
bisected, and submitted in cassette A1. The entire fibrofatty remnant is submitted in cassette A2.

Part B, additionally labeled “left pelvic lymph nodes," consists of multiple segments of soft, irregular,
yellow~tan, fibrofatty tissue fragments measuring 6.5 x 4 x 1 cm in aggregate. Multiple lymph node
candidates are identiﬁed and submitted as follows:

Cassettes 31-32: One lymph node candidate, bisected.

Cassette B3: One lymph node candidate, bisected.
Cassette 34: Two lymph node candidates, bisected.
Cassette BS: Multiple small lymph node candidates submitted intact.

Part C, additionally labeled “posterior bladder neck," consists of a single irregular, unoriented,
off-white/tan tissue fragment measuring 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm. The entire specimen is Submitted in
cassette C1.

Part D is received fresh additionally labeled "prostate and seminal vesicle". It consists of a single intact
prostate gland with attached seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundles weighing 50.5 grams and measuring
4.3 cm from apex to base, 4.4 cm from medial to lateral and 4.9 cm from anterior to posterior. The
exterior of the gland is roughened, red-tan and glistening. Sutures are noted along the anterior
midline, closing the dorsal vein complex. The seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundles are soft, whorled,
red-tan and without lesion or mass. The right anterior surface of the gland is inked green; the left
anterior surface is inked blue; and the posterior surface is inked black. The specimen is bisected
perpendicular to the urethral channel, and tissue is banked for research/tissue banking purposes. The
two halves of the specimen are subsequently glued together, and the specimen is fixed prior to further
sectioning. Following fixation, the bladder margin is removed, and the remainder of the gland is serially
sectioned perpendicular to the urethral channel from apex to base into eight serial slices. The serial
slices reveal a large, solid, off-white/yellow tumor located centrally along the posterior aspect of the
gland, which measures 3.0 cm in greatest dimension and grossly abuts the posterior and prostatic
capsule. A small, ovoid, 0.4-cm, periprostatic nodule is noted in the left posterior-lateral aspect of
serial slices #7—8. This nodule contains a yellow-tan discoloration, which is suspicious for extracapsular

 

 

tumor. Further dissection reveals gross tumor invading both of the seminal vesicle/vas deferens
bundles. The apical and bladder margins, as well as representative sections of the prostate and seminal
vesicles, are submitted as follows:

Apical Margin:

Cassette 01: Right apex, 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock, breadloafed and submitted entirely.
Cassette 02: Left apex, 6 o‘clock to 12 o'clock, breadloafed and Submitted entirely.
Right Anterior Quadrant:

Cassette D3: Serial slice #3.

Cassette 04: Serial slice #5.

Cassette 05: Serial slice #7.

Right Posterior Quadrant:

Cassette 06: Serial slice #3.

Cassette 07: Serial slice #5.

Cassette 08: Serial slice #7.

Left Posterior Quadrant:

Cassette 09: Serial slice #3.

Cassette D10: Serial slice #5.

Cassette 011: Serial slice #7.

Left Anterior Quadrant:

Cassette 012: Serial slice #3.

Cassette D13: Serial slice #5.

Cassette D14: Serial slice #7.

Bladder Margin:

Cassette 015: Right lateral bladder margin.

Cassette D16: Central bladder margin.

Cassette 017: Left lateral bladder margin.

Prostatic/Seminal Vesicle Junction:

Cassette 018: Right seminal vesicle and cross section of vas deferens.
Cassette 019: Left seminal vesicle and cross section of vas deferens.

Part E, additionally labeled “posterior urethra," consists of a single irregular, unoriented, tan-brown
tissue fragment measuring 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is entirely
submitted in cassette E1.

Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. Final diagnosis made by attending pathologist
following review of all pathology slides.
