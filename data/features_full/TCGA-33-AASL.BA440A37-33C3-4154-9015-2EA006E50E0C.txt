PART #1: RIGHT UPPER LOBE.
Resident Pathologist: ’"

Dictated by

The specimen is received fresh , labeled with the patient's name
w and designated as right upper lobe. it consists of
a gross y recognizable lobe of lung, weighing 360 gm and measuring 15
x 11 x 6 cm. The outer surface of the lung is a dark purple-red color
and it is of soft spongy consistency. There is a hard, raised nodule
on the anti-hilar portion which measures approximately 7 cm in
diameter. Cutting open the hard mass, reveals a hard spongy,
yellow-white interior. The external pleural surface of the mass has
been inked black. There are two stapled margins which are cut open
and inked black. The tumor appears attached to the pleural
surface, but there is no scarring or puckering of the pleura surface
over the tumor. The superior surgical stapled margin is 5.5 cm in
length and the inferior surgical stapled margin is 5 cm in length.
The tumor is approximately 0.5 cm away from the superior surgical
margin, and approximately 1 cm away from the inferior surgical margin.
There are some grossly visible bullae on the apical posterior side
of the outside of the lung. Approximately five percent (5%) of the

specimen is submitted. Some of the pieces were submitted for further
studies.
