Gross Description

1. The specimen labeled with the patients name as "RT upper parathyroid QS“ and consists of a fragment of tissue that
measures 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto for frozen section.
1A resubmitted frozen tissue

2. The specimen labeled with the patients name as "RT inferior parathyroid QS" and consists of a fragment of tissue that
measures 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm. The specimen is submitted in into for frozen section.
2A resubmitted frozen tissue

3. The specimen labeled with the patients name and as "Subtotal thyroid stitch marks upper pole RT lobe" consists of a

(agght hemithyroidectomy specimen that is received oriented with a suture and weighs 19.3 g. The'right lobe measures 4.0

The right lobe contains 1 delineated, ﬂeshy, yellow-pink nodule that measures 2.2 cm Si x 1.6 cm ML x 1.7 cm AP. The
remainder of the thyroid tissue is red-brown with several other poorly deﬁned nodules many of which have a translucent
red appearance. Sections of the nodule and normal tissue are stored frozen. The remainder of the specimen is submitted
