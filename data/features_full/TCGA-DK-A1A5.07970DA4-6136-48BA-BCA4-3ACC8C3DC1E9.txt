lymph node meaSuring 0.6 x 0.7 x 0.3 Cm. Entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
FSC - frozen section control

5).The specimen is received fresh for frozen diagnosis and labeled with "left distal ureter‘. It consists of a tubular tissue measuring
0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
FSC - frozen section control

6) The specimen is received fresh labeled, "Bladder, prostate and seminal vesicles". It consists of a cystoprostatectomy with
seminal vesicles measuring 9.6 cm from superior to inferior, 5.1 cm laterally and 6.2 cm from anterior to posterior. The left aspect
of the bladder is inked blue and the right green. The prostatic urethral margin is shaved and Submitted. The bladder is opened
along the anterior midline to reveal 2.5x1.9x0.4 cm tan-gray tumor, which is grossly situated within the posterior wall. The lesion
measures 1.8 cm from the left oriﬁce and 1.9 from the right. Both ureters are probe—patent measuring up to 0.2 cm in maximum
diameter. The lesion is sectioned to reveal tan-white cut surface. Extension to the inked fat is grossly not identiﬁed. The remaining
bladder mucosa is edematous. Discrete perivesical lymph nodes are grossly identiﬁed. The prostate is serially sectioned and is
grossly remarkable. Representative sections are submitted including two sections from each prostatic quadrant and transition
zone. TPS is submitted.
