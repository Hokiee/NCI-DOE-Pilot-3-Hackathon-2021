- Anaplastic astrocytoma, WHO grade III, see comment

Comment: Histologic sections demonstrate a markedly cellular and atypical astrocytic
proliferation with a mitotic rate greater than 6 per 10 high powered fields. There are no areas of
necrosis or microvascular proliferation noted. The ﬁndings are consistent with an anaplastic
astrocytoma. WHO grade III. Immunohistochemical stains for p53, Ki-67, and lDH-1 are
performed on block C1. Approximately 50% of the tumor cells are positive for p53, and the
proliferation index is approximately 5 to 10%. lDH-1 is negative.

Clinical Information

The patient is a -year-old male with a clinical diagnosis of left-sided brain tumor undergoing a
left craniotomy for tumor resection.

Specimen/Gross Description

A. The specimen is received fresh intraoperatively for consultation from , labeled
with the patient's name and designated on the requisition as "brain tumor," and consists of a
soft, pink-tan to yellow fragment of tissue measuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. A smear preparation
and frozen section are performed. The intraoperative consultation diagnosis by reads
"SUBPIAL GLIOMA AND REACTIVE BRAIN PARENCHYMA." The intraoperative consultation
diagnosis is communicated to the operating room at or The remainder of
the specimen is entirely submitted as follows:

1 - frozen section remnant
2 - remainder of specimen
B. The specimen is received fresh intraoperatively for consultation from , labeled

with the patient's name and designated on the requisition as "deep tumor," and consists of a
soft, mucoid, pink fragment of tissue measuring 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm. A smear preparation is

performed. The intraoperative consultation diagnosis by reads "HIGH-GRADE
GLIOMA." The intraoperative consultation diagnosis is communicated to the operating room at

on . The remainder of the specimen is entirely submitted in a single
cassette.

C. The specimen is received fresh, labeled with the patient's name and designated on the
requisition as "brain tumor," and consists of 10 pieces of soft, mucoid, pink-tan tissue ranging
from 0.5 cm to 1.6 cm in greatest dimension and aggregating to 3.0 x 2.0 x 0.8 cm. There are
also two soft, tan-white fragments of tissue measuring 1.9 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm and 1.5 x 0.9 x 0.2 cm.
The entire specimen is submitted as follows:

C1 - CB - mucoid fragments
C4 - tan—white fragments

D. The specimen is received fresh, labeled with the patient's name and designated on the
requisition as "deep tumor," and consists of three pieces of brain tissue, the largest measuring
3.3 x 3.0 x 1.2 cm and having a recognizable leptomeningeal surface. The two smaller
fragments measure 2.9 x 1.3 x 0.7 cm and 1.3 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm and each appear to be soft, tan to
brown and possibly necrotic. The 3.3 cm fragment is serially sectioned revealing gray and white

matter with blurring of the gray-white junction. Representative sections are submitted in four
cassettes.

lntraprocedural Consultation Findings
A. Subpial glioma and reactive brain parenchyma.
B. High-grade glioma.
