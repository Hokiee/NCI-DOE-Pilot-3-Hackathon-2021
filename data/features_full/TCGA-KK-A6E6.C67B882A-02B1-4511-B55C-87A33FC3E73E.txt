DIAGNOSIS;

(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 9 (4+5).
(SEE COMMENT).
TUMOR EXTENDING INTO EXTRAPROSTATIC TISSUE. (SEE COMMENT)
Margins of resection free of tumor but carcinoma extending focally to < 0.1 mm from the margin of resection.
PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH GRADE.
Right and left seminal vesicles, no tumor present.
Segments of right and left vasa differentia, no tumor present.

COMMENT:

The prostate gland contains three separate foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma. All tumor foci are located In the peripheral zone.
The dominant tumor focus is located in the right anterolateral, right lateral, right posterolateral and mid posterior peripheral zone.
This tumor focus measures 2.0 x 1.8 cm In the largest cross sectional dimension and It is present in the three cross sections of the
prostate and extensively in the apex and base regions. This tumor focus exhibits in the right posterolateral aspect of the prostate,
right superior neurovascular bundle region and bladder neck region, extension into extraprostatic adipose tissue. The added
length of extraprostatic tumor is 26.0 mm. The margin of resection Is free of tumor but tumor extends focally (right apex) to less
than 0.1 mm from the inked margin of resection. The second largest tumor focus is located in the left anterolateral and left lateral
peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 0.4 x 0.3 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in two cross
sections and focally in the apical region. The third tumor focus is located in the left posterior peripheral zone. This tumor focus
measures 0.4 x 0.3 cm in the largest cross sectional dimension and it is present in two cross sections. The non-dominant tumor
foci are of lower histologic grade (Gleason score 6) and are conﬁned to the prostate.

The dominant tumor focus exhibits Gleason grade 3, 4, and 5. The Gleason grade 5 component is located predominantly in the
right lateral and right anterolateral aspect of the tumor.

GROSSDESCRIPTION

(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa differentia.

The prostate gland (6.4 x 3.3 x 3.5 cm, 49 grams, post ﬁxation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the right
and left posterolateral aspects of the prostate appears symmetrical. Tumor is palpated in the right posterolateral aspect of the
prostate from the apex to the base. Serial cross sections have post ﬁxation demonstrating a ﬁrm area in the right peripheral zone
of the three cross sections of the prostate.

The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa differentia are grossly free of tumor.

SECTION CODE: C1—C4, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; C5-C7, left
seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; 08, prostatic base right border; 09-011, prostatic
base right posterior border; 012-016. prostatic base central portion; 017, prostatic base left border; 018. 019, prostatic base left
posterior border; 020-022, apex anterior; 023, C24, apex left; 025, 026, apex posterior; 027, 028, apex right; 029-042, sections
of the three cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.

The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in black.
Orange ink (05) denotes surfaces which do not represent the true margin of resection. Multiple blocks (031, 032, 036, 037, C41,
