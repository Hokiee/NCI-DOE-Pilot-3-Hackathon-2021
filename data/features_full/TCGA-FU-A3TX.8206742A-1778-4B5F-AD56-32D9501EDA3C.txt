SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPTION

A) SOURCE: Uterus. cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries, radical abdominal
hysterectomy

Received Is a radical hysterectomy specimen measuring 83.9 gm without
attached fallopian tubes and ovaries. It measures 10.5 cm from superior to
inferior, 5.0 cm from cornu to cornu and 2.0 cm In thickness: There is
approximately 2.5 cm of vaginal cuff present. The anterior portion of the
uterus is inked blue and the posterior is inked black. The perimetria is
removed and submitted sequentially from medial to lateral. The specimen
displays pink—tan slightly ragged serosal surfaces. Upon opening the

specimen there is a 4.9 x 3.5 x 2.3 cm exophytic fungating cervical mass.
The mass obscures the ectocervix completely. The vaginal cuff margin is
grossly free of tumor and is submitted en face. The tumor is located 2.4 cm

9 mm. Additionally the tumor appears to involve a portion of the
endocervix. _

The endometrium is tan and glistening and has an average thickness of 0,1

cm. The myometrium is homogeneous pink-tan, has an average thickness of 1.1
cm and is slightly trabeculated. There are no masses or lesions identiﬁed

in the endomyometrium.

The left ovary measures 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm and has a pink-tan smooth
bosselated external appearance. Cut section shows white—tan parenchyma with
no masses or lesions identified. There is a ligated fallopian tube

measuring 1.5 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter with a fimbriated end. On

cut section the tube is patent and stellate throughout.

The right ovary measures 1.3 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. The cut surface shows
yellow-tan parenchyma with multiple small cysts. No masses or lesions are
identified. There is a 1.5 cm segment of fimbriated fallopian tube. The

tube measures 0.4 cm in diameter and displays a stellate patent lumen
throughout.

A gross photograph is taken. Tissue is taken for tumor banking. The
specimen is submitted in 33 cassettes. Summary of cassettes:

16. Right parametrium

7-13. Left parametrium

14. Vaginal cuff from 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock, en face

15. Vaginal cuff 3 o'clock to 6 o'clock, en face

16. Vaginal cuff6 o‘clock to 9 o’clock, en face

17. Vaginal cuff 9 o'clock to 12 o‘clock, en face

18-20. Tumor at deepest point of invasion (anterior-12 o'clock,
submitted in thirds sequentially from vaginal cuff to lower
uterine segment- upper cut edge is inked yellow)

21-23. Tumor at deepest point of invasion (anterior 12-o'clock,
submitted in thirds sequentially from vaginal cuff to lower
uterine segment- upper cut edge is inked yellow)

24-25 Tumor at deepest point of invasion (posterior- 6 o'clock,
submitted sequentially from vaginal cuff to lower uterine
segment bisected~ upper cut edge is inked yellow)

26-27. Tumor at deepest point of invasion (posterior- 6io'clock,
submitted sequentially from vaginal cuff to lower uterine
segment bisected- upper cut edge is inked yellow)

Labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes“ are multiple yellow-tan, ragged fatty
soft tissues aggregating to 5.5 x 4.8 x 2.5 cm. The tissues are searched
for lymph nodes. Six discrete lymph nodes which range from 1.7-4.5 cm in
greatest dimension are identified. The specimen is entirely submitted in 12
cassettes as follows:

81. One lymph node

Labeled "right periaortic lymph nodes“ is a single 1.7 cm tan ragged. fatty
soft tissue. The tissue is examined for lymph nodes, and no discrete nodal
tissue is identiﬁed. The soft tissue is entirely submitted in toto in a

single cassette.

D) SOURCE: Lymph node resection, pelvic, left

Labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes" are multiple yellow-tan, ragged fatty

soft tissues which aggregate to 5 x 3.5 x 2.8 cm. The tissue is searched
for lymph nodes, five lymph nodes which range from 0.7-4 cm in greatest

tissues aggregating to 2.2 cm in greatest dimension. The tissues are
searched for lymph nodes, a single apparent lymph node measuring 1.3 cm in
