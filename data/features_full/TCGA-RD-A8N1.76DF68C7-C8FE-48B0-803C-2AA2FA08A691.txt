MACROSCQPIC DESCRIPTIQN SL212: W2?) 0239”!" ' ' l

Specimen container labelled “gastreatomy”: A proximal gastrectomy
specimen. 75mm along the lesser curvature, 145mm along the greater

curvature. 2?mm in diameter pf the
the distal staple end, together wit

roximal stable end and 45mm of
a lesser omentum lodxllﬂxlﬁmm

as well as a greater omentum 320xl60x20mm.

The gastric cavity has

been cashed previously along the lesser curvature to reveal a large
centre 3y ulcerated edgets raised tumour approximately 55x45mm,
which is located along the reater curvature of the bodﬁ. about 50mm
from the proximal end and 5 mm from the distal end and as on cut
surface infiltrated the full thickness of the gastric wall, showing
maximal tumour thickness oflemm.

Blocks selected: (a« both proximal (large) and distal (smaller)
resection margin, b‘ tumour and the adjacent proximal normal
gastromucosa. c— the tumour and adjacent distal normal astric
mucosa. d- further section of the_tumour show1ng maxima tumour
thickness. e— the non neoplastic gastric mucosa from both lesser
curvature and greater curvature, - all the small lesser curvature
nodes. g.h & 1 ~ gastric lymph node along the reater curvature;

3- probable small lymph node within the omenta fat)

Registrar/Typist:
ICR PIC D£SCRIPTION

Sections of the main tumour mass show a solid structureless tumour
with mass with thin fibrous septa. There is full thickness invasion
of stomach wall into adventitial fat. as the periphery and at
mesastatic sites the tumour shows moderately differentiated
glandular aClnl. do Signet ring cells are seen. The appearance is
oonssstent Wlth an intestinal type tumDUFn

No nodes are seen on the leSSer curve. 18/17 nodes taken from the
greater curve show tumour. Thmour is seen in adventitial fat,
apparrently separate from lymph nodes. Tumour is seen in lymphatics

and is present in lympathics at the distal marginr No tumour is
seen in omentum.

Sections of the gastric mucosa show a severe chronic gastritis. No
