My si station that I have personally reviewed the submitted
material(s) and the final diagnosis reflects that evaluation.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in six parts.

Part 1 is received in formalin and labeled with the patient' s name, initials
xx and "right neck dissection, 2, 3, 4". The specimen is a 12.0 x 4.0 x 5.0
cm selective neck dissection with 4.5 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm submandibular gland.
Multiple lymph nodes up to 1.8 cm are identified. Specimen is submitted as
follows:

1A — level 2 node A

1B — level 2 node B

1C — level 3 node A

1D — level 4 node A

1E — level 4 node B

1F — level 4 node C

1G — level 4 node D

1H — submandibular gland

1I — one level 1 lymph node, bisected

1J — one level 2 lymph node

1K — seven possible level 2 lymph nodes

1L — one level 3 lymph node

1M — nine possible level 3 lymph nodes

1N — seven possible level 4 lymph nodes.

Part 2 is received in formalin labeled with the patient' s name, initials xx
and "right neck dissection 2B". The specimen is a 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm
excision

of fibroadipose tissue with five lymph nodes up to 0.6 cm. Specimen
submitted
as follows:

2A — lymph nodes.
Part 3 is received in formalin labeled with the patient' s name, initials xx
and "left neck level 1". The specimen is a 7.0 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm selective neck

dissection with a 6.0 x 3.5 x 1.8 cm submandibular gland and four lymph nodes
ranging from 0.7 to 1.4 cm. Specimen is submitted as follows:

3A — submandibular gland

3B—3C — two lymph nodes each (one inked black in each cassette).
Part 4 is received in formalin labeled with the patient' s name, initials xx
and "left neck level 2". The specimen is a 3.0 cm excision of fibroadipose
tissue with nine possible lymph nodes up to 2.2 cm (largest grossly
positive).

Sections are submitted as follows:

4A — largest lymph node

4B—4C — four lymph nodes each.
Part 5 is received in formalin labeled with the patient' s name, initials xx
and "left neck level 3, 4". The specimen consists of two pieces of
fibroadipose tissue, 3.5 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm and 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm with nine
lymph

nodes up to 3.1 cm. Sections are submitted as follows:

5A — largest lymph node bisected

5B — four lymph nodes.
Part 6 is received in formalin labeled with the patient' s name, initials xx
and "tongue and mandible". The specimen is a right hemiglossectomy and
anterior/right lateral segmental mandibulectomy specimen, 8.0 cm anterior to
posterior, 7.5 cm dorsal to ventral and 6.5 cm right to left. It consists of

an 11.0 cm segment of mandible with an average diameter of 1.5 cm, 7.0 x 3.0
x

3.0 cm righ tongue with portion of floor of mouth and alveolar ridge mucosa
attached. In addition, is a 6.0 x 5.0 cm piece of skin in the submental
region with a central puckered area.

Centered in the floor of mouth right lateral tongue junction is a 5.0 x 3.5
x

4.0 cm centrally ulcerated tumor extending deep within the muscles of the
base

of tongue and floor of mouth. The tumor nearly encases the adjacent mandible
and appears to grossly invade through the cortex into the marrow space. The
closest extent of tumor to margin is 0.1 cm from the base of tongue soft

tissue. The tumor extends focally into the attached skin segment.

A 0.3 cm lymph node is identified in the base of tongue adipose tissue.
Inking code: green medial, black base of tongue, blue anterior—lateral
alveolar ridge.

Sections are submitted as follows:

6A — base of tongue mucosa (shave) frozen section control

6B — lateral soft tissue (shave) frozen section control

6C — lateral floor of mouth (shave) frozen section control

6D — anterior floor of mouth (shave) frozen section control

6E — deep base of tongue (perpendicular) frozen section control

6F — deep base of tongue (perpendicular) frozen section control

6G — anterior medial shave, frozen section control

6H — posterior medial shave, frozen section control

6I — posterior bony margin, decalcification

6J — anterior bony margin, decalcification

6K — tumor to bone, decalcification

6L — anterior skin shave

6M — left skin shave

6N — posterior skin shave

6O — right skin shave

6P — tumor to skin and lymph node at base of tongue

6Q—6R — tumor to deep tongue and floor of mouth muscle, respectively
6S — tumor to tongue mucosa

6T—6U — cross section of tumor from tongue mucosa to alveolar mucosa,
bisected

tumor to alveolar ridge.

RATIVE CONSULTATION:
6A—6H: RIGHT TONGUE AND MANDIBLE, COMPOSITE RESECTION (frozen sections)
A. MALIGNANT.
B. SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA.
