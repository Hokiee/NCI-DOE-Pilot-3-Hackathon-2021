GROSS DESCRIPTION
1. The specimen is labeled with the patient’s name and as "right neck

zone 4“. It consists of one lymph node measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The
specimen is submitted in toto.
1A specimen bisected and submitted in toto

2. The specimen is labeled with the patient's name and as "tail of right
parotid". It consists of 2 pieces of parotid measuring 2.5 x 2 x 0.8 cm
and 3 x 1.5 x 1 cm. Three lymph nodes are identified ranging in size
from 0.3 to 0.8 cm.

2A parotid gland

28 two lymph nodes

v

3. The specimen is labeled with the patient's name and as "right
mandible”. It consists of a segment of mandible with ramus meaSuring 7.6
AP x 8 SI x 4.5 ML cm. It includes 3 teeth. There is a tumor arising in
the retromolar trigone. The tumor measures 5.5 AP x 4 SI x 4.1 ML cm.
The tumor partially surrounds the first and second molar in both lateral
and medial gingiva, it extends through the retromolar trigone mucosa
posteriorly towards the medial and lateral skeletal muscles tissue. There
is involvement of mandible bone by the tumour. The tumor is located at
0.1 cm from the closest posterior lateral and medial muscle resection
margin. Remaining margins are as follows: anterior gingival resection
margin, 0.7 cm each from the lateral and medial gingiva resection margin,
0.5 cm from the posterior retromolar trigone resection margin, 0.6 cm

4. The specimen is labeled with the patient’s name and as "contents
right neck". It consists of an oriented left neck dissection with
overall dimensions of 9 x 8 x 1.5 cm. The internal jugular vein is not
identified. The sternocleidomastoid is also not present. The
submandibular gland measures 5 x 2 x 2.2cm and is unremarkable. Multiple
lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 to 1.9 x 1.1 x 0.5cm are identified in
multiple levels. Representative sections are submitted.

measuring 1.2 x 1.9 x 1.3 cm, 2 pieces of unremarkable skin the largest
measuring 3.7 x 2.5 x 0.4 cm. and 3 pieces of soft tissue to skeletal

Addendum Comment
Decalcified sections of the mandible confirm invasion of bone by squamous
cell carcinoma. The bone margins are negative for tumor.
