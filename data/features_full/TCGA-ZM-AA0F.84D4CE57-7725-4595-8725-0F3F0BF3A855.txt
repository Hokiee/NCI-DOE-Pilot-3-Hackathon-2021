Pathohistological diagnosis
Seminorna, right testicle

Description:

A testicle with tumor, size 5.5x3.5x3 cm with 10 cm long funiculus was received. At the
surface of the testicle we see 2.5 cm long surgical cut with sutures. At the out we see gray-
white, partially necrotic and bloody tumor 3.9x3x2.5 cm in size.

Histologically, the tumor is made of solid clusters of round and oval bright cells with dark
nuclei and partially emphasized nucleolus. Around tumor cell seats we see connecting tissue

containing abundant lymphocyte inﬁltrations. On numerous locations we see that the tumor
tissue is affected by necrosis and hemorrhaging.

Tumor tissue is not present in rete testis.
Tumor is not present in funiculus.
