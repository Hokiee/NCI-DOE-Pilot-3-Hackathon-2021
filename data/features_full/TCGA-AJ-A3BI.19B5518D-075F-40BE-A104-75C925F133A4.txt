PT! .
A- Received in formalin labeled and #1 right paraaorlic, is a 4.2 x 2.5 x 0.8 cm. irregular ﬁbroadlpose tissue bearing ﬁve irregular tan-
yellow firm tissue consistent with probable lymph node, ranging from 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm to 1.8 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm. The specimen is sectioned and
representative sections are submitted to include the lvmph nodes in their entirety as labeled: 1 - two whole probable lymph nodes; 2-4 ~ one lymph
node bisected in each. The blocks are labeled

B. Received in formalin labeled and #2 laﬂ paraaortic lymph node. is a 2.8 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. irregular ﬁbroadipose tissue bearing a 2.8 x 0.5
x 0,2 cm. irregular, tan-yellow firm tissue consistent with probable lymph node. The specimen is sectioned and submitted in its entirety as labeled: 1 —-
one lymph node. bisected; 2 - adipose tissue; The blocks are labeled

0. Received in formalin labeled . and #3 uterus. cervix. and bilateral tubes and ovaries. is a 114 gm. previously inked and opened
hysterectomy specimen. correlating of a 6.5 x 5.7 x 2.7 an, uterine body and an attached 3.6 x 2.4 x 2.2 cm cervix. The bilateral adnexa are attached to
the cornuz However. the orientation of the specimen is not completely obvious.

The seroea is shaggy and tamed. The ectocervrx is smooth to granular. hemorrhagic and tan. with a 0.6 cm. slit—like es.

The endooervicel canal is granular. tarnred, and 3.1 cm in length. The endometrlal cavity is 3.1 cm from comu to cornu and 4.9 cm in length. There is a
.1 x 3.9 cm polypoid. friable tan-white mass in one half of the andomerrlal cavity. The mass does not appear to extend into the lower uterine segment
The mass does not grossly appear to involve the underlying myometn‘um.

The myometrlum is nabeculated. tan-pink. and ranges in thldrness from 1.3 cm to 1.9 cm. There are two intramural, whorled, gray-white dense nodules
measuring 0.2 cm and 1.3 an in greatest dimension. No areas of hemorrhage or necrosis are identified in the nodules

The 4.2 x 3.2 x 1.7 cm. Ovary has a shaggy, tan«red outer surface. The cut surface is tan-yellow with a gray-white corpora albloans. Attached to the
ovary is a 4.8 x 3.5 x 1.1 cm. portion of shaggy, tan-red to yellow. ﬁbrofatty soft tissue. Within this tissue is a 2.3 x 0.4 cm. possible ﬁrnbrlated fallopian
tube with a shaggy tan-red semen and a pinpoint lumen.

The 4.8 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm, ovary has a shaggy. tan—red outer surface. The cut surface is tan-yellow.

Attached to the ovary is a 1.8 x 0.4 cm, possible limbriated fallopian tube and a 4.3 x 2.1 x 0.5 an, ovoid, tan-pink membranous tissue. The fallopian
tube has a shaggy, tamed serosa with a pinpoint lumen. The cut surface of the membranous tissue consists of a 3.2 cm. smooth—lined cyst containing a
clear serous fluid. No excrescences are identiﬁed.

The specimen is serially sectioned and representative sections are submitted as labeled: 1~2 -— anterior and posterior cervix; 34 - anterior and posterior
lower uterine segment; 5-6 -— full thickness endometrial mass in each; 7-8 -— endometn‘al mass; 9 - smaller endometriar polyp in toto; 10 - larger
endornetrial polyp. entirely submitted; 11 —- uninvolved endornyometrium with serosa; 12 ~ rnyornetrial nodules; 1344 - left and right parametrlum: 15-
17 —- smaller ovary and attached falopian tube; 18 -— larger ovary. 19 - larger ovary and attached fallopian tube; 20 - cystic tissue attached to larger

ovary. The blocks are labeled .lso received in the same container are a yellow. 3 green and a blue cassette labeled for
genomic research study.
D. Received in formalin labeled ' nd #4 right pelvic lymph node. is a 5.2 x 5.5 x 2.1 cm. irregular fibroadipoae tissue bearing ﬁve irregular

tan—yellow ﬁrm tissues consistent with possible lymph node, ranging from 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm to 4.4 x 1.8 x 0.7 cm. The specimen is sectioned and
representative sections are submitted to include the lymph node in their entirety as labeled: 1 - two whole probable lymph nodes: 2 - one lymph node
bisected; M - one lymph node serially sectioned; 7-10 - one lymph node serially sectioned. The blocks are labeled}

E. Received in formalin labeled ld #6 leﬂ pelvic lymph node, is a 6.1 x 5.8 x 2.9 cm, irregular ﬁbroadipose tissue bearing five irregular
tan-yellow ﬁrm tissues consistent with probable lymph node. ranging from 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm. to 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm. The specimen is sectioned and
reprocentatlve sections are submitted to include the lymph nodes in their entirety as labeled: 1-3 - one lymph node bisected in each; 4-5 - one lymph
