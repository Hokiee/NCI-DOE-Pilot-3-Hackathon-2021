COMMENT

The presence of a papillary type 1 renal cell carcinoma along with multiple
papillary adenomas in the patient‘s kidney raises the possibility of a
hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma (HPRC) syndrome. in HPRC
patients, the kidneys demonstrate multiple bilateral renal cell carcinomas,
most with low grade nuclear features. HPRC is caused by germline mutations
in the c~met oncogene, and demonstrates autosomal dominant inheritance,
Further studies and possible genetic counseling could be consideﬁf this

patient is felt to be clinically at risk for thii siiiiiil W“

SPECIMENJGROSS DESCRIPTION

A) SOURCE; Kidney} partial, right kidney mass

Labeled "Rt kidney mass clip on margin" is a 24.1 gram, 5 x 3.5 x 3 cm
portion of kidney with attached perinephric fat. The attached perinephric
tat has a thickness of 2.7 cm. The parenchymal margin is indicated by an
attached silver surgical ciip, The parenchymai margin is inked black. The
nonparenchymal surface with surrounding perinephric fat and possible intact
Gerota‘s fascia is inked blue. The tissue is serially sectioned revealing a
3.6 x 2.8 x 2 cm red-yellow soft to friable focally hemorrhagic mass. The
mass appears to abut the blue inked surface and also appears to extend to
within 0.1432 cm of the black inked parenchymal margin, The uninvolved

 

 

kidney parenchyma is maroon~tan and soft to rubbery.

Representative tissue including closest extension to apparent black inked
parenchyrnai margin is submitted for frozen section diagnosis on one block.

INTRAOPERATIVE PAT N TATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: "Margins free by
1-2 mm." is rendered by

Representative tissue is fr for possible future studies per tumor
banking protocoi perﬁ

Summary of sections:

1. Frozen section

2-12. Central portion of tissue focally with relation to black inked
parenchymal margin and with relation to blue inked surface of
surrounding perinephric fat and possible Gerota's fascia (tissue
in cassettes 7-11 represents tissue adjacent to frozen section
tissue)
