DIAGNOSIS :

Lung, left lower lobe, lobectomy: Invasive grade 4 (of 4) squamous
cell carcinoma forming a 6cm mass in the lower lobe extending through the
pleura to involve mediastinal fat. The margins of resection, including

the bronchial margin, are free of involvement.

Lymph nodes, intrapulmonary peribronchial, excision: Multiple (5 of 6)
lymph nodes are involved by metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.

Lymph nodes, aortic, inferior mediastinal and left fissure, excision:
Multiple inferior mediastinal lymph nodes (1 of 3 subcarinal, 1 of 3
inferior pulmonary ligament) are involved by metastatic squamous cell
carcinoma. Multiple aortic (3 aortopulmonary) lymph nodes as well as a
single left fissure lymph node are negative for tumor.

Lung, left lingula, excision: Lung parenchyma without diagnostic
abnormalities.
