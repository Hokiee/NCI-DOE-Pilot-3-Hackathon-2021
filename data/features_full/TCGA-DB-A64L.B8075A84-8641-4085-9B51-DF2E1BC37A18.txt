A-D. Brain. right frontal mass #l—#4 and CUSA. biopsies: Low-grade oligodendroglioma (WHO grade ll). See

Comment: The tumor shows focal high cellularin and increased proliferative activity [up to 3-4 mitoses per 10
HPF and Ki-67 labeling index (up to 10-15%)] suggesting focal early progression. The ﬁndings are insufﬁcient
for a grade III designation.
