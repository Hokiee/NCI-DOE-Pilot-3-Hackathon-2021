DIAGNOSIS

(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 7 (3+4). (SEE COMMENT)
TUMOR EXTENDING FOCALLY TO THE INKED MARGIN OF RESECTION (LESS THAN 1.0 MM).
Right and left seminal vesicles, no tumor present.
Segments of right and left vasa deferentia, no tumor present.
PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH GRADE

COMMENT

The prostate gland contains a single focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor is located in the right lateral, right postero-
lateral, right posterior, mid posterior, left posterior, left posterolateral, and left lateral peripheral zone. The tumor focus measures
3.5 x 1.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the three cross sections Of the prostate, extensively in the
apex and focally in the base region. In the left posterior surface of the prostate, tumor extends focally (less than 1.0 mm) to the
inked margin Of resection. No extraprostatic tissue is present at the site of the positive margin to evaluate the possible presence Of
extraprostatic extension.

GROSSDESCRIPTION

(C) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting Of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles, and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (5.1 x 4.5 x 5.7 cm, 95 grams, post fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
right posterolateral aspect Of the prostate appears more abundant than along the left side. A palpable nodule is present in the right
posterolateral aspect of the prostate in the mid region. A well circumscribed nodule (3.3 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm) protrudes from the base of
the prostate around the urethra. Serial cross sections after ﬁxation demonstrate a firm area in the right peripheral zone of the
second and third cross sections.

The seminal vesicles and segments Of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

SECTION CODE: C1-C4, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base towards the tip; 85—37,
left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip; CB, C9, median lobe; C10, C11, prostatic base
right border; C12-C14, prostatic base right posterior border; C15-CZ1, prostatic base central portion posterior aspect from right to
left; 022—027, prostatic base central portion, anterior aspect, alternating sections from right to left; C28 - 033, prostatic base left
border; C34, see diagram; C35-037, prostatic base left posterior border; C38-C40, apex anterior; C41, C42, apex left; C43—C45,
apex posterior; C46, C47, apex right; C48, detached portions Of margin Of resection according to specimen radiograph; 049-060,
sections Of the three cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.

The anterior aspect Of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow, and posterior surface in
black. Blue ink (C1, 2, 5, 6, 12, 13, 15-21, 34-36, 43-45) and orange ink (C50, 51, 54-56, 60) denote surfaces which do not
represent the true margin Of resection.
