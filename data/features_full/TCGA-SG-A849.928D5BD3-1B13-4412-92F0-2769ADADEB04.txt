Size
Greatest dimension: 2.7 cm <::3¢AH) [(5/0 7/] Es
Additional two dimensions: 2.5 x 2.0 cm
Histologic type: Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with myogenic
differentiation.
Mitotic rate (per 10 HPFs): 26
Necrosis present (approximately 30%)
Pre—treatment: none
Margins: The anterior margin is focally positive for tumor Other margins
are negative for tumor; the closest uninvolved margin is the deep margin
(0. 4 cm)
Lymph nodes
Number examined: 0

Slide A3 containing the anterior margin was compared to the paraffin block

for A3 to confirm that the edae of the tissue seen on the slide is in fact

the surgical margin has reviewed the anterior margin
and agrees with the interpretation that it is positive for tumor

SPECIMEN SUBMITTED
A: MASS RIGHT ANTERIOR ARM SARCOMA

CLINICAL DATA
MASS RIGHT UPPER ARM
LONG STITCH- PROXIMAL, SHORT STITCH- POSTERIOR, CHECK FOR MARGINS

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. Received fresh labeled "mass right anterior arm sarcoma" is a 7.5 x 5.5
x 2.5 cm piece of soft tissue and overlying skin measuring 6.8 x 5.9 cm. It
was received oriented with long stitch—proximal and short stitch-
posterior. The deep surface is smooth, glistening with smooth skeletal
muscle attached. The skin is grossly normal, but has firm protruding areas.
There is a 2.7 x 2.5 x 2 cm mass. It is tan—white and well-demarcated from
surrounding tissue. It is grossly free of all margins. It contains some
areas of hemorrhage and one possible small, pinpoint area of necrosis. The
distances from margins are as follows: Proximal 1.3 cm, distal 1 cm,
anterior 1.5 cm, posterior 1.2 cm, deep 0.4 cm. Two photographs were taken
of the mass. Tumor was given to tissue procurement and also sent for
cytogenetics. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1 distal
margin, perpendicular A2 proximal margin, perpendicular A3 anterior margin
and tumor, perpendicular A4 posterior margin and tumor, perpendicular A5
deep margin and tumor, perpendicular A6 tumor with possible area of
necrosis, A7—A8 tumor with hemorrhagic areas.
