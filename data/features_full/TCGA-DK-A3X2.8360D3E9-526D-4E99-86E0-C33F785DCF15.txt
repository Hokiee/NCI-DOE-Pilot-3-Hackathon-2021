Gross Description:

1) Received fresh labeled “right ureter” is a 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm yellow tan soft tissue fragment. It is entirely submitted in one
cassette.

Summary of sections:
FSC - frozen section control

2). Received fresh labeled ”left ureter” is a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm yellow tan soft tissue fragment. It is entirely submitted in one
cassette.

Summary of sections:
FSC — frozen section control

3) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation labeled "Left pelvic lymph nodes." It consists of a segment of
yellow-tan adipose tissue measuring 6 x 2 x 1.5 cm. On cut section, there are multiple lymph nodes identiﬁed measuring up to 2 x
1.8 cm in greatest dimensions. On cut section of the largest lymph node, it shows inﬁltration by gritty white-tan tumor.
Representative section is submitted for frozen section consultation. Representative section of the positive lymph node is submitted
to TPS. Remaining lymph nodes are entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:

FSC — frozen section control

PN- additional sections of positive node
LN-lymph nodes

4). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right common iliac lymph nodes" and consists of a single lymph node measuring 3.5 x
1.5 x 0.7cm. The lymph node is bisected and entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
LN - lymph node

5) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right pelvic lymph nodes" and consists of multiple pink tan ﬁrm lymph nodes ranging
from 0.2 x 0.2 cm up to 6 x 1 cm in greatest dimension. All identiﬁed lymph nodes are submitted.

Summary of sections:

LN - lymph nodes

BLN - bisected lymph nodes
LLN-largest lymph node

6) The specimen is received fresh. labeled "Presacral lymph node" and consists of two fatty yellow-tan lymph nodes measuring 1.8
x 1.7 cm in greatest dimensions. All identiﬁed lymph nodes are submitted.

Summary of sections:
LLN - largest lymph node
BLN - bisected lymph nodes

7) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Left common iliac lymph nodes" and consists of a single lymph node measuring 0.8 x
0.7 x 0.3 cm. The lymph node is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
LN - lymph node

8) The specimen is received fresh. labeled "Bladder, prostate and seminal vesicles". It consists of a bladder, prostate and seminal
vesicles measuring 8.7 cm from superior to inferior, 10 cm laterally and 8.5 cm from anterior to posterior. The bladder measures
8.5 x 8 x 6 cm, the prostate measures 5 x 5 x 4.5 cm, the right seminal vesicle measures 2 x 1 x 0.7 cm, the right vas deferens
measures 1.2 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter, the left seminal vesicle measures 2.1 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm. and the left vas deferens
measures 1 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. The anterior aspect of the bladder is inked blue and the posterior black The right
lobe of the prostate is inked green, the left lobe of prostate is inked blue. The prostatic urethral margin is shaved and submitted.
The bladder is opened along the anterior midline to reveal ill deﬁned papillary/polypoid mass measuring 7 x 6 cm which is grossly
involves the entire left side of the bladder and encasing the left ureteral oriﬁce and 2.2 cm from the right ureteral oriﬁce. Both
ureters are probe patent. The right ureter measures to 0.3 cm in maximum diameter. The left ureter is dilated and measures up to
1.5 cm in circumference. The lesion is sectioned to reveal full thickness involvement of the bladder wall ( 2.8 cm ). The extension
to the inked fat is grossly identiﬁed. The remaining bladder mucosa has an irregular appearance with scattered 0.2 to 0.3 cm in
diameter polyps throughout the entire bladder mucosal surface. Four perivesical lymph nodes are grossly identiﬁed. The
prostate is serially sectioned to reveal nodular appearance. Representative sections are submitted. The specimen is photographed.
, is submitted. Gross photos were taken.
