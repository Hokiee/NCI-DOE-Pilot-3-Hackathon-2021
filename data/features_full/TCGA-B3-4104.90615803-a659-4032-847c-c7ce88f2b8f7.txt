SPECIMEN
Right kidney, right ureter, bladder cuff

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Right renal mass

GROSS DESCRIPTION

Received fresh for tissue procurement labeled “right

kidney, ureter and bladder cuff" is a 513 gram, 11.5 x 7.0
x 4.0 cm. right kidney with attached, probe patent, 20 cm. ureter
measuring up to 0.8 cm. in diameter with a scant amount of apparent
bladder wall at the distal end (see distal margin block 1). A
moderate amount of perirenal adipose tissue is present. No adrenal
gland is identified superiorly. The renal capsule is delicate and
strips with relative ease from the underlying cortical surface. On
opening, the pelvis is dilated, granular tan pink—red and contains

a
superiorly located, 4.0 x 3.5 cm. papillary white pink lesion. A
portion of tumor and a portion of normal parenchyma are submitted
for tissue procurement as requested. On sectioning, the tumor has

a

maximal thickness of 2 cm. and is within 0.9 cm. of the anterior
inked capsular surface. No vascular invasion is identified
grossly.
The parenchyma is uniform red—brown with multiple cortical cysts, a
well-defined corticomedullary junction and a maximal cortical
thickness of 1.3 cm. The ureter is received with a stent in place
and on opening the mucosa ranges from smooth and unremarkable white
pink to slightly bosselated tan pinkhred. No discrete mass lesion
is identified. Representative sections are submitted in 15 blocks
as labeled. RS—lS.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 - Vascular and ureteral margins; 2—5 — renal
pelvis tumor including inked capsular surface; 6, 7 ~ additional
sections of tumor to adjacent parenchyma; 8, 9 — random pelvis;
10~12 — random parenchyma including cortical cysts; 13 ~ proximal
ureter; 14 ~ mid ureter; 15 — distal ureter.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Histologic type: Papillary urothelial cell carcinoma.
Histologic grade: High grade.
Associated epithelial lesions:
Primary tumor (pT): Tumor has invaded through the muscularis
propria of the

renal pelvis (pT2).
Margins of resection: Distal ureteral margin of resection free of
tumor.
Regional lymph nodes (pN): Cannot be assessed (pNX).
Distant metastasis (pM): Cannot be assessed (pMX).
Vascular invasion: Negative.
Other findings: Benign cortical cysts. Arteriolar
nephrosclerosis.

DIAGNOSIS

Kidney, right nephroureterectomy:
High grade papillary urothelial cell carcinoma of the renal

pelvis

extending through the muscularis propria of the pelvis.
Distal ureteral margin of resection is free of tumor.
Associated carcinoma in situ.

Benign cortical cysts.

Arteriolar nephrosclerosis.
