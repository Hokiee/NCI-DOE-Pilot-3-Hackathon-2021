differentiated liposarcoma.

- Tumor measures at least 8.0 cm in greatest dimension.

~ Dedifferentiated component constitutes 30% of tumor and is a high
grade pleomorphic sarcoma.

~ Well differentiated liposarcoma, lipoma-like and sclerosing type,
involving spermatic cord.

~ Tumor envelope the external iliac vessels.

— Tumor extends to superior, anterior, medial and lateral margins of
resection.

~ External iliac artery and vein encased by liposarcoma

- Three benign lymph nodes (0/3).

~ unremarkable testis.

2. Final left external iliac artery margin, biopsy:
~ Well-differentiated liposarcoma, with cautery artifact.

Note: Previous biopsy material was reviewed.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED

Gross Description:

The specimen is received in formalin and subsequently placed in formalin
labelled "Radical resection of the left pelvic mass, left testicle,
spermatic cord, left external iliac artery and vein and left psoas' and
consists of a soft tissue mass measuring in toto 15 x 11 x 9 cm. The
specimen is oriented using anatomic landmarks. There is a spermatic cord
present measuring 22 cm in length and 2 cm in diameter. The tunica
vaginalis is opened to reveal the testes (4.5 x 3.5 2 cm) and epididymis (4
x 0.8 x 0.8). The specimen is inked as follows: anterior—black,
posterior-blue, lateral-green, medial-yellow, superior—orange and
inferior-red. The spermatic cord and testicular tunics (external aspect)
are inked black. The specimen is incised to reveal an 8 x 6.5 x 6.4 firm
yellow soft tissue mass which encases the iliac artery and vein at the
periphery. The tumor is 0.5 cm from the superior margin. The testis is
incised to reveal normal, stringy testicular parenchyma. Incision of the
spermatic cord approximately 15 cm proximal to the testis shows small tumor
nodules measuring 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. Tumor is submitted for TPS.
Pictures are obtained. Representative sections are submitted for permanent
section.

Summary of sections:
AM—anterior margin
PM-posterior margin
SM—superior margin with main tumor mass
IM-inferior margin
LM-lateral margin

MM-medial margin

T-main tumor

ST-distal spermatic cord
SC-proximal spermatic cord
TE—testis

vs-iliac vessels and sarcoma
C—cystic area

S—skin

2) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Final left external iliac
artery margin'. and consists of a 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm fragment of tan soft
tissue. The stitch area is inked black. The specimen is bisected and
entirely submitted.
