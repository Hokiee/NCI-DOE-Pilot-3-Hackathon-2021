D REPOR *****
PATH #:
— Metastatic endometrioid carcinoma in the largest node with extension into perinodal soft

tissue
- Three smaller lymph nodes, no tumor seen

M. RENAL NODE:
- Lymph node, no tumor present

N. RIGHT RENAL NODE:
- Metastatic endometrioid carcinoma in lymph node with extension into perinodal soft
tissue

0. OMENTUM:
- Adipose tissue, no tumor seen

P. RIGHT COLON, DISTAL ILEUM:
- Tubular adenoma in right colon
- Eighteen lymph nodes, no tumor seen

COMMENT: The endometrioid carcinoma is a grade 3 tumor in the endometrium. Some of the
metastases in the lymph nodes appear to be grade 2; however, it is difficult to grade the tumor
because there is extensive squamous metaplasia in the primary tumor as well as in the metastases
and there are clear cell changes.

Consultant: Dr. I reviewed the sections from the appendix.

HISTORY: Endometrial cancer

 

MICROSCOPIC:
See diagnosis.

D REPO *****

Labeled with the patient's name, labeled "uterus and cervix", and received fresh for gross consultation and
subsequently ﬁxed in formalin is a total hysterectomy specimen weighing 340 grams. The uterus is symmetric in
shape. The uterus measures 12.0 cm from the fundus to the ectocervix, 7.0 cm from comu to cornu, and a
maximum of 6.0 cm from the anterior surface to the posterior surface. The serosal surfaces are pink-tan and
smooth. The parauterine and paracervical soft tissues are inked black. The cervix is 3.7 cm in length and up to 4.0
cm in diameter in the ectocervical region. The ectocervix is gray—white and smooth with focal pinpoint hemorrhage.
The external cervical os is 0.8 cm in length and ovoid. The specimen has been previously incised along both sides.
The endocervical canal is 2.5 cm in length and lined by pink-tan rugose mucosa. The transformation zone is
distinct. One soft sessile polypoid lesion is note don the posterior surface of the lower uterine segment measuring
0.7 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The polyp is 2.0 cm superior to the transformation zone. Sectioning of the cervix reveals no
gross abnormalities. No vaginal cuff is present. The endometrial cavity is 6.5 cm in length and up to 7.0 cm in
width. Within the uterus is a friable, polypoid pink-tan tumor mass that measures 10.7 x 9.5 cm in total surface area
and involves the anterior and posterior corpus and fundus as well as possible extension into the lower uterine
segment on the posterior aspect. The ex0phytic portions of the tumor have a maximum thickness of 2.0 cm. The
uterus has been previously sectioned revealing invasion of the wall to approximately 50% depth. No normal-
appearing endometrial lining is identiﬁed except in the lower uterine segment, where the thickness ranges from 0.2
to 0.3 cm. The muscular uterine wall has a maximum thickness of 2.9 cm. The uninvolved myometrium is pink-tan
and ﬁrm. Four well-circumscribed intramural leiomyomas are identiﬁed measuring 2.0 to 3.7 cm in greatest
dimension. The cut surfaces of each leiomyoma are gray-white ﬁrm and whorled without gross evidence of
hemorrhage, necrosis or calciﬁcation. The parametrial and paracervical soft tissues appear grossly free of tumor.
Representative sections are submitted.
