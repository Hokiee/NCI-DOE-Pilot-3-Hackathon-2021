CLINICAL DETAILS

choroidal melanoma.
Tumour size: 13.7 x 15 (4.4)mm.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

A fresh, intact left globe.
Dimensions: Axial 22.5mm, Horizontal 24mm, Vertical 24mm
Cornea: Horizontal 11.5mm. Vertical llmm

Optic nerve
Length 3.5mm, Diameter 4mm

Pupil: regular
Angle: normal

on trans— —illumination, a large shadow approximately 13. 5mm
in diameter is seen extending between the optic nerve and
just anterior to the equator.

Plane of section: oblique

Intraoculer description.
0n opening, a solitary dome shaped choroidal pigmented mass
is seen - 1mm of the optic disc.

Tumour size
LED 15mm, Height 4.7mm

MICROSCOPY

Sections show a variably pigmented choroidal melanoma of
mixed cell type in which the epithelioid cells amount up to
60%. Focal peripheral area of the tumour shows clear cell
changes / balloon type of cells. Tumour cells express
Melan-A and REP 27 (score 2).

The number of mitosis is small, approximately 2/40 high

power fields. The microvasculature of the melanoma is

prominent, and closed loops are present in the planes of

sections. The lymphocytio infiltrate within the tumour is

minimal. Scattered macrophages are present. Tumour necrosis

is not seen. Bruch's membrane appears breached in the

sections examined. There is minimal tumour extension into

the sclera. No tumour is seen in sections of optic nerve or

vortex veins examined. Tumour cells are not seen at the _ ;e;::£tcg
resection margins.

i
Elsewhere, the cornea shows no significant abnormality. The ,
anterior chamber angles are open and the anterior chamber is 1
shallow. The iris shows no significant abnormality but the I
ciliary body appears atrophic with hyalinisation of ciliary --m~{
processes. The lens shows subcapsular degenerative changes. ‘
Retina overlying the tumour is slightly atrophic.

Left eye, enucleation: Choroidal melanoma of mixed cell
type.

COMMENT

MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS

In the meantime, molecular genetic analysis of tumour DNA
extracted from the fresh uveal melanoma tissue was performed
using the technique termed multiplex ligation-dependent
probe amplification (MLPA) . These investigations were
performed in the ’ ‘ '

The kit P027 from , , which examines for gains or
losses in 31 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8, was used.
The DNA concentration was measured using ' . and the

quality assessed using multiplex—POI! prior to the MLPA
reaction.

The DNA concentration was high and of good quality on
assessment. The MLPA reaction was run at least twice on
differing occasions, resulting in similar results.

The results of the sequence analysis of the MLPA products is
printed on a separate report. In summary, sequence analysis
demonstrated :

loss of chromosome 1p,
monosomy 3,

partial losses of chromosome 6
and gains in chromosome Bq.

These molecular data require correlation with the clinical
and morphological data for metastatic risk assessment.
