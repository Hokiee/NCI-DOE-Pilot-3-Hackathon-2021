FINAL DIAGNOSIS

1. Thymoma, excision (A) — Thymic epithelial neoplasm with features of thymic carcinoma and thymoma (see
comment).

2. Superior mediastinal lymph node, excision (B) - Lymph node; negative for neoplasm.

3. Left sided thymus, excision (C) - Thymic tissue with no signiﬁcant pathologic changes.

COMMENT

1. The tumor is composed of a predominantly epithelial thymic proliferation consisting of nests and sheets of
polygonal cells with round nuclei with vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli, separated by prominent lymphoid
stroma. The cells show marked nuclear atypia in some areas as well as numerous mitotic figures. The tumor is
arranged in Iobules separated by ﬁbrous trabeculae; however there are patchy foci of dense hyalinizing ﬁbrosis
separating small irregular nests. Prominent lymphoplasmacytic inﬁltrates and lymphovascular invasion are also
present. These features are in favor of thymic carcinoma. The tumor invades through the capsule. The tumor

measures 5.5 x 3.5 x 2.2 cm. The tumor approaches the surgical margin in some foci, but it is surrounded entirely by
a thin layer of ﬁbrous tissue (less than 0.1 cm).

Selected slides from this case have been sent to His
diagnosis reads as follows:

“Thymic epithelial neoplasm, favor thymic carcinoma, 5.5 cm in greatest dimension. Tumor focally invades into the
capsule". “lmmunohistochemical stain performed and the results show the tumor cels are
strongly positive for CD5. Ki—67 stain highlights approximately 20% of the cells."

THYMOMA

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. Received fresh for frozen diagnosis labeled "thymoma" is a right thymus weighing 60.1 grams and measuring 9.5 x
4.5 x 3.5 cm. The resection surface is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a tan mass with cystic
areas that has yellow fluid in it. The mass measures 5.5 x 3.5 x 2.2 cm. No areas of necrosis are identiﬁed. No areas
of hemorrhage are identified. The mass appears to be grossly well circumscribed. The specimen is submitted as
follows: FSA1 frozen diagnosis; A2 closest margins with ink; A3 closest margin with ink; A4 closest margin with ink;
A5-A7 closest margins, no ink; A8-A25 remainder of the specimen submitted superior to inferior.

B. Received fresh is a tan-pink nodule resembling a lymph node measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. Totally submitted in
one cassette.

C. Received in formalin is a tan-yellow segment of fibroadipose tissue labeled "left sided thymus" measuring 5.5 x 3.7
x 1.1 cm, and weighing 12.9 grams. The external surface is inked in black. The specimen is sectioned to reveal a tan-
yellcw lobulated cut surface. Representative sections are submitted in three cassettes.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULT DIAGNOSIS
A. Thymoma. Margins are negative (gross examination with representative microscopic sections)
