Uterus, right ovary (2.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm) with 7.0 cm
segment of

right fallopian tube, and left ovary (2.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm)
with 5.0

cm segment of left fallopian tube together weighing 205.0
grams;

tissue from the omentum (biopsy, 1.3 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm);
separately

submitted portion of omentum (34.0 x 24.0 x 2.0 cm); right
and left

pelvic lymph nodes; right and left para—aortic lymph nodes
above and

below the inferior mesenteric artery; right gonadal
vessels (4.5 cm

in length); left gonadal vessels (6.0 cm in length); and
staging

biopsies [right colic gutter, right pelvic sidewall, right
diaphragm, cul de sac, left colic gutter, left pelvic
sidewall,

small bowel serosa, large bowel serosa, bladder
peritoneum, small

bowel mesentery, and large bowel mesentery (all ranging in
size from

0.2 cm to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension)].

DIAGNOSIS:

Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes; radical
hysterectomy

and bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy: FIGO grade III (of
III) serous

carcinoma is identified involving an endometrial polyp
(4.0 x 3.0 x

3.0 cm) in the upper endometrial cavity. There is a
submucosal

leiomyoma in the lower uterine segment. The surface
endometrium is

UUID: 5D25FDOB- EEES- 435C- 82(7- BCMBO758A1e4d
TCGA- D1- A2G7- 61A- PR

diffusely involved by serous carcinoma. Random sections
of the

endometrium show a mixture of serous carcinoma and FIGO
grade I (of

III) endometrioid carcinoma. There is focal superficial
invasion

(0.2 cm, total wall thickness, 2.5 cm). There is no
lymphovascular

space involvement. The endocervix is uninvolved. The
cervix is

unremarkable. There is a 1.5 cm simple cyst in the left
ovary. The

right ovary is atrophic. The fallopian tubes are
atrophic.

Omentum, biopsy: Negative for tumor.
Omentum, omentectomy: Negative for tumor.

Lymph nodes, right pelvic, excision: Multiple right
pelvic lymph

nodes (12 external iliac, 1 internal iliac, 6 common
iliac, 8

obturator) are negative for tumor.

Lymph nodes, left pelvic, excision: Multiple left pelvic
lymph

nodes (7 external iliac, 1 internal iliac, 4 common iliac,
10

obturator) are negative for tumor.

Lymph nodes, right and left para-aortic above and below
the inferior

mesenteric artery, lymphadenectomies: Multiple para-
aortic lymph

nodes above the inferior mesenteric artery (3 right, 7
left) are

negative for tumor. Multiple para—aortic lymph nodes
below the

inferior mesenteric artery (6 right, 7 left) are negative
for tumor.

Gonadal vessels, left and right, excision: The left and
right
gonadal vessels are negative for tumor.

Soft tissue; right colic gutter, right pelvic sidewall,
right

diaphragm, cul de sac, left colic gutter, left pelvic
sidewall,

small bowel serosa, large bowel serosa, bladder
peritoneum, small

bowel mesentery, and large bowel mesentery; staging
biopsies:

Negative for tumor, all sites.
