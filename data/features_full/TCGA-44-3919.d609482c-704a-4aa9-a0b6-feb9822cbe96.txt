CGA-44—3919

 

SPECIMEN
A. Right upper lobe of the lung
B. Level 10 lymph node
C. Right lymph node
D. Right lobe of lung
E. Level 7

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Lung lesion.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS
AFS: Lung, right upper lobe, wedge biopsy — Adenocarcinoma. -

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Received is a container labeled with the patient's
name, medical record number and "wedge resection right
upper lobe of the lung”. The specimen consists of a wedge—shaped
fragment of tissue, measuring 6.5 x 4 x 3.5 cm. Green ink is
applied to the pleural surface. The specimen is sectioned and is
found to contain a 2.5 cm spongy tan nodule which'extends to the
stapled margin of resection. A portion of the specimen is
submitted
for tissue procurement. Additionally, frozen section is performed.
All tissue minus the staple line is submitted in blocks AFS, A},
A2.
B. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin,
labeled
"level 10 lymph node" are multiple black—red irregular
rubbery tissue fragments which have an aggregate measurement of 2 x
l x 0.7 cm. Specimens are entirely submitted in one cassette.
AS—l.
C. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin,
labeled
"R4 lymph node" is a 3.2 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm pink—red irregular
soft friable tissue fragment. The specimen is friable. Also
received in the same container is a 1.2 cm pink—black irregular

 

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION
soft tissue fragment. The specimen is entirely submitted as
follows. Blocks lh3 — largest tissue fragment sectioned; block 4 —
smaller tissue fragment. ASH4.
D. Received fresh, subsequently fixed and inflated with
formalin, labeled "right lobe of lung." The specimen
consists of a 14 x 10.5 x 5 cm lobe of lung. The specimen shows
multiple staple lines throughout. Possible black softened hilar
lymph nodes are grossly identified. The specimen shows a
Violaceous
smooth glistening pleura. There are multiple staple lines present
located near the hilum and antihilar. Staple antihilar is removed
to show a 3.5 x 2 cm scabrous irregular focus. This focus is inked
blue and comes within 4 cm from the hilum. Cut surface of this
area
shows possible tumor present measuring 1.2 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm. This
grossly involves the staple line. No other discrete gross lesions
are identified throughout the remainder of the specimen which shows
a red spongy cut surface. Representative sections of the specimen
are submitted as follows: Block 1 _ bronchial and vascular
margins;
block 2 — possible hilar lymphoid tissue; block 3 — representative
section of possible tumor at staple line (RShS). -
E. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin,
labeled
"E. Level 7" is a 1.7 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm black—pink irregular
soft friable tissue fragment. The specimen is bisected and
entirely
submitted in one cassette. AS—l. -

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
A. The following template applies to the wedge resection
of lung:
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma
Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated
Primary tumor (pT): 2.5 cm. {pTl)

 

 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Margins of resection: Negative on the lobectomy specimen, specimen
D.
Venous (large vessel} invasion: Not identified.
Arterial {large vessel) invasion: Not identified.
Lymphatic (small vessel) invasion: Not identified.
Regional lymph nodes (pN): Negative as described below {pNO}
Distant metastasis (pM): Could not be evaluated by the specimen.
Other findings: None.

B. The level 10 lymph nodes demonstrate no evidence of
metastasis in six lymph nodes.

C. The Rw4 lymph nodes demonstrate no evidence of
metastasis in 12 lymph nodes.

D. The right lobe of the lung demonstrates residual
adenocarcinoma, 1.5 cm. located at the staple line. Due
to
the orientation of the carcinoma adjacent to the staple line in the
wedge resection, this likely represents one edge of the tumor and
thus should not be added to the main tumor size. The margins of
resection are uninvolved. There is no evidence of metastasis in
six
lymph nodes.
E. There is no metastasis in three level 7 lymph nodes.

3x3, 4x2, 14

DIAGNOSIS
A. Lung, right upper lobe, wedge resection:
Adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, 2.5 cm., extending
to the staple line.
B. Level 10 lymph nodes, resection:
No evidence of metastasis in six lymph nodes (0/6).

DIAGNOSIS

C. Level R~4 lymph nodes, resection:
No evidence of metastasis in twelve lymph nodes (0/12).

D. Lung, right lobe, lobectomy:
Adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, 1.5 cm. at staple
line.
No evidence of metastasis in 6 lymph nodes (0/6).

E. Level 7 lymph node, resection:
No evidence of metastasis in three lymph nodes (0/3).
