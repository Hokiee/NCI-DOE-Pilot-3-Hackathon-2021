Tissue‘s) Submitted:

1: LEFT BREAST MASTECTOMY SUTURE MARKS SHORT SUPERIOR AND LONG LATERAL
2: RIGHT BREAST MASTECTOMY SUTURE MARKS SHORT SUPERIOR LONG LATERAL

3: RIGHT AXILLARY CONTENTS

Gross Description:

Specimen #1 is received fresh labeled left breast mastectomy suture marks short superior and long lateral and consists of a 719
gram, 19 x 17 x 4 cm left total mastectomy specimen with two attached sutures, the short designating superior and the long
designating lateral. There is a 13 x 4.5 cm elliptical portion of white skin on the anterior aspect displaying a 1 x 1 x 0.3 cm everted
nipple. No skin lesions are appreciated. The posterior margin is intact. The specimen is inked as follows:

Superior—anterior- blue
lnferior-anterior— green
Posterior- black.

The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal two indurated foci within the fibrous tissue. one located retroareolar located
approximately 3 cm deep to the nipple. The retroareolar nodule measures approximately 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm and is 2 cm from the
anterior margin and 6.5 cm from the deep margin. Approximately 3 cm lateral to the aforementioned nodule is an additional 0.5 x
0.4 x 0.4 cm ill-defined tan rubbery to indurated nodule located at the junction of the lower outer and upper outer quadrant. 3 cm
from the deep margin and 4.5 cm from the nearest anterior inferior margin. The remaining cut surface consists of approximately
75% yellow lobulated adipose tissue and 25% scattered white rubbery micronodular fibrous tissue. Representative sections are
submitted as follows:

1A—1 B: retroareolar indurated nodule (no margins)

10: closest anterior and posterior margins to retroareolar nodule
1 D: skin overlying retroareolar nodule

1 E: nipple

1F-1G: lateral nodule (no margins)

1H: posterior and nearest anterior margin to lateral nodule

1 I: upper outer quadrant

1.]: upper inner quadrant

1K: lower outer quadrant

1 L: lower outer quadrant.

Please note all representative quadrant sections contain no margins.
Time in formalin: . submitted same day.

Specimen #2 is received fresh labeled right breast mastectomy suture marks short superior long lateral and consists of an 833
gram, 23 x 18 x 4 cm right total mastectomy specimen with two attached sutures, short designating superior and the long
designating lateral. There is an 11.5 x 4.2 cm white elliptical portion of skin on the anterior aspect. which displays a 1 x 1 x 0.5 cm
everted nipple. There is a 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm raised tan-white nodule located on the skin at 4 o'clock, 0.8 cm from the 4 o'clock
margin. The posterior margin is intact. The specimen is inked as follows:

Superior-anterior- blue
Inferior-anterior- green
Posterior- black.

The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 3 x 2.8 x 2.0 cm ill—defined markedly indurated tan-white irregular mass located
predominantly in the upper inner quadrant and extending retroareolar. The mass is located 4 cm from the distal margin and 2.2 cm
from the overlying skin. The specimen is radiographed and two clips are identified located in contiguous slices. Palpably the two
clips are present within the same mass. The mass is located within 1.1 cm of the nearest anterior margin. The remaining breast
parenchyma consists of approximately 75% yellow lobulated adipose tissue and 25% scattered white rubbery nodular fibrous
tissue. No additional masses are identified. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

2A-ZD: representative sections of mass, one section per contiguous slices to include both areas surrounding clips
2E: representative deep margin and mass
2F-ZG: mass to nearest anterior margin

2H: nipple and skin nodule to closest margin (green 4 o'clock margin)
2i: upper outer quadrant
2J: lower cuter quadrant

2K: lower inner quadrant
2L: upper inner quadrant.
Time in formalin: submitted same day.

Specimen #3 is received in formalin labeled right axillary content and consists of a 10 x 7 x 3 cm aggregate of fat in which multiple
lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.1 cm to 2.3 cm in greatest dimension. Some of the larger lymph nodes are sectioned to
reveal white and focally firm cut surfaces possibly consistent with tumor. The lymph nodes are submitted in its entirety with the
exception of the largest grossly polypoid lymph node as follows:

3A: five lymph nodes

SB: six lymph nodes

30-36: each cassette contains one lymph node bisected
3H-3J: one lymph node trisected

 
 
     

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3K: representative section of largest grossly positive lymph node
3L: one lymph node bisected.
