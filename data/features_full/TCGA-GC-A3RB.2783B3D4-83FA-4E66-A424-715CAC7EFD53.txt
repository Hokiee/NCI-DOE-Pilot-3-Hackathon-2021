CLINICAL INFORMATION
Bladder cancer

SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPTION

A) SOURCE; Bladder and prostate

The specimen is received fresh labeled "bladder and prostate." It consists
of an 8 x 7.5 x 5 cm bladder There is 3 cm of attached right ureter. The
ureter appears dilated with a diameter of 0.6 cm. It is obstructed. The
ureteral margin (not a true margin) is sectioned and submitted en face.
There Is 6 cm of attached left ureter. This ureter is patent and measures
0.4 cm in diameter. The ureteral (not a true margin) is sectioned and
submitted en face. The attached prostate measures 4 (r-l) x 2.9
(anterior-posterior) x 2.6 (apex-base) cm. The right seminal vesicle
measures 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The left seminal vesicle measures 2 x 1 x 0.7 cm.
The right vas deferens measures 8 cm in length and up to 0.4 cm in
diameter. The left vas deferens measures 5 cm in length and up to 0.2 cm in
diameter. The right half of the specimen is inked green, the left half

iinked blue and the posteriorraspect inked black.

The distal urethral margin is sectioned in a radial fashion and entirely
submitted for frozen labeled F81 and F82.

INTRAOPERATIVE PAT OLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: "Urethral margin
negative" is rendered by

The specimen is opened along the anterior aspect. There is a 7 x 4.1 x 1 cm
partially endophytic, partially exophytic mass. The mass is found within

the trigone and extends up to a portion of the posterior wall, right

lateral wall and right aspect of the anterior wall. It extends to within

1.5 cm of the distal urethral margins. It appears to obstruct the right

ureteral oriﬁce. It is found 1.3 cm from the left ureteral orifice. A
representative section of the tumor is sectioned and frozen for possible
ancillary studies. It Is sectioned. It extends into the bladder wall for a
maximum depth of 2.1 cm. The bladder wall measures 2.2 cm and the tumor
extends to within 0.1 cm of the right lateral soft tissue margin. The cut
surface is tan and firm.

The remaining urothelium is moderately hyperemic and coarsely wrinkled. No
additional lesions are noted.

The prostate is serially sectioned. The cut surfaces are mottled tan-pink.

No obvious tumor is appreciated. The seminal vesicles are sectioned and are
grossly unremarkable. The vasa deferentia are sectioned revealing pinpoint
unremarkable Iumina.

A gross photo is taken.

There are no palpable lymph nodes in the attached fat.

Representative sections are submitted in 29 cassettes labeled:

1-2. Frozen section residue, distal urethral margin, sectioned in a
radial fashion

section, seminal vesicle)

18-22. Left prostate. apex to base (cassette 22 includes longitudinal
sections, seminal vesicle)

23. Vasa deferentia margins, en face

The remainder of the apparent prostate is submitted as follows:

24-25. Portion of right prostate

26. Portion of possible right prostate and bladder tumor

27. Portion of possible right prostate and bladder tumor

28. Portion of left prostate

29. Portion of possible left prostate (Includes portion of bladder
and tumor)

8) SOURCE: Distal right ureter

Labeled "right distal ureter" is a 0.6 cm in length cylindrical portion of
tissue measuring 0.8 cm in diameter. It is submitted as received in one
chuck for frozen section diagnosis.

INTRAOPER PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: "Negative" is
rendered by

C) SOURCE: Left distal ureter

Labeled "left distal ureter“ Is a tan-pink cylindrical 0.6 cm in length x
0.6 cm in diameter portion of tissue. It is entirely submitted on

for frozen section diagnosis.

INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: "Negative" is

rendered by—

D) SOURCE: Lymph nodes, right pelvic

Labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes" are several yellow—tan ragged fatty
tissues aggregating 5 x 4 x 1 cm. Five lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging
from 0.4-2.8 cm in greatest dimension. The nodes are submitted in four
cassettes as follows:

1. Three nodes

2. One node

3.4. One node

E) SOURCE: Lymph nodes, left pelvic

Labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes” is a 3 x 2 x 2 cm portion of yellow-tan
ragged fatty tissue. Four lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging from 0.9-3.5
cm in greatest dimension. The nodes are submitted in ﬁve cassettes as
follows:

1. One node

2-3. One node

4. One node

—

5. One node

F) SOURCE: Appendix

Labeled "appendix" is an intact vermiform appendix measuring 2.8 cm in
length averaging 0.5 cm in diameter with attached mesoappendiceal fat
measuring 2 x 0.5 cm. The serosal surface is pink-tan and smooth with an
unremarkable lumen without masses, perforations or fecaliths identified.
Representative sections to include the proximal margin (inked) are
submitted in a single cassette,
