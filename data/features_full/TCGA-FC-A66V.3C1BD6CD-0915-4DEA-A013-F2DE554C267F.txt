Surgical Date:
Gross Description: A. "Left pelvic node." A 3.5 x 2.0 x 0.4 cm lymph node.

B. "Right pelvic node." A 1.0 cm lymph node admixed with 1.0 cm adipose tissue.

C. "Prostate." A 52 gram, 5.0 x 4.0 x 3.8 cm prostatectomy specimen with attached seminal vesicles and
an intact capsule. The prostate is inked as follows: Anterior red, right side black and left side blue. The
apex is shaved, cut perpendicularly and submitted in C1 and C2. The bladder neck is shaved, cut
perpendicularly and submitted in C3 and C4. The remaining prostate is serially sectioned transversely
revealing a tumor in the left postero-Iateral aspect from apex to base, 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. There is also
yellow orange tumor in the right postero-lateral mid to base, 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm. The right seminal vesical

had questionable tumor. D. "Prostatic apex." A 0.3 and 0.4 cm fragment.

E. "Bladder neck." A 0.7 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm fragment. W" W 91140 [é
Microscopic Description: Gleason score: 4 + 3 = 7 (6.2/3— WW7: N o 3 649! C1

.9799 q/quts

Higher tertiary pattern: Absent
Tumor quantity: 40% of prostatic tissue; maximum linear extent at least 23 mm
Prostate size: 52 gram

Location: Bilateral

Histologic type: Conventional

Therapy-related change: Absent

Extracapsular extension: Present (Bilateral base, near seminal vesicles, at least 0.5 cm extent)
Seminal vesicle invasion: Present (right side, suspicious for left side involvement)
Angiolymphatic invasion: Present (focal)

Margins: All margins free of tumor

Lymph node (right pelvic, B): 1 lymph node free of tumor
Lymph node (left pelvic, A): 1 lymph node free of tumor

Bladder neck: Benign smooth muscle, no prostate glands.

Comments: Tumor involves the right seminal vesicle, and also involves the intraprostatic portion of the
left seminal vesicle. Clear involvement of the extraprostatic left seminal vesicle is not seen in these

sections.
