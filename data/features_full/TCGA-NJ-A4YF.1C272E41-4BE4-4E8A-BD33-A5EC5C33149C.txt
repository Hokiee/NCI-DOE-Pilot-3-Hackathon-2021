FINAL DlAGNOSlS

A. (Pleura, biopsy): Skeletal muscle and fibrous tissue with chronic

inflammation. No tumor seen.

B. (Right upper lobe, lobectomy): Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma,

measuring 2.5cm in the greatest dimension, focally extending into the visceral

pleura.

Bronchial, vascular, and stapled surgical margins are free of tumor.

Remaining lung with mild emphysema and chronic inflammation.

pT2NOMx

C. (Level 11 lymph node, biopsy): Lymph nodes with anthracosis.

D. (Level 7 lymph node, biopsy): Lymph nodes with anthracosis.

E. (Level 4/2 lymph node, biopsy): Fibroadipose tissue and minute fragment of

lymphoid tissue with anthracosis.

F. (Level #8, biopsy): Fibrous tissue and blood.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION
A. FROZEN: PLEURAL BIOPSY CANCER OR NO CANCER: Skeletal muscle and
fibroconnective tissue with focal chronic inflammation. No tumor seen.

(Frozen section and touch preps reviewed).

B. FROZEN: RIGHT UPPER LOBE FROZEN SECTION ON BRONCHIAL MARGINS:
Adenocarcinoma. Bronchial margin negative for tumor. (Frozen sections and

touch preps reviewed).

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. The specimen, submitted for frozen section, is labeled pleural biopsy.
Received fresh is a 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm aggregate of soft pink tissue. Touch
preps are prepared. The entire specimen is submitted for frozen section with

the remnants placed in cassette A91.

B. The specimen, submitted for frozen section, is labeled right upper lobe.
Received fresh is a 17.0 x 12.0 x 5.0 cm right upper lobe of lung. There is a
palpable peripheral mass with puckering of the overlying pleura. The pleura
overlying the mass is inked blue and the lung is serially sectioned to show a
2.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm irregular tan nodule. Touch preps of the mass are

prepared. The bronchial margin and a section of the mass are submitted for
frozen section with the remnants placed in cassettes 891 and 892 respectively.
No other masses or lesions are identiﬁed in the lung. Representative

sections are submitted as follows: Bl - vascular margin; 32 and BB - stapled
surgical margin; B4 through 36 - sections of the nodule; B7 - section of

uninvolved lung.

C. The specimen is labeled level 11 lymph node. Received fresh is a 2.0 x

1.5 x 0.8 cm aggregate of soft pink to black tissue. The entire specimen is

serially sectioned and submitted in cassette C1.

D. The specimen is labeled level 7 lymph node. Received fresh is a 1.5 x 1.0
x 0.6 cm aggregate of soft tan to black tissue. The entire specimen is

submitted in cassette D1.

E. The specimen is labeled level 4/2 lymph node. Received fresh is a 1.0 x
1.0 x 0.2 cm aggregate of soft pink tissue. The entire specimen is submitted

in cassette E1.

F. The specimen is labeled level 8. Received fresh is a 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm
fragment of soft pink tissue. The entire specimen is wrapped and submitted in

cassette F1.
