Gross Description

The specimens are received in six formalin—filled containers, each labeled with the patient‘s
name. The first container is labeled "left adnexa." It contains a tan, lobulated mass,
weighing 430 grams. The outer surface is tan to hemorrhagic and irregular with possible
tumor present. The specimen was previously sliced. The surface is inked. Sectioning shows
the cut surface is tan to yellow-tan slightly lobulated, with cystic areas. Some areas

show a light yellow, edematous, trabeculated consistency. Focal hemorrhage is noticed. A
structure resembling fallopian tube is identified attaching to the tumor. In the container
there is a cassette labeled "FSl" which holds the frozen section remnant. Labeled Al to A4 -
tumor (Al and A3 tumor with possible fallopian tube); A5, A6 - white-tan to yellow area; A7,
A8 ~ solid area; A9, A10 ~ cystic areas; A11, A12 — yellow spongy area; A13 — large cystic
areas; A14 - frozen remnant. Jar 2.

The second container is labeled "right adnexa." It contains a 6 x 2.7 x 0.7 cm, yellow to
tan to hemorrhagic irregular soft tissue fragment. A possible ovary is identified which
measures 2.7 x 2 x 0.6 cm. The outer surface is pink—tan and smooth. Sectioning shows
the cut surface is white—gray and smooth. A fallopian tube measures 2 cm in length, 0.4
cm in diameter, with an unremarkable appearance. In the adipose tissue, a firm nodule is
identified measuring 1 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm. Labeled E1 to B3 — ovary and fallopian tube; 34 —
bisected firm nodule. Jar l.

The third container is labeled "left pelvic side wall." It contains two tan to hemorrhagic,
irregular soft tissue fragments measuring 2 x 1 x 0.7 cm and 3 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm. On
examination, two firm nodules are identified, 1.5 cm and 1.9 cm in greatest dimension.
Sectioning shows the nodule has a white-tan, smooth cut surface. Labeled C1. Jar 1.

The fourth container is labeled "omentum." It contains two fragments of yellow adipose
tissue consistent with omentum measuring 15 x 11.5 x 1.5 cm and 5.5 x 4 x 1 cm. On
examination, four firm nodules are identified, measuring 0.3 to 1.1 cm in greatest

dimension. Sectioning shows they have a well circumscribed, white—gray, firm cut surface.
Labeled D1, D2. Jar 2.

The fifth container is labeled "small intestine." It contains a 35 cm in length, 4.3 cm
in circumference segment of small bowel with attached mesentery measuring 14 x 3 x 1 cm.
The serosa is pink—tan with extensive adhesions to adhere the small bowel to each other.
Multiple white—gray small nodules are present on the surface of the serosa. There is a
sutured area. Sectioning shows this area has a submucosal white-gray nodule with hemorrhage.
Opening of the remaining small bowel shows the mucosa is pink—tan with prominent intestinal
folds. No polyps or other abnormalities are identified. The bowel wall measures 0.2 cm
in thickness. In the mesentery there is a 2 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm, white—gray, firm area noted.

Labeled El, E2 - serosal nodules; E3 — sutured area; E4 — mesentery solid area; E5 -
resection margin. Jar 2.

The sixth container is labeled "splenic flexure." It contains a 7 x 5.5 x 2 cm yellow,
lobulated adipose tissue. On examination, two white—gray, firm nodules are identified
measuring 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm and 2.5 x 1.8 x 1.6 cm. Labeled F1, F2. Jar 2.
