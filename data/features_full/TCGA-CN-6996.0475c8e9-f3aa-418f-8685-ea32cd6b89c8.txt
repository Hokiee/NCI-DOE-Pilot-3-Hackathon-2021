My srgnature 1s attestation that I have personally reviewed the submitted
material(s) and the final diagnosis reﬂects that evaluation.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in seven parts.

Part 1 is received ﬁxed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
"right hemi-glossectomy." It consists of a wedge of tan connective tissue,
5.8 X 3.2 X 1.6 cm, partially covered with an ulcerated gray-white mucosa.
Upon cross-sectioning, a 4.2 X 1.6 X 0.9 cm, white, firm lesion is identiﬁed.
Digital ima e hotographs are taken. Normal tissue and tissue from tumor were
banked for Head and Neck Tissue Bank.

Ink Code:

Blue anterior margin

Green posterior margin

Black all other margins

Red banked area.

Cassette Code:

lAFS anterior and posterior margin, shave

1BFS anterior tongue margin, shave

lCFS posterior tongue margin margin, shave

1DFS anterior ﬂoor of mouth margin, shave

1EFS posterior ﬂoor of mouth margin, shave

1F-11 representative sections of the tumor.

Part 2 is received ﬁxed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
"resection anterior ﬂoor of mouth." It consists of a 2.4 X 1.0 X 0.8 cm, tan
connective tissue and gray-white mucosa. A suture marks medial margin (inked
black) and the true margin was identiﬁed by the surgeon (inked blue). After
frozen section analysis the specimen is submitted in cassette 2AFS.

Part 3 is received ﬁxed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
"resection posterior ﬂoor of mouth." It consists of 1.0 X 0.5 X 0.6 cm of

tan connective tissue and gray-white mucosa. A suture marks posterior margin
(inked black) and the true margin was identiﬁed by the surgeon (inked blue).
After frozen section analysis, the specimen is submitted in cassette 3AFS.
Part 4 is received ﬁxed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
"medial posterior ﬂoor of mouth/tongue." It consists of 0.9 X 0.7 X 0.6 cm

of tan, connective tissue and mucosa. A suture marks posterior margin (inked
black) and the true margin was identiﬁed by the surgeon (inked blue). After
frozen section analysis, the specimen is submitted in cassette 4AFS.

Part 5 is received ﬁxed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
"new posterior margin." It consists of 2.2 X 1.3 X 0.8 cm of tan, connective
tissue and mucosa. A suture marks posterior margin (inked black) and the true
margin was identified by the surgeon (inked blue). After frozen section
analysis the specimen is submitted in cassette 5AFS.

Part 6 is received ﬁxed labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
"deep muscle margin." It consists of 1.1 X 0.8 X 0.5 cm of tan, brown,
connective tissue specimen. After frozen section analysis, the specimen is
submitted in cassette 6AFS.

Part 7 is received ﬁxed, labeled with the patient's name, initials, XXX and
"right neck dissection, levels 1-4". It consists of a tan-yellow, elongated
ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 15.0 X 7.2 X 2.3 cm with attached submandibular
gland measuring 4.0 X 3.0 X 1.7 cm. The specimen is divided into levels 1A,
1B, level 2, level 3 and level 4. Three possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed
ranging in greatest dimension from 0.8 to 1.3 cm in level 1A. One lymph node
is identiﬁed measuring in greatest dimension 1.6 cm in level 1B. Four
possible lymph nodes are identified ranging in greatest dimension from 0.2 to
3.5 cm in level 2. The largest lymph node is serially cross sectioned
revealing a cystic and necrotic cut surfaces. Eight possible lymph nodes are
identiﬁed ranging in greatest dimension from 0.7 to 2.5 cm in level 3. Four
possible lymph nodes are identified ranging in greatest dimension from 0.4 to
1.6 cm in level 4.

The submandibular gland is serially cross sectioned revealing a lobular
tan-yellow unremarkable parenchyma.

Cassette code:

7A one lymph node, bisected, level 1A

7B two lymph nodes, level 1A

7C one lymph node, level 1B

7D representative of submandibular gland

7E 7F representative of largest lymph node, level 2

7G three possible lymph nodes, level 2

7H two possible lymph nodes, level 3

71 7] three possible lymph nodes in each, level 3

7K four possible lymph nodes, level 4

7L three possible lymph nodes, level 4
7M one possible lymph node (received as a separate fragment from the main
specimen).
