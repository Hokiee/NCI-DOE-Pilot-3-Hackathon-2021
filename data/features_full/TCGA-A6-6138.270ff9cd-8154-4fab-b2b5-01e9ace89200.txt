SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

SPECIMEN
Right colon

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Cancer cecum

GROSS DESCRIPTION

Received fresh labeled "right colon" is a previously

unopened 30 cm. segment of proximal right colon with
attached 19 cm. of distal ileum surfaced by smooth scabrous tan pink
serosa with a copious amount of attached mesocolon and mesentery.
An unremarkable 3.9 cm. appendix averaging 0.5 cm. in diameter is
present. The proximal and distal margins measures 4.5 and 8.0 cm.
in circumference respectively. On opening there is a well
circumscribed, 5.5 x 4.9 cm. rubbery white pink-red tumor
immediately distal to the ileocecal valve. A portion of tumor and a
portion of normal mucosa are submitted for tissue procurement as
requested. On sectioning, the tumor has a maximal thickness of 1.0
cm. and appears to extend into the muscularis and extend to within
1.2 cm. of the inked serosal surface. The ileal mucosa is
unremarkable, tan—pink with regular folds and the walls average 0.5
cm. in thickness. A soft tan-pink colonic polyp is present
measuring 0.2 cm. in greatest dimension, 11 cm. distal to the main
tumor (see block 8). No additional mass lesion or abnormality is
identified. Multiple soft to slightly rubbery pale tan tissues in
keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 1.3 cm. in greatest
dimension are recovered from the attached mesocolon and mesentery.

entative sections are submitted in 17 blocks as labeled.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Proximal and distal margins; 2 - tumor to inked
free radial serosal surface; 3, 4 - central tumor; 5 - tumor to ICV;
6 - tumor to distal mucosa; 7 - random ileum; 8 — colon with small
polyp; 9 - random colon; 10 - appendix; 11-13 - ole lymph nodes;
14—17 — one bisected lymph node per cassette.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
This right hemicolectomy specimen contains a moderately
differentiated adenocarcinoma of the cecum, involving the cecal side
of the ileocecal valve. Please see the template below:

Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma.

Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated.

Primary tumor (pT): The tumor invades nearly the full thickness of
the muscularis propria, (pT2).

Proximal margin: Negative for tumor.

Distal margin: Negative for tumor.

Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative for tumor.

Distance of tumor from closest margin: The tumor measures 1.2 cm

from the inked serosal surface and 19 cm from the proximal margin.
Vascular invasion: Negative.
Regional lymph nodes (pN): Twenty—four lymph nodes are found, all
Of which are negative for metastatic disease, 0/24 (pN0).
Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: Negative.
Distant metastasis (pM): Cannot be assessed.
Other findings: A 2 mm adenomatous polyp is noted within the colon.

Ileum and appendix, no significant pathology.

DIAGNOSIS
Right colon, right hemicolectomy - Moderately-differentiated
adenocarcinoma
of the cecum extending into but not through the muscularis
propria. No
lymphatic invasion found and all twenty-four lymph nodes are
negative for
metastatic disease. All margins are negative for tumor. An
incidental
2 mm adenomatous polyp is noted within the right colon.
Terminal ileum and appendix, no significant pathology.
