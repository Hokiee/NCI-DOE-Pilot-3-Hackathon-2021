CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left lower lobe nodule, lung mass

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh in five parts labeled with the
patient's name.

1. Part one is labeled 'left lower lobe nodule'. It consists of a

wedge of lung, measuring 7.5 x 2 x 0.9 cm, and weighing 8 grams.
There is an ill-defined hemorrhagic, shaggy tumor, measuring 2.5 cm
located approximately 0.2 cm from the stapled margin. The staple
margin and pleura is inked in black. The representative section of
the tumor is frozen. The specimen is entirely submitted in to nine
cassettes.

2. Part two is labeled 'level #9 lymph nodes'. It consists of afew
anthracotic lymph nodes ranging in greatest dimension from 0.2 to
0.8 cm. Submitted in toto.

3. Part three is labeled 'level# 6 lymph nodes'. It is received
fresh and consists of a few anthracotic lymph nodes ranging in
greatest dimension from 0.6 to 0.4 cm. Submitted in toto.

4. Part four is labeled 'left lower lobe'. It weighs 103 grams lobe
of lung measuring 13 x 9 x 4 cm. There is a bronchial remnant
identified measuring 0.9 x 2.5 cm in length and diameter, stapled.
On the lateral side of the lobe there is an 8 cm partially stapled
area, which is 3.5 cm from the bronchial resection margin. The
pleural surface around the defect is inked black. Serial sectioning
of the lung shows no discrete lesion with hemorrhagic lung
parenchyma. There are multiple anthracotic peribronchial lymph
nodes identified ranging in greatest dimension from 0.3 to 0.6 cm.
Representative sections are submitted.

5. Part five is labeled 'level # 5 lymph nodes'. It consists of a
few anthracotic lymph nodes ranging in greatest dimension from 0.2
to 0.7 cm. Submitted in toto.

SUMMARY OF SECTIONS:
1A frozen section of tumor
1B-1I remainder of tissue
2A-2B in toto

3A-3B in toto

4A shaved bronchial and vascular resection margin
4B-4F sampled stapled area

4G-4H lymph nodes

5A-5B in toto
