CLINICAL HISTORY

—man has had severe headache with nausea and

vomiting for

about three weeks. On imaging there is a large right temporal lobe
mass, with

edema and transtentorial herniation , with only a linear area of
enhancement.

 

OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
Right temporal tumo:

Operation/Specimen: A: Brain tumor, biopsy
B: Brain, excision biopsy
C: Brain, right temporal, excision biopsy

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:

A, B, and C. Brain, right temporal, excisional biopsies:
1. Mixed oligoastrocytoma, with atypical features.

2. MIBrl proliferation index: 109.

See Microscopy Description and Comment.

COMMENT

The specimens are portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white
matter. The

brain is sparsely to heavily infiltrated by a glial neoplastic
proliferation

with a mixed oligodendroglial and astroglial phenotype. Focally, the
neoplastic cells have atypical nuclei, there are mitotic figures, and
the

proliferation indices tend to be high {up to 10%). There is also
focal subtle

microvasoular hyperplasia. There is no necrosis, but karyorrhexis is
found

without difficulty.

The findings are interpreted as a mixed oligoastrocytoma that is
undergoing

 

 

anaplastic transformation. The tumor does not have enough features to
be
upgraded.

The morphological features may be correlated with clinical, imaging,
and
operative findings for their final interpretation and patient's follow

up.

PROCEDURES /ADDENDA
Loss of Heteroz osit l 19 Assa LOH

 

Interpretation

NEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1p and chromosome arm 19q is
NOT

detected.

Informative loci are: D131612, D18496, D1981182, PLAZGéC

Results—Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from paraffin tissue block
and a correspOnding peripheral blood specimen for germline comparison.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA

(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3
markers

on 1p are D18548, D181592, and D18552 (with DlSé68, D181612, and
D18496 as

backup markers) and the 3 markers on qu are D198219, DlQSdlZ, and
PLA2G4C

(with D193606 and D1981182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites
(2 or 4

nt repeats) except PLAZG4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat}
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score,
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used
if the

first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or
otherwise

ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas
with 1p

and 19q deletion.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results
from a

stand-alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its
performance

characteristics determined by the — as
required by_egulations. It has not been cleared or
approved for

 

specific uses by the 0.8. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA
has

determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are

provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted
only in

the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.

TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non~neoplastic cells in
the sample
may preclude the detection of allelic loss.

Interpretation
POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected.

Results—Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT
promoter

have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents.
Assessment of

MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA
followed

by real—time PCR amplification {MethyLight} of methylated and
unmethylated DNA

sequences.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results
from a

stand alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its
performance

characteris i ermined by the AP Molecular Pathology laboratory as
required bﬂegulations. It has not been cleared or approved
for

specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA
has

determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are

provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted
only in

the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.

INTRA—OPERATIVE CONSULTATION
A.

 

 

Brain tumor, biopsy: Glioma with oligodendroglial and astrocytic
features.

Moderately pleomorphic, but no definite other hithgrade features.
Frozen

section and smears performed at—and results

reported to

h Senior Staff Pathologist

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. Brain tumor, biopsy:

Received labeled with the patient' 3 name and MRN are 2 fragments of
homogeneous appearing tan tissue, approximately 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm in
aggregate. Portions are used for frozen sections and smears. The
frozen

residual is submitted in Al and the unfrozen tissue is submitted in
A2.

B. Brain, excision biopsy:

FIXATIVE: None. NO. PIECES: 1 fragment of tan—pink, glistening,
hemorrhagic

soft tissue. SIZE/VOL: 3.3 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. CASSETTES: 2, -

C. Brain, right temporal, excision biopsy:

FIXATIVE: None. ND. PIECES: 3 fragments of tanupink, glistening,
hemorrhagic

soft tissue. SIZE/VOL: 1.2 up to 1.3 cm. CASSETTES: 1, -

 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

H and IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The cerebrum is

diffusely and focally heavily

infiltrated by a glial neoplastic proliferation. The GFAP
demonstrates

frequent reactive—type astrocytes. A majority of neoplastic cells
strongly

over express the p53 protein. with the MIB~1 the proliferation index
may go

up to about 10% (assuming that 50% of cells are neoplastic}. Focally
the

mitotic rate may be three mitoses / ten high power fields. The C031
and CD34

demonstrate focal subtle microvascular hyperplasia.
