CLINICAL INFORMATION
h/a left parietal tumour. If it is an oligo please get lpl9q status.

MACROSCCFEC EXAMINATION
Labellwd "Brain tumour".
Specimen consists of two irregular pieces of soft to firm cream tls$ue
measuring 7x5x2mm and 19x10x6mm.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Seatimns show brain tissue with focal areas of increased cellularity and in
ﬁame Of these areas there are vacuolated cells (abundant cytoplasm) with
central nuclei and slightly pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei gaen (high
mitotic count is seen in seme areas up to 4/HPF 340). I think it is
consistent with oligodendrogliotic cells mixed with agtrocytic cells.
Tha adjacent brain tissue also shnws & slight increase in cellularity
although thera is less pleomorphism in this and no fried egg like areas.
Where is n0 evidence or necrosis. There are also branching networks of
capillary seen.
The GFAP certainly demonstrated a network of astrocytiﬁ‘cells howevex in the
sliqodendrogllotlc area the stromal clear cell in the-centre-of this L
fibxillary network leaving the clear cells unstained and the Ki-GT shows {
focal area of high index 5—10% and in other areas is <4%. ”
I think the overall features are that of mixed astrocytic eligodendrogliama.
I woulﬂ probably grade this as Grade III (WHO grading) and the sections are
ﬁg“ﬁ sent Fnr ’WTQq status.
