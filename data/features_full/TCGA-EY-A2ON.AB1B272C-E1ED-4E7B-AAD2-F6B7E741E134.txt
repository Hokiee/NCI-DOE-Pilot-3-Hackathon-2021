. WWI/3
Diagnosis: JVﬁﬁ/nAOmﬁmawv
A: Omentum, resection C5%J
— Involved by serous carcinoma, largest focus 11.5 cm in /QJ
greatest dimension nay”

B: Uterus, tubes and ovaries, hysterectomy with bilateral
salpingo—oophorectomy

Uterus and cervix, hysterectomy:
Location of tumor: anterior and posterior endometrium

Histologic type: high grade uterine papillary serous carcinoma
with associated calcifications

Histologic grade (FIGO): grade 3

Extent of invasion: involves uterus, cervix, and bilateral
adnexae

Myometrial invasion: outer half, extends to <1 mm from the
serosa in the uterine body and involves the serosa in the
posterior lower uterine segment

Lower uterine segment involvement: present

Cervical involvement: present; also, there is a small amount of
soft tissue attached to the posterior aspect of the cervix,
which is involved by microscopic foci of serous carcinoma
Adnexal involvement (see below): present

Other sites: not applicable

Cervical/vaginal margin and distance: vaginal margin distance 6
mm (small portion of vagina attached to posterior cervix)

Lymphovascular space invasion: present

Regional lymph nodes: not applicable

  

C aaaaa

Other pathologic findings:
— Chronic cervicitis with reactive epithelial changes

- Multiple leiomyomas measuring up to 3.2 cm in greatest
dimension

Tumor estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor
immunohistochemistry results:

Estrogen receptor (Ventana, clone SP1): Weakly positive 10%,
very weak intensity

Progesterone receptor (Ventana, clone 1E2): Positive 10%, l to
2+

AJCC Pathologic Stage: pT3a pNx
FIGO (2008 classification) Stage grouping:

These stages are based on information available at the time of
this report, and are subject to change pending additional
information and clinical review.

Ovary, right, oophorectomy:

— Involved by serous carcinoma

- Few tumor foci measuring up to 3 mm
- Surface involvement present

— Physiologic changes

Ovary, left, oophorectomy:

Involved by metastatic serous carcinoma
— Few tumor foci measuring up to 5 mm
Surface involvement present

Physiologic changes

Fallopian tube, right, salpingectomy:

— Serous carcinoma involves serosal surface

— Detached fragments of carcinoma in tubal lumen, but no tubal
epithelial involvement

— Endosalpingiosis

— Fimbria with vascular congestion and lymphatic dilatation

Fallopian tube, left, salpingectomy:

- Serous carcinoma involves serosal surface

— Detached fragments of carcinoma in tubal lumen, but no tubal
epithelial involvement

— Paratubal tissue with benign ectopic adrenal cortex

Comment:

This serous carcinoma is considered to be of endometrial origin
since morphology of tumor is the same in endometrium and
ovaries, endometrial tumor is large while ovarian is small,

there is deep myometrial invasion and lymphovascular

space invasion, tumor involves bilateral ovaries, several small
foci are seen in each ovary, and there is ovarian surface
involvement as well as parenchymal involvement.

Immunohistochemical stain for CD31 supports both lymphovascular
space invasion and myometrial tumor with artifactual clearing
around invasive tumor foci.

Clinical History:
This is a -year—old female with endometrial cancer.

Gross Description:

Specimen A is received in one appropriately labeled container,
additionally labeled "omentum" and consist of one aggregate of
yellow fatty omentum weighing 310 grams and measuring 15 cm x 16
cm x 7 cm. Sectioning through this omentum reveals at least 3
large tumor nodules measuring 11.5 x 4.0 x 1.5 cm; 6.5 x 3.0

x 1.5 cm; and 5.5 x 2.3 x 1.5 cm. The cut surface of these
nodules is yellow and firm. Representative sections of tumor are
placed into blocks Al-AS. A representative section of uninvolved
omentum is placed into block A6.

Specimen B is received in one appropriately labeled container.

Adnexa: Present bilaterally

Weight: 300 grams

Shape: Pear shaped, with large subserosal irregular
nodularities. The largest Of these is on the posterior surface
and measures 3.2 cm.

Dimensions:

height: 13.5 cm

anterior to posterior width: 5.8 cm

breadth at fundus: 7.0 cm

Serosa: Tan, smooth, nodule with 2-3 pedunculated white
whorled firm lesion (greatest dimension 2.3 cm)

Cervix:

length of endocervical canal: 4.5 cm

ectocervix: Tan, hemorrhagic

endocervix: Tan, rough, hemorrhagic

Endomyometrium:

length of endometrial cavity: 5.0 cm

width of endometrial cavity at fundus: 4.7 cm

tumor findings:

dimensions: 4.5 x 3.8 x 1.5 cm

appearance: Fungating, irregular, tan/brown, friable

location and extent: Gross involvement by both the anterior
and posterior endometrium.

myometrial invasion: Inner one—half

thickness of myometrial wall at deepest gross invasion: 2.5 cm
other findings or comments: There are numerous (6-8) white
whorled nodules found in the myometrium. The largest of these
measures 2.4 cm x 2.5 cm x 3.2 cm.

Adnexa:

Right ovary:

dimensions: 4.0 cm x 1.1 cm x 1.7 cm

external surface: White, bosselated

two pieces proximally. The lumen of the right fallopian tube is
white and firm.
