Final Diagnosis ‘
Breas, le wide local excision. Inﬁltrating ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade III (of III),
[tubules 3/3, nuclei 3/3, mitoses 2/3, Noﬂlngham score 8/9], forming a 2.0 x 1.8 x 1.5 cm
circumscribed mass with central ﬁbrosis [AJCC pTlc]. Focal (5%) high grade ductal carcinoma
in situ with necrosis is present outside the main tumor mass. Angiolymphatic invasion is absent.
The non-neoplastic breast parenchyma shows nonproliferative ﬁbrocystic changes. Calciﬁcations
are present in malignant ducts. Biopsy site changes are present. All surgical resection margins,
after a single separately submitted re-excision of the anterior/inferior margin, are negative for
tumor (minimum tumor free margin, 0.7 cm, superior margin).

Lymph nodes; left axillary sentinel Nos. 1, 2, and 3; sentinel biopsies: A single (of 3) leﬁ
axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN No. l) is positive for isolated tumor cell cluster [AJCC pNO
(i+) (sn)]. This isolated tumor cell cluster measures 0.11 mm and is seen on cytokeratin and H&E
staining. Blue dye is identiﬁed in all three sentinel lymph nodes. Immunohistochemical
cytokeratin stain was performed on the paraffin embedded sentinel lymph node tissues and
conﬁrm the H&E impression.

Lymph node, left axillary, excision: A single nonsentinel lymph node is negative for metastatic
carcinoma.
