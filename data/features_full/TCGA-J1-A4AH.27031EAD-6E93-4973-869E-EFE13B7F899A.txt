0. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"bronchial marginAFS" is a ring of cartilage and soft tissue
measuring 2 x 2 x 0.3 cm thick. Submitted totally in 01.

P. Received in formalin labeled with the patient‘s name and
“left lung" is a pneumonectomy specimen weighing 425 grams and
measuring 21 x 13 x 7 cm in greatest dimensions. The hilar
aspect is inked black at this time. The pleural aspect has been

cm in greatest dimensions. The tumor extends to within 5 mm of
the current inked bronchial margin (not true margin, which is
sampled by frozen section). The section code is as follows:
Pl~96eextensive sampling of hilar margin perpendicular to inked
surface (parallel to airways and vascular structures) to include
scattered areas of anthracosis consistent With lymph nodes;
97=indurated lung distal to tumor; P8—Pll=extensive sampling of
tumor which appears friable, white and focally necrotic; and
P12:representative section of grossly uninvolved lung.
