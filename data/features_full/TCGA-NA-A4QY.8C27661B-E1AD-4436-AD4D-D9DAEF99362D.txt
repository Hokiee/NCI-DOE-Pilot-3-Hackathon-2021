candidates are identified ranging from 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm up to 1.2 x 1 x 0.5

node candidates are identified ranging from 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm up to 1.5 x 1.3

inked lymph node exhibits a brown, red, soft cut surface, while the non—inked
lymph node candidate exhibits a tan—yellow, soft cut surface.

C. "Anterior peritoneal node", received fresh and placed in formalin on

is a 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.7 cm tan—pink, rubbery nodule.
Sectioning exhibits a white, pink, smooth, whorled, soft cut surface. The
nodule is submitted entirely in block Cl.

D. "Right external iliac lymph node", received fresh and placed in formalin on
is a 4 x 2.3 x 0.7 cm aggregate of fibrous adipose tissue.

One lymph node candidate (0.7 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm) is identified and submitted

intact in block D1. The remainder of the adipose tissue is submitted entirely

in blocks D2—3.

E. "Right obturator", received fresh and placed in formalin on “at

is a 5 x 3 x 2 cm aggregate of fibrous adipose tissue. Six lymph node
candidates are identified ranging from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm up to 4.5 x 1.8 x
0.8 cm. The largest lymph node candidates is sectioned and exhibits a
red-brown, smooth, soft cut surface. The mid—sized lymph node (inked blue) is
bisected and exhibits a tan—pink, soft, smooth cut surface.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

F. "Left pelvic lymph node", received fresh and placed in formalin on-
at J 3.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm aggregate of fibrous adipose tissue. Two

lymph node candidates ranging from 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm (inked blue) up to 1.7 x
1 x 0.6 cm are identified and bisected revealing a pink—red, soft, smooth cut

G. "Uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries", received fresh and placed in
formalin on is a 335 gram, 14 x 13 x 7.5 cm disrupted
fragmented uterus with attached right ovary (3 x 1 x 0.3 cm), fimbriated
fallopian tube (6 x 0.6 cm), detached left ovary (3 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm), detached
non—fimbriated left fallopian tube (4.5 x 0.3 cm), and detached cervix (3 cm

with a 0.5 cm 03).

The largest fragment is supracervical consistent with body and fundus of the
uterus, and has a smooth, pink—tan endometrium (0.1 cm) with tattered edges.
Within the endometrial cavity is a 3.5 x 1.5 x 2.1 cm (protruding into cavity)
pink~tan, rubbery, exophytic mass.

On cut surface, the mass is grossly confined to the endometrium and overlies a
3.9 cm thick myometrium. Based on the attached right adnexa, the mass appears
to be positioned on the anterior endometrium. The myometrium has roughly 17
intramural, homogenous, white, whorled nodules ranging from 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm
up to 5 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm.

The uterine serosa is smooth with focal adhesions and a 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm,
homogenous, white, whorled serosal nodule. The left and right fallopian tubes
and ovaries are grossly unremarkable. The ectocervix has a pink—tan, smooth,
grossly unremarkable endocervical canal.

Within the aggregate is a 6.5 x 5 x 2.5 cm aggregate of mass, myometrium (6 x
6 x 3 cm aggregate), and three leiomyomata ranging from 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm up to 4

x 3 x 3 cm.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Gl—3— anterior mass, full-thickness (trisected)
G4—6— additional sections of mass
G7—9— intramural nodules

G10— subserosal nodule

Gll— anterior cervix

G12— anterior perpendicular lower uterine segment extending into
endocervical canal

G13— posterior cervix

G14— posterior perpendicular intrauterine segment extending into

endocervical canal

G17- representative of mass aggregate
618- representative of the three leiomyomata
H. "Appendix", received fresh and placed in formalin on‘ is

a 5 cm long x 0.6 cm diameter vermiform appendix with 2 cm of attached
mesoappendix. The serosal surface is smooth, tan—pink, and intact. The
specimen has an uniform wall thickness of 0.2 cm diameter which contains fecal
material towards the distal end. The distal tip mucosa is tan—pink and
focally hemorrhagic.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Hl— representative cross sections (margin inked blue)
H2— longitudinal section of distal tip

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

20f4

 

Microscopic examination is performed.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. RIGHT PERIAORTIC LYMPH NODES (DISSECTION):

NO TUMOR SEEN IN EIGHT LYMPH NODES

LEFT PERIAORTIC LYMPH NODES (DISSECTION):

NO TUMOR SEEN IN THREE LYMPH NODES.

ANTERIOR PERITONEAL LYMPH NODE (EXCISION):

NODULAR FOCUS OF CARCINOSARCOMA, 1.5 CM.
NO LYMPH NODE ARCHITECTURE IS SEEN.

Comment: No lymph node architecture is seen in specimen C. This may represent
an extranodal tumor deposit, a lymph node entirely replaced by tumor, or
fragmentation of the main tumor. Clinical correlation is needed.

D.

H.
