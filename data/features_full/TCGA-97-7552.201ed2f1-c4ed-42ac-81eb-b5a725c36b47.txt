bronchioloalveolar (80%).

Histologic Grade: Well to moderately differentiated (G1-G2).
Margins: Uninvolved by carcinoma.

Direct Extension of Tumor: No visceral pleura invasion identified.
Lymphatic Invasion: Not identified.

Large Vessel Invasion: Not identified.

Pathologic Staging: pT2 N0 Mx.

CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Lung mass Ieft

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received fresh in four parts each labeled with the
patient's name.

1. Part one is received fresh for froze section, labeled 'Ieft lower

lobe.' It consists of a lobe of lung, measuring 16 x 11.5 x 3.5 cm.

On the pleural surface there is a linear defect, measuring 3 x 1 cm.
The surface of the lung shows pleural thickening covering an area,
which measures 3 cm. Upon opening the lung there is a tan glistening
mass, measuring 5.2 x 3.5 x 2.2 cm. It extends up to the pleura. The
mass is located 2 cm away from the surgical margin. The mass does
not appear to involve the vascular or bronchial margin. No evident
lymph nodes are identified within the lung tissue. The specimen is
photographed and representative sections are submitted.

2. Part two is labeled 'station #12.‘ It consists of one gray black
lymph node measuring 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm .It is submitted entirely.

3. Part three is labeled 'station #11.' It consists of a gray black
lymph node; measuring 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm .It is submitted entirely.

4. Part four is labeled 'station #7.' It consists of a gray black
lymph node, measuring 1 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm .The cut surface is grossly
unremarkable. It is submitted entirely.
