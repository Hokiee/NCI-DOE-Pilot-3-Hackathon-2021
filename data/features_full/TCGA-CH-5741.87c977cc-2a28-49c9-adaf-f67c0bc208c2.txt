Diagnosis

1. Poorly differentiated, bilateral adenoearcinoma of the prostate across the organ. Maximum
tumor diameter 5.5 cm. Gleason 4+5=9 (Gleason 5: 20%). Extensive extraprostatic tumor growth
in the bilateral rectolateral and bilateral basal regions, as well as extensive bilateral inﬁltration of
the seminal vesicles. Multifocal tumor involvement of perineum] sheaths. Multifocal tumor
inﬁltration of the surgical preparation margin in the left basal and right rectolateral region (max.
contact line 3 mm in the left basal region); Gleason 4 and Gleason 5 portions immediately at the
margin. Multifocal evidence of lymph vessel invasion. No unequivocal evidence of blood vessel
invasion.

In addition, numerous foci of a prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (high—grade PIN) and signs of
myoglandular prostatic hyperplasia. Urothelium of prostatic urethra without dysplasia.

 

2. 2 tumor-free lymph nodes.

3. i .5 cm carcinoma metastasis without evidence of extranodal tumor growth in one of three
lymph nodes.

Summary tumor classiﬁcation
pT3b, max. tumor diameter 5.5 cm, Gleason 4+529 (Gleason 5 : 20%), L1, V0, le (1/5), RI.

Remark
In contrast to the prior punch biopsies, a Gleason 5 portion of 30% is now identiﬁable in the
main preparation.

Additional innnunohistochemical studies were initiated to clarify the vascular status. The results
will be presented in a follow—up report.

Follow-up report

Microscopy

(Immunohistochemistry: CD31, D2-40)

In the immunohistochemical studies on two representative tumor blocks, there is no evidence to
suggest the presence of tumorous vessel invasion.

The ﬁnal tumor classiﬁcation is thus as follows:
pT3a. Gleason 4+5=9 (Gleason 4: 50%, Gleason 4: 30%), pNO (0/3), L0, V0, RI.
