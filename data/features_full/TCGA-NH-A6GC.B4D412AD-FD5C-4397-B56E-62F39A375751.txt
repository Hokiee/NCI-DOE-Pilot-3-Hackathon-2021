GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in three parts. Each part is labeled with the patient's name.

A. Labeled “omental implant" is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis and is a 9.0 x
6.0 x 2.5 cm diffusely indurated. nodular portion of yellow. lobulated omental adipose. The
adipose has multiple. mucinous tumor masses with two large masses ranging up to 6.0 x 4.5 x
2.5 cm. The section is sampled for frozen section diagnosis. The tissue is sampled to have
solid to minutely cystic. mucin—filled masses thronghout the specimen. A section is sampled
for frozen section diagnosis. An additional section is sampled for tissue banking.
Additional representative sections are sampled from across the specimen:

A1 - frozen section residue

A2—A4 — additional sections sampled

B. Labeled "left colon" and received fresh for tissue banking is a 23 cm segment of large
bowel. The bowel has a distal area of indurated. creeping fat. This region is inked blue on
the serosa. The bowel is opened to have an 8.0 x 7.0 x 3.0 cm mucinous tumor mass. The mass
comes to within 4.5 cm of the distal margin. 14 cm from proximal. The tumor diffusely
involves and extends through the bowel wall and extends close to the inked serosa and
mesenteric, radial fat margin. There is 1.5 cm of adipose between the bowel wall and radial
fat margin. The tumor extends nearly to this inked margin. Surrounding mucosa is otherwise
unremarkable with normal. tan folds. The adipose is sectioned to have multiple nodular
lymph nodes. The lymph nodes are focally tumor replaced with a mucinous appearing cut

surface. Sections of the tumor are sampled for tissue banking. Representative sections are
sampled for routine histology as labeled:

B1 — proximal margin

82 - distal margin

B3—B7 — sections of tumor extending through bowel wall into underlying adipose
to the inked serosal and radial fat margin

38—811 — whole lymph nodes from proximal to distal

312 - tumor replaced lymph node sampled

The slides are examined and evaluated.
