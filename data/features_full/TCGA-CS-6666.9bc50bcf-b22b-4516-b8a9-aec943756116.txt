Microscopic Description:

This tumor is an infiltrative glial neoplasm composed of pleomorphic
astrocytes. The malignant features of this tumor are best seen in
specimen #3. Tumor cells show strong positive immunohistochemical
staining for GFAP. Tumor cells that are gemistocytic in appearance are
present focally. Numerous mitotic figures are identified. The Ki67
proliferation index of the tumor is 16%. No ganglion cell component of
the tumor is identified on chromogranin or neurofilament
immunohistochemical stain. The majority of tumor cell nuclei show
positive immunohistochemical staining for p53. While scattered tumor
cells show immunohistochemical staining for EMA, this neoplasm does not
show histologic features of an ependymoma and is best classified as
Anaplastic Astrocytoma. The possibility that this neoplasm arose from
a lower grade tumor cannot be excluded. Case was reviewed in

Case discussed witl--- An addendum with the results of

Neu-N immunohistochemical stain will be issued.

Gross Description:

   

1. Right parietal tumor: Received fresh for frozen labeled with the
patient's name and #1 right parietal tumor is a 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm

aggregate of tan-white soft tissue. Touch preps are prepared.
Approximately 60% of the specimen is submitted for frozen section. The

remainder of the specimen is entirely submitted in one additional
cassette.

2. Capsule wall: Received fresh for frozen labeled with the patient's
name and #2 capsule wall is a 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm fragment of tan

tissue. Touch preps are prepared. The specimen is entirely submitted in
one cassette for frozen section.

3. Right parietal tumor: Received in formalin in a specimen container
labeled with the patient's name and a buccal #3 right parietal tumor"
single fragment of red white soft tissue measuring 1.8 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm.
The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.
