Comment

The resection specimen was received in two pieces. The main piece, the
portion of kidney and tumor, showed the tumor to be 4 cm in greatest
dimension and the separate piece that was friable tumor measured 4.5 cm in
greatest dimension. Clinical evaluation for tumor size may be more accurate.

Pertinent Clinical Information
year—old Black male with right renal mass.

Gross Description
Specimen Material: A- Tumor base resection (right kidney), 8- Right kidney
tumor.

The case is received in two parts each labeled with the patient's name, medical record number
and given accession number , and it is accompanied by a requisition form labeled
with the same nameand same accession number.

Part A: Received fresh labeled "TUMOR BASE RESECTION (RIGHT KIDNEY)" is a
0.8 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm tan-pink irregular portion of tissue. No masses or

lesions are identiﬁed. A frozen section is performed and the specimen is

submitted in its entirety into one cassette labeled FSAl.

Part B: Received in formalin labeled "RIGHT KIDNEY TUMOR" is a 51 gram, 4 x
3.5 x 2.5 cm red-brown, ovoid portion of kidney with abundant attached fat
and Gerota's fascia. Also received in the container is a 14 gram tan

portion of friable tissue that measures 4.5 x 3 x 3 cm that entirely
represents tumor. The Gerota's fascia above the attached fat is inked blue
and the kidney resection margin is inked black. The specimen is serially
sectioned to reveal a well—circumscribed tan to tan-pink and variegated,
friable mass that is located 0.1 cm from the nearest renal resection margin
and abuts the soft tissue margin. The attached fat is sectioned and lymph
node search is performed and reveals no grossly identiﬁable lymph nodes.
Gross pictures are taken.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:
B 12 tumor to nearest kidney resection margin

BZ: representative sections of tumor and nearest soft tissue margin
B3: other half of tumor to nearest soft tissue margin

B4— B7: representative sections of tumor to kidney resection margin
BS: representative sections of tumor capsule to soft tissue margin
B9- B10: representative section of tumor to kidney resection margin
Bl 1 representative section of soft tissue margin and opposite end of
farthest extent of uninvolved kidney
