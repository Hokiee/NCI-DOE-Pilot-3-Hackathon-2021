- METASTATIC MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA IN ONE OF THREE LYMPH NODES
(1I3).

(SUMMARY):

Histologic Type: Epithelioid type, solid growth pattern.

Tumor Extent: The tumor involves the parietal pleura as scattered
nodules, with focal visceral involvement (pT1b).

Regional Lymph Nodes: Metastasis in one lymph node (pN1) (specimen
9).

Lymphovascular Invasion: Present.

Pathologic Staging: pT1b N1 Mx

(NOTE): The tumor is positive for calretinin and CK5I6, and negative
for BerEP4 and 372.3. The results support the diagnosis.

CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Mesothelioma

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in nine parts each labeled with the
patient's name.

1. Part one is received in formalin labeled '6th rib, left‘. It
consists of two fragments of rib measuring 8.6 x 1.6 x 0.9 cm and
8.7 x 1.7 x 0.6 cm. Representative sections are submitted.

2. Part two is received in saline labeled 'level 5 lymph node'. It
consists of multiple pieces of ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 2.8 x
2.5 x 0.9 cm in aggregate. The specimen is entirely submitted.

3. Part three is received in saline labeled 'level 6 lymph node'.
It consists of a piece of ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 1.1 x 0.6 x
0.4 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted.

4. Part four is received in saline labeled 'level 7 lymph node'. It
consists of a piece of black-to—yellow soft tissue measuring 0.8 x
0.8 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted.

5. Part ﬁve is received in saline labeled 'lingular biopsy‘. It

consists of a piece of lung tissue measuring 3.2 x 1.6 x 0.4 cm.

There is a suture identiﬁed on the specimen; the suture is between
two nodules, per surgeon. One of the nodules measures 0.4 x 0.2 cm.
the other nodule measuring 0.3 x 0.1 cm. The two nodules are
located at the pleural surface. One side of the specimen is

stapled. The pleural surface of the specimen is inked blue. The
stapled margin is inked green. The specimen is serially sectioned

and entirely submitted.

6. Part six is received in saline labeled 'left lower lobe biopsy'.

It consists of a fragment of lung tissue measuring 3.6 x 1.2 x 0.4
cm. One end of the specimen is stapled. There is no nodule
identiﬁed at the pleural surface. The pleural surface is inked blue
and the stapled margin is inked green. The specimen is serially
sectioned and entirely submitted.

7. Part seven is received in saline labeled 'nodule on PA'. It
consists of a piece of pink soft tissue measuring 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2
cm. The specimen is wrapped in ﬁlter paper and entirely submitted

8. Part eight is received in saline labeled 'pleural tumor'. It

consists of a piece of pleura with adipose tissue measuring 21.5 x
0.9 x 0.4 cm. There are three nodules identiﬁed at the pleural
surface which measuring 1.9 x12 x 0.6 cm, 1.8 x 1.6 x 0.6 cm. and
0.9 x 0.9 x 0.1 cm, cut surface is tan—pink. All three nodules are
submitted. Representative sections of the rest of the specimen are
also submitted

9. Part nine is received fresh labeled 'pleura left'. It consists

of multiple pieces of tan-red soft tissue measuring 15 x 13 x 1.2 cm
in aggregate. There are multiple small nodules identiﬁed which
measure 0.5 to 0.9 cm. Representative sections are submitted.
