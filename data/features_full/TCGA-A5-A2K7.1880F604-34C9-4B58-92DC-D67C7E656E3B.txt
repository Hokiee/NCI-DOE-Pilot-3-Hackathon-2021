Comment(s)
The previous report .__m ) is noted.
According to the article, 73 t of the lower uterine segment

endometrial carcinoma reveals the similar immunohistochemical
patterns as endometrial carcinoma. There is more prevalence of
Lynch syndrome in the patients with LUS endometrial carcinoma
(29%). (Carcinoma of lower uterine segment: A newly described
association with Lynch Syndrome. S.N.Westin, et.al. in J Clin
Oncol 2008; 26(36): 5965)

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY

ACCt#: \dm:

Specimen A is labeled as "left AP margin" and consists of one
piece of fibrovascular soft tissue with congestion and
hemorrhage, measuring 2.0 X 1.5 X 0.5 cm. There is no tumor.
The entire specimen is submitted into cassette A1.

Specimen B is labeled as "right parametrial margin" and consists
of one piece of fibroadipose tissue with hemorrhage, measuring
0.7 X 0.7 X 0.5 cm. The entire specimen is submitted into

cassette Bl.

Specimen C is labeled as "uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and
ovaries F/S" and consists of one piece of uterus, cervix and
bilateral adnexa, weighing 243 grams in total, measuring 7.0 cm
in width, 10.8 cm in length, 5.5 cm anteroposteriorly for the
uterus, 2.5 X 1.5 X 1.0 cm for the right ovary, 4.5 cm in length
and 1.0 cm in diameter for the right fallopian tube, 3.0 X 2.0 X
1.0 cm for the left ovary, 4.5 cm in length and 1.0 cm in
diameter for the left fallopian tube. The cervix is enlarged,
measuring 6.0 cm in width, 4.0 cm anteroposteriorly. The
parametrial margin is inked black. The specimen is opened along
the anterior midline sagittally, showing a barrel—shaped cervix
and lower uterine segment completely replaced by tumor,
measuring 4.5 cm in length,

4.0 cm in depth, circumferentially. The cut surface of the
right paracervical/vaginal margin is grossly free of tumor, but
the distance is unclear. The surfaces of the bilateral ovaries
show white-tan nodular lesions. The surface of para-adnexal
tissue shows a small paratubal cyst. The cut surface of the
fallopian tubes and ovaries are unremarkable. The right
parametrial tissue measures 4.0 x 1.0 X 0.5 cm. The left
parametrial tissue measures 4.0 X 0.5 X 0.5 cm. On palpation,
parametrial tissue is free of tumor. The surface of the uterine
serosa does not show any tumor nodules. The endometrial cavity
measures 3.5 cm in width, 4.0 cm in length. The myometrium
measures up to 2.7 cm in thickness in the fundus. The cut
surface of the myometrium is unremarkable. The endometrial
mucosa on the fundus is unremarkable. The cut surface of the
tumor is white-tan, necrotic with 50% of the area with
micro—papillae and spongy appearance. A portion of the tumor
was submitted to and : . A gross photo
was taken. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
