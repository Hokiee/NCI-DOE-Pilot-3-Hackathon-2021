C — Glioblastoma multiforme. —

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. Received fresh for frozen section labeled "right

temporal lobe mass.“ It consists of two fragments of soft
tan tissue. In aggregate these measure 0.9 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. A touch
preparation is made and the entire specimen is submitted in one
block for frozen section.

B. Specimen taken for tissue procurement.

C. Part C is received fresh for frozen section labeled

"right temporal lobe mass." It consists of several
fragments of soft tan tissue measuring 7 x 6 x 3 mm. in aggregate.

touch preparation is made and the entire specimen is submitted in
one block for frozen section. _
D. Received in formalin, labeled "right temporal brain
lobe mass" are three pink—tan irregular rubbery tissue
fragments which average 0.7 cm. in greatest dimension each. No
orientation of specimens are given. The specimens are entirely
submitted in one cassette. AS—l.

 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

A. Microscopic examination performed.

C. D. This right temporal lobe mass is a high grade

astrocytic neoplasm composed of a dense population of
markedly pleomorphic large cells with readily identifiable mitotic
figures. Pseudopalisading around broad areas of necrosis is noted.
There is focal spindle cell component to the tumor and focal
vascular proliferation. The features are compatible with
glioblastoma multiforme.

4X3, 14X2

DIAGNOSIS
A. Right temporal lobe mass, biopsy — Mildly gliotic brain tissue,
no definite tumor present.
B. Right temporal lobe mass — This specimen has been sent directly
for tissue procurement.
C, D. Right temporal lobe mass, excision - Glioblastoma
multiforme.
