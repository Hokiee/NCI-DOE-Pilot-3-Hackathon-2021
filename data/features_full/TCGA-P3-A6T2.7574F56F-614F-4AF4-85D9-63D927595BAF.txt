GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A) Received in formalin designated "m, left level IB" is a 4 x 4 x

2.5 cm yellow lobulated portion of fibrofatty tissue. The specimen is
sectioned and there is an eccentric 4 cm in greatest dimension salivary gland
identified. It has tan lobulated cut surfaces. No masses or lesions are
identified. Surrounding the salivary gland is a scant amount of adipose
tissue admixed with three lymph nodes ranging from 0.8 to 1.4 cm in greatest
dimension. The lymph nodes are sectioned and have focally white indurated
cut surfaces. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1 - two
bisected lymph nodes, one inked blue and one inked orange; A2 - one trisected
lymph node; A3—A4 — random salivary gland.

B) Received in formalin designated "m, left level II and III" is a 8 x 3 x
2 cm yellow lobulated portion of fibrofatty tissue. There are two sutures
attached to the level II region and three sutures to the level III region.
The specimen is sectioned and has yellow lobulated fatty focally fibrous cut
surfaces admixed with numerous lymph nodes ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 cm. No
masses are identified. The larger lymph nodes are sectioned and have
unremarkable cut surfaces. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
B1-B3 — candidate level II lymph nodes; B4 — two bisected level II lymph
nodes, one inked blue and one inked orange; B5-B6 - candidate level II lymph
nodes; B7 — two bisected level II lymph nodes, one inked blue and one inked
orange; BB — candidate level III lymph nodes.

C) Received fresh designated "m, gingival mucosa" are two fragments of
tissue measuring 0.2 and 0.3 cm in greatest dimension, which is entirely
submitted for frozen section diagnosis, then thawed and submitted in cassette
CFSl.

D) Received in formalin designated "m, left buccal mass" is a 4.5 x 3.7 x
2.5 cm portion of tan and brown tissue. The mucosal surface is remarkable
for a 3.6 x 2.6 cm exophytic, pale tan lesion with adherent blood on the
surface that is raised 1.2 cm above the adjacent mucosa. There is smooth,
glistening, gray—brown mucosa around three of the four sides of this lesion;
however, the lesion abuts the fourth side and appears transected. The deep
surface has fibrofatty tissue with no gross tumor. No orientation is
provided to the specimen; however, the side where the lesion abuts the margin
is inked black and arbitrarily designated 3 o 'clock. The 12 o' clock aspect
is inked blue, 9 o'clock orange, and 6 o‘clock green. The specimen is
serially sectioned from 12-6 o'clock, revealing a 2.6 cm (from 3—9) x 1.6 cm
(from superficial to deep) x 4.5 cm 12—6 o'clock lesion that is white on cut
surface. This lesion abuts the black ink, appears free of the deep aspect by
at least 0.5 cm, and appears to approach the orange ink. The 12 and 6
o'clock most slices are sectioned perpendicularly to these margins, revealing
approximately 0.4 cm of normal mucosa between the lesion and the green inked
margin, and 0.6 cm of normal mucosa between the lesion and the blue inked
margin. Cassettes: Dl—D2 - composite of lesion from 9-3 o'clock; D3 -
additional representative section in relationship to black ink; D4 -

additional representative section in relationship to orange ink; D5 -
sections in relationship to blue ink; 06 — representative sections in
relationship to green ink.

 

E) Received fresh designated "m, superior buccal margin" are two

pieces of tan tissue measuring 0.2 and 0.5 cm in greatest dimension, which
are inked black and submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis, and then
thawed and submitted in cassette E/F/GFSl.

F) Received fresh designated ., inferior buccal margin" is a 0.7 x 0.2 x
0.3 cm portion of tan and red tissue, which is inked blue and submitted

entirely for frozen section diagnosis, then thawed and submitted in cassette
E/F/GFSl.

G) Received fresh designated tongue margin" is a 0.8 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm
portion of tan and red tissue, which is inked orange and submitted entirely
for frozen section diagnosis, then thawed and submitted in cassette E/F/GFSl.

H) Received in formalin designated "i, left molar left posterior
margin" is a 2 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm premolar. It has a central silver amalgam.
There is a scant amount of soft tissue received in the container measuring

0.8 x 0.8 x 0.1 cm in aggregate. The soft tissue minus the tooth is entirely
submitted in cassette H1.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
CFS) Cauterized fibrous tissue, inflammatory cells, and granulation tissue
with squamous mucosa; no carcinoma and no definitive high—grade dysplasia

 

EFS, FFS, GFS) No carcinoma or high—grade dysplasia

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

D) Mouth, left buccal mass, excision: Invasive, moderately—differentiated,
keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, with the following features:

1. 4.5 cm in greatest dimension.

2. An in—situ component is identified.

3. Carcinoma invades submucosal fat and skeletal muscle.

4. Thi invasive front infiltrates as angulated cords of malignant cells.

5. Perineural invasion identified.

6. Squamous carcinoma extensively involves arbitrarily designated 3 o'clock

margin (see gross description); the remaining margins appear uninvolved by
carcinoma.

7. Minor salivary gland with no involvement by carcinoma.

8. Minimum pathologic stage: pT3, N2b, MX.

A, B) Lymph nodes, left levels IE, IT, and III, excisions: 2 of 42 lymph

nodes positive for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, including:

1. 2/3 level IB nodes, with the largest focus of carcinoma measuring 1.0 cm

in dimension, with no definite extranodal invasion seen.

2. 0/34 level II nodes.

3. 0/5 level III nodes.

4. No extranodal extension identified.

5. Greatest dimension of metastatic carcinoma in lymph node is 0.9 cm. {a
6. Salivary gland negative for carcinoma. ‘

C, E, F, G, H) Mouth, gingival mucosa, superior buccal margin, inferior
buccal margin, tongue margin, and left molar left posterior margin,
respectively, biopsies: No carcinoma identified.
