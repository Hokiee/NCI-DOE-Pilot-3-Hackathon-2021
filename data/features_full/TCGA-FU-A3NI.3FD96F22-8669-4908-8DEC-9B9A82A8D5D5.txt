GROSS UtSURlP'l lUN:

The specimen is received in ten formalin-ﬁlled containers
labeled with the patient‘s name

A. Container A is additionally labeled "right ovary and
tube," and contains a 3.6 gm, 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.4 cm ,
yellow—tan lobulated ovary received with attached
paraovarian soft tissue and segment of fallopian tube, 3.5
cm in length and ranging from 0.7 up to 10 cm in diameter.
Sections through the tube reveal a dilated lumen containing
red-brown, hemorrhagic ﬂuid. The ovary is sectioned to
reveal a hemorrhagic corpus luteum. The remainder of the cut
surface is tan-gray and fibrous with multiple gray-white
corpora albicantia,

B. Container Bis additionally labeled "left ovary and

tube," and contains a 6.6 gm. 3.5 x 2.8 x‘1.8 cm.

yellow-tan lobulated ovary received with attached
paraovarian soft tissue and segment of ﬁmbriated fallopian

tube. The tube has been previously .. .rrupted and when
reconstructed is 5.0 cm in length and ranges from 0.7 to 0.9
cm in diameter A n '1 cm, uniloculnted paratuh'il cyst is
present at the proximal and. It features a smooth inner
lining and contains clear, watery fluid. The ovary is
sectioned to reveal a tan-pink fibrous cut surface with l
multiple gray—white corpora albicantia and a hemorrhagic
corpus luteum. A 0.6 cm uniloculated subcortical cyst is
present. It features a smooth inner lining and contains
clear, watery fluid. Representative sections are submitted
in cassettes 81-3, labeled designated as
follows: 1, cross sections of fallopian tube; 23, ovary.
C. Container 0 is additionally labeled "radical
hysterectomy" and consists of a 117.2 gm radical.
hysterectomy Specimen. The specimen is comprised of uterine
corpus (5.0 cm in length by 4.3 x 4.0 cm), uterine cervix
(3.5 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm), vaginal cuff (0.5 to 2.0 cm in
length). left paracervical soft tissue (3.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm),
and right paracervical soft tissue (3.5 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm). The
paracervical soft tissues are inked. The uterine corpus is
surfaced by pink-tan, glistening serosa. The uterine cervix
is partially surfaced by pink-tan, glistening to finely
granular ectocervical mucosa, and features a central 0.9 cm
patent us. A discrete invasive mass is not identified. On
palpation, no lymph nodes are palpated within the
paracervical soft‘tissues. On sectioning. the endocervical
canal is yellow—tan and granular. A gray—white granular
lesion is present on cut surface that'extends 1.2 cm deep
(to within 0.4 cm of the inked margin.
The triangular endometrium is pink~tan, focally shaggy, and
lush, with an average thickness of 0.3 cm. Within the
anterior aspect is a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm, tan—pink, polypoid
lesion. No areas of invasion are identified. The surrounding
myometriurn is pink tan: and fibrous with an average thickness
of 1.6 cm. Within the myometrium is a 0.9 cm
well-circumscribed, firm, rubbery intramural nodule. It
features a giay~white, whorled and bulging cut surface with
no evidence of hemorrhage or necrosis. Representative
sections are submitted in cassettes (51-1 I, labeled
iesignated as follows: 1, anterior vaginal cuff. en-
face; 2, posterior vaginal cuff. en face; 3, right
paracervical soft tissues, perpendicular; 4, left
paracervical soft tissues, perpendicular; 5~7, anterior
endoectocervix; 8-10, posterior endoectocervix: 11, anterior
lower uterine segment; 12', posterior lower uterine segment,
13-14, full thickness anterior endomyometrium; 15-16, full
thickness posterior .endomyometrium; 17, whoried nodule.
Additionally, a yellow and a green cassette are submitted
for genomics research, each labeled
