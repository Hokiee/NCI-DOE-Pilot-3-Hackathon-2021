nonsmokers and associated with the tumor response to treatmant with EGFR" Inhibitors (2), These mutations are mutually

Addendum ‘

PROBE Vgsis LSI EGFR SgectrumOrange/ CEP 7 Sodotmrnesroot!TM Probe—

Fiuorescence in-situ hybridization studios performed on the adenocarcinoma shows a ratio of EGFR‘ gono to the centromere of
chromosome 7 of 1.07 indicating no EGFR amplification in the targeted region. The rate of hyporploidy for the oentromere of
chromosdmo Y was 30% of the analyzed cells. The signal to nucleus ratio (SNR) for the EGFR gene was 2.5. 60 cells were
analyzed in the targoted region.

 

Interpretation guidelinos for EGFR’ Geno Copy Number by FISH:

Ratio of (EGFR to the oantromoro of chromosome 7:
Less than 2.0: No EGFR ampliﬁcation
Greater than 2.0: EGFR ampliﬁcation

Hyporploidy; Grootor than two centromero oopiosiooll.
SNR: The: average number of EGFR signals per analyzed Dell within the targeted region.

Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy number by FISH analysis to be associated with favorable clinical benefit (clinical

response. stable disease, time to progresoion. and survival) in patients with advanood nonwsmall cell lung cancer treated with
EGFR tyrosine kinnge inhibitors.

FINAL DIAG NQSIS:
Summary statement

The right lower lobe superior segment demonstrates a 2.5 cm invasive moderately differentiated adenocarclnoma
associated with vlsceral pleural and angiolvmphntic invaoion. All sampled lymph nodes are benign. Surgical resection
margins are free of tumor. The pathologic stage is TQNOMX.

The right middle lobe demonstrates a 0.6 cm typical carcinoid. Numerous oaroinoid tumorlour and ultimate
neuroendocrlne call hyperplasia are soon throughout the right upper, right lower and right middle lobes.

COMMENT:

This case in addition to Invasive moderately differentiated adonocaminoma demonstrates typical carcinoid in the right
middle lobe asswiated with numerous carcinuld tumorlets and diffuse nauroenducrine cell hyperplasla. A primary lung
origin of carcinoid is confirmed by positiva TTF—1 and aynaptophysin immunostalning. CDXZ and calcitonin are negative.
Surgical mactlon margin of the right middle lobe demonstrates scattered small microscopin foul of neuroendocrine

cells. However, based on the gross deseription it seams that margin is negative for tumor and these neumendonrine
cells may represent another focus of tumul'let.
