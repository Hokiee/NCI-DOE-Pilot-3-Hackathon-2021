Gross Description

The specimen is received fresh in one part, labeled with the patients name, medical record number, and
"left kidney and Gerota’s fascia." it consists of a total nephrectomy specimen, measuring 15.0 x 9.5 x 5.0
cm and weighing 356 gm. The outer surface is inked in black, and the specimen is bisected to reveal a ﬁrm
brown-tan kidney with a polypoid, yellow-tan mass, measuring 3.0 cm, present in the cortex of the mid
kidney. This mass grossly distends the renal capsule and invades the perinephric fat. The fascia is not
grossly involved. The mass does not appear grossly to invade into the renal pelvis or intrarcnal vessels.

The adrenal is not grossly identiﬁed. The pcrihilar fat is dissected and closely examined for lymph nodes.
Sections are submitted as follows:

Cassettes Al-A2: Tumor at renal capsule.

Cassettes A3-A4: Tumor in relation to renal pelvis.
Cassette A5: Hilum, including ureter and vessels.
Cassette A6: Representative section of normal kidney.
Cassette A7 : Tumor invading perirenal fat.

Cassette A8: Candidate lymph nodes.

Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. Final diagnosis made by attending pathologist
following review of all pathology slides.
