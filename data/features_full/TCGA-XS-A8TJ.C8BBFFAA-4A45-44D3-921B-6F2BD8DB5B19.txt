the wall is thin, measuring 0.1 cm, the light is dilated and ﬁlled with hemorrhagic content.
The uterus measures 13.5 cm in its longitudinal axis, 8.0 cm in anteroposterior diameter
and 8.5 cm in bicorneal distance. The cervix measures 3.7 cm in diameter and is
surrounded by the vaginal dome, measuring between 0.7 and 1.2 cm. It is observed hard
and ulcerated lesion with poorly defined edges and granular background, measuring 3.4
x 3.0 cm, involving all quadrants of the cervix. To the cuts, the myometrium measures 7.8
