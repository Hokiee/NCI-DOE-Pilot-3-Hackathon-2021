Gross Description

A. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"left pelvic lymph node“ is a yellow—tan fibroadipose tissue
measuring 2 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. One lymph node was identified
measuring 0.7 x 0.3 cm bisected and entirely submitted in A1.

B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"tissue over prostate" is a yellow-tan adipose tissue fragment
measuring 32.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. The specimen is serially
sectioned showing a yellow and tan adipose cut surface and
entirely submitted in 31-34.

C. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
”prostate gland, seminal vesicles and vas deferens“ is a radical
prostatectomy specimen which includes a 42 gram prostate gland
with attached seminal vesicle and vas deferens. The prostate
gland measures 5 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm and has a shaggy capsule that is
disrupted at the bladder resection margin and has been
previously inked black on the left and blue on the right. The
right seminal vesicle measures 2 x 1.2 cm. The right vas
measures 2.0 x 0.4 cm. The left seminal vesicle measures 2 x 1.5
cm. The left vas measures 3 x 0.4 cm. The inferior prostate
is sectioned transversely, removed from the rest of the specimen
and sectioned from anterior to posterior parallel to the plane
of the urethra. The remaining gland is serially sectioned
transversely and shows a firm, focally nodular parenchyma. The
seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia Show no abnormalities.
Representative sections submitted as follows: inferior prostate
demonstrating apical margin submitted entirely anterior to
posterior in C1-C6 ; bladder resection margin; is a
perpendicular resection and entirely submitted in C7—C8;
complete section of mid gland anterior C9—C10; posterior
Gil-€12; complete section of upper third of gland, anterior
C13-Cl4; posterior C15-C16; remainder of the posterior gland
entirely submitted in C17-C20; right seminal vesicle and vas
deferens C21; left seminal vesicle and vas deferens C22. Also in
the same container there are two cassettes the first one is
labeled "tumor" which is submitted in C23; the second cassette
is labeled "normal" which is submitted in C24. 85% of the
Specimen is represented.
