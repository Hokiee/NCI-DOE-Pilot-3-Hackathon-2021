CLINICAL HISTORY:
Large primary tumor left breast.

GROS S EXAMINATION:

A. "Left breast biopsy", received fresh. Fibroadipose tissue 5.4 x 4 cm
containing a central infiltrative yellow white stellate tumor 3 cm in
diameter. Al— AFl. Representative sections in Block A2—A4.

B. "Left breast", fresh. A breast measuring 23 x 15 x 6 cm with an overlying
skin ellipse 17 x 9 cm. There is a retracted nipple toward the medial aspect.
A sutured incision 6 cm across is present towards the lateral aspect. Numerous
slightly elevated brown warty lesions are present on the skin adjacent to the
nipple. Attached axillary tissue is present measuring 13 x 3 x 5 cm and this
contains numerous enlarged lymph nodes, the largest of which measures 2.5 cm
across. The largest three nodes have been marked with a suture and bisected.
Sectioning the breast shows a cavity beneath located in the upper outer
quadrant the incision measuring 5 cm in diameter. The deep margin is 0.5 cm
from the deep edge of the cavity. None of these tumor tissues is present
within wall. The remaining breast tissue is irregular fibrous but shows no
suspicious lesions.

Block Summary:
81- nipple and adjacent skin lesions.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
AFl "Invasive ductal carcinoma". Tissue sent for ER/PR.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

Sections show poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma of no special
type invading breast tissue. The tumor is composed of highly atypical
pleomorphic epithelial cells forming sheets, cords, and columns with minimal
attempt at the gland formation. There is extensive lymphatic channel invasion
by tumor, and extensive tumor necrosis is present.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. "LEFT BREAST BIOPSY":

[’INVAS‘IYE DUCTAL CARCINOMA \OF NO SPECIAL TYPE MEASURING 3 CM ACROSS.

NSABPQNUCLEAR GRADE 3, HISTOLOGIC GRADE 3.
EXTENSIVE LYMPHATIC CHANNEL INVASION AND TUMOR NECROSIS IS PRESENT.

 

 

 

NO ADJACENT IN SITU CARCINOMA PRESENT.
"LEFT BREAST BIOPSY", LEFT RADICAL MASTECTOMY.:

BIOPSY CAVITY WALL CONTAINS RESIDUAL HIGH GRADE INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA
OF NO SPECIAL TYPE SIMILAR TO THE ABOVE TUMOR.

DEEP MARGIN IS FREE OF TUMOR.

NIPPLE AND NIPPLE DUCT ARE FREE OF TUMOR.

SEPARATE FOCI OF TUMOR IS IDENTIFIED IN THE UPPER INNER QUADRANT,
REPRESENTING MULTIFOCAL TUMOR.

METASTATIC TUMOR PRESENT IN 16 OF 21 LYMPH NODES WITH EXTRACAPSULAR

INVASION OF TUMOR PRESENT.
(3 OUT OF 4 LOWER AXILLA, 9 OUT OF 11 MID AXILLA, 4 OUT 6 UPPER AXILLA)

MULTIPLE SEBORRHEIC KERATOSIS ON SKIN ADJACENT TO NIPPLE.
