A. UTERUS, CERVlX TUBE AND OVARY BlLATERAL

Labeled with the patient‘s name, labeled "uterus, cervix tubes and ovaries". and received fresh in the
Operating Room for gross consultation and subsequently ﬁxed in formalin is a 160 gram, supracervical
hysterectomy. bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and cervicectomy specimen. The uterus is 4.6 x 4.0 x 4.5
cm. The cervix is received detached and measures 3.4 x 3.0 x 2.7 cm. The endometrial cavity is 3.1 cm
long and up to 2.4 cm in width. The endometrial mucosa is about 0.2 cm in thickness. The muscular
uterine wall measures 1.3 cm. There are parametrial soft tissues attached to the uterus, those on the
right side are 1.0 cm in width and those on the left side are 1.1 cm in width. The right ovary is 2.1 x 1.4 x
1.0 cm. The right fallopian tube is 2.5 cm in length and ranges 0.4 cm in diameter. The left ovary is 2.5
cm x 1.0 cm x 1.0 cm. The left fallopian tube is 2.3 cm in length with a diameter of 0.4 cm. The portion
of the left fallopian tube is dilated to a diameter of 1.5 cm.

Within the endometrial cavity is a 4.0 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm polypoid, friable yellow—tan mass diffusely that
occupies the endometrium, extends into the anterior lower uterine segment, and is 0.9 cm from that
margin. Myometrial invasion by ﬁrm tan-white tumor is present and involves approximately 50% of the
uterine wall thickness (involves up to 0.8 cm of the wall where the maximum thickness is 1.2 cm). The
uterine serosa appears uninvolved by tumor. The cervix, vaginal cuff, and parametria appear grossly free
of tumor. No metastatic tumor is seen in ovaries or fallopian tubes.

Multiple subserosal and intramural leiomyomas are present. Approximately seven leiomyomas are
identiﬁed ranging from 0.3 to 5.4 cm in greatest dimension. Cut sections of the leiomyomas reveal ﬁrm
solid tan-white whorled tissue without gross evidence of necrosis or hemorrhage. The cervix is grossly

othenivise grossly unremarkable. No other lesions are identiﬁed.

External surface is pink-tan smooth and glistening with focal areas of cautery artifact. Cut section of the
Ieiomyoma reveals a 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm area of calciﬁcation at the periphery. Multiple sections through
the Ieiomyoma reveal multifocal areas of calciﬁcation throughout. The remaining tissue reveals whitish
solid ﬁbrous whorled tissue with no areas of necrosis or hemorrhage identiﬁed. Representative sections
submitted.
