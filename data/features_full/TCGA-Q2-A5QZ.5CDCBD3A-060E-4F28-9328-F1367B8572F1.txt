1. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and "r ght
kidney" is a 302 gram right radical nephrectomy specimen including kidney (9.5 x 7.8 x 6.8
cm) and surrounding perirenal fat measuring in thickness from 1.0 to 2.0 cm. No adrenal
gland is identified. Extending from the renal pelvis is a ureter (2.5 cm in length by 0.3
cm in diameter), renal vein (0.5 cm in length by 0.3 cm in diameter), and renal artery (l
cm in diameter by 0.4 cm in diameter). There is a 5.3 x 5.2 x 4.8 cm palenwhite tumor with

GROSS DESCRIPTION: (continued)

focal areas of hemorrhage, located in the mid—portion of the kidney. The tumor abutts the
perirenal fat without penetrating the renal capsule. The tumor also does not involve renal
sinus fat or the renal pelvis. The remainder of the renal cortex is tan/brown with a
well—defined cortical medullary junction. The pelvis and calyces are covered by smooth
glistening mucosa. The adipose tissue is thinly sectioned and no lymphnodes are identified.

A portion of the tumor is taken for TCGA research.
