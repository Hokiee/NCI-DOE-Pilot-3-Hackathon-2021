PATHOLOGY REPORT

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:

renal mass 51 +1.; kliéwii N”) C147 9’

POSTOPERATIVB DIAGNOSIS:
renal mass

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen consists of an 8.4 gmd 3.2 x 3.0 x 1.9 cm partial
nephrectomy specimen displaying a tan—red, smooth lining consistent
with renal capsule. The renal resection margin is tan-brown and
scabrous. The capsular margin is inked black, and the renal resection
margin is inked blue. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a
1.8 x 1.8 x 1.3 cm, tan-brown, mahagony, wellecircumscribed mass that
is less than 0.1 cm from the renal resection margin and grossly
extending to the renal capsule. The mass does not grossly extend into
the perinephric fat. There is minimal amounts of uninvolved renal
parenchyma at the renal resection margin.

Also received in the same container is a 3.5 x 3.0 x 1.2 cm aggregate
of tan-yellow, fatty soft tissue. Sectioning reveals a tan-yellow,
unremarkable cut surface.

Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1—4- entire partial
nephrectomy specimen; 5- fat within the same container. Please note
that a representative portion of tumor is taken for tissue bank.
