CLINICAL HISTORY
The patient is a year—old woman with a history of oligodendroglioma (WHO
grade II) resected in . At that time the reported Ki—67 labeling.
index of the tumor was 3%. She now presents with an MRI signal abnormality
concerning for recurrent tumor.
OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
Not Given
Operation/Specimen: A: Brain, right temporal excision biopsy
B: Brain, right temporal excision biopsy
PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:
Brain, right temporal lesion, excisional biopsy: oligoastrocytoma (WHO grade
II) (see comment).
COMMENT
The focally high proliferative index and strong diffuse p53 immunoreactivity
may suggest aggressive clinical behavior and/or transition toward a higher
grade lesion. Clinical correlation is recommended.

MGMT Promoter Methylation

Date Ordered: Date Reported:

Interpretation

POSITIVE — Methylated MGMT promoter is detected

Results—Comments

Testing was done on block (Bl).

TEST DESCRIPTION: Bisulfite treatment of DNA followed by PCR amplification of
both methylated and unmethylated MGMT promoter sequences, with products
detected by gel electrophoresis.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a
stand—alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its performance
characteristics determined by the as
required by CLIA ' 88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for
specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has

 

determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results
are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.

INTRA-OPERATIVE CONSULTATION
A. Brain, right temporal lesion, excisional biopsy: infiltrating glioma
(consistent with recurrent oligodendroglioma).

, Senior Staff Pathologist
GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Received from the operating room are two fragments of soft tan tissue
measuring approximately 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm in aggregate. Small samples are
used for smear preparations and frozen sections. The frozen section remnant
is
submitted in cassette Al and the unfrozen tissue is submitted in cassette A2.
B. Received from the operating room are two fragments of soft tan tissue
measuring approximately 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. The samples are
submitted in 81—32.

, Resident Pathologist
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Sections of A and B show an infiltrating glial neoplasm composed of cells
with
mostly eccentrically placed round nuclei reminiscent of mini—gemistocytes.
Other areas show similar cells with angulated nuclei and more astrocytic n
appearing morphology similar to conventional gemistocytes. Rare mitotic @
figures are noted and occasional apoptotic cells are seen. Necrosis and/or
definite vascular proliferation are not identified. The tumor is strongly,
diffusely p53 immunoreactive. The Ki—67 labeling index is approximately 5%
overall and 15% in the most proliferative areas.
