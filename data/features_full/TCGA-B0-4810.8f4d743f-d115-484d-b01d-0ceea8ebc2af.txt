Comment:
Slides from previous kidney neoplasm he morphology of the current bone lesion is similar
to previous renal lesion. Immunohistoc emis ry w e no ormed to confirm the diagnosis. Results will be Issued in an

addendum.

      

ddendum

Addendum .

The immunohistochemical examination was performed by using antibodies against cytokeratin 7 (01(7), cytokeratin 20
(CI-(20), CD10, vlmentin and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). The neoplastic cells stained with EMA, vimentin and
CD10, but not with CK? or CKZO. These findings strongly support the diagnosis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
Clinical correlation is recommended.

Final Diagnosis
