Microscopic Description and Comment:

Sections of the cervicai tumor show an invasive pooriy differentiated squamous
cei] carcinoma with a prominent associated infiammatory response that in some
areas produces a iymphoepitheiiai carcinoma-1ike pattern. In many regions the
tumor ceiis show prominent ciear ceii chan e, which in some areas appears to be
a degenerative change. Despite the fact I at the entire cervix was submitted
for microscopic examination, there is no evidence of ciear ceii adenocarcinoma.
We have_reviewed the eariier biopsy ( 1 from this patient' that biopsy is
quite superficiai, and in retrospect, the clear ceii features I at are present
