removed. The entire specimen is bisected and submitted in Al.
8. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"right pelvic lymph nodes" is a single elongated nodule of tan,
fatty tissue measuring 3 x 1 x 0.3 cm in maximal thickness. The
specimen is bisected and entirely submitted in Bl.

C. Received in formalin labeled ”prostate, seminal vesicles and
vasa deferentia“ is a radical prostatectomy specimen which
includes a 29 gram prostate gland with attached seminal vesicles
and vasa deferentia. The prostate gland measures 4 x 3 x 3 cm
and has a shaggy capsule that is disrupted at the bladder
resection margin and has been previously inked black on the left
and blue on the right. The right seminal vesicle measures 3 x 1
x 1 cm. The right vss measures 2 cm in length. The left seminal
vesicle measures 2.8 x 1 x 1 cm. The left vas measures 2.5 cm
in length. The inferior prostate is sectioned transversely,
removed from the rest of the specimen and sectioned from
anterior to posterior following the plane of the urethra. The
remaining gland is serially sectioned transversely and shows a
firm, focally nodular parenchyma. The seminal vesicles and vasa
deferentia show no gross abnormalities. Representative sections
submitted as follows: inferior prostate demonstrating apical
margin submitted entirely anterior to posterior in C1~C7;
bladder resection margin in C8—C10; complete section of mid
gland anterior in C11, C12: posterior in C13, C14; complete
section of upper third of gland, anterior in C15, C16; posterior
in C17, C18: remainder of the posterior gland entirely submitted
in Ola—C21; right seminal vesicle and vas deferens in C22; and
left seminal vesicle and vas deferens in C23.
