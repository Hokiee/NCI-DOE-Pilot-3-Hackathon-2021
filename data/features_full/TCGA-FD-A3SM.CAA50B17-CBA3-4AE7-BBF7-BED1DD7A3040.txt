Clinical History:

The patient is a -year—old male with malignant neoplasm of bladder undergoing
a radical cystectomy with Neo-bladder.

Specimens Received:

A: Right pelvic lymph nodes

B: Left pelvic lymph node

C 2 Left pelvic lymph nodes

D: Bladder, prostate

E: Right distal ureter, stitch on non-margin side

Gross Description:
The specimens are received in ﬁve containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.

A. The ﬁrst container is additionally identiﬁed as, "1. Right pelvic lymph

nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 7 x 6 x 2 cm aggregate of
yellow‘tan ﬁbrofatty tissue. 10 lymph node candidates are identiﬁed ranging

from 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm to 2 x 1 x 1 cm. The lymph node candidates are submitted
as follows:

Al -A2: 3 lymph node candidate in each cassette

A3: 2 lymph node candidates

A4: 1 serially sectioned lymph node candidate

A5-A6: 1 serially sectioned lymph node candidate

B. The second container is additionally identiﬁed as, "2. Left pelvic lymph
node". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 12 gm, 5.0 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm
pink-tan nodule consistent with lymph node. The lymph node candidate is serially
sectioned to reveal white-tan and ﬁrm focal with cystic and necrotic tissue.

The specimen is representatively submitted for frozen section diagnosis and read
as "one lymph node frozen, positive for carcinoma, approximately 2 cm" per Dr.
[]. The frozen section remnant is submitted in blocks BlFS—B2F S.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Bl FS-B2FS: Frozen remnant

B3: Section of lymph node

C. The third container is additionally identiﬁed as, "3. Left pelvic lymph
nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 7 x 5 x 2 cm aggregate of
yellow-tan ﬁbrofatty tissue. 18 lymph node candidates are identiﬁed ranging
from 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm to 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm. The lymph node candidates are
submitted as follows:

C1-C2: 4 lymph node candidates in each cassette

C3-C4: 3 lymph node candidate in each cassette

C5: 1 serially sectioned lymph node candidate

C6: 1 serially sectioned lymph node candidate

C7-C8: 1 serially sectioned lymph node candidate

C9-C10: l serially sectioned lymph node candidate

D. The fourth container is additionally identiﬁed as, "4. Bladder, prostate".
Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 525.1 g, 16.5 x 11.5 x 5.5 cm
cystoprostatectomy specimen consisting of a 9.0 x 8.5 x 4.0 cm bladder with
attached pericystic adipose tissue and a 5.5 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm prostate. The right
seminal vesicles measure 5.5 x 2.0 x 0.8 cm and right vas deferens measures 15.5
cm in length by 0.2-0.5 cm in diameter. The left seminal vesicles measures 4.5 x
1.8 x 0.8 cm and left vas deferens measures 13.5 cm in length by 0.2-0.7 cm in
diameter. The right ureteral stump measures 1.4 x 0.5 cm, the left measures 1.1

x 0.5 cm, and the urethral stump measures 1.4 x 0.7 cm, which demonstrate
intact, patent lumens.

The right half of the prostate is inked blue, the left half is inked black, and

the reminder of outer surface of the specimen is inked black. The bladder and
prostate are opened along the posterior aspect due to the location of the

bladder tumor. The prostate is surrounded by thin, shaggy membranous tissue and
sectioning demonstrates rubbery, pink-tan, and spongy with no discrete masses
and indurations.

The opened bladder reveals a 9.0 x 6.5 x 3.0 cm fungating, shaggy, gray-tan ﬁrm
to friable mass occupying the entire anterior and lateral walls of the right and
left sides. Approximately 30% of the posterior wall is also involved. On cut
section, the mass is diffusely solid and white-tan with focal yellow-tan areas
consistent with necrosis. The mass extends through the muscularis propria and
focally abuts the deep margin with a maximal wall thickness of 3.0 cm, and
located 3.5 cm from the urethral margin.

The remaining surrounding bladder mucosa is wrinkled, white-tan with a uniform

1.1 cm wall thickness. Bilateral ureteral oriﬁces, adjacent to the trigone, are
identiﬁed and probe patent.

The pericystic adipose tissue is dissected for lymph node candidates. No lymph
nodes are identiﬁed.
Also received is a detached vessel 5.0 cm in length by 0.2-0.3 cm in diameter.

Gross photographs are taken. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
D 1: Right ureter resection margin

D2: Left ureter resection margin

D3: Distal urethral margin

D4-D5: Apical prostatic margin, perpendicularly sectioned
D6—D7: Bladder mass, including deep margin (tandem sections)
D8: Bladder mass and uninvolved mucosa, anterior wall

D9: Bladder mass and uninvolved mucosa, dome

D l O-Dl 1 :Additional bladder mass

D12: Uninvolved bladder mucosa, dome

D13: Uninvolved bladder mucosa, posterior wall

D14: Uninvolved trigone

D15: Representative prostate through verumontanum

D16: Representative prostate above verumontanum

D17: Bilateral seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia

E. The ﬁfth container is additionally identiﬁed as, "5. Right distal ureter,

stitch on non-margin site". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 1.5 cm in
length and 0.6 cm in diameter tubal structure consistent with ureter. A stitch

is designating non-margin side, and opposite side is inked blue. The specimen is
sectioned to reveal a 0.3 cm lumen and a wall thickness 0.2 cm. The outer
surface of the specimen is pink-tan to yellow-tan, and shaggy. The inner surface
is gray-tan and smooth. The marginal side is submitted en face as E1.
