GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in 11 parts.

Part 1 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX, and
labeled "neck dissection level 1A". Received is a fibroadipose tissue
measuring 4.8 X 1.2 X 0.5 cm. On serial sectioning, there are possible lymph
nodes ranging in size from 0.1 to 0.3 cm. The entire specimen is submitted in
cassettes 1A through 1C.

Part 2 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX, and
labeled "right composite resection". Received is a mandibulectomy specimen
measuring 7.0 cm superior to inferior X 7.3 cm anterior to posterior X 4.5 cm
medial to lateral. The specimen includes mandibular bone, gingiva, lateral
soft tissue, medial soft tissue, submandibular gland, three teeth and lymph
nodes.

There is a white ﬁrm mass measuring 2.8 X 2.0 X 2.0 cm involving the lateral
portion of the gingiva and the lateral buccal mucosa. On sectioning of the
mandibular bone, the lesion may grossly involve the mandibular bone. The
lesion does not appear to involve the medial side of the mandibular bone nor
medial soft tissues grossly. The lesion is 0.2 cm from the lateral soft

tissue margin and 0.1 cm from the posterior soft tissue margin.

There is a lymph node adjacent to the submandibular gland which grossly
appears involved. This lymph node measures 3.8 X 2.5 X 3.2 cm. This lymph
node is necrotic, cystic and filled with yellow ﬂuid. It is located between

the mandible and the submandibular gland approximately 0.3 cm from the
inferior mandible and grossly abuts but is separated from the submandibular
gland by soft tissue. The submandibular gland measures 3.0 X 2.0 X 2.0 cm.
It does not appear involved by the lesion grossly. There is also another
lymph node that grossly appears involved measuring 1.8 X 1.3 X 1.2 cm. It is
located in the anterior inferior soft tissue and grossly appears to have some
extranodal extension.

Other possible lymph nodes are found in the soft tissue. These lymph nodes
are tan, do not grossly appear to be involved, and range in size from 0.6 to
1.0 cm.

Digital photographs are taken.

4.0 X 0.4 X 0.2 cm soft tissue fragment. It was received for intraoperative
consultation and is resubmitted in 7AFS.

Part 8 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX, and
labeled "right neck dissection, levels 2 through 4". Received are unoriented
fragments of ﬁbroadipose tissue in aggregate measuring 3.2 X 1.2 X 1.3 cm and
an unoriented main fragment measuring 10.5 X 4.1 X 1.1 cm. The fragments and
the main specimen are serially sectioned for lymph nodes. Possible lymph
nodes are found ranging from 0.3 cm to 2.2 cm. The largest lymph node is
found in the mid two-thirds region of the main fragment.

Cassette Code:

8A - possible lymph nodes from the fragments of tissue received

8B-8C - possible lymph nodes from the first one-third of the main fragment

8D-8G - possible lymph nodes from the second third of the main specimen (8D
one lymph node sectioned, 8E—8F - one lymph

node fragmented, 8G - possible lymph nodes)
8H - possible lymph nodes from the last third of the main fragment.
Part 9 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX, and
labeled "new posterior lateral mucosal margin, inked margin is the true
margin". Received is a soft tissue fragment measuring 1.5 X 0.5 X 0.1 cm. It
was received for intraoperative consultation and is resubmitted in cassette
9AFS.
Part 10 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX, and
labeled "new posterior medial mucosal margin, inked margin is the true
margin". Received are two soft tissue fragments, one measuring 0.8 X 0.3 X
0.1 cm and the other measuring 0.3 X 0.2 X 0.1 cm. It was received for
intraoperative consultation and is resubmitted in cassette 10AFS.
Part 11 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX, and
labeled "ﬁnal posterior medial margin, inked margin is true margin".
Received is a 1.8 X 0.5 X 0.2 cm soft tissue fragment. One side is inked
blue. The entire specimen is submitted in cassette 11A with the inked side
down.
