2. LEFT LEVEL III, IV, AND V (MODIFIED RADICAL NECK DISSECTION):
METASTATIC PAPILLARY THYROID CARCINOMA PRESENT IN ONE OF six (1
OF 6) LYMPH NODES (0.9 CM). EXTRANODAL EXTENSION IS PRESENT.

NOTE: The carcinoma involves an adjacent parathyroid gland (leﬁ inferior pole).

PART #1: TOTAL THYROID AND CENTRAL WEDGE DISSECTION

Dictated:

The specimen is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, xxxx and is designated
'total thyroid and central neck dissection’. The specimen has been previously oriented
with a stitch marking the leﬁ tumor. The total thyroid weighs 18.7 gm and measures 7.0 x
5.5 x 2.9 cm The leﬁ lobe measures 4.0 x 3.0 x 2.9 cm and the right lobe measures 4.0 x
3.0 x 1.4 cm. The anterior aspect of the specimen is inked orange, while the posterior
aspect of is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a lesion in the left
lobe measuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm that is harvested by the tissue bank. This mass has a
homogeneous, yellow, ﬁrm, gelatinous cut surface and measures ............. cutoff. There
is an attached portion of yellow, ﬁbrofatty tissue along the leﬁ inferior thyroid pole
which measures 3.0 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm. An attempt is made to search for lymph nodes.
Three possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed.
