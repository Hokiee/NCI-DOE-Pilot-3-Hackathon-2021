GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. KIDNEY LEFT
Received fresh is a 1,098 gram nephrectomy specimen with attached perinephric fat measuring 23 x 14
x 9 cm. The cortical surface has a nodular appearance. The kidney proper is 18 x 12 x 8 cm. The
parenchyma has been replaced by a papillary tan-brown mass measuring 17 x 11.8 x 8 cm. It has
obliterated the renal pelvis and calyces. Areas of hemorrhage and necrosis are noted. There are clear
fluid filled cysts throughout. There is a rim of normal appearing renal tissue measuring 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.1
cm. On sectioning through the mass it extends into the perinephric fat. In the hilar region there is a
nodule that measures 6.3 x 4.7 x 2.7 cm. On sectioning, it appears to be an extension of a tubular
structure. No adrenal gland is identified and within the perinephric fat lymph nodes are found ranging in
size from 0.1 to 0.3 cm. Representative sections were taken for tissue procurement and a gross
photograph was taken. Representative sections are submitted in A1 (vascular and ureteral margins),
A2—A1 2 (tumor), A13 (renal parenchyma), and A14—A17 (multiple possible lymph nodes).
B. LYMPH NODES lNTER—AORTIC CAVAL
Received in formalin is a piece of yellow-tan adipose tissue measuring 3.7 x 2.2 x 0.8 cm. Eight
possible lymph nodes are identified ranging in size from 0.1 to 0.8 cm. Specimen is submitted in Bf
(lymph nodes), B2-B4 (one lymph node), B5 (the rest of tissue).
C. LYMPH NODES PERI-AORTIC
Received in formalin is a piece of yellow-tan adipose tissue measuring 3.5 x 3.2 x 1.2 cm. Three lymph
nodes are identified ranging from 0.6 to 4.7 cm. in greatest dimension. Specimen is submitted in Cf
(one lymph node), C2-C3 (one lymph node), C4-C5 (one lymph node), and 06 (the rest of tissue).

DIAGNOSIS:
A. KIDNEY, LEFT, RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY:
- PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, TYPE 2, INVADING PERIRENAL AND RENAL SINUS
ADIPOSE TISSUE
-TUMOR SIZE 17 X11.8 XBCM
- FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3
- METASTATIC CARCINOMA To SEVEN OUT OF SEVEN LYMPH PERINEPHRIC LYMPH NODES
(7/7)
- VASCULAR AN URETERAL MARGINS NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (SEE NOTE)
- SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT

B. LYMPH NODES, INTER-AORTIC CAVAL, EXCISION:
- NO TUMOR SEEN IN FOUR LYMPH NODES (0/4)

C. LYMPH NODES, PERI-AORTIC, EXCISION:
- METASTATIC CARCINOMA TO TWO OUT OF FOUR LYMPH NODES (2/4)

NOTE: There are numerous perinephric-adipose-tissue tumor depositions/lymph node involvements.
The tumor is present at the inked surface in one of these foci; therefore correlation with the surgical
findings is recommended for better assessment of the final status of the Gerota#s fascial margin.
