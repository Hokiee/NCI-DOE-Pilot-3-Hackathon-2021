Gross Description:
Received are three appropriately labeled containers.

Container A is additionally labeled "right pelvic lymph node."
It consists of a 4.3 x 2.6 x 1.5 cm portion of adipose tissue
that is dissected for lymph node candidates of which nine are
identified ranging from 0.4 cm in greatest dimension up to 4.3 x
1.5 x 1.2 cm in greatest dimension.

Block summary:

A1 — five lymph nodes

A2 - two lymph nodes

A3 — one lymph node, serially sectioned
A4~A6 — one lymph node, serially sectioned

Container B is additionally labeled "left pelvic lymph node." It
consists of a 6.1 x 2.1 x 1.4 cm portion of adipose tissue that
is dissected for lymph node candidates of which eleven are
identified ranging from 0.4 cm in greatest dimension up to 4.1 x
1.3 x 0.4 cm in greatest dimension.

Block summary:

B1 — four lymph nodes
BZ—B7 — each contains one lymph node, serially sectioned
B8—B9 — one lymph node, serially sectioned

Container C is additionally labeled "uterus, cervix,
parametrium."

Specimen fixation: formalin

Specimen type: radical hysterectomy with attached bilateral
parametrium

Adnexa: absent
Weight: 345 grams
Shape: distorted pyriform

Dimensions:

Height: 10.5 cm

Anterior to posterior width: 5.2 cm
Breadth at fundus: 7.1 cm

Serosa: pink/tan, smooth and glistening with two homogeneous
white whorled rubbery nodules (1.0 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm and 7.1 x 4.7
x 4.6 cm), each of which bulges on cut section; Anterior
cervix=blue, posterior cervix=black.

Cervix:

Ectocervix: 4.1 cm in diameter; smooth and gray, of which
approximately 75% of the anterior ectocervix is eroded by tumor;
the posterior ectocervix has a focus of abutting tumor but is
intact, smooth and glistening

Tumor size: 4.0 x 2.7 x 1.5 cm (protruding into the canal)

Tumor site: Tumor involves from 6 o' clock up through 3 o' clock
(clockwise fashion) with 3—5 o' clock uninvolved by mass; the
mass is soft, tan/yellow, well circumscribed and partially
friable but is without hemorrhage or necrosis; the mass
partially erodes the anterior ectocervix and grossly abuts the
posterior ectocervix, extends 1.2 cm into the stroma, 0.3 cm
from the anterior cervical soft tissue margin, 0.9 cm from the
posterior cervical soft tissue margin, 1.4 cm from the anterior
lower uterine segment, 1.1 cm from the posterior lower uterine
segment, and 0.8 cm closest to the vaginal mucosal margin (at

12 o' clock)

Endocervix: involved by mass except from 3-5 o' clock

Other features: none

Endometrium:

Length of endometrial cavity: 3.9 cm

Width: 3.8 cm '

Endometrial surface: red/brown, slightly granular (less than 0.1
cm thick)

Other findings: none

Myometrium:

Thickness of wall: 2.5 cm

Other findings: The myometrium is tan, trabeculated and contains
approximately 10 homogenous white whorled rubbery nodules up to
3.5 x 3.5 x 3.0 cm in greatest dimension, all of which

bulge on cut section.

Vagina: The vaginal mucosa measures 4.7 cm in diameter x 1.3 cm
wide x 0.1 cm thick and is tan, smooth and glistening and
unremarkable.

Urinary bladder: n/a

Rectum: n/a

Digital picture: not taken

Tissue give to tissue procurement: Tumor is given to the Tumor
Procurement foundation.
