1). The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled
"Sentinel node number one, level 1, left axilla" and consists of a single
lymph node measuring 1.3 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm. The specimen is bisected. Entirely
submitted for frozen section.

Summary of sections:
FSC -- frozen section control

2). The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled
"Sentinel node number two, level 1, left axilla" and consists of two lymph
nodes measuring 1.1 x 0.5 x 0.5 and 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. The larger lymph
node is inked black. Entirely submitted for frozen section.

Summary of sections:
FSC -- frozen section control

3). The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled
“Sentinel node number three, level 1, left axilla'I and consists of a single
lymph node measuring 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm. Lymph node is bisected. Entirely
submitted for frozen section.

Summary of sections:
FSC -- frozen section control

4). The specimen is received fresh labeled, "left breast, stitch marks
axillary tail" and consists of a breast with attached axillary tail. The
breast measures 28.0 x 25.0 x 5.0 cm with overlying skin ellipse measuring
22.0 x 10.0 cm. Situated eccentrically on the skin surface is a nipple
measuring 1.2 x 1.2 cm and areola measuring 2.0 x 2.0 cm. A suture
demarcates the axillary tail which measures 6.0 x 5.0 cm. The posterior
surface of the breast is inked black, anterior superior - blue, anterior
inferior - green and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a firm
white mass measuring 5.0 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm, and located in the upper inner
quadrant extending to the upper outer quadrant, measuring 2.0 cm from the
closest deep margin. The remaining breast tissue shows a fibrofatty cut
surface. The axillary tissue is dissected to reveal a lymph node
Representative sections are submitted, including the lymph node.
