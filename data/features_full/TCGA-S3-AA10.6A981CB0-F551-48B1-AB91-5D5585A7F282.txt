Clinical Information

None

Pius-0P DIAGNOSIS: Right breast CA

POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: Same

TYPE OF pnocnnuma: Right modiﬁed mastectomy

Gross Description

The specimen is labeled "RIGHT BREAST AND AXIIJARY CONTENTS" and is received unlined (the
specimen is in formalin for more thané hours and less than 48 hours}. It consists of a 420 g right mastectomy
with axillary contents weighing 420 g measuring 18 x 10 x 3.0 cm. The axillary content measures 6.0 x 5.5 x 3.0
cm. The nipple is unremarkable measures 1.3 x 1.3 cm in maximum dimensions. Solar is unremarkable. The left
fascia is smooth and glistening. The anterior margin is inked red and the deep posterior margin is inked black.
On sectioning, there is a well-circumscribed lohulated focally hemorrhagic pink-tan mass measuring 2.5 x 2.5 x
1.5 cm. The mass is close to the deep posterior margin in the outer quadrant close to the axillary contents. The
mass is 0.7 cm {Tom the anterior margin and approximately 12 cm from the nipple. On further sectioning the
breast parenchyma is nodular. there are no other lesions grossly identiﬁed. There are four fatty lymph nodes

MUNOHISTOCHEMICAL EVALUATION OF ESTROGEN RECEPTORS, PROGESTERONE
RECEPTORS, AND EEK-ZNEU IN INVASIVE MAMMARY CARCINOMA .

ESTROGEN RECEPTORS: 0 %, NEGATIVE.
PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS: 0 %, NEGATIVE.
STAIN ING INTENSITY: ..

HER-ZNEU: SCORE U, NEGATIVE.

Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin ﬁxed parafﬁn embedded tissue (Block A2) using the
following monoclonal antibodies: Estrogen receptor (Clone SP1), Progesterone receptor (Clone 152) and
Her-Zneu C Clone 485); control sections for HER—ZNeu are provided within a kit (score 0 MCF—‘l, score
1+ T—47D, score 2+ MDA—MB-453, score 3+ 1312474). Detection system used: polymer. Primary antibodies,
reagents and control sections for HER—2mm are all provided by

All controls show appropriate reactivity.

Reactivity g: Estrogen and Proggsterone recepm is determined based on the percentage of positively
stained nuclei of tumor cells. Reference values (CAP accreditation program checklist 2010 and guidelines on
webpagc):

Positive: nuclear staining in 1% or greater than 1% of invasive carcinoma cells

Negative : nuclear staining in less than 1% of invasive carcinoma cells

Staining intensity: is reported as weak, moderate or strong.

Egg—hen reactivig is reported applying the CAP scoring guidelines (CAP accreditation program checklist
2010 and guidelines on webpage):

Score 0 =- Negative: No iimnunoreactivity, or faint week immunorenctivity in <10% of tumor cells but only a
portion of the membrane is positive"

Score 1 a Negative: Faint weak immunoreactivity in 10% or >10% of tumor cells but only a pom'on of the
membrane is positive.

Score 2+ = Equivocal: Weak to moderate complete membrane immunorcactivity in >10% of tumor cells or
circumferential intense membrane staining in <30% of cells.

Score 3+ =- Positive: More than 30% of the tumor cells must show circumferential intense and uniform
membrane staining. A homogeneous (chicken wire) pattern should be present.

Equivocal results for HER-2mm (Score 2+) will be subsequently followed by a reﬂex dual-color ISH testing.

Additional immunohistochemical studies fpr AEl/AE3 were performed on formalin ﬁxed, pmﬁnmbedded
tissue (Blocks Al 1-13) with adequate positive and negative control sections. All stains were negative.
