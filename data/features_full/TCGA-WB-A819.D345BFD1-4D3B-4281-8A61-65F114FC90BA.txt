Clinical Information Left necrotic adrenal pheochromocytoma (94 x 56 mm)

Macroscogz:
The surgical specimen weights 171 9 after dissection of adipose tissue and contains a tumor of 9 cm
with a solid cystic hemorrhagic appearance. The remaining normal adrenal measures 3 cm

Microscopy

A cellular proliferation with large cells and abundant cytoplasm is observed. Cells are polygonal and
eosinophilic with occasional intracytoplasmic hyaline globules. Nuclei exhibit some degree of
anisokaryosis (mild to moderate), a pale chromatin and prominent nucleoli. On a cutting plane.
ceiluiarity is higher with nuclei and cells of smaller size and a certain degree of cellular monotony.
Mitoses are rare, a single mitosis is observed for 10 ﬁelds with the lens 40. There is no atypical
mitosis. These cells are organized in cellular structures or adopt a diffuse architecture arranged in a
sparse interstitial tissue but are often highly hemorrhagic with ﬁbrous and cystic reorganizations. There
is an abundant hemosiderine deposition. No capsular invasion or vascular invasion was observed.
Absence of necrosis.

CONCLUSION

Left adrenal pheochromocytoma, 9 cm long axis.
PASS Score= 6. (Diffuse architecture. 2 High cellularity: 2 Cellular monotony 2)
