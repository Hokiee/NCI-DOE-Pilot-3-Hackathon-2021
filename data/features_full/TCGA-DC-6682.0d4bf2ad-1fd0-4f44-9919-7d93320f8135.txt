I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

Gross Description:

1). The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "Sigmoid and upper rectum
stitch marks proximal." It consists of a rectosigmoid colon that measures
19.0 x 7.5 cm. The serosal surface is smooth. The radial resection margin is
inked black, and the specimen is opened to reveal a tumor that is located
12.5 cm from the proximal margin and 5.5 cm from the distal margin. The
tumor measures 6.8 cm in length and 8.5 cm in width. Serial sectioning
reveals tumor invasion to a depth of 0.9 cm, extending through the
muscularis grossly approaching into the underlying pericolic fat, which is
4.5 cm from the closest radial margin. The remaining mucosa shows grossly
unremarkable mucosal folds. Pericolic and peri-rectal adipose tissue is

thoroughly examined for lymph nodes, and all possible nodes are submitted.
Representative sections are submitted. TPS is submitted.

Summary of sections:

PM - proximal margin

DM - distal margin

RM - radial margin

T - tumor

RS - uninvolved mucosa
LN - lymph nodes

BLN - bisected lymph node

2). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Hernia contents." It consists
of multiple lobulated fibrofatty soft tissue fragments measuring 17.0 x 4.5
x 5.0 cm in aggregate with multiple fragments of irregular skin measuring
9.5 x 4.5 cm in aggregate. The specimen is sectioned to reveal grossly
unremarkable lobulated adipose tissue, no discrete lesions or gross
abnormalities are identified. Representative sections are submitted.

Summary of sections:
U - undesignated

3). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Omentum." It consists of a 18 x
15 x 5.5 cm portion of lobulated adipose tissue consistent with omentum.
Serial sectioning reveals yellow-tan fatty lobulated appearance with focal
areas of hemorrhage. Representative sections are submitted.

Summary of sections:
0 - omentum

4). The specimen is received in formalin labeled "Base of IMA lymph nodes."
It consists of two lymph nodes measuring 0.3 x 0.3 cm and 1.5 x 1.4 cm in
greatest dimensions. Lymph nodes are entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
LN - lymph nodes
TLN - trisected lymph node

5). The specimen is received in formalin wrapped around an anastomotic pin,
labeled "Proximal margin" and consists of a ring of pink tan soft tissue
measuring 3.0 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm. Multiple sutures and staples are attached.
The mucosal surface is pink tan and focally hemorrhagic. The sutures and
staples are removed and the soft tissue is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U - undesignated

6). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Distal margin" and
consists of a ring of pink tan soft tissue measuring 2.0 x 1.7 x 0.8 cm.
Multiple sutures and staples are attached. The mucosal surface is pink tan
and focally hemorrhagic. The sutures and staples are removed and the soft
tissue is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U - undesignated
