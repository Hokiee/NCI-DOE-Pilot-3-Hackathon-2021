Status of adrenal gland away from tumor: no significant histologic
abnormality

Lymph nodes: none sampled

AJCC Stage: pTZ pNx pr

NOTE: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information
available at the

time of this report, and is subject to change pending clinical review
and additional information

Clinical History:
Pheochromocytoma. CIS: Rads: 7.1 cm diameter enhancing right adrenal
mass, adenoma versus adrenal cortical carcinoma versus

pheochromocytoma. No regional lymphadenopathy, other intraabdominal
masses, contralateral mass, or liver lesions.

adrenal mass with a tan, smooth, external surface (inked black). There
is a 2.5 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm portion of normal appearing yellow adrenal
cortex adhered to the mass. On section the mass has a pink/tan to
yellow fleshy cut surface. There is a 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm discrete pale tan
nodule within the mass. Also in the container is a 4.2 x 2.5 x 1 cm
fragment of normal appearing adrenal gland. On section, the adrenal
gland appears grossly unremarkable.

Block Summary:

Al—A4 — Adrenal mass

A5 — Grossly normal adrenal gland
Tissue remains in formalin. (Self)

Light Microscopy:
Light microscopic examination is performed by Dr.

Sections of the right adrenal mass show a unifocal, discrete but
unencapsulated mass with zellballen architecture, monomorphous
cytology without spindle cells, necrosis, mitotic activity, capsular
invasion, or vascular invasion. Features are interpreted as benign
pheochromocytoma, and lend no support for malignant pheochromocytoma.
