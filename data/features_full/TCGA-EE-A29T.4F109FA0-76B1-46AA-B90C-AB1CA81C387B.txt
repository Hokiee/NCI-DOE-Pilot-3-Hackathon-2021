The largext involved node is the one sampled for turnout banking. it is about 70% eﬂ‘hced with
intraparenclmnal. sinusoidal and subcapsular tumour. The largest cross section of tumour in this node is 27 x
20mm No deﬁnite extranodal spread is seen in this node. The smaller involved nodes show a predominantly
sinusoidal and subcapsu lar pattern of involvement. There is focal extranodal spread in block 1C and possible
focal extmnridal spread in IF.
