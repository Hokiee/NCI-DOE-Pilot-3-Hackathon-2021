Diagnosis:

A. LYMPH NODE, DESIGNATED "N8R", BIOPSY:
- FRAGMENTS OF ANTHRACOTIC LYMPH NODE.
- NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.

B. LUNG, RIGHT LOWER LOBE, LOBECTOMY:
- INVASIVE MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA OF
THE LUNG, WITH VISCERAL PLEURAL INVASION.
- THE TUMOR MEASURES 62 MM IN DIAMETER.
- SATELLITE TUMOR NODULES PRESENT ADJACENT TO MAIN MASS.
- THE BRONCHIAL MARGIN IS FREE OF TUMOR.
- THE TUMOR IS PRESENT 50 MM FROM THE BRONCHIAL MARGIN.
- LUNG TISSUE WITH EMPHYSEMATOUS CHANGES AND RESPIRATORY
BRONCHIOLITIS.

- METASTATIC CARCINOMA IN ONE OF THREE PERIBRONCHIAL LYMPH
NoDEs (1/3).

- BENIGN GLANDULAR EPITHELIAL INCLUSION WITHIN
PERIBRONCHIAL LYMPH NODE.

- FOCAL NONCASEATING, HYALINIZED GRANULOMATOUS
INFLAMMATION WITHIN PERIBRONCHIAL LYMPH NODE.

C. LYMPH NODE, DESIGNATED "N9R", BIOPSY:
- ANTHRACOTIC LYMPH NODE.
- NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.
- SEE SYNOPTIC CANCER STAGING CHECKLIST.

COMMENT: Dr has co-reviewed representative slides from this

case, and concurs with the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.

FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

 

Source of Specimen:
A. Lung bx

B. Lung
C. Lung bx

Clinical HistonL/Operatjve Dx:
Malignant neoplasm, right lower lobe

lntraoperative Diagnosis:
B. Right lower lobe frozen section diagnosis: ”Bronchial margin free of tumor" The
Mrpretationm was/were performed and rendered at

Gross Description:

A. The specimen is labeled N8R and is received in formalin. It consists of two 0.7 cm fragments of red-
brown to anthracotic tissue. The specimens are inked wi rasting colors and each specimen is
bisected. The tissue is entirely submitted in cassette A1.

B. The specimen is labeled right lower lobe and is received without fixative. It consists of a lobe of lung
which measures 16.0 x 9.5 x 3.8 cm and weighs 269.0 grams. The pleural surface of the superior portion
of the lobe has a mottled red to dark violet appearance and appears smooth. There is a prominent area
of puckering and distortion of the lateral basilar portion of the lung. Adjacent to this pleural puckering and
distortion are three subpleural firm prominent nodules which vary from 0.7 to 1.2 cm. There is another
subpleural nodule in the lateral apical portion of the lung. At the hilum of the lung a staple line is
dissected from the specimen and the bronchial margin is removed as a thin shave. There are three small
up to 0.6 cm peribronchial lymph nodes. The bronchi are opened and there is no gross evidence of
intraluminal tumor. Sections of the lateral basilar portion of the lung reveal a dull yellow relatively well
circumscribed neoplasm which measures 6.2 x 5.0 x 2.9 cm. This neoplasm is 5.0 cm from the bronchial
resection margin. It abuts and distorts the pleural surface. Representative sections are submitted.
Sections summary: B1) bronchial margin from frozen section, B2) vascular margins, B3) peribronchial
nodes, B4-B5) lateral basilar tumor and pleural surface, BG-B7) additional sections of tumor, BB) three
subpleural nodules just adjacent to tumor, 89) subpleural node anterior apical lung, B10) uninvolved

lung.

C. The specimen is labeled N9R and is received in formalin. it consists of a single 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm
fragment of red-brown tissue. It is serially sectioned and entirely submitted in cassette C1.

Microscopic Description:
A. Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic findings are reflected in the diagnosis
rendered.

FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

B. Special stain: Elastln stain, performed on blocks B5, BS, and B7, demonstrating visceral pleural
invasion. lmmunohistochemical stain: cytokeratin OSCAR, TTF-1, performed on block B3, demonstrating
1 mm metastatic focus within subcapsular sinus of peribronchial lymph node. The metastatic tumor and
the epithelial inclusion stain positive for cytokeratin OSCAR, where as only the metastatic tumor stains
positive for TTF-1. Appropriate positive and negative controls reviewed.

C. Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic ﬁndings are reflected in the diagnosis
rendered.
