Gross Description:
Received are three formalin filled containers each labeled with patient’s name.

A is received and additionally labeled "A, right neck Level ll-lV dissection,
single stitch at Level II, double stitch at Level N" and consists of a 13.0 x
4.8 x 1.8 cm purple-tan irregular soft tissue with a single black stitch
denoting the Level ll area and a double black stitch denoting Level lV.
Palpation through the specimen reveals multiple firm nodularities. Sectioning
reveals eight lymph nodes in the station two area the largest of which has a
greatest dimension of 3.4 cm and has apparent calcifications within. There are
six probable station four lymph nodes the largest of which have a greatest
dimension of 3.5 cm. These nodes are submitted in its entirety as follows:

A1 one whole lymph node, entirely;

A2 one whole lymph node, station two, entirely;

A3 two whole lymph nodes, entirely;

A4 two whole lymph nodes, bisected, all halves submitted;

A5 two whole lymph nodes, each bisected, all halves submitted;

A6,7 one whole lymph node, step-sectioned, entirely;

A8-12 largest station two lymph node, step-sectioned, entirely;

A13 two probable lymph nodes, station four, entirely;

A14 two probable lymph nodes, station four, entirely;

A15 two whole lymph nodes, each bisected, all halves submitted;

A16 one whole lymph node, bisected, each half submitted;

A17-19 one whole lymph node, station four, step-sectioned, entirely;

A20-23 largest station four lymph node, step-sectioned, entirely.

B is received and additionally labeled "total thyroidectomy; central neck
dissection, single left upper pole, double at right lower pole" and consists of
a total thyroid specimen 5.5 x 6.0 x 1.5 cm. The thyroid is received with a

 

 

 

surface. A single incision has been made through the are completed for
each side so that the entire specimen is inked as follows: right black, left .

following:
B1,2 right lobe to include mass in relationship to inked surgical
margin;
B3,4 apparent uninvolved left lobe;
B5 apparent isthmus;
representative node;
87 representative node.

C is received and additionally labeled "left central neck mass and FSC+0" and
consists of 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm pink-tan soft tissue received fresh for frozen
section diagnosis. The specimen is submitted in its entirety in cassette C1.
