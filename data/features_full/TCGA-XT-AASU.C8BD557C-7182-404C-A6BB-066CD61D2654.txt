INTERPRETATION AND DIAGNOSIS:

1) SKIN “RIGHT PORT SITE" (EXCISION): SKIN WITH CHRONIC INFLAMMATION
NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

2) 6TH RIB (RESECTION: RIB (GROSS DIAGNOSIS).

3) R4 LYMPH NODE (LYMPHADENECTOMY): ONE (1) LYMPH NODE AND
ASSOCIATED FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

4) R8 LYMPH NODE (LYMPHADENECTOMY): TWO (2) LYMPH NODES AND
ASSOCIATED FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

5) STATION 7 LYMPH NODE (LYMPHADENECTOMY): ONE (1) LYMPH NODE AND
ASSOCIATED FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

6) RIGHT LUNG AND PLEURA (PNEUMONECTOMY):

MIXED SARCOMATOID AND EPITHELIOID MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA. THE TUMOR
INVOLVES BOTH THE VISCERAL AND PARIETAL PLEURA, CHEST WALL, DIAPHRAGM
AND THE PERICARDIUM. THE TUMOR INVOLVES THE LUNG PARENCHYMA. THE
TUMOR EXTENDS CLOSE TO THE MARGIN OF RESECTION AT THE APEX, LATERAL AND
POSTERIOR MARGIN AND IS IN THE SOFT TISSUE OF THE BRONCHIAL MARGIN.
FIVE (5) HILAR LYMPH NODES ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. ONE LYMPH NODE
CONTAINS AN ASBESTOS BODY. THE NON-TUMOR LUNG SHOWS ESSENTIALLY NO
INTERSTITIAL FIBROSIS OR BRONCHIOLAR LUMINAL FIBROSIS. AT LEAST ONE
CHARACTERISTIC ASBESTOSIS BODY IS SEEN ON IRON STAINS IN EACH OF TWO
SLIDES (6C, 6H). A SINGLE "MINUTE" MENINGOTHELIAL NODULE IS PRESENT
(6C) .

7) POSTERIOR DIAPHRAGMATIC SULCUS (RESECTION): MALIGNANT
MESOTHELIOMA INVADING INTO, BUT NOT THROUGH, THE DIAPHRAGM.

8) A3 LYMPH NODE (LYMPHADENECTOMY): FIVE (5) LYMPH NODES AND
ASSOCIATED FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

NOTE ADDED Immunostain for EGFR is strongly positive in the
epithelioid parts of the tumor, and only focally and weakly positive
in the spindle component. JED-Os

The specimen is received fresh labeled* and designate
“Right port site." The specimen consists o rip of lightly

PART #2: 6TH RIB

Resident Pathologist:

Dictated by

The specimen is received fresh labeledwand designated
"6th rib-gross only." The specimen consists of we ragments of bone
grossly consistent with rib. The larger bone measures 16.5 cm in
length and has an average cross sectional area of 1.6 x 1.2 cm. The
shorter fragment of bone measures 8 cm in length and has an average

PART #6: RIGHT LUNG AND PLEURA
Resident Pathologistz.

Dictated by

The specimen is received fresh labeled” and designated
right lung and pleura. It consists of a right lung with associated
pleura, diaphragm, and portion of what appears to be pericardial
tissue. Overall, the specimen measures 26 x 19.5 x 18 cm. This
includes a 18 x 16 x 6 cm lung and pleura and an 11.5 x 15.5 x 2 cm
segment of attached diaphragm. The entire specimen weighs 1185 gms. A
7.5 x 3 x 0.2 cm portion of pericardial tissue is noted on the
mediastinal surface of the lung. The lung appears to be completely
encased by a nodular membrane. The nodular membrane varies in color
from tan—pink to brown, and is continuous from the surface of the
lung onto the surface of the attached diaphragm. The nodules vary in
size from approximately 0.4 cm in greatest dimension to as large as 2
cm in greatest dimension. The abdominal surface Of the diaphragm
consists primarily of skeletal muscle; however, underlying modularity
is evident.

Examination of cut sections, reveals a thick core of firm white
tissue entirely encasing the lung. This core of white tissue varies
in thickness from 0.4 cm to 1 cm. This firm white mass extends into
the interlobar fissures. The thick firm white tissue also extends
into the posterior sulcus. The mass appears to invade deeply into the
diaphragm, and grossly appears to extend to the abdominal surface of
the diaphragm diffusely. Examination of cut sections, in the area of
the presumed adhered pericardium, reveals the firm nodular mass
appears to extend nearly to the surface of the pericardial membrane.
Examination of the lung parenchyma reveals tan red soft parenchyma
without any discrete masses or lesions. The lung does not appear to
be particularly fibrotic nor cystic, but does appear to be somewhat
compressed. Tissue is harvested for future possible studies.

PART #7: POSTERIOR SULCUS TUMOR
Resident Pathologist:

Dictated by U

The specimen is received fresh labeled ~nd designated
"Posterior sulcus tumor." The specimen consists of a portion Of
diaphragm with what appears to be a small portion of the
periesophageal ligament. It measures 21 x 12 cm and is approximately
2.5 cm at its thickness. The pleural surface appears to be completely
covered with a firm white mass. Examination of the abdominal surface
reveals only skeletal muscle and the aforementioned periesophageal
ligament. Examination of cut section reveals the white mass to
infiltrate into the diaphragmatic muscle, but in no where does it
grossly appear to perforate to the other side into the abdominal
surface. Several full thickness sections are taken to sample the
lesion. Beginning at the end opposite the periesophageal ligament

(block "A"). With the final section being through the periesophageal
ligament (block "B").

The specimen is received fresh labeled— and designated
"A3 lymph node." The specimen consists of a 4.5 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm
fragment of black-yellow-red fibrofatty tissue. Five possible lymph
nodes are grossly identified. The largest of these measures 3 x 1.5 x
0.5 cm. This large lymph node is bisected and submitted. All the other
lymph nodes are submitted in full.
