Pathology Report

DIAGNOSIS
(A) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL:

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CLEAR CELL TYPE, FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 4
(17.0 CM).

TUMOR EXTENDS INTO HILAR AND PERICAPSULAR ADIPOSE TISSUE AND INVOLVES
HILAR AND
PERICAPSULAR VESSELS.

Renal vein and ureteral margin,no tumor present.
Adrenal gland, no tumor present.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL - A radical nephrectomy specimen (26.0 x
17.0 x 12.0 cm) including the kidney (24.0 x 16.0 x 10.0 cm), a segment
of the renal artery, renal vein, and ureter, and adrenal gland (6.0 x

3.5 x 1.0 cm). There is a large variegated extensively necrotic mass
(17.0 x 15.0 x 8.0 cm) in the upper pole of the kidney. Within this

tumor there are multiple dark red and golden nodules, light tan friable
nodules, and focal mahogany nodular areas. The tumor invades the
perinephric adipose tissue and abuts the Gerota's fascia margin. The
tumor invades into the renal sinus. Renal vein is grossly free of

tumor. The tumor compresses the adrenal gland but does not invade.
There are focal light tan well circumscribed nodules at the periphery of
the tumor.

The adjacent kidney parenchyma is unremarkable. The pelvic
calyceal system is compressed by the tumor but othenNise unremarkable.
No lymph nodes are identiﬁed in the hilum of the kidney. The adrenal
gland is grossly unremarkable.

Portions of the tumor have been submitted for a possible electron
microscopy as well as for the vaccine protocol.

INK CODE: Black-Gerota's fascia.
