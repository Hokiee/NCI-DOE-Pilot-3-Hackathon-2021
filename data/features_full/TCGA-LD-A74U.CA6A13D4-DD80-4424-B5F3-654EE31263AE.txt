COMMENT

Tumor grossly is 5.3 cm. In the axillary contents (#2), sizeable tumor mass within the fat is also present in multiple blocks, which
most likely represents a direct extension from the lumpectomy, and thus the tumor size is estimated to be 7cm.

Gross Description:

Specimen #1 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation, labeled with the patient‘s name and right breast mass, and consists
of an 11.3 cm (medial to lateral) x 8.5 cm (superior to inferior) x 4.5 cm (anterior to posterior) product of partial mastectomy which
is surfaced by a 6.9 x 2.2 x 0.2 cm ellipse of unremarkable white tan skin. No nipple is Identified. A short suture designating
superior and a long suture designating lateral are present. Two needle localization wires are entering the specimen in the superior
and inferior aspects. The specimen is radiographed and differentially inked as follows: superior-blue, inferior-green, lateral-yellow,
medial—red, posterior/deep—black and serially sectioned from lateral to medial into 10 slices. No biopsy clip is identified. An ill-
defined, rubbery to firm, white-tan area measuring 5.3 x 5.0 x 3.5 cm is identiﬁed in slices 4 to 10. This area of fibrous tissue
shows some extensions to the posterior, inferior, superior, and medial margins. This fibrous area is also 2.0 cm from the overlying
skin. No other lesions are grossly identified. The breast parenchyma consists of tan-yellow, Iobulated adipose tissue (60%) and
fibrous tissue (40%). Time in formalin: Some tumor and normal tissue is frozen for TCGA studies.
Representative sections of all slices (with the exception of slices 2 and 3) are submitted as follows:

1A-1 B: slice #1, lateral margin, perpendicular (representative)
101 D: slice #4, irregular fibrous area

1 E: slice #4, fibrous area to posterior margin
1F: slice #4, fibrous area to superior margin
1G-1 H: slice #5, fibrous area contiguous section
1 I: slice #5, posterior margin

1.): slice #5, inferior and posterior margins

1 K: overlying skin

1L-1 M: slice #6, contiguous section of fibrous area to inferior margin

1 N-10: posterior margin

1P: superior margin

1Q-1T: slice #7, contiguous section from superior to interior (orange ink denotes contiguous section)
1U: overlying skin

1 V: slice #8, fibrous area
1W: superior margin

1X: inferior margin

1Y: posterior margin

12: slice #9, inferior margin

1AA: slice #9, irregular fibrous area

1 BB: superior margin

1CC: posterior margin

lDD-l GG: slice #10. medial margin, perpendicular (representative).

Specimen #2 is received in formalin labeled right axillary dissection, and consists of 11.0 x 10.0 x 2.5 cm yellow adipose tissue.
The specimen was serially sectioned to reveal 16 lymph nodes ranging in size from 1.5 to 4.5 cm. The lymph nodes are entirely
submitted and labeled as follows:

2A: Two lymph nodes intact.
23: Two lymph nodes intact.
20: Four lymph nodes intact.
2D: One lymph node, bisected.
2E: One lymph node, bisected.
2F: One lymph node, bisected.
ZG: One lymph node, bisected.

2H: One lymph node, representative section.
2|: One lymph node. representative section.
2d: One lymph node, representative section.

2K-2L: One lymph node, representative section.

Specimen #3 is received fresh labeled omentum, and consists of a 20 x 20 x 5.0 yellow Iobulated adipose tissue. The specimen is
serially sectioned and no lesion is grossly identified. Representative sections are submitted labeled 3A—SB.
