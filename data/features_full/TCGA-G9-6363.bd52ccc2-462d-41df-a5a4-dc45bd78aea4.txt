INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:
FSA/FSB—ri ht and left pelvic lymph nodes: Negative for malignancy calted by Dr. to Dr. at-
<A> *8)

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES
Received fresh is a piece of adipose tissue, 6 x 3 x 2 cm, containing 3 lymph nodes. The iargest
measuring 5.1 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm and two smaller nodes, each ‘1 cm in greatest dimension. Lymph nodes
are submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis is follows:
F 8A1: two smaller nodes
FSA2-FSA4: largest node

B. LEFT PELVlC LYMPH NODES

Received fresh are multiple pieces of adipose tissue, 6 x 3 x 2 cm in aggregate. Five possible lymph
nodes are identified, 0.7 to 1.1 cm in greatest dimension. Lymph nodes are submitted entirely for
frozen section diagnosis.

F881: 4 possible lymph nodes

F882: 1 lymph node

C. PROSTATE
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "prostate" is a resected prostate

gland weighing 80 g and measuring 6-cm from right to left, 5-cm from anterior to posterior, and 4.2-cm
from apex to base. The capsule is smooth and intact. Ink code: Apex—red, anterior—orange, base-blue,
posterior-black, right-green, left-yellow. The apex and base are removed from the specimen yielding a
new weight of 29 g. The specimen is serially sectioned from apex to base showing ﬁrm tan bulging
parenohyma. The right and left seminal vesicles, 2.5 x 2.7 x 1.5 cm, and 2.5 x 2.8 x 1.6 cm,
respectively. are bisected to show beige tan cystic tissue. The right and left vas, 3 x 0.5 em, and 4.1 x
0.5 cm, respectively, are serially sectioned to show 1‘” rm tan tube structure. A portion of the specimen is
submitted for tissue procurement the remainder of the mid- -portlon' Is entirely submitted (with the
exception of seminal vesicles and vas deferens}:
01— C3: Right apex
04—05: Left Apex
06: Level 1 rlghtside
C7: Level 1 iett side
08-011: Level 2. capsule, right side
C12—C13: Level 2, capsuie, left side
014-015: Right iateral base
016—019: Right base
C20—021: Right base with distal urethral margin [bladder neck
022—C23: Left base with distal urethra! margin ibiadder neck
024-029: Left base
. C30—032: Leftlaterai base
633: Right seminal vesicle, right vas
. . CS4: Left seminal vesicle, left vas

o. LEFT APICAL MARGEN
Received in formalin labeled with the patient‘s identiﬁcation and designated "ieft apical margin" is an
irregular fragment of brown-tan soft tissue measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The entire specimen is

submitted, D1.
