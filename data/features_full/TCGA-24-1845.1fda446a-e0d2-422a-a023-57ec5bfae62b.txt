Microscopic Description and Comment:
The specimen received labeled "right periaortic lymph node' shows one definitive lymph node with no evidence of

malignancy and a soft tissue fragment that is difiuseiy involved b metastatic poorly differentiated serous
adenocarcinoma. For discussion witt‘we are interpreting this soft tissue tumor fragment

as a iﬂih node that has been effaced by metastatic disease. The patient is staged accordingiy in the synoptic report.
History:

The patient is a —with a complex pelvic mass and etevated CA125. Operative procedure: Examination
under anesthesia, exptoratory iaparotomy, radical hysterectomy, bilateral saipingo-oophoreotomy, omentectomy, and
staging biopsies.

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Gross Description; _
The specimens are received in seven lormalin~fllled containers, each labeled " The lirst is labeled

“right tube and ovary, FSt/X.“ It contains a white cassette labeled “F81,“ that holds multiple pieces of yellow-tan soft
tissue aggregating to 3 x 2 x 0.3 cm. Labeled At {F81}. Also in the container is a cystic and solid ovary. previously
sectioned, with attached fallopian tube, with the measurements and characteristics described in the intraoperative
non-microscopic consultation. The serosa! surface is light tan and purple, wrinkled but shiny, with a 2.5 x 2 cm
brown-tan surface nodule adjacent to the fallopian tube suspicious for surface tumor involvement. The Interior of the
tumor is yellow-tan, hemorrhagic, and spongy, with solid areas measuring up to 5 cm in maximal dimension. The
fallopian tube has a purple—tan. smooth exterior, and is sectioned to show a pinpoint lumen. Labeled A2 to A4 - tumor in
relation to smooth serosa; A5 to A8 - tumor and capsule in relation to putative surface tumor; A9 to A11 - inferior of solid
tumor; A12 - fallopian tube.

The second container is labeled 'lelt tube and ovary, FS2/X.’ it contains a white cassette labeled "FSZ," that holds
multiple pieces of ten soft tissue, two of which have been previously inked blue, aggregating to 2 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm.
Labeled Bf (F82). Also in the container is a cystic ovary with attached fallopian tube. previously opened, with the
measurements and characteristics described in the intraoperative non-microscopic consultation. After formalin fixation,
the interior of the tumor is tan and fleshy. with solid areas measuring up to 5.5 cm in maximal dimension. The fallopian
tube has a purple-tan, smooth. shiny serosa, and is sectioned to show a pinpoint lumen. Labeled B2 to 89 - tumor in
relation to serosa; i310 - fallopian tube. -

The third container is labeled "rectat tumor.“ it contains a 3 x 1.8 x 0.9 cm piece of heterogeneous white-tan and brown
soft tissue. it is bisected to show a solid cut surface. similar in appearance to the previously described ovarian tumors.
Labeled Of.

The fourth container is labeled ”radical hysterectomy." It contains a uterus and cervix measuring 9 x 5.5 x 4 cm, with
attached 4.5 x 3.5 x 0.7 cm right posterior parametrium. The uterine serosa is tanubrown, smooth, and shiny, with a 0.8
cm subserosat nodule near the left anterior fundus. The 4 x 3 cm whitetan ectocervix has an unremarkable
transformation zone and is without lesions. The cervical resection margin and parametrial soft tissue are inked blue,

and the uterus is bivalved to show a 4.5 x 1.7 cm unremarkable endometrial cavity and endometrial lining, a 2.3 x 1.1

cm unremarkable endocervical canal and endocervicat mucosa, and a 1.5 cm in thickness firm tan myometrium. The
subserosal nodule is sectioned to show a putative lelomyoma. No other tesions are identified. Labeled Di - anterior
cervix; D2 - posterior cervix; D3 - anterior endomyometrium and subserosal leiomyoma; D4 - posterior endometrium; D5
to D7 - parametrial soil tissue, completely submitted from superior to interior. -

The fifth container is labeled 'diaphragm lumbr.‘ It contains a 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm piece of white-tan soft tissue. Labeled
E1. -

The sixth container is labeled “omenttun.” It contains a 24 x 10 x 2 cm piece of brown-yellow ilbroadipose omentum.
The serosa! surface is smooth and shiny, with omental thickening consistent with diffuse involvement by metastatic
disease. These thickened areas are highlighted on cut surface. Labeled Ft to F5. -

The seventh container ls labeled 'right periaortic lymph nodes." it contains two pieces of yellow—tan tibroadipose tissue
aggregating to 2.4 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm. They are dissected to Show two putative lymph nodes measuring 0.9 and 1.9 cm.

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

HISTOLOGIC GRADE
The histologic grade is poorly differentiated (G3)

TUMOR INVASION
Turner is identified on the ovarian surface(s)

TUMOR INVOLVEMENT

Tumor involvement of the pelvic peritoneum/soft tissue is present
Metastatic involvement of the extrapelvic peritoneum is present
Metastatic involvement of the omentum is present

TUMOR SIZE
The maximum dimension of tumor implants outside the true pelvis is macroscopic but less than 2 cm

PRIMARY TUMOR (T)
Based on the above information, the primary tumor is classified as macroscopic peritoneal metastasis beyond pelvis 2
cm or less in greatest dimension (T 3br’lllB)

REGIONAL LYMPH NODES (N)

The regional lymph nodes are classified as regional lymph node metastasis (N1)
The total number of regional lymph nodes examined is 2

The total number of metastatically—involved lymph nodes is t

Extranodai extension by tumor metastases is present

DISTANT METASTASIS (M)

The status of distant tumor site cannot be assesse

STAGE GROUPING

The Final AJCCIUlCC/FIGO stage is TSCthlb/IO (Stage lllC}
TBbei/MX (Stage X)

The pathologlc stage assigned here should be regarded as provisional, and may change after integration of clinical data
not provided with this specimen.
