Comment:

The trichrome stain highlights the mild to moderate postal fibrosis. The reticulin stain shows interrupted
reticuiin frameworsi in the tumor component. The iron stain is negative. The tumor cells are positive for
HepPar—1 ., and negative for Alpha Fetoprotein, cytokeratin 7 and. cytokeratin 20. All of the stains were
performed. with appropriate controls. These results support the above diagnosis.

Gross Description
A The specimen is received fres h, labeled “segment 5 of liver. liver tumor, gallbladder" and
consists of a liver with attached gallbladder. The liver is 190.9 grams, 12.0 x 15 x 5.0 cm. There is a
7.3 x 5.5 it 5.0 cm well circumscribed yellow-tan, Elobulated mass with a central area of hemorrhage
The mass abuts and distends the capsule. The mass is 1.8 cm from doses! surgical margin which is
int-red blue. The remaining liver parenchyma is brown without nodularity. The capsule is otherwise
smooth with no adhesions or nodules. The gallbladder is 15.5 x 10 x 3.5 cm, The serosa is slightly
congested with a small amount of adhesions. The wall averages 0.1 cm in thickness. The mucosa is
ﬂattened. The lumen contains a dark yellow, viscous bile and a 0.8 x 0.8 ‘1‘ 0.5 cm aggregate of
homogeoous- black, nodular, friable stones, which are up to 5.? cm in greatest dimension.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

let-AS; Mass perpendicularto surgical margin with adjacent normal parenchyma.

A3~A4: Mass with capsu to.

A5: Mass with central area of hemorrhage

AB-Ai': Random sections of mass

A8: Normal parenchyma
A9: Cystic duct margin
A10: Gallbladder

A portion of tissue is submitted to Tissue ﬁocurement Laboratory.
