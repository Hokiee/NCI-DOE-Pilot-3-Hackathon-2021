SPECIMEN
A. Transverse colon
B. Appendix

CLINICAL NOTES

PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Please check for microsatelite instability on
specimen A

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin labeled
"transverse colon” is a transverse colon with an abundant portion
of
omentum attached. The omentum is 70.0 x 15.0 x 1.2 cm. The omentum
specimen is sectioned and palpated to show no discrete gross
lesions
identified. Also attached to the specimen is a transverse colon
with partially covered abundant yellow lobular fat. The specimen
is
35.0 and stapled at both ends and arbitrarily inked blue and black.
The specimen is predominantly covered with abundant lobular fat and
the previously described omentum. The specimen is opened to show
pink—tan smooth glistening mucosa with normal to slightly flattened
folds having an average circumference of 6.5 cm. There is a large
exophytic lesion which is 4.5 x 4.2 x 1.0 cm and is 14 cm from the
nearest margin of excision. The tumor grossly involves the
muscularis propria and into the serosa. There is a 1.2 cm.
umbilication in the serosa. The tumor is contiguous with this site.
The cut surface of the tumor shows no discrete invasion into the
fatty tissue. It comes within 7 cm. of the radial margin. No
other
discrete gross lesions are identified in the mucosa. Lymph nodes
are
grossly identified. Representative sections of the specimen are
submitted as follows: Block 1 — representative section of omentum;
2 ~ representative luminal margins; block 3-5 — representative
section of tumor normal, tumor serosa and tumor fat; block 6 w
representative radial margin; block 7 — representative normal; 8—11
h nine possible lymph nodes each; 12 w one possible lymph node

GROSS DESCRIPTION
bisected; 13 — one possible lymph node sectioned. RS—13.

MIC

 

Received in formalin labeled “appendix" is a 9.5 x 0.5
cm. appendix which is partially covered with pink tan

smooth glistening serosa and abundant yellow lobular fat. The
specimen is sectioned to show an intact wall with an average
thickness of 0.3 cm. The lumen ranges from pinpoint to 0.4 cm. and
is partially filled with green fluid feces. No discrete gross
lesions are identified. Representative sections of the sp ' re
submitted in one cassette with the proximal ending. R81. W

ROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma.

Histologic grade: The tumor is predominantly moderately
differentiated with focal poorly differentiated carcinoma

identified.

Primary tumor (pT): The tumor extends through the wall into the
adjacent pericolonic tissue, pT3.

Proximal margin: Negative for tumor.

Distal margin: Negative for tumor.

Circumferential (radial) margin: Tumor comes to within 0.1 cm of
the serosal surface of the specimen; the radial margin is negative.
Distance of tumor from closest margin: 14 cm

Vascular invasion: Not identified.

Regional lymph nodes (pNJ: Two of 26 lymph nodes positive for
metastatic carcinoma (2/26).

Distant metastasis (pM): pr.

5x1, 2x1

DIAGNOSIS

A. Colon, transverse, excision — Invasive adenocarcinoma (see

tumor

characteristics in the microscopic description).
Tumor is submitted for microsatellite instability testing and

an
addendum will be issued when the report is received.
B. Appendix, appendectomy — Appendix with fibrous obliteration of
the tip.
