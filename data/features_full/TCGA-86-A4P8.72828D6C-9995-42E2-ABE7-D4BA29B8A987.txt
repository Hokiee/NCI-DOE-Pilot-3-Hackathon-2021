Diagnosis Details: Adenocarcinoma

Comments: The prior FNA specimen is discordant in that tumor cells are seen in stations 4 and 11 on the
resection, but not in the FNA specimens from those areas. The FNA was reviewed in conjunction with
this case, and since tumor cells are not present in the FNA, the discordance most likely represents
