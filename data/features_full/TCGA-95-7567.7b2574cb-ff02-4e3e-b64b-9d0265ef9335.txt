Gross Description
Specimen A is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and as "#7
lymph node.“ The specimen consists of multiple soft tissue fragments measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm in aggregate. Multiple lymph

node fragments are identiﬁed, and submitted entirely for frozen i diagnosis as "A1FS" through "A3FS." The remaining
adipose tissue is submitted in cassette "A4." Dictated byﬂ‘

Specimen B is received fresh for intraoperative diagnosis, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and as "4R
lymph node." The specimen consists of a soft tissue fragment measuring 3.5 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm. Two lymph nodes are identiﬁed
measuring 1.5 and 1.2 cm in greatest dimension, respectively. The smaller lymph node is submitted entirely for frozen section

diagnosis as "B1FS" and the larger lymph node is submitted entirel f r tion diagnosis as "B2FS." The remaining
adipose tissue is submitted in cassette "BS" and "B4." Dictate

Specimen C is received fresh for intraoperative consultation and is labeled "11R sump node." It consists ofa single lymph node
measuring 1 ' ' ' ' ' ' ' 'n cassette "C1FS." This frozen

Specimen D consists of a skin ellipse measuring 5.0 x 1.1 cm excised to a depth of 1.2 cm. A crusted round lesion is present on
the skin surface measuring 1.4 x 0.9 cm and located less than 1.0 mm from one resection edge and 2.0 mm from the opposite
resection edge. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted as described below.

Specimen E is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and "posterior 11R sump." The

specimen consists ofa fraiment of soft tissue measuring 1.3 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette

Specimen G is received fresh for intraoperative consultation and labeled with the patient's name, medical record number and as
"right upper lobe The specimen consists ofa lobe of lung measuring 18.0 x 9.0 x 7.5 cm, weighing 325 grams. A ﬁrm tumor
with irregular border and necrosis is present in the hilar invading the bronchus measuring 6.3 x 6.3 x 5.0 cm. The tumor is 0.5
cm from the bronchial and vascular margins, and abuts the pleura. Parietal pleura is focally adhered to the posterior lung, and is
identiﬁed by the surgeon, and inked blue. This area is 3.5 cm from tumor. A slightly ﬁrm nodule is present on the visceral pleura
adjacent to the parietal pleura measuring 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The remaining lung is unremarkable. The shave bronchial margin
is submitted for frozen section diagnosis as "GI FS." A representative section of the tumor is submitted for frozen section
diagnosis as "GZFS; and a touch prep of the tumor is submitted as "G2TP." The specimen is inked as follows: visceral pleura
black, pariet . Representative sections of the tumor and normal lung are submitted for Tissue Procurement.
