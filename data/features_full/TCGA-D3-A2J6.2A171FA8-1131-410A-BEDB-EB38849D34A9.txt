INK CODE: None.

SECTION CODE: A1-A2, representative largest lymph node metastasis; A3-A7, additional lymph node metastases, one
representative node each; A8, three lymph nodes; A9, two lymph nodes; A10, two possible lymph nodes; A11, two possible lymph
nodes; A12, three possible lymph nodes; A13, representative unremarkable skin.

(B) lLlAC AND OBTURATOR LYMPH NODE - A yellow, fibrofatty tissue fragment measures overall 12.0 x 8.0 x 4.0 cm. Twenty-
four lymph nodes are identiﬁed, 7.0 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm and the smallest 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. Multiple lymph nodes are grossly positive
with a black surface.

SECTION CODE: Bl, representative of largest grossly positive lymph node; BZ, representative section of one grossly
posrtive lymph node; B3, representative section of one lymph node; B4, representative section of one lymph node; B5, one lymph

node; 86, two lymph nodes; 87, three lymph nodes: 38. two lymph nodes; 89, two lymph nodes; B10, two lymph nodes; 811, six
