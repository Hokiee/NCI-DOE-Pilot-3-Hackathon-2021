GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Omentum (AF1}", received fresh for frozen section. A 320.0 gram, 15.5 x
11.5 x 2.5 cm portion of tan—yellow, firm fibroadipOSe tissue with diffuse
adhesions and white-tan adherent exudate is received. The specimen is
serially sectioned to exhibit a tan—yellow, firm, cut surface throughout, i.e.
tumor size greater than 2 cm. A representative section has been previously

frozen as AFl and the frozen section remnant is entirely submitted in block
Al. An additional representative section is submitted in block A2.

8. "Right tube and ovary", received fresh and placed in formalin. A 101.0
gram, 8.0 x 5.8 x 3.7 cm ovary with an adherent 5.5 cm long fimbriated
fallopian tube. The surface of the ovary is focally disrupted and is serially
sectioned to exhibit a 4.5 x 3.8 x 2.8 cm thin walled cyst filled with a
yellow~tan, waxy, sebaceous material, and a small amount of white-tan mucinous
material. A 2.2 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm tan, friable nodule is attached to the cyst
wall. No additional masses or papillary excrescenses are grossly

identified. The remainder of the parenchyma is replaced by a white—tan, firm
tissue and multiple thin walled cysts up to 2.0 cm, one of which is lined by
papillary excrescenses.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

D. "Left tube and ovary", received fresh and placed in formalin. A 50.0 gram,
6.5 x 5.0 x 2.2 cm Ovary with an attached and focally embedded fimbriated
fallopian tube is received. The surface of the ovary is disrupted and rough
with multiple adhesions. The ovary is serially sectioned to exhibit a firm,
white—tan cut surface with multiple cysts up to 2.2 cm in greatest dimension,
one of which is lined by papillary excrescenses. No normal ovarian tissue is
grossly identified. The fallopian tube is 5.2 cm long with an average
diameter of 0.4 cm.

05 which opens into a 2.0 cm long tan, trabeculated endocervical canal. The
3.4 x 1.5 cm endometrial cavity is lined by a tan, smooth endometrium. The
0.1 cm endometrium overlies a 1.3 cm myometrium remarkable for a 1.3 cm in
greatest dimension, white, well—circumscribed, whorled nodule with a bulging

 

cut surface. Representative sections of cervix are submitted in Block El—2
and representative sections of endomyometrium are submitted in blocks E3-4.

F. "Left cul—de—sac", received fresh and placed in formalin. Received is a
5.2 x 4.5 x 1.6 cm fragment of tan—yellow fibroadipose tissue which is focally
indurated. Sectioning reveals a white—tan, firm cut surface with yellow,
lobulated adipose tiseue. A representative section is submitted in Block Fl.

G. "Rectosigmoid colon", received fresh and placed in formalin. Received is a
16.0 cm long unoriented segment of large intestine that ranges in
circumference from 2.5 cm up to 5.5 cm. The serosa is diffusely covered with
adhesions and multiple fecal areas of induration. The lumen is focally
stenotic and surrounded by indurated, yellow, lobulated adipose tissue. The
mucosa is pink—tan and grossly unremarkable. Sectioning exhibits areas of
white—tan, firm tissue deep to the mucosa, which corresponds to the areas of
induration on the serosa.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: Hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo—oohphorectomy, omentectomy,

partial colectomy, multiple biopsies.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE {AJCC 6th Edition): pT3C pNX pMX

NOTE: Information on patholog sta e and the o erative procedure is
accreditation by the Pathology stage is based solely

upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.
