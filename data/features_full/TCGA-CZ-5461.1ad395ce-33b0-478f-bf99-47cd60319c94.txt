PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:

RIGHT KIDNEY, NEPHRECTOMY:

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CLEAR CELL PE (6.4 cm), Fuhrman nuclear grade IV
of IV, with FOCAL SARCOMATOID DIFFERENTIATION and focal papillary

features.
The tumor is confined to the kidney.

No vascular inva81on 1cent1:1éﬁ?“‘
The vascular, ureteric, and soft t' sue margins are negative for tumor.

Non—neoplastic kidney will be evaluated by the Renal Pathology Service

and reported in an addendum.
AJCC Classification (6th Edition): le NX MX.

NOTE: This case was also reviewed by Dr.—Pathology Service,

who concurs.

CLINICAL DATA:

History: A with metast C RCC.
Operation: None given. I
Operative Findings: None given

Clinical Diagnosis: None given.

TISSUE SUBMITTED:
Right kidney.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: '
The specimen is submitted fresh, in one part, labeled with the patient's name,

unit number, and "#1. Right kidney", and consists of 451.5—gram right
nephrectomy measuring 17.0 x 6.3 x 5.0 cm in overall dimension with 0.8 cm in
length x 1.1 cm in diameter vein, 1.5 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter artery,
and 4.2 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter ureter. Resection margin is inked
black. There is a 6.2 x 5.3 x 4.5 cm tan/white to tan/yellow focally cystic
focally hemorrhagic partially encapsulated mass at the inferior pole of the
kidney, which is abutting kidney capsule (less than 0.1 cm away from in inked
margin}, 4.2 cm away from the vein margin, 5.6 cm away from the artery margin,
and 7.8 cm away from the ureteral margin. Representative sections of the mass
are submitted for cytogenetics and tissue bank for special studies.
Representative sections of the normal kidney parenchyma are submitted for
electron microscopy, immunofluorescence and tissue bank for special studies.
No adrenal gland is grossly identified. Mass does not appear to grossly invade

perirenal fat.

KARYOTIPE: T1:46,XY,del(3){p1?2p1?4)[5} T2: 46,XY,del(3)(p1?2p1?4)[5]

METAPHASES COUNTED: 10 ANALYZED: 10 SCORED: BANDING: GTG

INTERPRETATION: . .
Three different specimens were received. An interstitial deletion was seen in

specimen labeled T1 and T2, a characteristic finding in renal cell carcinoma,
clear cell type.
I

No metaphases were available from specimen T3, therefore the cytogenetic
analysis could not be performed.

COMMENTS:
Mosaicism and small chromosOme anomalies may not be detectable using the

standard methods employed. Chromosome analysis was performed at a level of
400 bands or greater.

INDICATION FOR TEST:
? RCC. Tumors 1—3
