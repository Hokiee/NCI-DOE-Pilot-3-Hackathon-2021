A. LEFT COLON

SPECIMEN(S):
A. LEFT COLON

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. LEFT COLON
Received fresh is an unoriented, closed segment of colon measuring 28 cm in length. The external
circumference is 8.2 cm. The serosa has numerous adhesions and a firm nodule measuring 11 x 8.5 x 6
cm. The serosa is inked black. The specimen is opened; there is an annular, indurated, ulcerated mass
with serpentine borders measuring 10.7 x 8.5 x 6 cm. H is necrotic and extends through the muscular
propria into the mesocolonic fat. It is located 8 and 10 cm from either surgical margin. 2.5 cm from the
mass and 7.5 cm from the margin is a pedunculated polyp measuring 4.5 x 3.7 x 3 cm. It has
superficial a depth of invasion. Extending from the sessile polyp to the margin are numerous polyps
ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 cm. Multiple lymph nodes are identified. A portion of the mass is submitted for
tissue procurement. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
A1 -A2: margins
A3-A5: mass including deep margin
A6-A7: mesocolonic fat and mass
A8: mass and possible diverticula
A9-A10: mass in relationship to normal-appearing mucosa
A1 1-A14: mass extending into the mesocolonic fat
A15: polyps
A16-A17: section of pedunculated polyp en bloc
A18: pedunculated polyp and stalk
A19: pedunculated polyp
A20: normal-appearing mucosa
A21 -A24: proximal 6 lymph nodes each
A25-A27: proximal 4 lymph nodes each
A28: proximal 1 matted lymph node
A30-A38: distal 6 possible lymph nodes each
A39-A40: distal 2 bisected lymph nodes each

DIAGNOSIS:
A. LEFT COLON, RESECTION:

MUSCULARIS PROPRIA INTO SUBSEROSA WITH PERINEURAL INVASION.
- EXTENSIVE INTRAMURAL SUPPURATIVE NECROSIS
-TUBULOVILLOUS ADENOMA WITH FOCAL HIGH GRADE DYSPLASIA
-HYPERPLASTIC POLYPS(MULTIPLE)
-MARGINS NEGATIVE
-METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA IN ONE OF EIGHTY TWO LYMPH NODES (1/82)
