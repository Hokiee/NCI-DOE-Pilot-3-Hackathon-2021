Gross Description:

The specimen is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name, and labeled "left kidney."
Specimen components and dimensions: The specimen consists of a left kidney

received with a moderate amount of attached fat. The specimen has overall

dimensions of 23.4 x 8.7 x 5.2 cm. The renal parenchyma has dimensions of 14.2 x

6.4 x 3.8 cm. An adrenal gland is not present. The specimen is received

previously inked and incised.

Size, appearance, and location of tumor: The specimen is remarkable for

numerous nodules/masses that range from 0.2 x 0.2 by less than 0.2 cm to 6.7 x

5.9 x 4.4 cm. The dominate mass resides within the lower pole. The masses are
yellow-orange to red-brown, granular and homogenous to variegated and focally
hemorrhagic. These nodules/masses range from ill defined to well defined and
encapsulated. The total number of nodules/masses is approximately 12.
Renal capsule/renal sinus: Some of the nodules/masses extend to, but not beyond
the capsule. The renal sinus fat does not grossly appear to be invaded.
Renal vein: The renal vein is not invaded and is grossly negative at the
margin.
Lymph nodes (size, number, & location): An exhaustive search of the hilar fat
to include the use of palpation and chemical clearing agent reveals no grossly
appreciable lymph nodes.
Other ﬁndings: Additionally, there are a few cysts present that range from
minute to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. The cysts contain gray—yellow, serous
fluid. The cortical surface is red-brown, granular with numerous ill defined,
yellow-orange granular foci, which are grossly similar to the aforementioned
nodules/masses. The renal parenchyma is red-brown with an ill deﬁned to well
defined corticomedullary border and a cortical thickness that maximizes at
approximately 0.5 cm. Additionally, there are a few ill defined, yellow-orange
granular foci present, which are grossly similar to the aforementioned
nodules/masses. Some of the papillary tips are hemorrhagic. The urothelium is
gray-white, smooth and glistening with some edema.
Blocks submitted:

1 vascular and ureter margins en face;

2-5 dominant nodule/mass to include renal sinus fat in cassettes 2-3
and capsule and inked external surface in cassettes

4 and 5;

6-9 smaller nodules/masses to include renal sinus fat in cassettes 6-7

and capsule and inked external surface in
cassettes 8 and 9;

10 ill defined, yellow-orange granular foci;

11 cysts;

12 hemorrhagic papillary tip;

13 normal most renal parenchyma and urothelium.

Gross images have been taken of the specimen.
Microscopic Description:

The final diagnosis of each specimen incorporates the microscopic examination
findings.
