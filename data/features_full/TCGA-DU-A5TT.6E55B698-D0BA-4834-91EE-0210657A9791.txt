Clinical History

-year—old man experienced new onset seizure, and on imaging study had a mostly non-enhancing
lesion in
the left frontal premotor area at the level of the middle frontal gyrus, without choline spike. However,
seizure activity
has increased and enhancement appears to have enlarged.

A, B. Brain, left frontal tumor, excisional biopsies:
1. Oligodendroglioma, anaplastlc (WHO 3).

2. 1p. 19g LOH (codelation): Positive.

3. lDH1-R132l-I, lmmunohistochernistry: Negative.
4. Methylated MGMT promoter: Positive.

5. MIB-‘l proliferation index: 1.8%.

See Microscopy Description and Comment.
Comment

The sections contain portions of cerebrum that are inﬁltrated and extensively effaced by a glial neoplastic
proliferation

in which there are frequently mitoses. The neoplasm has a mixed cellularity. The MlB-1 proliferation index
is 18%
in the more active areas. There is focal microvascular cellular proliferation. There is not tumor necrosis.

The morphological features are those of a glioma with anaplastic features. The glioma has codelation of
arms 1p

and 19q, a feature characteristic of oligodendrogliomas.

Loss of Heterozygosity 1p. 19q Assay (LOH)
Date Ordered: Date Reported:
Interpretation
POSlTlVE: Allelic toss on chromosome arm 1p and chromosome arm 19q is detected.
informative loci are: 0181592, 018552, 0198219, 0198412
Results-Comments

Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor parafﬁn block (A1). DNA extracted
from a

corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.

H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)! Tumor DNA
pairs using 3

markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1p are D1S548, D1 81 592, and 015552 (with D1 S468,
D1 $1612. and

D1 S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are 0198219. 0198412. and PLA2G4C (with
0198606 and

01981182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLAZG4C which is a
minisatellite (26

nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, am plicon size, and
ease of

interpretation. The backup markers are used if the ﬁrst line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or

otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the

typical ﬁnding in oligodendrogliomas with 1p and 19q deletion.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand-alone diagnostic
test. This test

was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the

as required

by CLIA ' 88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for speciﬁc uses by the US. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are

provided for informational purposes only. and should be interpreted only in the context of established
procedures

and/or diagnostic criteria.

TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in the sample may preclude the
detection of

allelic loss.

Interpretation
POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected.
Results-Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block (A1)
H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to
beneﬁt
from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulﬁte
treatment of
DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences. The
analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into
unmethylated DNA. and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated
DNA. Factors

such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may
preclude the
detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences.

Microscopic Description

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The CD163 demonstrates numerous microglial cells in between the
neoplastic cells.

The IDH1 stain is negative. With the MlB-1 there is a proliferation index of about 18% in the more active
areas. The

0034 depicts focal neovascularization and focal microvascular cellular proliferation.
