FLUORESCENCE IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION (FISH) for EGFR in BRAIN

 

 

Tissue Block: -

RESULTS: POLYSOMY of chromosome 7 (See note below)

Number of celis evaluated: 40

INTERPRETATION:

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FiSH) anaiysis on a brain tumor sample from this patient with Abbott
Moiecular probes specific for the centromere of chromosome 7 (control probe) and the short arm (EGFR-
7p12) of chromosome 7 was performed. The control sample gave expected resuits.

These studies showed polysomy of chromosome 7 in 80% of the nuclei examined. in brain tumors this
signal pattern correlates with an amplified EGFR signal pattern.

NOTE:
1. Samples are considered positive in brain it the EGFR to CEP 7 signal ratio is 2 2.0 in 2 10% of
anaiyzed cells or tumors with four or more copies of the EGFR gene in 2 40% of the cells (high

poiysomy).

2. Sampies are considered inconclusive, requiring consult with the pathologist, in brain if the EGF R to
CEP 7 signal ratio is a 2.0 in <10% of analyzed cells or when four or more copies of the EGFR gene in <
40% of the cells.

References:

These FISH tests were developed and their performance characteristics determined by -
3 required by the CLIA .reguiaffons. They have not been cleared or
approved for specific uses by the US. Food and Drug Administration.

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for EWSR1 Disruption

 

RESULTS: See Comment
FISH NOMENCLATURE: nuc ish(EWSR1x2)[iST/200]

COMMENT: This test is in validation and is intended for research use only. Within this limitation, no
disruption of EWSR1 was identified.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with a commercially available probe F
that serves to identify a disruption of the EWSR1 (Ewings sarcoma region) gene locate at d was
carried out on 200 interphase ceiis. Three of the cells showed a disruption of the EWSR1 gene. This
value is simiiar to the value obtained from a normal control. This result is consistent with the ABSENCE of

the translocation involving 22q12.

i have iersonaili examined the siecimen, interiretod the results, reviewed the report and signed it electronically.
