A. Segment 6 partial liver resection: Received fresh labeled. gment 6 partial liver resection.” is
an 85-gram lobe of liver measuring 7 x 7 x 6 cm. The surface of the liver s a bosselated. The resection margin
is marked with green ink and the specimen is serially sectioned revealing an ill-defined tan-white soft mass
measuring 3. 5 x 2.8 x 2. 5 cm. The mass lies 0.7 cm from the closest resection margin and within 0.1 cm of the
aerosol surface of the liver. The remaining cut surfaces shows a grossly nonnal brown liver parenchyma.
Representative sections of the mass and norms liver are submitted for tissue banking. Gross photographs of the
intact and sectioned specimen are taken. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for permanent
section: A1) Mass and serosal surface. A2) Mass at closest margin. ‘As-M) Mass. A5) Nonneoplastic liver.

  

 

Is. Gallbladder. Received in formalin labeled Gallbladder" and consists of an intact
gallbladder measuring 10 x 4 cm The cystic duct marg a with yellow ink and is shaved and submitted on
face. The gallbladder serosa is purple-tan. smooth and glistening. 0n the hepatic aspect of the gallbladder near the
across is a raised soft cyst-like area measuring 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. This area is overmarked with green
ink. The gallbladder mucosa is ten and velvety with no distinct masses. polyps. or plaques. The gallbladder wail
has an average thickness of 0.2 cm. The cystic duct' Is nondllatad. No gallstones are identiﬁed with the gallbladder
lumen or specimen container. Representative sections including the cyst-like area in its entirety are submitted. 81)
Cystic duct and random sections. 82) Cyst-like area.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:

A Sections show a nodular mass with areas of ﬁbrous septation. The nodules are composed of sheets and
focal trabecular arrangements of atypical cells The mostly polygonal cells show marked variability in size. There
are many very large cells with bizarre nuclei. Most of the cells show clear cytoplasm with distinct cell borders. In the
more trabecular areas. the cells are smaller with more eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic figures. includng atypical
ones. are common. The parenchymal resection margin Is negative for tumor. No lymphovescular invasion is seen.
The tumor abuts. but does not penetrate. the liver capsule. The hepatic parenchyme away from the mass shows a
minimal lymphocytic infiltrate of the portal tracts. No notable ﬁbrosis is seen by HBIE. There is no suggestion of
nodularity. No lobuler activity is appreciated. Many of the hepatocytes have brown granular pigment.

8. Along the serosel surface. adjacent to a minimal amount of hepatic parenchyma. is a thin. ﬁbrous cyst wall
which is lined by a single layer of low cuboidal to ﬂattened. bland epithelial cells. The gallbladder mucosa shows a
minlrnal lymphoch inﬁltrate. There is no dysplasia or malignancy.
