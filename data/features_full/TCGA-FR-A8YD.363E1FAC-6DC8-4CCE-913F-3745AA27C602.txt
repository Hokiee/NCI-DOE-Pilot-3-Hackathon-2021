Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis:
Frozen section requested by Dr. in

FSAl: Left lower lobe, wedge resection

— Poorly differentiated malignancy suspicious for metastatic
melanoma

Drs. on
Frozen Section Pathologist: , MD

Clinical History:
—year—old female with history of T4B NO vulvar melanoma, status
post radical vulvectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Recent CT

showed left lower lobe lung solitary pulmonary nodule concerning for
metastatic disease.

Gross Description:

Specimen A is labeled "left lower lobe lung mass" and consists of a
10 gram, half wedge of lung (4.7 x 3.5 x 1.1 cm). Along the exposed
cut surface is a 1.8 x 1.6 x 1.0 cm well-circumscribed firm smooth
black/brown nodule that is 0.2 cm to the parenchymal margin
underlying the staple line (inked blue). The nodule is 0.4 cm from
the pleura. The uninvolved parenchyma is spongy tan and the pleura

is smooth and glistening. A portion of the nodule is frozen as
representative FSAl.

Block Summary:
FSAl — Frozen section remnant

A2-A3 — Perpendicular nodule with parenchymal margin
A4 - Normal lung away from nodule

Specimen B is labeled "left lower lobe wedge" and consists of a 6
gram (6.7 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm) lung wedge that contains two staple lines,
one of which has two attached sutures indicated as first staple line
margin. The parenchyma underlying the first staple line is inked
blue and the parenchymal margin underlying the other staple line is
inked black. The parenchyma is spongy tan and without nodules. The
pleura is intact, smooth and glistening. Representative cross
sections of the two parenchymal margins in B1—B3.

Specimen C is received in a formalin filled container labeled with
the patient‘s name and labeled "station 9" and consists of a 0.9 x
0.8 x 0.4 cm aggregate of two fragments of black/gray lymph node

tissue. The largest fragment is bisected and all fragments submitted
in C1,

Specimen D is received in a formalin filled container labeled with
the patient's name and labeled "station 11" and consists of a 0.4 X

0.3 x 0.2 cm fragment of black/gray lymph node tissue, submitted in
D1,

Specimen E is received in a formalin filled container labeled with
the patient‘s name and labeled "left lower lobe lung mass" and
consists of a 5 gram (5.2 x 3.1 x 1.6 cm) half of wedge of lung. At
the exposed parenchyma cut surface there is a 1.1 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm
well—circumscribed soft tan/brown nodule that grossly abuts the
parenchyma margin underlying the staple line (inked blue and is 0.2
cm from the pleura). The remainder of the parenchyma away from the
nodule is spongy tan and the pleura is smooth and glistening.
Perpendicular sections of nodule with parenchymal margin in El and
E2 and normal lung away from nodule in E3.

Light Microscopy:
Light microscopic examination performed by Dr.

All three wedge resections show nodules with discohesive tumor
cells, large nuclei and nucleoli and binuculeation. Morphology
favors metastatic malignant melanoma. Immunostains are performed and
show S-100 is positive in all three nodules (specimens A, B and E)
and cytokeratin is negative. MART—1 is also positive in specimen A.
The findings are confirmatory of metastatic malignant melanoma. No
primary bronchogenic carcinoma is identified.
