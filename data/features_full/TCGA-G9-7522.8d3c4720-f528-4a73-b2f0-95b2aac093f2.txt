GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. PROSTATE
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and "prostate" a 29 g resected prostate gland
measuring 2.8 cm from right lateral to left lateral, 3.3 cm from anterior to posterior, and 2.1 cm from
apex to base. The capsule is, smooth red, and intact. Ink code: Anterior-orange, posterior-black, right
lateral-green, left lateral-yellow, base-blue, apex-red. After removal of apex to base, the prostate

weighs 17 g and has a nodular tan parenchyma. The right seminal vesicle is 4.6 x 2.3 x 0.5 cm and the
left is 4.6 x 1.8 x 0.4 cm; they consist of cystic tan tissue. The right vas deferens is 3.5 x 0.8 cm and the
left is 3.1 x 0.6 cm; they consist of tubular tan tissue. Tissue is procured (10 9); submitted entirely:
A1 -A2: perpendicular section of apex

A3: level I, right side

A4: level I, left side

A5-A6: level II, right lateral and posterior capsule

A7: level II, left lateral and anterior capsule

A8: level III, right anterior

A9: level III, right posterior

A10: level III, left anterior

A11: level III, left posterior

A12: perpendicular section of right mid base

A13: perpendicular section of left mid base

A14-A15: perpendicular sections of right lateral base

A16-A17: perpendicular sections of left lateral base

A18: perpendicular section of right posterior base

A19: perpendicular section of left posterior base

A20: perpendicular section of right mid base urethral orifice margin

A21: perpendicular section of left mid base urethral orifice margin

A22: right seminal vesicle and vas deferens

A23: left seminal vesicle and vas deferens

B. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and "left pelvic lymph nodes" are pieces of
yellow-tan soft tissue, 4.7 x 3.5 x 1.1 cm containing 3 possible lymph nodes measuring 1.7 x 1 x 0.4 cm,
1.9 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm, and 3.2 x 1 x 0.5 cm. The largest lymph node is bisected and has a yellow-tan cut
surface; submitted entirely:

B1: 1 bisected lymph node

B2:2 lymph nodes

B3-B5: remainder of soft tissue

C. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and "right pelvic lymph node" are pieces of

yellow-tan soft tissue in aggregate, 4.7 x 3.5 x 1 cm containing possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 x
0.2 x 0.2 cm to 2.1 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm. The largest lymph node is bisected and has a uniform yellow-tan cut

surface; submitted entirely:

C1 -C2: 2 possible lymph nodes in each cassette

C3: 1 bisected lymph node

C4-C5: remainder of soft tissue

None given
