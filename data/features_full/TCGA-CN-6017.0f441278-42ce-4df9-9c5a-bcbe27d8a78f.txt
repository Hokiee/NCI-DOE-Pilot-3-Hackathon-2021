My s1gnature 1s attestation that I have personally reviewed the submitted
material(s) and the final diagnosis reﬂects that evaluation.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in seven parts.

Part 1 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled with the
patient' s name, initials XXX and "left base of tongue". It consists of two
fragments of tan-brown, soft tissue measuring 0.6 X 0.5 X 0.4 cm and 0.5 X 0.3
X 0.2 cm. The frozen tissue is submitted for permanent section in cassette
1AFS.

Part 2 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and

"left hemiglossectomy, stitch is anterior". It consists of a 5.5 X 3.6 X 2.5

cm apparent hemiglossectomy. A stitch marks the anterior aspect. On cut
section a White, irregular, unencapsulated poorly defined tumor, measuring 4.7

X 3.4 X 2.5 cm, is seen within the tongue. Digital photographs are taken.
Tissue is collected for banking.

Part 3 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and
"additional deep margin". It consists of a tan-brown portion of soft tissue.
The frozen tissue is submitted for permanent sections in cassette 3AFS. The
remainder of the tissue is submitted in cassette 3B.

Part 4 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and

"left neck level 2, long stitch at 2A, short is 2B". It consists of an 8.7 X

4.5 X 1.5 cm portion of yellow adipose tissue and tan-pink fibrous tissue. A
long stitch marks level 2A and a short stitch marks level 2B. A separate
fragment of adipose tissue measuring 2.6 X 0.7 X 0.5 cm is also included. The
separate fragment contains two possible lymph nodes, measuring 0.6 X 0.6 X 0.6
cm and 1.0 X 0.6 X 0.6 cm. Level 2A contains siX possible lymph nodes
measuring 0.5 X 0.4 X 0.2 cm to 2.0 X 1.7 X 1.1 cm. Level 2B contains eleven
possible lymph nodes measuring 0.3 X 0.2 X 0.2 cm to 1.7 X 1.1 X 0.4 cm and an
enlarged lymph node measuring 3.0 X 1.8 X 1.4 cm.

SECTION CODE:

4A two possible lymph nodes from separate segment of tissue

4B siX lymph nodes from level 2A

4C thru 4D enlarged lymph node, level 2B, bisected

4E one lymph node from level 2B, bisected

4F two lymph nodes from level 2B

4G two lymph nodes from level 2B

4H three lymph nodes from level 2B

41 four lymph nodes from level 2B.

Part 5 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and

"left neck levels 3 and 4". It consists of a 4.0 X 3.7 X 0.6 cm unoriented
portion of yellow adipose tissue and tan-pink fibrous tissue. Level 3

contains two possible lymph nodes measuring up to 1.6 X 1.5 X 0.5 cm. Level 4
contains eight possible lymph nodes measuring between 0.1 X 0.1 X 0.1 cm and
0.8 X 0.6 X 0.3 cm.

SECTION CODE:

5A one lymph node from level 3, bisected

5B - one lymph node from level 3, bisected

5C three lymph nodes from level 4

5D ﬁve lymph nodes from level 4.

Part 6 is received fresh labeled with the patient' s name, initials XXX and

"left neck level 1A and B". It consists of an 11.0 X 4.9 X 1.9 portion of
unoriented yellow adipose tissue and tan-pink ﬁbrous tissue containing a 4.8
X 4.5 X 1.8 cm submandibular gland and eight possible lymph nodes ranging from
0.3 X 0.2 X 0.2 cm to 1.0 X 0.9 X 0.5 cm.

SECTION CODE:

6A four possible lymph nodes from level 1A

6B four possible lymph nodes from level 1A

6C one possible lymph node, bisected from level 1B

6D three possible lymph nodes from level 1B

6E representative section of submandibular gland from level 1B.

Part 7 is received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled with the
patient' s name, initials XXX and "additional posterior margin, stitch is
anterior, ink on true margin". It consists of three fragments of brown, soft
tissue measuring 2.5 X 1.5 X 1.3 cm, 0.5 X 0.5 X 0.2 cm, and 2.4 X 2.1 X 0.4
cm. The ﬁrst two fragments of frozen tissue are submitted for permanent
section in cassette 7AFS. The third fragment of frozen tissue is submitted
for permanent section in cassette 7BFS.

M£JSCOPIO

Microscopic examination substantiates the above diagnosis.

The following statement applies to all immunohistochemistry, Insitu
Hybridization Assays (ISH & FISH), Molecular Anatomic Pathology, and
Immunoﬂuorescent Testing:

The testin was develo ed and its performance characteristics determined by
the Department of Pathology, as required by the CLIA
I regu ations. T e testmg has not been cleared or approved for the

specific use by the US. Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA has
determined such approval is not necessary for clinical use. Tissue ﬁxation

ranges from a minimum 0! a maximum 0! hours.
This laboratory is certifie un er the Clinical La oratory Improvement
Amendments of ("CLIA") as qualified to perform high-complexity clinical
testing. Pursuant to e requirements of CLIA, ASR's used in this laboratory
have been established and verified for accuracy and precision. Additional
