gross Description

Specimen is received in 2 parts:

Afl’he specimen is labeled "RIGHT SENTINEL NOD ” and is received unﬁxed. It consists of 4 x 4 x 1 cm fragment of fatty tissue
which reveals 6 lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.3»2 x l x 1 cm. All lymph nodes are entirely submitted as follows:

A1 = possible two lymph nodes

A2 = bisection of a single lymph node

A3—A4 = entire sections of single lymph node

Specimen is in formalin more than 6 hours and less than 48 hours

Time specimen was removed from the patient: ‘

Time specimen was placed in formalin 2

lschemic time: 16 minutes

B. The specimen labeled ”RIGHT BREAST TISSUE" is received in formalin. (Specimen is in formalin more than 6 hours and less
then 48 hours). It consists of an ovoid piece of yellow-tan fatty tissue with 3 sutures designating double long - 12 o'clock, single long -
6 o'clock and double short - deep margin. A needle guide wire is inserted within the specimen. The specimen measures 5 x 4 x 3.5
cm. is oriented and inked as follows: Anterior-yellow, posterior-black, superior-orange, inferior-red, medial-blue, and lateral margin
with green color. On sectioning. the cut surface shows centrally, a. 2 x 2 x 1.8 cmin ill-deﬁned mass with 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm
calciﬁcation. Entirely submitted in cassettes B 1-329.

lmmunohistochemical studie‘s were performed on formalin fixed, parafﬁn—embedded tissue (Block 5 A1, A2, A3 8:. A4) with adequate
positive and negative control sections. Al and A2 each shows a single positive cells, A3 reveals 2 positive cells and A4 is entirely

negative. Immunohistochemical stains were also performed on B 18 with appmpriste positive and negative controls. The results are as
follows:
