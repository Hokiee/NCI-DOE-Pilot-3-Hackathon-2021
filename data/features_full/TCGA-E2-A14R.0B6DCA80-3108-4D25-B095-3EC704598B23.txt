ER: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0
PR: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0
COMMENT:

The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the proportion score
(0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of
cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate
intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring range from 0 to 8.

ER/PR positive is deﬁned as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is deﬁned as an Allred score of less than
or equal to 2.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.

Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 105, 1:100) and PR (PGR 136. 1:100)

provided by Dako A) following the manufacturer 5 instructions. This assay was not modiﬁed.
Interpretation of the tH/PR rmmunonistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature.
information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
-year-old Caucasian female with palpable leﬂ breast mass. Ultrasound showed 2 masses at 12 o'clock position,
largest one 2.0 cm. Core biopsy showed DCIS, here for wide local excision and sentinel node biopsy.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis
was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit (Dako, Carpenteria, CA) using rabbit anti-
human HER2. This assay was not modiﬁed. External kit-slides provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high,
low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-house known HER2 ampliﬁed control tissue were evaluated along
with the test tissue. Adequate, well preserved, clear—cut invasive carcinoma was identiﬁed for HER2 evaluation.
Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature,
information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.

This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and CAP
and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology Department takes full responsibility
for this test's performance.
