The cervical lesion is an unusual one since it is predominantly exophytic with some thinning of the
underlying normal cervix. The 0.5 cm is the exocervlcal resection margin from the tumor. The invasion is
one-third or less of the thickness of the cervix. The case was discussed with on

GROSS DESCRIPTION
The case is received in 10 parts. all labeled with the patient's name

Part A is received in formalin labeled “right obturator lymph nodes —- F/S” is a 4.5 x 2.5 x 1 cm aggregate
of yellow-tan fibroadipose tissue containing 4 lymph nodes, measuring 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm. 3 x 1 x 0.7 cm,
0.9 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. and 1 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm, respectively. Touch preparations on the two smaller nodes are
performed and part of the largest node and part of the medium node are touch prepped and frozen as
FSA1 and FSA2. The frozen section residuals are submitted in cassettes (A1) and (A2). The remainder
of the nodes are submitted in cassettes (A3) and (A4).

Frozen section diagnosis: by
FSA1 -— Right obturator node (largest node) — “Negative."
FSA2 - Right obturator node (medium node) — "Negative.”

Touch prep cytology:
FSA3 — Right obturator node (two small ones) - “Negative on cytology.”

Part G is received in formalin labeled “external iliac artery lymph nodes" and consists of a 4 x 2 x 1 cm
aggregate of yellow-tan fibroadlpose tissue containing 2 lymph nodes, ranging from 0.5 — 3 cm in greatest
dimension. The first node is submitted entirely in cassette (G1). The second node is bisected and
submitted in cassette (62).

Part H is received fresh in the frozen section room labeled “left obturator lymph nodes (F/S)" and consists
of a 3 x 2.5 x 0.6 cm aggregate of yellow-tan ﬁbroadipose tissue containing 2 lymph nodes, measuring 2 x
0.7 x 0.6 cm and 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm, respectively. The nodes are bisected and half are frozen as PSI-i1
and FSH2 for frozen section interpretation. The frozen'section residuals are submitted in cassettes (H1)
and (H2). No residual lymph nodes are identified.

Frozen section diagnosis:
FSH1 and FSH2 — Right obturator lymph nodes, 2 — "Negative for carcinoma.”

Part i is received in forrnalln labeled “left obturator lymph nodes" and consists of a 4 x 1 x 0.7 cm
cylindrical lymph node that is sectioned and submitted entirely in cassettes (i1) and (l2).

Part J is received in formalin labeled “uterus, bilateral tubes, ovaries and cervix (Genome fresh)” is a 203
gm, 10.5 cm from cervix to fundus by 7 cm in width by 5.1 cm from anterior to posterior radical
hysterectomy specimen with a 5.2 x 4.1 x 2 cm tan granular, fungating mass protruding from the cervical
as. The tumor is 8.5 cm from the top of the endometrial cavity. Grossly. the tumor is limited to the cervix
and does not appear to invade into the lower uterine segment. The uterine across is purple-tan and
smooth with multifocal thin ﬁbrous adhesions. Adjacent to the fungatlng mass. the cervical mucosa is
pink-white, smooth and glistening. The endometrlum is red-tan and glistening. There is a 1.1 cm
diameter white whorled nodule within the anterior myometrium. A portion of the tumor is submitted for
TCGA-Genome analysis. The following sections are submitted: .

The 5 gm, 3 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm multicystic right ovary is purple-tan and cerebriform. The cut surface
demonstrates multiple cysts ranging up to 1.5 cm in diameter that are variously filled with clear mucoid
material to hemorrhage. The previously ligated 6.5 cm in length by 0.5 cm in diameter ﬂmbriated fallopian
tube is lined by purple-tan, smooth and glistening serosa.

The 4 gm, 3.2 x 1.9 x 1.2 cm plnk~tan cerebrifcrm left ovary is multicystic and demonstrates a 1 cm
diameter clear fluid-filled cyst and a 0.7 cm in greatest dimension white corpus alblcantia. There is a 6

smooth and glistening serosa. The following additional sections are submitted:

Sections from the radical hysterectomy demonstrate a moderately to poorly differentiated nonkeratinizing
Invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix that extends into the endocervix. The tumor is excphytic
and is composed of sheets of pleomorphlc nuclei with abundant cytoplasm, focal intercellular bridges, and
necrosis. The cervical soft tissue margins and lower uterine segment are uninvolved. Lymphovascuiar
invasion is focally identified, slide J4. Sections of the endometrlum demonstrate a secretory pattern. A
single submucosal leiomyoma is present. The right ovary demonstrates a hemorrhagic corpus Iuteum
and various follicular cysts in varying stages of evolution. The right fallopian tube is unremarkable. The
left ovary demonstrates multiple follicular cysts in varying stages of evolution. The left fallopian tube is
unremarkable. The left and right parametrlum are uninvolved by squamous cell carcinoma.
