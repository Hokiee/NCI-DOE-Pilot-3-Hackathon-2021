FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

PART 1: LYMPH NODES, RIGHT AND LEFT PELVIC, EXCISION —
NO EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASIA IN 9 LYNIPH NODES (019).

PART 2: PROSTATE AND BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES, RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY —

  
 
 

 

A. PROSTATE ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 4 +3=7 WITH A TERTIARY 5 COMPONENT OF APPROXIMATELY
3%,
B. THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT LOBES AND HAS A GREATEST NODULAR DIAMETER 0F
2 CM IN ONE HISTOLOGIC SECTION.
C. THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THE EXAMINED PROSTATE VOLUME.
