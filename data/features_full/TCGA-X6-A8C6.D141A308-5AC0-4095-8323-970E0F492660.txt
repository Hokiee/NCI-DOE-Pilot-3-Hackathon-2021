A. Received fresh tax on consultation in a container: labeled with the
patient's name. hospital timber and "ﬁne: Lt leg mass' is a 570 gram
brown portlun 0: muscle oriented with stitch proximal end. The
measurements are as tollois: Superior. tn deep 9.0 can, medial to lateral
16.0 «a, proximal ta distal 15.5 cm. Attached to the supetricaal surface
is a tarnish, smut}: skin ellipse, 3.5 x 0.7 on with no sea: identified.
Ink identatiets are as follows: Superior proximal u inked blue, superior
distal is inked gteen. medial deep is inked osange and. lateral deep is
inked black. The specimen is sectioned from proximal to distal to reveal
a 8.5 x 3.3 x 6.5 an lobulated white-tan-yellcw mass with also: cystic
component. It is 2.2 cm from the proximal mtgin, 3.0 cm from the distal
Mtgin. and «Li on from the deep margin but a plate or tissue is present.
hi, pewendicular sections through proximal margin: A2. mass nearest deep
margin; A3, mass at superficial margin: A1. mass at medial heroin.- A5.
