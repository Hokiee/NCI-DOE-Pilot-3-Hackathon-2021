— No tumor seen in four lymph nodes (0/4).

- Benign thymic tissue identified.

Comment:

In the thyroidectomy specimen, the tumor nodule involving the
superior pole appears to be partially encapsulated with some
areas of capsular disruption. Tumor cells extend to the inked
surfaces consistent with involvement of the surgical resection
margin. Foci of tumor demonstrate areas of minimal
extrathyroidal extension.

Clinical History:
.-year—old female with thyroid carcinoma.

Gross Description:
Received are two appropriately labeled containers.

Container A is additionally labeled "thyroid".
Specimen fixation: Formalin
Type of specimen: Total thyroidectomy

Size and weight of specimen: Weight is 21 grams, left lobe (5.5
x 2.3 x 0.7 cm), right lobe (4.5 x 2.3 x 1.1 cm) connected by
isthmus (1.7 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm), nodule attached to the right
superior pole (3.1 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm).

Orientation: Suture at left superior pole. Inking: anterior
capsule blue, posterior capsule black, isthmus yellow, and right.
superior pole nodule green.

Tumor location: Right lobe
Focality: Multifocal
Dominant tumor: Right

Tumor description: There are three nodules arbitrarily
designated as A, B and C which are all located in the right
lobe. Nodule A is loosely attached at the right superior pole
(inked green) and is 3.1 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm. The external

surface is pink/tan, smooth. The cut surface is solid pink/gray,
smooth and rubbery. Nodule B is 0.4 cm from nodule A and is 2.2
x 2.1 x 1.0 cm. Nodule B is well-circumscribed smooth pink/tan
and multi—nodular. Within the right inferior lobe is nodule C,
0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. This nodule is smooth, rubbery pink/tan and
well—circumscribed. Tumor C is 0.7 cm from tumor B.

Tumor size: Nodule A (3.1 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm), Nodule B (2.2 x 2.1 x
1.0 cm), and Nodule C (0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm)

Confinement/non—confinement: A, B and C nodules are all grossly
confined, defer to light microscopy

Distance of tumor to capsular inked margin: Tumor A grossly
abuts the green inked capsular margin; tumor B grossly abuts the
anterior and posterior capsule and is 1.4 cm from the isthmus.
Tumor A appears to be external to the thyroid gland, whereas
tumor B is within the thyroid parenchyma. Tumor C grossly abuts
the anterior capsule, 0.1 cm from the posterior capsule and is
1.5 cm from the isthmus margin.

Appearance of thyroid gland away from tumor: Red/brown and
spongy. The left lobe is unremarkable.

Parathyroid: Not identified
Lymph nodes: No

Tissue for investigation: A portion of tumor A is given to tumor
procurement foundation.

Digital photograph: No

Container B is additionally labeled "level 6 central lymph
nodes" and consists of a 2.6 x 1.7 x 0.5 cm fragment of adipose
tissue that contains five lymph node candidates, up to 0.3 cm in
greatest dimension. By message received from Dr. , this
specimen represents central neck dissection of compartment

VII and this corrected information is reflected in the final
diagnosis.

Block Summary:
Bl — Two lymph node candidates
