FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS

A. Left breast, modiﬁed radical mastectomy:

- Invasive lobular carcinoma, SBR grade 11, see pathologic parameters and
comment.

- Lobular carcinoma in situ, classic type.

- Metastatic carcinoma in thirteen of ﬁfteen lymph nodes (13/15); biopsy
site present in one node.

Clinical History:
The patient is a year-old female with breast cancer undergoing left breast
modiﬁed radical mastectomy.

Comment
The tumor exhibits 20% cellularity. Although extensive hyalinization is present

in the tumor bed, this feature was also seen on the pre-treatment biopsy. Hence,
response to chemotherapy is difﬁcult to assess. Of note, no signiﬁcant
treatment response is seen in the lymph nodes.

Specimens Received:
A: Left breast modiﬁed radical mastectomy

Gross Description:

A. The specimen is received in a single container labeled with the patient's
name, medical record number, and additionally identiﬁed as, 'left breast
modiﬁed radical mastectomy‘. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 1,276.6
gm modiﬁed radical mastectomy specimen. The specimen is received oriented with
a suture designating left axillary tail. The specimen measures 26.5 cm from
superior to inferior, 27.5 cm from medial to lateral, and 5 cm from anterior to
posterior. There is an attached 9.5 x 9 x 2.5 cm axillary tail. On the

anterior surface is a 23.5 x 13 cm tan-white ellipse of skin with a 6 x 5 cm

areola and a 1.1 x 1 cm ﬂattened nipple. The nipple—areolar complex reveals no
evidence of ulceration or retraction.

The specimen is inked as follows:

superior edge — blue;

inferior edge - green;

posterior - black.

The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 21 slices to

reveal a ﬁrm, bulging, scallop tan—white to pink 8.5 x 6.5 x 4.2 cm mass in

slices 5-13. The mass is 0.7 cm from posterior margin (black) and 0.5 cm from
anterior skin. A biopsy tract ﬁlled with gel is present in places 6-7, with

clip present in slice 7. The remainder of the specimen consists of

approximately 5% dense gray-white ﬁbrous breast parenchyma and 95% lobulated
yellow adipose tissue. No additional masses or nodules are grossly identiﬁed.
Sectioning through the axillary tail reveals multiple tan-brown, rubbery lymph
nodes ranging from 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.4- 2 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm in greatest dimension.
Breast specimens are ﬁxed for at least 6 hours in 10% NBF and no more than 72
hours.
