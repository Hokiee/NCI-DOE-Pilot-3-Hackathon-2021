Primary Tumor: pTZa: Unilateral. involving one—half of1 side (“lobe )or less.

Regional Lymph Nodes: pNO: No regional lymph node metastasis.

Lymph Nodes
Number examined: 2.
Number involved: 0.

Margins:
Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma.

Extraprostatic extension: Absent.

Seminal vesicle invasion (invasion of muscular wall required): Absent.

Perineural invasion: Present.

Comments: Small focus of probable carcinoma in right mid (H) as well.

Clinical: Prostate cancer.
Gross: The specimen is received fresh in three parts all labeled ”

Part 1 is labeled "left pelvic lymph node pocket" and consists of a piece of adipose tissue
measuring 3.5 x 3 x 1.5 cm; The specimen is examined for lymph nodes. One lymph node
measuring 0.2 cm is identiﬁed. The lymph node is entirely submitted in cassette A.

Part 2 is labeled "right pelvic lymph node pocket" and consists of fragments of adipose tissue
measuring 4.5 x 3.5 x 1.5. cm in' aggregate. The specimen is examined for lymph node. One lymph
node is identiﬁed measuring 1.5 cm. The lymph node is entirely submitted in cassette 8.

Part 3 is labeled "prostate. and seminal vesicles" and consists of a prostatectomy specimen
weighing 51 grams and measuring 5.5 x 5 x 3.5 cm. The right seminal vesicle measures 2.5 x 1.5 x
0.5 cm. The right vas deferens measures 0.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. The left seminal
vesicle measures 2.5 x‘ 1.5 x 0.5 cm. The left vas deferens. measures 1 cm in length and 0.5 cm in
diameter. Prostatic capsule is grossly unremarkable. The specimen is inked as follows: right =
black, left = blue. The urethral (apical) and the lateral margins are shaved up and the specimen is
serially sectioned to reveal a nodular pattern of the prostatic parenchyma. No discrete lesions are-
grossly identiﬁed. The specimen is represented as follows-: CD = right apical resection margin,
coned. and serially sectioned, E-F = left apical resection margin, coned and serially sectioned. (54 =
right apex, mid and base respectively. J-L = left apex, mid and base, respectively. M = bladder
resection margin shave, N = right seminal vesicle, 0 = left seminal vesicle.
