PATIENT HISTORY:

Squamous cell carcinoma of right tonsil.

PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: None given.

POST—OP DIAGNOSIS: Same.

.S-RE: Tonsillectomy and right neck dissection.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
PART 1, 2, 3, 4, AND 5. TONSIL, RIGHT, BASE OF TONGUE, RIGHT SOFT PALATE,
LATERAL AND MEDIAL PHARYNGEAL, TONSILLECTOMY WITH MARGINAL BIOPSIES—

 

A. INVASIVE SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA (3.7 CM), KERATINIZING,
MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED.

B. ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION PRESENT.

C. NO PERINEURAL INVASION PRESENT.

D. ALL SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA.

E. PATHOLOGIC STAGE: pT2N3MX

PART 6. LYMPH NODES, RIGHT, LEVEL I—IV, NECK DISSECTION—

A. METASTATIC SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA IN AT LEAST ONE OF FOUR LYMPH
NODES (1/4).

1. POSITIVE NODE (6.5 CM) WITH EPICENTER IN LEVEL II (see comment).
2. EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION PRESENT.

B UNREMARKABLE SUBMANDIBULAR GLAND.

PART 7. LYMPH NODES, RIGHT, LEVEL V, NECK DISSECTION—
E YMPH NODES, NO TUMOR PRESENT (0/5).

The positive node likely represents a mass of matted lymph nodes, but for
stagin ur oses we have considered it a single node.

   

My si station that I have personally reviewed the submitted
material(s) and the final diagnosis reflects that evaluation.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in seven parts.

Part 1 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xx, medical record number
and "base of tongue." The specimen consists of a 0.8—cm in largest dimension
fragment of soft tissue covering by gray—pink, soft mucosa. Intraoperative
consultation was requested for part 1 and was performed. Part 1 is entirely
submitted in cassette 1A.

Part 2 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xx, medical record number
and "right soft palate." Part 2 consists of a 1.5 cm in largest diameter
fragment of soft tissue, inked blue. Part 2 is entirely submitted in
cassette

2A.

Part 3 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xx, medical record number
and "lateral pharyngeal." Part 3 consists of a 0.8 cm in largest diameter
fragment of soft tissue. Part 3 is entirely submitted in cassette 3A.

Part 4 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xx, medical record number
and "medial pharyngeal" and consists of a 0.9 cm in largest dimension
fragment

of soft—to—rubbery tissue. Part 4 is entirely submitted in cassette 4A.

Part 5 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xx, medical record number
and "right tonsils, suture medial" and consists of a 5.5 x 4.0 x 3.5 cm
fragment of soft tissue with an exophytic solid gray mass, 3.7 x 3.5 x 2.3 cm
in largest dimension. The mass is 0.3 cm from the deep margin and is inked
black. Digital images are taken. A portion is submitted for tumor bank.
Representative sections of the tumor in its relationship to the deep margin
are submitted in cassettes 5A—5E.

Part 6 is labeled with the patient's name, initials xx, medical record number
and "right neck levels 1—4." Part 6 consists of a fragment of fibroadipose
tissue, 9.0 x 6.5 x 4.0 cm in largest dimension. The specimen is distorted by
a 6.5 cm in largest dimension mass, which is lobulated, encapsulated and has
a

yellow fragile necrotic—appearing cut section surface. Digital images are
taken. The mass is located at level 4. The remainder of the specimen contains
an unremarkable lobulated major salivary gland tissue, 3.0 cm in largest
dimension. Several level 3 lymph nodes are identified. The largest level 3
lymph node measures 0.8 cm in largest dimension. Representative sections are
submitted as follows:

6A—6F — representative sections of the large mass with capsule
6G — three lymph nodes, two lymph nodes (largest) are bisected
6H — representative section of major salivary gl d (submandibular).

Part 7 is labeled with the patient's name, initialsrl, medical record number

and "right neck level 5" and consists of a 2.5 cm i argest diameter

fragment

of yellow, lobulated fibroadipose tissue with potential lymph node, up to 0.5
argest dimension.
