Specimens Submitted:
1: Left lower abdominal wall mass

DIAGNOSIS:

1. Soft tissue, lower abdominal wall. left, mass, excision: (} ? >4/ZQ/B
- Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma),

high grade.

- Tumor measures 6.4 cm in greatest dimension.

- Mitoses: greater than 10 /10 KPP.

- Necrosis is present (10% of tumor).

- surgical resection margins are uninvolved: closest margin - Inferior
margin (clearance of 0.2cm).

Note: Sections show spindle cell neoplasm with tumor cells showing marked
cytological atypia and nuclear pleomorphism with moderate amount of
eosinophilic cytoplasm. numerous interspersed bizarre cells with vesicular
nuclei and prominent nucleoli are seen. Atypical mitotic figures were
identified. Morphological findings are consistent with high grade,
undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

17.5 x 10.6 x 5.8cm. The skin ellipse measures 15 x 7.7cm. The specimen is
oriented by a short stitch marking the superior margin and long stitch
marking the lateral margin. The specimen is inked as follows: Lateral -
Orange: medial - red; Superior - Blue, inferior - green: deep/posterior -
black. The specimen is opened along the long axis to reveal a mass measuring
6.4 x 5.3 x 4.9cm. The mass is serially sectioned to reveal a yellow tan
homogenous cut surface with a cystic area measuring 3.8 x 2.5 x .3cm. The
cyst was filled by hemorrhagic fluid. Only rare areas of hemorrhage and
necrosis are seen in the solid part of the tumor. The tumor is located 3.2cm
from the lateral margin: 6.5cm from the medial margin; 1.8cm from the
superior margin; 0.3cm from the inferior margin and the distance from deep

margin is 0.4cm. A part of the specimen is submitted for TPs and photographs
are taken
