DIAGNOSIS:

l. UTERUS WITH BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES, TOTAL ABDOMINAL
HYSTERECTOMY WITH BILATERAL SALPINGOOOPHORECTOMY:
—Adenocarcinoma of endometrium

(Endometrioidjtype
4Focal clear cell features
—Histologic FIGO grade 2+3w
—Nuclear grade 2
-The tumor invades less then half of myometrium
-The maximal thickness of myometrial invasion is 5 mm
-The thickness of the myometrium in the area of maximal tumor
invasion is 15 mm
-No endocervical invasion is identified
-Small focus suspicious for angiolymphatic invasion (section C)
~The remaining endometrium shows atrophy
-Myometrium shows leiomyoma, calcified and focal adenomyosis
—Fibroma, minute, left ovary
-Inclusion cortical cysts, right ovary
—Involutional changes, bilateral ovaries
-Unremarkable fallopian tubes

2~8. LYMPH NODES: RIGHT OBTURATOR, RIGHT PELVIC, RIGHT OBTURATOR,
RIGHT PELVIC, LEFT PELVIC, LEFT OBTURATOR, LEFT PERIAORTIC:
~Negative for metastatic carcinoma
—Benign lymph nodes ( a total of eighteen nodes), 0/18

1: UTERUS BILATERAL TUBES BILATERAL OVARIES
Labeled with the patient's name, designated "uterus bilateral tubes
and ovaries", and received fresh for an intraoperative frozen
section diagnosis and subsequently submitted in formalin. The
uterus with attached cervix and bilateral adnexa weighs 92 grams.
The uterus measures 7.5 cm from fundus to cervix 0.5 cm from cornu
to cornu and 2.7 cm from 2.7 cm from anterior/posterior, and is

oriented by the relationship of the peritoneal reflections. The
serosal surface of the uterus posterior and anteriorly shows several
bosselations due to the presence of subserosal leiomyomas. The
remainder of the serosal surface is pink—tan and smooth. The uterus
is incised on both sides. The endometrial cavity is 0.3 cm long and
2.3 cm in width. The posterior endometrium shows tan polypoid
friable tumor replacing the endometrium. Cut sections of the
posterior endomyometrium shows tumor invading into the less then
half of the myometrium. The anterior myometrium appears grossly
uninvolved by the tumor. The endometrium measures 0.5 cm in
thickness. The myometrium measures 1.5 cm. Cervix measures 2.5 cm
in length and 2.0 cm in width. The external 05 is slit-shaped and
measures 0.7 cm. within the uterus there are a total of three
leiomyomas two are subserosal and one is intramural. Cut sections
of the leiomyomas are well circumscribed has a white solid whorling
surface. The transition zone and the endocervical canal are
unremarkable. The right fallopian tube measures 4.5 cm in length
and 0.5 cm in average diameter the fimbria are lush and velvety. On
cut sections the tube is unremarkable. The right yellow cerebriform
ovary measures 3.0 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm. On cut section the ovary is
unremarkable. The left fallopian tube measures 6.0 cm in length and
0.5 cm in average diameter. The fimbria are lush and velvety. On
cut section the tube is unremarkable. The left yellow cerebriform
ovary measures 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.4 cm. On cut section the ovary is
unremarkable. Representative sections.

2: OBTURATOR LYMPH NODE RIGHT

Labeled with the patient's name, designated "obturator lymph node",
is received fresh from the operating room for an intraoperative

lymph node measures 0.5 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm and is entirely embedded for
frozen section 1. The fat was not embedded for frozen section.
Entirely submitted.
