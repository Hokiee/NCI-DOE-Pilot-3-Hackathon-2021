lymph node for

frozen section." It consists of a 6 x 4 x 2 mm tan soft tissue
fragment. The .7

specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section and
resubmitted in block FSAl,

Container B is additionally labeled "right superior
parathyroid." It holds two

red/tan soft tissue fragment in aggregate weighing less than 0.1
grams and

measuring 0.3 x 0.1 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is submitted in block
FSBl,

Container C is additionally labeled "right inferior parathyroid
for frozen

section." It consists of a less than 0.1 gram, 2 x 1 x 1 mm
red/tan soft tissue

fragment. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section
and resubmitted

in block FSCl,

Container D is additionally labeled "total thyroid".

gray/white and

well circumscribed (left and right lobes) with the largest
having focal

calcification. The third nodule is well—circumscribed pink/gray
and semi

gelatinous (left inferior pole), 0.1 cm from the dominant
nodule.

Tissue submitted for special investigations: A portion of
dominant nodule
was given to tumor procurement foundation.
