GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. ADRENAL GLAND LEFT

Received fresh is an adrenalectomy specimen measuring overall 14 x 11.5 x 4 cm and weighing
175 grams containing a tumor mass measuring 5.5 x 5 x 2.5 cm. The external surface is inked
blue. The mass is encapsulated with brown-tan cut surface. A portion of normal golden yellow
adrenal gland is seen measuring 3.5 x 3.5 x 1 cm. A portion of the specimen is submitted for
tissue procurement. Gross photographs are taken. Representative sections are submitted in Al-
A2-A9 (tumor) and A10-A1 l (adrenal gland).

B. LYMPH NODE PERIAORTIC

Received in formalin is a fragment of beige—tan ﬁrm tissue measuring 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm. The
entire specimen is submitted in cassette Bl.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
Immunoperoxidase stains are performed on tissue sections from block# A2. The
immunophenotypic features are in support of the diagnosis.

CHROMOGRANIN A Positive

CYTOKERATIN AE1/3 Negative Rare tumor cells are positive
INHIBl'N-ALPHA Negative

The interpretation of the above inununohistochemistry stain or stains is guided by published results in the medical literature, provided
package information from the manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance and assay validation within the

analyte speciﬁc reagent (ASR). These tests were developed and their performance characteristic determined by the Department of Pathology
Laboratory at ’ They have not been cleared or approved by the US. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has

determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. ADRENAL GLAND, LEFT, ADRENALECTOMY:
- PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA. TUMOR SIZE 5.5 X 5 X 2.5 CM. MARGINS
NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. SEE NOTE

B. LYMPH NODE, PERIAORTIC, EXCISION:
- ONE LYMPH NODE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/ 1)

NOTE: The tumor is located 0.1 cm from closest inked margin. The tumor exhibits focal
capsular invasion and extension into peri—adrenal adipose tissue. There is no definite evidence of
vascular invasion, necrosis (only degenerative changes are seen), readily seen mitoses (none is
seen), profound nuclear pleomorphism (random pleomorphism is seen), high cellularity, cellular
monotony, or tumor cell spindling. Although the total histomorphologic score of this tumor,
according to the reference below, is more seen in pheochromocytoma with benign clinical
behavior, it is really still difﬁcult to predict the clinical behavior of this tumor based merely on
the histomorphology. Clinical and radiologic correlation is critical to exclude malignancy as
strictly deﬁned by documenting metastases in organs do not have normally chromafﬁn cells. See
reference (L. Thompson. Am J Surg Pathol 26(5): 551-55 6, 2002).
