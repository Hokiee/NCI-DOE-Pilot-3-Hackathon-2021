DIAGNOSIS

PARTIAL HEPATECTOMY (647 G) LEFT LATERAL (SEGMENT Ill): HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA.

Tumor type: Hepatocellular carcinoma

Histologic grade: Variable including grade I of IV (well differentiated adenoma-like) and grade ll-lll of iv

(moderately differentiated)
Tumor size: 15 cm pedunculated tumor (with gastric compression clinically)

2 cm satellite tumor (approaching but not transected at parenchymal margin)
Tumor multifocality: Present, as above

Vascular invasion: Not present

Hepatic capsule: No transcapsular invasion

Local extension: Organ-confined

Margins: -Hepatic parenchymal: negative (~1 mm)

-Bile duct(s): N/A
-Vascular: N/A

Lymph nodes: N/A
Other findings: Steatosis (35-40%) and Mallory hyaline in well differentiated HCC; focal tumor necrosis
& hyalinization present; no background cirrhosis; non-specific triaditis; focal peliosis
AJCC stage: Stage IIIA; pT3a (assuming “cNO” and “cMO” status)
***Electronicallv Signed Out***
COMMENT

As per the OP note. this represents a palliative resection to relieve gastric compression. Other lesions were reportedly present via
intraoperative ultrasound. Note is made of the prior core biopsy «

Histologically this tumor shows equal components of well differentiated adenoma-like HCC with clonal evolution to a more
moderately differentiated HCC.

parenchyma is tan-brown without nodularity. Representative samples are submitted labeled 1A — 1R.
