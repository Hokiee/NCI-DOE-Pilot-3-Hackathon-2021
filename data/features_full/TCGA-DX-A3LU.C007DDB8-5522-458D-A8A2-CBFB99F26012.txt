- THE DEDIFFEREN‘I‘IATED COMPONENT PREDOMINATES AND HAS A HETEROGENOUS
MORPHOLOGY, RANGING FROM MYXOFIBROSARCOMA TO A PLEOMORPHIC HIGH GRADE

ALSP PRESENT.

- TUMOR SIZE: 19 x 16 x 14 CM.

- THE TUMOR INVOLVES THE RENAL CAPSULE AND FOCALLY INVADES INTO THE
RENAL PARENCHYMA.

~ THE TUMOR INVOLVES SUESEROSA OP BOWEL.

- THE TUMOR EXTENDS TO THE U'NDESIGNATED SOFT TISSUE MARGIN.

- AREAS OF NECROSIS ARE SEEN.

- THE BOWEL RESECTION. RENAI- VASCULAR AN'D URETERAL MARGINS ARE FREE OP
TUMOR.

- KIDNEY WITH SIMPLE CYST AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATION.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF

and consists of a 19 x 16 x 14 cm partially encapsulated, firm brown mass
with attached fibroadipose tissue measuring 15 x 5 x 5 cm and a portion of
bowel designated with a stitch measuring 5 cm in length and 6 cm in
circumference. The bowel is attached to mass by a portion of mesentery
measuring 5 cm. within the attached fibroadipose tissue and also
incorporated within the mass is a kidney measuring 13 x 7 x 2.8 cm. The
renal cortex measures 0.4 cm and the medulla measures 1.6 cm. A 2.4 on
smooth wglled clear fluid-filled cyst is identified in the superior pole.
The tumor inyolves the renal capsule and extends to the renal parenchyma at
the inferior pole. The specimen is inked black and sectioned serially
revealing a heterogeneous firm tan mass with central areas of hemorrhage and
necrosis and focal areas of dense fibrosis. The necrosis appears to be less
than 10% of the overall tumor specimen. A portion of tissue is submitted
for TPS, photographs are taken and representative sections are submitted.

Summary of sections:

Ml — colon margin one

M2 - colon margin two

UC - unremarkable colon

K - unremarkable kidney

KC - kidney cyst

F - perirenal fat (grossly normal—appearing)
TK ~ tumor with relation to kidney

TKC — tumor with relation to renal capsule
TM - tumor with margin

T - tumor

UV - kidney vascular and ureteral margin
