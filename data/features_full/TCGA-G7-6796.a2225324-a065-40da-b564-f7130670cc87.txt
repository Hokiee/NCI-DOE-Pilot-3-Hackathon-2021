CLINICAL HISTORY
None given

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:
FSC/FSD- Negative for tumor by Dr. to Dr. at

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. LEFT RENAL MASS
Received fresh is a piece of yellow-tan soft tissue weighing 13 g and measuring 3.7 x 2.8 x 2 cm. There
is a suture designating the site of additional tumor resection. The indicated surface is inked blue and
the opposite surface is inked black. The specimen is bisected; there is a well-circumscribed gold-tan
mass measuring 1.5 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm which is located adjacent to the tumor resection margin. The mass
is hemorrhagic and necrotic. Portion is submitted for procurement. The adjacent fat is unremarkable.
The specimen is submitted entirely in cassettes A1 -A8.
B. ADDITIONAL TUMOR-LEFT RENAL
Received in formalin is a piece of brown-tan tissue measuring 1.7 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm. There is a area white-
tan discoloration measuring 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.2 cm. The renal tissue is inked black. The specimen is
serially sectioned and submitted entirely in cassettes Bf -B2.
C. LEFT RENAL FINAL MARGIN
Received fresh are 3 small tan-red tissue fragments measuring 0.6 x 0.4 cm in aggregate. Submitted
entirely for frozen section diagnosis in cassette FSCf.
D. FINAL RANDOM MARGIN
Received fresh are 4 tan tissue fragments measuring 0.8 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. Submitted entirely for
frozen section diagnosis in cassette FSD1.
E. FAT OVERLYING KIDNEY-LEFT
Received in formalin is an aggregate of yellow-tan adipose tissue measuring 20 x 14 x 4 cm. On
sectioning, no masses, lesions, or areas of discoloration are identified. Representative sections are
submitted in cassette E1-E3.
