COMMENT:
A high percentage of tumor cells (greater than 20%) immunostaining for MGMT has been reported to be
associated with a relatively diminished response to Hence,

the 20% result in this case suggests the possibility of a relatively diminished response to

Recent studies have shown that co—expression of EGFRvIlI and PTEN as detected by immunostaining
was si nificantl correlated with a clinical response of giioblastomas to EGFR kinase inhibitors—
* Hence the toss of PTEN in this case suggests a diminished probability of
response to EGFR-kinase inhibitors.

Recent studies indicated an adverse prognostic significance of increased expression of laminin beta 1
and decreased expression of Iaminin beta 2 predicting a worse survival of patients with gliomas.

-ssociation between Iaminin—8 and glial tumor grade, recurrence, and patient survival. -

Accordingly, elevated expression of beta 1 and suppressed expression of beta 2 in this tumor predict
more aggressive behavior.

Presence of activated (phosphorylated) p42144 Mitogen—Activated Protein Kinase (pMAPK) often is
indicative of an upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. It has been shown to be associated
with a relative resistance to radiation therapy in glioblastoma multiforme

Cancer Res. =

Correspondingly, a high percentage of tumor cells immunoreactive to pMAPK antibody in this case may
predict a relative resistance to radiation therapy.

 

The use of these tests in guiding therapy has limitations. Review of the relevant literature and clinical
correlation is advised. These test results do not obligate or preclude use of the relevant therapeutic
agents.

FLUORESCENCE IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION (FISH) for EGFR in BRAIN

 

 

Tissue Biock: -

RESULTS: POLYSOMY of chromosome 7 (See note below)

Number of cells evaluated: 40

iNTERPRETATION:
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis on a brain tumor sample from this patient with Abbott

Molecular probes specific for the centromere of chromosome 7 (control probe) and the short arm (EGFR-
7p12) of chromosome 7 was performed. The control sample gave expected results.

These studies showed polysomy Of Chromosome 7 in 45% of the nuclei examined. In brain tumors this
signal pattern correlates with an amplified EGFR signal pattern.

NOTE:
1. Samples are considered positive in brain if the EGFR to CEP 7 signal ratio is a 2.0 in 2 10% of

analyzed cells or tumors with four or more copies of the EGFR gene in 2 40% of the cells (high
polysomy).

2. Samples are considered inconclusive, requiring consult with the pathologist, in brain it the EGFR to
CEP 7 signal ratio is 2 2.0 in <10% of analyzed cells or when four or more copies of the EGFR gene in <

40% of the cells.
