GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) 2.0 CM MELANOMA LEFT UPPER ARM IN CONTINUITY WITH AXILLARY NODE DISSECTION - Specimen consists of
oriented skin excision measuring 170 x 3.2 x 1.5 cm with a linear scar measuring 6.5 cm and axillary contents measuring 18.0 x

the ulnar margin. The largest lymph node measures 2.5 cm in greatest dimension and is grossly positive. The majority of the
grossly positive lymph node submitted for tissue protocol.

INK CODE: Radial half of the specimen - blue, ulnar half of the specimen - orange.

SECTION CODE: A1, proximal tip, ink side up; A2, distal tip, ink side up; A3, ulnar skin margin, en face, ink side up; A4,
radial skin margin, en face, ink side up; A5-A19, soar in toto; A20, A21, representative section of normal skin with underlying soft
tissue; A22, representative section of grossly positive lymph node; A23, ﬁve possible lymph nodes; A24, ﬁve possible lymph
nodes; A25, five possible lymph nodes; A26, four possible lymph nodes; A27, four possible lymph nodes; A28, four possible lymph
nodes; A29, four possible lymph nodes; A30, four possible lymph nodes; A31, four possible lymph nodes; A32, four possible
lymph nodes; A33, three possible lymph nodes; A34, two possible lymph nodes; A35, seven possible lymph nodes; A36, one
possible bisected lymph node; A37, one possible bisected lymph node.

(B) ADDITIONAL AXILLARY TISSUE - A 4.2 x 3.7 x 1.3 cm tan-yellow tatty tissue fragment. Lymph node search yields two
possible lymph nodes. larger one measuring 4.0 mm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are submitted entirely in cassette
