lntraoggggtive Consultation;

An mtraoperative non-microscopic consultation was obtained and interpreted as: "Called to pick up 'uterus. cervix." is :3
l9? gram specimen consisting at a uterus with an attached cervix (ftmduslectocervix: 11 cm: comu to cornu: 5.7;
anterior-posterior. 5.3 cm). Parametnal tissue is inked black. Opened to show a 1.7 x 1.5 cm cervical lesion invading to
a depth at 1,4 cm grossly. The lesion extends up to the right parametrlal inlmrl mmln Rmalt nation of tumor and
nonnal tor study. Rest for permanents. Shown to surgeon."t “ "

The patient is a year old woman with cervical cancar. Operative procedure: Radical hysterectomy. bilateral

Gross Dggriggon;

The specimens are received in it Ionnalin—Illled containers, each labeled with the patients name "m
The ﬁrst specimen is labeled “left extremal lilac lymph node.“ it consists of multiple fragments of ﬁbroadiposa

tissue that measure. in aggregate. 4 x 2 x 2 cm. 0n dissecting, three lymph nodes ranging from 0.4 to 1.6 cm are

identiﬁed; sections of these lymph nodes show unremarkable areas. Labeled M - two lymph nodes; A2 - one lymph
node. Jar l.

The second specimen is labeled “ten obturator lymph node." It consists of several fragments of ﬁbroadipose tissue that
measure. in aggregate. 2,5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. On sectioning and dissection. three lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 to 1.5
cm in dlameter are identiﬁed; sections of these lymph nodes show largely lobe composed of adlpose tissue. Bisected.
Labeled Bl - two lymph nodes; 82 - one lymph node. Jar 0.

the third specimen is labeled ”right external lliac lymph node." It consists at several fragments at ﬁbroadiooso tissue
that measure. in aggregate. 5 x 3 x 1.5 cm. On dissecting. two lymph nodes ranging from 1.5 cm to 3 cm in maximal

The fourth specimen is labeled "right obturetor lymph node.“ it consists of a single lymph node with attached adipose
tissue that measures 0.5 x02 x 0.2 cm. Sectioning shows putative lymph nodal tissue. Labeled 131. Jar 0.

The tinh specimen is labeled "right periaortlc lymph node." ll Consists of a single lymph node measuring 4.5 x 2.5 x 1.0
