Single specimen designated as left thyroid lobe. Initially received in the fresh state for Oncogenotyping
studies is an 8 gram lobe of thyroid, 4.8 x 2.3 x t 8 cm The surfaces of the thyroid are glistening and
tabular. deep red. The margins are marked blue. The specimen is serially sectioned perpendicularly
through the long axis to reveal a well—circumscribed. glistening, tan nodular lesion. 2.3 x 1.4 x 1 3 cm
abutting the anterior and posterior thyrord margins Cut sections oi the lesion demonstrates multiple loci oi

thyroid parenchyma: The remaining cut sections or the thyrord demonstrate glistening. semi-translucent
darkened tart-red nodules ranging irom 0.5-1 2 cm The uninvolved ttiyrmd peirer‘rchyma is meaty deep
