Final Surgical Pathology Report

Final Patholo ic Dia nosis
A. LIVER, LESION, BIOPSY (A1FS):
— CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA.

B. LIVER. BIOPSY (B1 FS):
- CIRRHOSIS.
- NO CARCINOMA IS IDENTIFIED.

C. LIVER, RIGHT HEPATECTOMY:

- CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA, INTRAHEPATIC (ADENOCARCINOMA OF PANCREATICOBILIARY TYPE IN LIVER).

- THE TUMOR IS MULTIFOCAL WITH THE LARGEST FOCUS. 3.3 CM.

~ TUMOR FOCALLY EXTENDS TO WITHIN 0.1 CM OF PARENCHYMAL MARGIN OF RESECTION.

. TUMOR SUPERFICIALLY INVADES INTO THE ADVENTITIA OF A LARGE CA
PARENCHYMA, BUT THE LUMEN OF THE VEIN IS FREE OF CARCINOMA.

- TUMOR ABUTS THE CAPSULE OF THE LIVER.

- UNINVOLVED LIVER SHOWS EVOLVING SIRRHOSIS.

Comment

lmmunohistochemical stains performed excludes the presence of focal hepatocellular differentiation. The malignant cells are
positive for CK? (bile ductular marker) and are negative for hepatocellular marker hep-pan. glypican 3, arginase. CD10 and

poly-CEA show focal positivity, but canalicula' pattern formation is not convincing. CD56 is negative. This pattern of staining is
consistent with the above diagnosis.

A trichrome stain demonstrates bridging ﬁbrosis that would have qualiﬁed as at least stage 3 of 4.
