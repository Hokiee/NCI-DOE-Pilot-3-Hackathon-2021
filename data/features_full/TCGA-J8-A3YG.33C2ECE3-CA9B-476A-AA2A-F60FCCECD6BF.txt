A) Thyroid, right lobectomy: Papillary thyroid carcinoma, forming 2.5 cm
tumor mass, conﬁned within the thyroid capsule. Focally suspicious for
lymphovascular invasion. One parathyroid lymph node involved by
metastatic papillary carcinoma (See synoptic report).

8) Thyroid. left iobectomy: Papillary thyroid carcinoma, forming a 0.8 cm
tumor mass, confined within the thyroid capsule. Two additional
microscopic foci (each <1.0 mm) of papillary thyroid carcinoma also
seen in random parenchymal sections. Hyperplastlc nodules.
Lymphovascular invasion is present. (See synoptic report).

0) Lymph nodes, central compartment. excision: Five of eight lymph
; nodes involved by metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma. Two
' unremarkable parathyroid glands. Benign thymic tissue is also present.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A) Received fresh labeled "right thyroid Iobe and isthmus" is a beefy red thyroid
lobe measuring 5.0 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm and weighing 13 grams. The extemai surface is
inked black and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.6 cm
circular tan/brown. partially cystic lesion with a friable cut surface. Focal areas of
ﬁbrosis are seen. The lesion appears contained within the thyroid capsule and
occupies approximately 80% of the lobe. A portion of the mass is submittegijgr the

of the lesion are submitted in A1. Additional permanent section of lesion A2 through
A5. Nomial thyroid A6.

B) Received in formalin labeled "left thyroid lobe" is a lobe of thyroid weighing 7 g,
and measuring 4.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm. The red/tan capsule surface is focally disrupted.
A small amount of fatty soft tissue is adherent to the specimen. The specimen is
inked on its surgical margins with black ink, serially sectioned. and reveals a ﬁrm
white/tan lesion measuring 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. This lesion focally abuts
the inked capsule. Additional smaller nodules measuring up to 0.7 cm in greatest
dimension are also identified. The remainder of the thyroid parenchyma is beefy
red/tan. The specimen is entirely submitted as follows: 81 entirely submitted
indurated lesion. 82 through 86 remainder of thyroid.

C) Received in formalin labeled "central compartment lymph nodes" are four
irregular portions of yellow lobulated node-bearing adipose tissue measuring 3.0 x
2.0 x 1.0 cm. Dissection yields multiple possible lymph nodes measuring up to 0.4
cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is entirely submitted in CI through C4.
