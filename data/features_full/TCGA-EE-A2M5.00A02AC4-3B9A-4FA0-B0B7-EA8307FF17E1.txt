Two specimens were received.

1. "Contents leﬁ axilla. Stitch marks highest node". An ellipse of
hair-bearing skin 85 x 25mm, with underlying fatty tissue, tumour and skeletal
muscle with an aggregate dimension of 150 x 85 x 75mm. The piece of skeletal

appearance. There is no macroscopic involvement of muscle or of the overlying
skin.

ll. "Tumour left axilla". Multiple haemorrhagic fragments of white and yellow
tissue with an aggregate dimension of 30 x 15 x 6mm. Representative sections
