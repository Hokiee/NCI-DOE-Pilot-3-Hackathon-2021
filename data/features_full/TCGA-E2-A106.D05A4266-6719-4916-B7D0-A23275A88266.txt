Special stains and/or lmmunohistochemical stains were performed with appropriately stained positive
and negative controls.

- MICROMETASTATIC CARCINOMA TO ONE LYMPH NODE, WITH NO
EXTRANODAL EXTENSION (1/1) (SEE NOTE).

NOTE: There are two foci of micrometastasis, each measuring less than 1 mm in size. A cytokeratin
AE1/3 stain was performed that highlights the micrometastases and also shows a few scattered
cytokeratin positive cells in the parenchyma.

B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2, RIGHT AXILLA, BIOPSY:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NO TUMOR SEEN (0/1).

C. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #3, RIGHT AXILLA, BIOPSY:

- MULTICENTRIC INVASIVE QEQIAEQARQIEQMA. MODERATELY
DIFFERENTIATED (se‘R‘G‘RADE 2) (SEE NOTE).
- TUMOR MEASURES 1.2 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION.
- INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS WITHIN 1 MM OF THE ANTERIOR MARGIN
IN THE UPPER INNER QUADRANT.
- EXTENSIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), CRIBRIFORM, SOLID
AND MICROPAPILLARY TYPES, NUCLEAR GRADES 2 AND 3, WITH
NECROSIS AND MICROCALCIFICATIONS, INVOLVING LOBULES
- DCIS IS PRESENT AT THE ANTERIOR MARGIN IN THE UPPER INNER
QUADRANT.
- DCIS INVOLVES LACTIFEROUS DUCTS.
— SKIN AND NIPPLE, No TUMOR SEEN.

NOTE: In the upper outer quadrant, a biopsy site is noted with adjacent DCIS. Near the biopsy site, a 2
mm focus of invasive ductal carcinoma is seen. In the upper inner quadrant, there is invasive ductal
carcinoma with DCIS, with the largest focus of invasion measuring 1.2 cm and with at least one other
focus of invasion that measures 0.1 cm. The DCIS in the upper inner quadrant is mass forming and
spans at least 4 cm in greatest dimension.

E. AXILLARY CONTENTS, RIGHT, LEVELS 1—2, DISSECTION:
- 13 LYMPH NODES, NO TUMOR SEEN (0/13).

F. BREAST, RIGHT, ADDITIONAL TISSUE, EXCISION:
- DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, PRESENT AT INKED ASPECT (SEE NOTE).

NOTE: There is a 3 millimeter focus of DCIS. The tissue was not oriented but was inked entirely black
and DCIS is present at the Inked aspect.

G. BREAST, RIGHT, ADDITIONAL INFERIOR MARGIN, EXCISION:
- FOCAL COLUMNAR CELL CHANGE WITH CYTOLOGIC ATYPIA
(FLAT EPITHELIAL ATYPIA).
- NO EVIDENCE OF CARCINOMA.

METHODOLOGY:
Tissue was ﬁxed In 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit (

i using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modiﬁed. External kit-slides
provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-
house known HER2 ampliﬁed control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well
preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identiﬁed for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2
immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided
by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.

This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from
ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology
Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance.

CLINICAL HISTORY:

-year—old female with abnormal screening mammogram of right breast at right upper outer quadrant.
Needle biopsy showed invasive ductal carcinoma. Patient then had MRI which showed enhancement of

upper outer quadrant and upper inner quadrant; anteriorly there was enhancement 2 cm from clip and
close to nipple. PET, CT and bone scan show no evidence of metastatic disease. Invasive ductal
carcinoma SBR grade 2, ER positive, PR positive, Her2/neu negative. Tumor size 0.4 cm, also with high
grade DCIS solid and cribriform with necrosis and extension to lobules.

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right Breast Cancer

ADDENDUM:

PatthsIon HER-2 DNA Probe Kit
Case No

Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED
Clinical Interpretation of results
Ampliﬁcation of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase ﬂuorescence in-situ
hybridization (FISH) on formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn embedded tissue sections using a Chromosome
17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the Pathology
Core Facility by Dr.. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17
signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no
ampliﬁcation of the HER2/neu gene.

Block used A1 Source of case: RPCI
Tissue ﬁxation formalin-ﬁxed tissue Outside Case No: NA
Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes

HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.05
This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of
CEP17 signals In at least 20 Interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic
mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded.
Method of ratio enumeration: manual count
Limitations
The Vysis PatthsIon Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It Is
intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease—free
and overall survival In stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding
adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into
consideration, such as tumor size, number of Involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status.
No
treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-
2/neu
gene ampliﬁcation status alone.
Overview of this test
