REVISED REPORT (Addendum/Procedure included) <€;k;> A49L74//951~

TISSUE DESCRIPTION:

Al A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8 A9 A10 A11 Bl

Tissue from liver segments II and III (aggregating 163.0 grams, 12.8
x 9.2 x 6.3 cm), tissue from liver new margin (7.8 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm).

DIAGNOSIS:

Liver, segments II and III and new margin, excisions:
Well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma forming a 3.2 x 2.8 x
2.2 cm well-circumscribed but unencapsulated mass. No vascular
invasion seen. Surgical resection margins, after a single
re—excision are negative for tumor.

ADDENDUM:

The surrounding non—neoplastic liver shows mild, nonspecific portal
inflammation with no advanced fibrosis (see comment).

ADDENDUM COMMENT:
A minority of portal tracts contain a mixed inflammatory infiltrate
consisting of lymphocytes with rare plasma cells and occasional
neutrophils. The latter appear to be associated with patchy
ductular proliferation. Interlobular bile ducts are intact. A
solitary portal—based granulomatous reaction is seen. The lobular
parenchyma demonstrates surgical hepatitis with trace steatosis but
no active steatohepatitis. There is no significant fibrosis.
