 

DIAGNOSIS

(A) RIGHT KIDNEY:
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (7.0 CM MAXIMUM DIMENSION), CONVENTIONAL TYPE (60% CLEAR CELLS, 40%

EOSlNOPHlLIC CELLS). FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3, lNVASlVE iNTO RENAL SiNUS ADIPOSE
TISSUE AND RENAL PELVICALYCEAL SYSTEM. (SEE COMMENT)
Margins of resection free of tumor.
Adrenal gland, no tumor present.
(B) PARACAVAL. iNTERAORTIC CAVAL LYMPH NODES:
F0ur lymph nodes, no tumor present.

 

COMMENT

Renal celi carcinoma in the right kidney invades into the renal sinus adipose tissue and the renai pelvicalyceat system. There is no
invasion into the perinephric adipose tissue orthe renal vein. Multlfocal necrosis is present. The kidney parenchyma shows
hemorrhage in the renal tubutes.

 

GROSS DESCRIPTEON

(A) RIGHT KIDNEY - A radicai nephrectomy specimen (21.0 x 12.0 x 7.0 cm). including the right kidney (12.5 x 9.0 x 6.5 cm). a

“egment of renal artery. the renat vein, ureter (5.0 cm in length and 0.5 cm in average diameter) and the adrenat gland (6.5 x 3.0 x 0.9
.n). There is a 7.0 x 5.5 x 5.0 cm welt circumscribed tumor in the mid pole of the kidney. The tumor is goiden yellow. with extensive

areas of hemorrhage and necrosis, which are present predominantly in the center of the tumor. The tumor extends into the renai sinus

and renal pelvis. The tumor does not invade into the perinephric adipose tissue or renal

vein.

The adjacent kidney parenchyma has multifocai btack striated foci of discoloration in the renal cortex. Otherwise, the kidney
parenchyma ls unremarkabte. The peivicalyceal system is smooth and devoid of other lesions. No iymph nodes are identiﬁed in the
hiium or the kidney.

Serial cross sections of the right adrenal gland show unremarkable cortex and meduila.
Portions of the tumor have been submitted for pOSsible electron microscopy as welt as for vaccine protocol.

SECTION CODE: A1, ureter and vascular margins. A2-A4, tumor with renal sinus and pelvis; A5, tumor in renal pelvis: A6, tumor
and renal pelvis; A7, A8. tumor and perinephric fat; A9, tumor and adjacent kidney; A10, A1 “I. uninvolved renal parenohyma; A12,
adrenat gland. representative section.

(B) PARACAVAL INTER AORTIC LYMPH NODE ~ A segment of adipose tissue (6.2 x 4.5 x 1.0 cm) with four possible unremarkable
lymph nodes (from 0.8 to 4.0 cm in greatest dimension).

SECTION CODE: 81-84, one possible lymph node; 85-88, one possible iymph node; 89, two possible lymph nodes. -

CLINICAL HISTORY
Renal mass.
