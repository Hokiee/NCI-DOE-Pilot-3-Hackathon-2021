FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Comment: There are two discrete tumors, both of which
have an in situ “bronchioloalveolar' component.
The largertumor is peony differentiated and the
smallertumor is moderately differentiated. in the
absence of lymphatic invasion and lymph node
involvement, these are considered to be
synch ronOus primaries and thus staged
according to the larger tumor.

Selected slides were reviewed in
intradepartmental consultation with Dr.

Gross Description:

A. The specimen is Iabeied mm and is received in formalin. It consists of a 1.3 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm fragment
of slightly disrupted, red-enthracotio tissue. it is bisected longitudinally and submitted in cassette A1. .

El. The specimen is labeled N11L and is received in formalin. it consists of a 0.5 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm fragment
of dark red~black tissue which is submitted intact in cassette 81.

C. The specimen is labeled N111. #2 and is received in formalin. it consists of a 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm
fragment of tan to anthracotic tissue which is submitted in cassette C1.

D. The specimen is labeled left lower lobe and is received without ﬁxative. it consists of e lobe of lung
measuring 13 x 12 x 5 cm with a partially ﬁxed weight of 123 grams. The pleural surface is pink to pale

tan and smooth. It is inked blue. Along the posterolateral edge of the lung, there has been a previous
incision made revealing a subploural tan-white tumor nodule. This tumor measures 2.7 x 2 x 1.5 cm. it is
approximately 5 cm from the closest bronchial margin. A representative section of the tumor is submitted
for frozen section as DFS1. At the hilum, the bronchial and vascular margins are removed and submitted
for frozen section as DFSZ. There appears to be a single 0.5 cm penbronchial node. The pleural surface is
inked blue. Dissection of the bronchi reveals no grossly obvious intrabronchiai tumor. The pulmonary
parenchyrna is pink to pale red and well-aerated with a focus of peribronchiai consolidation in the
mid-upper aspect. This area is 2.8 cm from the bronchial margin. Representative sections are submitted.

Section summary: Di) representative section of tumor from F8, D2) bronchial and vascular margins from
F8. 03) peribronchial node. 04-06) additional sections of tumor, DY) representative apical lung. D8)
consolidated area De) basilar lung.

E. The specimen is labeled N6 and is received in formalin. It consists of a 1.4 x 0.7 x 0.2 cm fragment of
iibrofatty tissue with a few small fooi of scattered enthracotic discoloration. The specimen is submitted
intact in cassette E1.

F. The specimen is labeled N7 and is received in formalin. it consists of ﬁve fragments of anthracotic
tissue which vary from 0.5«1 .1 cm in maximum dimension. Also in the specimen container is a 1 cm
aggregate of ﬁbrofatty tissue containing punctate fool of anthracotic discoloration. The two largest
fragments of anthracotic tissue are inked with contrasting colors. They are sectioned and submitted in
cassette F1. The remaining. anthracotic tissue fragments are submitted in cassette F2. The separate
ﬁbrofatty tissue is submitted in cassette F3.

6. The specimen is labeled N9L and is received in formalin. It consists of a 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm fragment of

fibrofatty tissue with a 0.2 cm area of gray-brown discoloration. Also in the specimen container is a 0.2 cm
fragment of hemorrhagic material. The specimen is submitted in cassette Gt.

Microscopic Description:
A. Sections of the tiller (N10L) lymph node show a single benign lymph node (0/1). No malignancy is
identiﬁed.

8. Sections of the intertobar (N11L#1) lymph node show a single benign lymph node (0/1). No malignancy
is identiﬁed.

C. Sections of the intertobar (N1 1 L #2) lymph node show a single benign lymph node (0/1). No

malignancy is identiﬁed.

D. Sections of the left lower lobe lobectomy show invasive adenocarclnoma. There are two tumors. the
largest measuring 2.7 cm. This tumor is moderate to poorly differentiated with focal areas of cribh‘form and
solid growth with more prominent nuclear pleomorphism. The pleura is uninvolved. There is a single focus
of large vessel invasion. No lymphatic invasion is identiﬁed. The smaller tumor which measure 1.4 cm is
entirely gland forming with in situ carcinoma around the periphery of the mass. This tumor is also clear of
the pleura. No lymphovascular invasion is identiﬁed in association with this mass. The margins are well
clear of both tumors. There is a single benign peribronchlal lymph node (0/1). The uninvolved lung has
distal emphysematous changes.

An identical immunohistochemical panel was performed on both tumors (block 05 and 08). The panel
shows both tumors are strongly positive for oytokeratin 7 and TTF-t. Both tumors are negative for
cytokeratin 20. This immunoproﬁle conﬁrms primary lung origin and excludes metastasis.

E. Sections of the para—aortic (N6) lymph node a single benign lymph node (0/1). No malignancy is
identiﬁed.

F. Sections of the subcarinal (N7) lymph nodes show an estimated thirteen benign lymph nodes (0/13). No
malignancy is identiﬁed.

G. Sections of the pulmonary ligament (N9L) lymph node show a single benign lymph node (011). No
malignancy is identified.
