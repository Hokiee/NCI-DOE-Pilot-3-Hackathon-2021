SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS

Specimen: Surgical Excision

Block Number: E10

 

ER: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0
PR: Negative Allred Score: 0 = Proportion Score 0 + Intensity Score 0

 

COMMENT:

The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the
proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 ~ 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of
cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak
intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining). with a scoring
range from 0 to 8.

ER/PR positive is deﬁned as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is deﬁned as an Allred score
of less than or equal to 2.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
lmmunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 105, 1:100) and PR (PGR
136, 1:100) provided by Dakc ollowing the manufacturer s instructions. This
assay was not modiﬁed. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published
results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal
review of staining performance.

Fish Ordered: Yes , on Date

 

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTeSt (TM) test kit
C using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modiﬁed. External kit-slides
provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-
house known HER2 ampliﬁed control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well
preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identiﬁed for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2
immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided
by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.

This assay has been validated according to the Tim recommendations and guidelines from
ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology
Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance.

Patthsion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit
Case No
Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED
Clinical Interpretation of results
Ampliﬁcation of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase ﬂuorescence in-situ
hybridization (FISH) on fonnalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn embedded tissue sections using a chromosome
17 centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the .
, by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17
signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no
ampliﬁcation of the HER2/neu gene.
Block used E10 Source of case:
Tissue ﬁxation formalin-ﬁxed tissue Outside Case No:NA
Tissue source breast Results interpreted: yes
HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.03
This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSl HER-2/neu signals by the total number of
CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic
mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded.
Method of ratio enumeration: manual count
Limitations
The Vysis Patthsion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is
intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free
and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding
adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into
consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status.
No
treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-
2/neu
gene ampliﬁcation status alone.
