GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. PROSTATE
Received fresh is a 35g resected prostate measuring 5.5cm from right to left, 4.5 cm from anterior to
posterior, and 3.2cm from apex to base, with attached right and left seminal vesicles and vas deferens.
The specimen is inked as follows: Anterior-Orange, Posterior-Black, Apex-Red, Base-Blue, Right-
Green, and Left-Yellow. After removal of the apex and base, the remaining prostate weight is 17g. The
specimen is serially sectioned from apex to base to reveal firm tan fibrous parenchyma. A 1 x 0.8cm
area of tan brown granules is identified in the left mid portion of the specimen. The granules are 0.1 cm
each. The attached right and left seminal vesicles are 5.5 x 1.8 x 1cm and 6.5 x 2.2 x 0.7cm,
respectively, are sectioned to beige tan cystic tissue with no gross evidence of tumor involvement. The
attached right and left segments of vas deferens are 3.6 x 0.5cm and 3 x 0.7cm, respectively, are
sectioned to reveal firm tan tubular structure with no gross evidence of tumor involvement. A portion of
the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement (Level II). The remainder of the specimen is
submitted as follows:
A1 -A2: right apex
A3-A4: left apex
A5: level I right anterior
A6-A7: level I right posterior
A8: level I left anterior
A9-A10: level I left posterior
A11 : level II right anterior capsule
A12: level II right posterior capsule
A13: level II left anterior capsule
A14: level II left posterior capsule
A15: level I" right anterior
A16: level III right posterior
A17: level III left anterior
A18: level III left posterior
A19-A20: right base with periurethral margin
A21: left base with periurethral margin
A22-A23: right lateral base
A24: left lateral base
A25: right seminal vesicle and vas deferens
A26: left seminal vesicle and vas deferens
B. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES
Received in formalin labeled with the patient’s identification and ‘left pelvic lymph nodes’ are seven tan
pink lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2cm to 3.4 x 2 x1.8cm.
Bt : four lymph nodes
B2: two lymph nodes
B3-B4: one lymph node
C. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES
Received in formalin labeled with the patient’s identification and ‘right pelvic lymph nodes’ are three tan
pink lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3cm to 5.4 x 2.3 x 1.5cm.
Ct: two lymph nodes
C2-C4: one lymph node

CLINICAL HISTORY:
None provided.

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
