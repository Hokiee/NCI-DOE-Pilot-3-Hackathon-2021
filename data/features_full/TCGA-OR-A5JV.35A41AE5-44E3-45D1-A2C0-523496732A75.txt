fibroadipose and separate 13 x 6 x 2 cm. No mass or lesion. Representative
sections

3. ”Perirenal lymph node." Received is a 1 cm, pink-yellow lymph node.
Bisected.

4. ”Retroperitoneal fat." Received in a small container are portions of
fibroadipose aggregating to 6 x 5 x 3 cm. No mass or lesion. Representative
sections.

5. ”Left adrenal and left kidney.” Received in a large container, 3 1525
gram kidney and adrenal. A 17 x 11 x 12 cm adrenal mass attached to a 13 x 4 x

pseudocapsule and membranous/fascial layer. Attached to the kidney is 2.5 cm
segment of ureter. Inferior pole of kidney contains a 3.6 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm
