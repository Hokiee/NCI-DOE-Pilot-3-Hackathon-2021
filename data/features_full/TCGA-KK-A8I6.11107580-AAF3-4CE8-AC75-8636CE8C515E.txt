> DIAGNOSIS

(E) LEFT BASE:

Fibromuscular tissue and ﬁbroadipose tissue with vessels, nerve trunks and ganglia consistent with extraprostatic
tissue/superior neurovascular bundle tissue and bladder neck tissue and minute focus of prostate glands, no
tumor present.

(F) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:

PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 7 (4 + 3). (SEE COMMENT)

TUMOR EXTENDING INTO EXTRAPROSTATIC TISSUE.

Margins of resection, free of tumor.

Right and left seminal vesicles, no tumor present.

Segments of right and left vasa deferentia, no tumor present.

PERINEURAL INVASION, PRESENT.

No lymphovascular invasion identified.

PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH GRADE.

COMMENF

The prostate gland contains two foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma. Both tumor foci are located in the peripheral zone. The
dominant tumor focus is located in the right lateral, right posterolateral and right posterior peripheral zone. This tumor focus
measures 2.0 x 1.0 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present in the single cross section of the prostate and
extensively in the apex and base. In the right superior neurovascular bundle region, this tumor focus extends focally into
extraprostatic tissue. The added length of extraprostatic extension is 2.0 mm. The margins of resection are free of tumor. The
second tumor focus is located in the left lateral and left posterolateral peripheral zone. This tumor focus measures 1.0 x 0.4 cm in
the largest cross-sectional dimension and it is present In the single cross sectionof the prostate and focally in the apex and base.
This tumor focus is of lower histologic grade and conﬁned to the prostate with negative margins.

Geese DESCRIPTION

(E) LEFT BASE — A fragment of tan—gray tissue measuring 1.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. No orientation provided. Submitted in E.
(F) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and
attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (4.6 x 2.2 x 2.7 cm, 21 grams, post ﬁxation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the
posterolateral aspects of the prostate is scant and symmetrical. A ﬁrm nodule is present on the right base of the prostate. Serial
cross sections after ﬁxation do not demonstrate unequivocal carcinoma.

The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.
Also included in the container is a detached fragment of tissue consistent with seminal vesicle measuring 1.8 x 1.2 x 0.5

SECTION CODE: F1, detached fragment of seminal vesicle; F2-F5, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas
deferens from the base towards the tip; F6-F8, left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip;
F9, prostatic base, right border; F10, prostatic base, right posterior border; F11-F15, prostatic base, central portion; prostatic base,

F25, F26, apex right; F27-F30, sections of the single cross section of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.
The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green. left surface in red, right surface in yellow and posterior surface in

black. Blue ink (F17, F18 and F23) denotes surfaces that do not represent the true margin of resection.
