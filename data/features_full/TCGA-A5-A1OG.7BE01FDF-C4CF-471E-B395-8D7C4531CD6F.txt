A. OMENTUM #1

Labeled with the patient's name. labeled "omentum 1", and received in formalin is a 22.0 x 6.5 x 0.7 cm

adipose tissue. Representative sections are submitted.

Labeled with the patient's name. labeled "omentum 3", and received in formalin is a 17.0 x 14.0 x 2,0 cm
fragment of yellow adipose tissue. Serial sections are unremarkable and reveal lobulated adipose tissue.
Representative sections are submitted.

D. UTERUS/CERVlX/RIGHT TUBE AND OVARY/LEFT TUBE AND OVARY

Labeled with the patient's name, labeled "uterus/cerlelright tube and ovary/left tube and ovary”, and
received fresh from the operating room is a 150 gram specimen consisting of a previously opened uterus
with attached fallopian tubes and ovaries. The uterus measures 7.0 x 7.0 x 5.0 cm. The exooervix
measures 4.0 x 3.0 cm. The endocervical canal measures 4.0 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter. The
endometrial cavity measures 3.0 cm in length and 3.4 cm in width. The right ovary measures 3.0 x 1.2 x
0.4 cm and the right fallopian tube measures 3.6 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. There is a 2.5 x
2.5 x 2.0 cm right paratubal cyst. The left ovary measures 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm and the left fallopian tube
measures 3.2 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter.

The endometrial cavity is largely replaced by a friable, redltan, heaped up 3.0 x 3.0 cm mass which
extends from the fundus to the lower uterine segment on both the anterior and posterior surfaces. The
cut surface reveals invasion into the underlying superﬁcial myometrium. A representative section has
been used for frozen section. The myometrium measures 1.5 cm in thickness and contains multiple,
approximately five to seven nodules located submucosal. intramural, and subserosal. They range from
1.0 to 3.0 cm in greatest dimension. Cut surface of all nodules reveal white fibrous. often whorled surface
and ﬁrm texture without hemorrhage or necrosis.

The exocervix, external 05 and endocervical canal are grossly unremarkable. The uninvolved portion of
the endometrial cavity is covered by tan/pink hemorrhagic mucosal surface without additional gross
lesions. The serosa shows no gross abnormalities.

Representative sections are Submitted.
