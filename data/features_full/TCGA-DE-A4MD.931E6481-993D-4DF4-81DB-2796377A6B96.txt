available at the time of this report, and is subject to change
pending clinical review and additional information.

E: Lymph node, right, modified neck dissection (2, 3, 4)

Clinical History:
The patient is a -year-old man with history of thyroid
carcinoma, clinical

Gross Description:
Received are six appropriately labeled containers.

Container A is additionally labeled "right neck level ZB" is a
2.3 x 1.8 x 1.4 cm fragment of markedly cauterized yellow/tan
fibrofatty tissue is dissected for lymph node candidates. Three
lymph node candidates up to 1.1 cm in greatest dimension are
identified.

Block Summary:
A1 — Three lymph node candidates
A small amount of tissue remains in formalin

Container B is additionally labeled "central compartment right
neck" it holds a 1.7 x 1.7 x 0.6 cm aggregate of cauterized
yellow/tan fibrofatty tissue containing three lymph node
candidates up to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension.

Block Summary:

B1 - Two lymph node candidates
B2 - One lymph node candidate, sectioned,

Container C is additionally labeled "left thyroid lobe" is a 7.8
gram 5.3 x 2.8 x 1.2 cm lobe of thyroid. Specimen is received
focally disrupted along the lateral portion of the specimen.
Inked as follows, anterior blue, posterior black and isthmus
yellow. Specimen is sectioned from superior toward inferior

to reveal a dark red/brown homogenous parenchyma with no focal
lesions noted.

Representative sections are submitted in blocks C1—C4.

Container D is additionally labeled "right thyroid lobe"

Dominant tumor: Present

Tumor description: A solid variegated tan/red to gray/brown
friable mass

Tumor size: 5.5 cm right to left, 6 cm superior to inferior
and 4.5 cm anterior to posterior

Confinement/non—confinementz The overlying soft tissue is
markedly expanded but grossly appears intact.

Distance of tumor to surgical margins: Focally abuts blue inked
anterior, black inked posterior margin and is within 1.5 cm of
the yellow inked isthmus margin

Appearance of thyroid gland away from tumor: There is a scant
amount of dark red/brown normal appearing thyroid tissue in the
most inferior pole of the specimen near the isthmus. Adjacent to
the isthmus margin is a 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm firm white/tan
nodule.

Parathyroids: None identified

tissue procurement

Inking: Anterior blue, posterior black and isthmus yellow

D1 Perpendicular sections of superior margin

D2 - Nodule adjacent to isthmus

D3 - Tumor in relationship to yellow inked isthmus

D4 - Tumor at inferior pole in relationship to adjacent normal
D5—D10 - Representative sections of tumor to include
relationship to blue inked anterior and black inked posterior
margins

Tissue remains in formalin

Container E is additionally labeled "right modified neck
dissection level 2, 3, 4" and it consists of an unoriented 9.5 x
