GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in eight parts. Each part is labeled with the patient‘s name.

A. Received fresh for tissue banking and "left breast" is an 858 gram, 28.0 x 16.0 x 5.0
cm fibrofatty breast. The breast is received with a suture designating superior at one
corner of the skin ellipse. There is no axillary tail, and the breast is consistent with a
simple mastectomy specimen. Separate within the specimen container is a linear 7.0 x 1.5 x
0.8 cm strip of tissue with fibroskeletal muscle. The fascial plane is somewhat smooth,
and no additional fibroskeletal muscle is identified. The breast has an overlying 8.5 x
3.5 cm skin ellipse with a central 3.0 cm areola which extends to the edges of the ellipse
and a 1.0 cm nipple with an adjacent associated papule. No scars or lesions are identified
on the skin surface. There is blue localization dye. The deep margin is inked blue, and
the breast is serially sectioned to have a 1.7 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm indurated tumor mass. A
portion of the tumor is sampled for tissue banking. The tumor is 2.0 cm from the deep
margin. The tumor appears to be in the upper outer quadrant according to the orientation
of the specimen. The tumor is approximately 8.0 cm from superior, 14 cm from inferior, is
11.5 cm from medial and approximately 7 cm from lateral. The tumor is 1.0 cm from the
superficial to lateral peripheral aspect of the breast. The tumor is in the upper outer
quadrant. The remainder of the parenchyma is diffusely fatty, and no additional indurated
lesions are identified. White fibrous tissue appears to involve <20% of the parenchyma.
The breast has an odd shape for orientation and is longer superior to inferior than medial
to lateral. Representative sections are sampled as labeled:

A1 — sections of nipple

A2 - areola

B. Part 2, received in formalin for gross evaluation, labeled with the patient's name and
”sentinel node #1", is a 2.0 x 1.4 x 1. 0- -cm aggregate of yellow, lobulated adipose. The
adipose is sectioned to have a 1.0 x 0.6 x D 5 cm nodular lymph node. The node is
sectioned to be entirely submitted per sentinel lymph node protocol in cassette Bl.

C. Part 3, received for gross evaluation, labeled l’sentinel node #2", is a 4.0 x 3.0 x
2.0 cm aggregate of yellow, lobulated adipose. The adipose is sectioned to have a 0. 5- cm
nodular lymph node. The node is bisected. There is an additional minute 0. 3- cm lymph node

present within the aggregate of adipose. Lymphoid tissue is entirely submitted per
sentinel lymph node protocol in cassette C1.

D. Part 4, received for gross evaluation, labeled “sentinel node #3", is a 1.5 x 1.4 x
0.8ecm portion of yellow, lobulated adipose. The adipose is sectioned to have a nodular,

1.2 x 0.5 x 0.4-cm lymph node. The node is trisected to be entirely submitted per sentinel
lymph node protocol in cassette D1.

E. Part 5, received fresh for frozen section diagnosis labeled with the patient‘s name and
“breast tissue or fat?", is a 6. 3- —gram, 5.0 x 3.0 x 1. 3 cm portion of yellow, lobulated
adipose. The adipose is sectioned to have scant dense white fibrous tissue. The fibrous
tissue makes up between 5 and 10% of the parenchyma. No indurated lesions or tumor-like
masses are identified. A section is sampled for frozen section diagnosis with the frozen
section residue in El. Additional sections are sampled in E2-E3.

Parts 6, 7, and 8 are received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name.

F. Part 6, labeled "right sentinel node #1", is a 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.6—cm nodular lymph node.
The node is sectioned perpendicular to the long axis to be entirely submitted for frozen
section diagnosis with the frozen section residue in cassette F1.

G. Part 7, labeled "right breast tissue new margin", is a 77~gram, 19.5 x 9.5 x 2.0—cm
fibrofatty portion of breast tissue. The specimen is oriented with a single suture
superior and a double suture designating the new margin. The "new margin“ will be inked
blue with the remainder of the specimen inked black. A portion of breast tissue is
sectioned from superior to inferior to have a diffusely glistening fatty cut surface with
scant delicate white fibrous tissue. No areas of induration or tumor—like masses are
identified. The breast is sampled from superior to inferior, concentrating on the areas of
white fibrous tissue. The fibrous tissue makes up <20% of the parenchyma. Representative
sections are sampled in Gl-GG.

H. Part 8, labeled "right breast", is a SSS—gram, 20.0 x 13.5 x 4.5—cm fibrofatty breast.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: (Continued) -

The breast is received with an eccentric, medial overlying 8.0 x 4.0—cm “drop—shaped" skin
excision. The excision has an overlying, inferior 5.0 x 4.0-cm areola, which extends to
the skin edges and a 1.5—cm flat nipple. The remainder of the skin surface demonstrates no
areas of scar. There is a suture at the pole of the excision designating superior. The
deep margin has a roughened to focally smooth fascial plane. There is scant focal
fibroskeletal muscle identified. No axilla is present and the breast is consistent with a
simple mastectomy specimen. The breast is serially sectioned from lateral to medial to
have a 3.0 x 2.0 x 0.8—cm blood—filled biopsy cavity. The biopsy cavity appears to focally
abut the superficial peripheral margin medial toward the skin excision. The biopsy cavity
comes within 1.0 cm of the edge of the skin. The surrounding tissue adjacent to the biopsy
cavity appears to be predominantly glistening yellow adipose. No indurated lesions or
tumor—like masses are identified associated with the biopsy cavity. There are additional
adjacent areas of fat neorosis and hemorrhage associated with the biopsy cavity. The
biopsy cavity is 3.5 cm from the deep margin. The biopsy cavity is approximately 4.0 cm
from superior, 6.0 cm from inferior, is approximately 6 cm from medial and at least 10 cm
from lateral. The biopsy cavity is centrally located within the breast between the upper
and lower inner quadrants. There is diffuse nodular white fibrous breast tissue extending
throughout the specimen. No discrete indurated lesions or tumor-like masses are
identified. There are focal areas consistent with fibrocystic change. The fibrous breast
tissue has a somewhat gritty, granular appearance adjacent to the biopsy cavity underlying
the nipple. The breast is sampled as labeled:

H1 sections of nipple

H2 - areola

H3 - deep margin nearest biopsy cavity

H4—H6 - sections of biopsy cavity to nearest superficial peripheral margin

H7,H8 — sections of biopsy cavity with adjacent granular white fibrous tissue

H9 — upper outer quadrant

H10 ~ lower outer quadrant

H11 - upper inner quadrant (quadrant most closely associated with biopsy
cavity)

H12 - lower inner quadrant sampled

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:

H&E sections of specimen B shows a ductal carcinoma in situ in the surrounding breast
tissue. P63 and CD10 stains of the residual ductal carcinoma in situ does not show
definitive areas of invasion.
