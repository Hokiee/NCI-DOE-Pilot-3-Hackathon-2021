DIAGNOSIS

(A) THROMBUS, LEFT GONADAL VEIN:

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL TYPE.

(B) LEFT KIDNEY:

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL TYPE (80% CLEAR CELLS AND 20% EOSINOPHILIC CELLS), FUHRMAN‘S NUCLEAR
GRADE 4. (SEE COMMENT)

TUMOR MEASURES 14.0 ON] IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION.

TUMOR INVADES PERINEPHRIC ADIPOSE TISSUE AND DIRECTLY INVADES LEFT ADRENAL GLAND.
TUMOR INVADES RENAL SINUS ADIPOSE TISSUE AND RENAL VEIN.

METASTATIC RENAL CELL CARCINOMA INVOLVING ONE OF ONE HILAR LYMPH NODE (111).
TUMOR THROMBUS WITHIN RENAL VEIN AT MARGIN OF RESECTION. (SEE COMMENT)

Ureter and soft tissue margins of resection, free of tumor.

Multiple renal cortical (simple) cysts.
(C) LEFT PARAAORTIC LYMPH NODES:

Ten lymph nodes, no tumor present (0110).
(D) lNTERAORTO-CAVAL LYMPH NODE:

Three lymph nodes, no tumor present (013).

(E) TUMOR THROMBUS:

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL TYPE.

COMMENT

The tumor is a conventional renal cell carcinoma with a predominant grade 3 nuclear grade and scattered foci of grade 4 pleomorphic
nuclei. The nests of tumor cells are surrounded by lymphopiasmacytic infiltrates. Although tumor is seen within the lumen of the renal
vein at the margin of resection. it does not invade the wall of the vessel.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) THROMBUS LEFT GONADAL VEIN - A red-pink irregular fragment of tissue (1.5 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm). Total in A. MLitlc

(B) LEFT KIDNEY - A radical nephrectomy specimen (16.0 x 13.0 x 8.0 cm, total), including a left kidney (14.0 x 13.0 x 8.0 cm), renal
artery (3.0 cm In length and 0.5 cm in diameter), and the renal vein filled with thrombus (3.0 cm in length and 1.5 cm In diameter), and an
unremarkable ureter (9.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm In diameter average). The left adrenal gland is identified and compressed by the
tumor, measuring approximately 3.0 cm in length and 0.1 cm in width. A 14.0 x 13.0 x 8.0 cm ill-defined tumor is replacing 80% of the
kidney at the upper and middle poie. Tumor invades through the capsule into the perinephric adipose tissue. The tumor appears tan-
pink with extensive gelatinous change and necrosis (more than 80%). The tumor appears lnvading into the sinus and distal
pelvicaiyceal system. The Gerota's fascia appears mobile and free of tumor. The tumor is also invading into the left adrenal gland and
replaces majority portion with a rim of the recognizable adrenal gland. One hilar lymph node Is identified. Portion of the tumor ls
submitted for possible electron microscopy.

INK CODE: Gerota's fascia - black.

SECTION CODE: B1, resection margins of renal vein, renal artery, and ureter; B2. B3, renal vein with thrombus; B4, BS, tumor with
resection margin of Gerota's fascia; 36-311, tumor (B10 with sinus; B11 with pelvis); B12, B13, normal kidney; 314, one hilar lymph
node; B15, B16, tumor involving the adrenal gland.

(C) LEFT PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODE - Seven possible lymph nodes (4.0 x 2.5 x 0.6 cm) ranging from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 to 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.4
cm.

SECTION CODE: C1, Three possible lymph nodes; C2, two possible lymph nodes; C3, two possible lymph nodes-

(D) INTERAORTOCAVAL LYMPH NODE - Four lymph nodes ranging from 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.3 to 2.0 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm.

SECTION CODE: D‘l, two lymph nodes; D2, two lymph nodes. -
(E) TUMOR THROMBUS — A 2.5 x 2.5 x1.0 cm red-brown soft tissue, entirely submitted in E1 and E2. -

CLINICAL HISTORY
Left renal mass.
