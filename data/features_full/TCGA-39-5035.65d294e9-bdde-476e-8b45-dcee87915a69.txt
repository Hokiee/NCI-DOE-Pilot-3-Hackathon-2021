5). The specimen is received fresh ané is labeleﬂ, "right lower lobe lung".
It consists of a 16.3 x 14.2 x 6.‘ cm lung lobe with attached bronchus and
bleoa vessels straddled by multiple staple lines. The attached bronchus
measures 0.9 cm. The pleural surface shows a 2.5 s 2.2 cm pleural seat with
adhesions and a prior incision with sutures. whe pleural surface is inked
black. Serial sectioning reveals a 2.9 x 2.5 x 1-3 cm (remaining tumor}
tan, stellate humor abutting the pleural scar. The tumor is ill—defineﬁ.
located 6.0 cm from the bronchial margin and 9.0 cm tram the closest staple
