Horizontal 24mm, Vertical 23mm

Cornea: Horizontal 12mm, Vertical 11.5mm

Optic nerve: flush.

On trans-illumination, a large shadow is seen inferiorly,
approximately 15mm in maximum dimension.

Plane of section: vertical

Intraocular description:
On opening, a solitary pale dome shaped choroidal mass is
seen, with possible ciliary body involvement.

Tumour size:

LED 13mm. Height 9mm.

MICROSCOPY

Sections show a virtually amelanotic melanoma consisting
predominantly of spindle cells however also including a
minor epithelioid cell component up to 10% The tumour
occupies basically the choroid with focal extension to pars
plana. Most of tumour cells are arranged in a fascicular
pattern with nuclear palisading. In addition, there is focal
cytoplasmic vacuolation in tumour cells producing a balloon

cell appearance.

The number of mitosis is approximately 4/40 high power

fields. Closed loops are not present in the planes of
sections. The lymphocytic infiltrate within the tumour is
minimal. Few scattered macrophages are present. Tumour
necrosis is not seen. Bruch's membrane appears focally
breached in one of the sections. There is no tumour
extension through the sclera, optic nerve or vortex veins
examined. Tumour cells are not seen at the resection
margins.

Elsewhere, the cornea shows no significant abnormality; The
anterior chamber angles are open and the anterior chamber is
shallow. The iris shows no significant abnormality but the
ciliary body appears atrophic with hyalinisation of ciliary
processes. The lens shows cataractuous changes. Retina
overlying the tumour is slightly atrophic.

DIAGNOSIS

Left eye, enucleation: Ciliochoroidal melanoma of mixed cell
type.

COMMENT

Assessment of HSP27 expression on immunohistochemistry will
follow. In addition? molecular genetic examination of DNA
extracted from the tumour cells will be performed using
multiplex—ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA),
looking at chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8. A supplementary report
will follow in due course.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (MLPA)

In the meantime, molecular genetic analysis of tumour DNA
extracted from the fresh uveal melanoma tissue was performed
using the technique termed multiplex ligation-dependent
probe amplification (MLPA). These investigations were
performed in the

The kit P027 from , which examines for gains or
losses in 31 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8, was used.
The DNA concentration was measured using 2 and the

quality assessed using multiplex-PCR prior to the MLPA
reaction.

The DNA concentration was high and of good quality on
assessment. The MLPA reaction was run at least twice on
differing occasions, resulting in similar results.

The results of the sequence analysis of the MLPA products is
printed on a separate report. In summary, sequence analysis

demonstrated :

normal chromosome 1p ,

di somy 3 ,

borderline gains in chromosome 6
and normal chromosome 8.

Taken together, these molecular data would place the patient
in the low risk group with respect to the development of
metastatic melanoma. Consideration of clinical features of

the tumour is, however,

also required.

Tumour cells express Melan-A and HSP 2'7 (score 2).
