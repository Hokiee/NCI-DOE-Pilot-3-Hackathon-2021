Gross Description:
Received in ﬁve parts.
Source of Tissue: 1. Labeled # 1, "level 9 lymph node“

Gross Description: Received fresh in a container labeled "level 9 lymph node". It
consists of a single ovoid rubbery gray lymph node measuring 2.4 x 1.4 x 1.3 cm.
Sections disclose a tan-gray cut surface. Entirely submitted in IA.

Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled # 2, "portion of right level 11 lymph node"

Gross Description: Received fresh in a container labeled "portion of right level 11 lymph
node". It consists of three grayish black tissue fragments measuring respectively 0.5, 0.8

and 1.0 cm. The larger node is bisected. All four fragments are submitted in 2A.

Source of Tissue: 3. Labeled # 3, "right lower lobe"

Frozen Section Diagnosis: 3FS- NO TUMOR SEEN AT BRONCHIAL MARGIN PER

Gross Description: Received fresh for frozen section consultation in a

container labeled "right lower lobe". It consists of a 180 gram right lower lobe of lung

measuring 15.0 x 12.0 x 6.0 cm. The bronchial margin was procured for frozen section

and the residue is in 3FS. Also at the hilum are multiple tan ﬁrm nodules

measuring up to 2.0 cm. The nodules are consistent with lymph nodes with Pain W {'W
marked and anthracotic changes and possible metastatic disease. The ‘ l: . 5,, 155,
vascular and bronchial margins are unremarkable. The bronchial tree is

opened and is likewise unremarkable. There is some pleura adjacent to the

hilum having a white thickened cobblestone appearance measuring 2.0 x 2.0
cm. This area will be additionally sampled for histological impression

and comes to within 1.8 cm from the margin. Posterior inferior on the

lung, partially involving the diaphragmatic surface is a large area of

pleural puckering. This area is received partially sectioned disclosing a
large tan mass measuring 4.0 x 4.0 x 3.8 cm. The tumor comes to within
5.8 cm from the margin. Sections show a central ragged cavity containing
necrotic debris. Elsewhere, the pleura is tan-pink, spongy and no

additional lesions or masses are found. Representative sections are
submitted in 3A-I.

Designation of Sections: 3A— vascular margins, 3B-3D— multiple single

hilar and peribronchial lymph nodes, 3E- thickened pleura with possible

tumor studding adjacent to hilum, 3F-3H- right lower lobe tumor, 31-

uninvolved right lower lobe lung tissue

Source of Tissue: 4. Labeled # 4, "level 4 lymph nodes"

Gross Description: Received fresh in a container labeled "level 4 lymph nodes". It
consists of a single gray ﬁrm to rubbery lymph node measuring 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. It is

bisected disclosing a tan firm cut surface. Entirely submitted in 4A.

Source of Tissue: 5. Labeled # 5, "level 7 lymph nodes"

Gross Description: Received fresh in a container labeled "level 7 lymph nodes". It
consists of two tan rubbery nodules measuring respectively 3.2 x 2.5 x 1.5 and 5.0 x 4.0 x
3.0 cm. The smaller node is sectioned disclosing a tan to grayish black cut surface.

The larger portion of tissue is consistent with a few matted nodes ranging

ﬁnm 1.0 up to 4.0 cm. Sections disclose predominantly tan homogeneous

cut surfaces. Representative sections are submitted in 5A—G.

Designation of Sections: SA-SB- single lymph node, 5C-5G— multiple
sections of single nodes [from large matted mass of nodes]

Final Diagnosis:
****AMENDED REPORT****

This amended report is issued to correct the staging in the template to
pTNM: T2NOMx.

**$*****************$***************************************************
1. Level 9 lymph node, biopsy:
- No evidence of metastatic carcinoma in one lymph node (0/1).

- Small lymphocyticl homa rese t, see note.

2. Portion of right level 11 lymph node, biopsy:

— No evidence of metastatic carcinoma in four lymph nodes (0/4).

3. Lung, right lower lobe, lobectomy:

- Invasive squamous cell carcinoma, 4 cm, poorly differentiated.

- The tumor does not involve the visceral pleura.

- Lymphovascular space invasion is not seen.

- The pleural, bronchial and vascular margins are free of tumor.

- No metastatic carcinoma is seen in eleven peribronchial lymph nodes
(0/11).

4. Level 4 lymph nodes, biopsy:

- NO evidence of metastatic carcinoma in one lymph node (0/1).

- Small lymphocytic lymphoma present.

5. Level 7 lymph nodes, biopsy:

- No evidence of metastatic carcinoma in multiple matted lymph nodes.
- Small lymphocytic lymphoma present.

- pTZNOMx

Note: The lymph nodes show effacement of the normal architecture by small
lymphocytes. The tumor lymphocytes are positive for CD20 and CD23. The
lymphocytes are negative for CD10, CD3 and cyclinDl. The CD5 seems to be
following the pattern of the CD3. These ,ﬁpdings are consistent with small
lymphocyticlmphgma.
