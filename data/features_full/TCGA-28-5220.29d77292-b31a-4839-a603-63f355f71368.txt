A high percentage of tumor cells (greater than 20%) immunostaining for MGMT has been reported to be

Hence the loss of PTEN in this case suggests a diminished probability of
response to EGFR-kinase inhibitors.

ssociation between Iaminin-S and glial tumor grade. recurrence, and patient survival.

   
 

y, elevated expression of beta 1 and suppressed expression of beta 2 in this tumor predict
more aggressive behavior.

Presence of activated (phosphorylated) p42f44 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (pMAPK) often is
indicative of an upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. It has been shown to be associated

with a relative resistance to radiation therapy in glioblastoma multiforme—

Correspondingly, a high percentage of tumor cells immunoreactive to pMAPK antibody in this case may
predict a relative resistance to radiation therapy.

The use of these tests in guiding therapy has limitations. Review of the relevant literature and clinical
correlation is advised. Thes test results do not obligate or preclude use of the relevant therapeutic
agents.

HISTORY: _
Right occipital tumor

MICROSCOPIC FINDINGS:

Sections disclose infiltrating glioma composed of minimally pleomorphic population of oval to angulate
nuclei associated with numerous mitotic ﬁgures, very focal endothelial proliferation and occasional foci of
palisading necrosis. The ﬁndings are of a glioblastoma muttiforme.

FLUORESCENCE IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION (FISH) for EGFR in BRAIN

 

Tissue Block: -

RESULTS: POLYSOMY of chromosome 7 (See note below)

Number of cells evaluated: 40

INTERPRETATION:

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis on a brain tumor sample from this patient with Abbott
Molecular probes speciﬁc for the centromere of chromosome 7 (control probe) and the short arm (EGFR—
7p12) of Chromosome 7 was performed. The control sample gave expected results.

These studies showed polysomy of chromosome 7 in 70% of the nuclei examined. in brain tumors this
Signal pattern correlates with an amplified EGFR signal pattern.

NOTE:

1. Samples are considered positive in brain if the EGFR to CEP 7 signal ratio is a 2.0 in 2 10% of
analyzed cells or tumors with four or more copies of the EGFR gene in a 40% of the cells (high
polysomy).

2. Samples are considered inconclusive. requiring consult with the pathologist, in brain if the EGFR to

CEP 7 signal ratio is a 2.0 in <10% of analyzed cells or when four or more copies of the EGFR gene in <
40% of the cells.

These FISH tests were developed and their performance characteristics determined by-

approve or spear IC uses by the U. 8. Food and Drug Administration.
