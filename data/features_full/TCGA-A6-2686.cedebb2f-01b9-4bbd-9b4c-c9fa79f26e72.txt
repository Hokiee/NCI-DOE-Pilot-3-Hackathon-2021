SPECIMEN
Right colon

CLINICAL NOTES ‘
PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Ri ht colon CA
CLINICAL HISTORY: h with above h + on bx
GROSS DESCRIPTION
Received fresh in a container labeled "right colon" is a
previously opened portion of bowel, with a tan—pink smooth
glistening serosal surface, and with adherent yellow adipose
tissue.
There is an appendix present 4.5 cm long x 0.6 cm. in diameter.
The
appendix is grossly unremarkable, with a tan serosa, tan wall and
tan mucosa, without focal lesion. The bowel consists of 5 cm. of
distal small bowel and 15 cm. of contiguous proximal colon. There
is
a circumferential 6 x 4.5 x 1.2 cm. tumor mass in the ileocecal
valve/cecal region. It grossly extends through the full thickness
of the bowel wall and into surrounding adipose tissue. There is
possible serosal umbilication, with this area inked blue, with this
area difficult to assess due to the prior opening. The tumor is not
near the radial margin. The mucosa away from the mass lesion is
tan~pink and glistening with a normal pattern of folds. The
colonic
portion of the specimen averages 8 cm. in circumference, and the
small bowel segment averages 4.2 cm. in circumference. The small
bowel is without focal lesion. The adipose tissue is dissected,
and
multiple soft tan lymph nodes are identified. RS—l3, following
fixation, according to the accompanying block summary.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — proximal and distal resection margins; 2—5 —
tumor, including relationship to uninvolved bowel and to serosal
surface; 6 — appendix, 7 — largest lymph node, bisected, 8~l3 “
lymph nodes, with multiple lymph nodes per block.

 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

The following template summarizes the findings in this case:

Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma

Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated

Primary tumor pr}: pT3. Carcinoma invades through the full
thickness of the bowel wall and into surrounding adipose tissue.
Proximal margin: Negative

Distal margin: Negative

Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative

Distance of tumor from closest margin: See gross description
Vascular invasion: Not definitively identified.

Regional lymph nodes (pN): pNO. Thirtyhthree lymph nodes are
identified, and they are negative for malignancy.

Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: Not identified

Distant metastasis (pM): pMX

Other findings: The appendix is without Specific diagnostic
abnormalities.

DIAGNOSIS

Terminal ileum, appendix, and right colon, excision
— Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, invading through the full
thickness of the bowel wall and into surrounding adipose tissue
(see microscopic description).
— Margins negative for malignancy.
— Thirty~three lymph nodes negative for malignancy.
~ Appendix without specific diagnostic abnormalities.
