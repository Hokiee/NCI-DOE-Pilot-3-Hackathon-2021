MICROSCOPIC REPORT

The sections reveal irregular pieces of pleural tissue diﬂusely infiltrated a biphasic tumour showing areas of
epithelioid tumour cells with visible nucleoli and a moderate amount of cytoplasm. which merge with areas of
tumour dis a in a more sarcomatoid mo no with oval to lum 5 ”note sha :1 cells set in ﬁbrous stoma.

lmmgnoh'mghemiﬂy - The tumour. mainly in the epitl'lelioid areas. is variably positive for MNF‘I 16, AE1AE3.
C034, Bel-2, C099 (weak) and EMA (weak, focally membranous), but shows only one small focus where a few
cells stain for calretinin. There is no signiﬁcant staining for CKS/a, mesothelin, €031, HMB45 and TTF-1. WT-‘i
shows variable cytoplasmic staining. but no signiﬁcant nuclear positivity.

Despite the lack of speciﬁc staining for mesothelial markers, the morphological appearances favour biphasic

mesotheliorna.
Clinical—radiclogical-pamologiml correlation is advised.
