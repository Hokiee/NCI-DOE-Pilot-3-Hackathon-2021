Microscopic Description and Comment:

Sections of the endometrium. leit ovary and omenium show mixed high grade serous carcinoma and endometrioid
carcinoma (overall about 60% endometrioid and 40% serous). There is also high grade serous carcinoma In the
cervix, right ovary. peritubai soft tissue oi the left tailopian lube and detached lntraiurninai fragments of high grade
serous carcinoma within the right iatiopian tube. Within the endometrium, the carcinoma invades the myometrlum and
extends to the cervical mucosa with stromal invasion.

Whenever there Is carcinoma in the ovaries and endometrium, it can be difficult or impossible to decide whether these
represent synchronous primary tumors or whether one site represents metastatic spread from another site. in this
case. iactors that favor an endometrial primary with metastases to ovary and peritoneum include the presence of an
Identical mixed serous and endometrioid morphology in both locations as well as myometrial Invasion, lymphvascular
space invasion and cervical extension In the uterus. However. clinical correlation Is recommended to arrive at a final
determination.

 

iS cry:
The patient IS _who has an adnexal mass and an elevated CA125. Operative procedure:
Total abdomina ysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophoreciomy, and optimal tumor debulklng.

Gross Description;
The specimens are received in eight formalin—tilled containers, each labels The first container is

labeled “omental biopsy, FSf/X." it contains a white cassette that holds a — n tissue measuring 2.2 x
2.2 x 0.2 cm. Additionally in the container is a 13 x 8 x 4 cm portion of yellow omentum. Sections show a diffusely firm
yellow-tan cut surface with innumerable tan tumor nodules measuring up to 2 cm. Labeled A1 - remnant of F31; A2 -
section including largest tumor nodule.

The second container is labeled "cervix. uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries.‘ It contains a 223-gram uterus, cervix, and
attached right adnexa. The uterus measures 9.5 cm inlerier-to-superior; 8 cm cornu-to-cornu; and 4.5 cm
anterior-to—posterior. The uterine across is tan and smooth. The 3.3 x 3 cm eclocervix ls partially disrupted anteriorly
and has a tan-brown slightly rough surface with pinpoint hemorrhages. The 2.8 cm endocerle is tan, unremarkable,
and patent. The 3.5 x 3 cm endometn’al cavity is distorted by fibroids and has a tan. unremarkable surface with a
thickness of 0.1 cm. The myometrium contains numerous fibroids. the largest oi which measures 4.5 x 4 x 3.5 cm and
is in the right anterolateral aspect of the lundus. There is a fibroid in the posterior wall that is extensively calcllied. All
of the fibroids have well-circumscribed and tan-white whorled cut surfaces without hemorrhage or necrosis. The
non—fibroid myomelrial wait thickness measures 2 cm. The right adnexa measures 5 x 4.5 x 3 cm and has a rough. tan
surface with scattered tumor nodules. Sections show a fan cut surface that is partially replaced by ten, papillary. iriable
tumor. The 6 x 0.8 cm fallopian tube has a tan smooth serosai surface and is sectioned to show a tan-brown cut
surface with focal hemorrhage and a pinpoint lumen. Additionally in the container is a left adnexa weighing 26 grams.
The ovary is distorted by enumerabfe. tan. focally papillary tumor covering most of the surface. At one end there
appears to be a disrupted cyst wall. The ovary/mass measures 7 x 3 x 2.8 cm. Sections show a solid and cyst mass.
Some of the cysts have yellow gelatinous material. The solid areas are tan with more papillary areas on the surface.
The adherent fallopian tube measures 4 x 1 cm and has a tan smooth across with a tan cut surface and a pinpoint
lumen. Acid decaiciiication. Labeled Bi to 83 contiguous anterior strip with Bi containing cervix. 82 containing lower
uterine segment. and 83 containing endomafrium; B4 to 86 contiguous posterior strip with B4 containing cervix. 35
containing lower uterine segment. and BB containing endometriurn with calcified underlying leiomyoma; B? to BS - right
ovary with 37 containing surface tumor; Bio - right fallopian tube; B11 to 314 - left ovary; i315 - left fallopian tube; 816
to 819 - remainder of posterior end ' m; 820 to 827 - remainder oi anterior endometrium with B20 to B25
containing a surface papillary areaflﬂl

The third container is labeled “a ppendix". It contains a 4.5 x 1 x 0.8 cm appendix with a tan serosal surface that is less
hemorrhagic and has numerous tan nodules on the surface measuring up to 0.3 cm. There is up to 1 x 1 cm of
tan-yellow mesoappendix. Sections show a fan cut surface with a wait thickness of up to 0.4 cm and as thin as 0.1 cm.
The ium an is obliterated towards the tip. Proximally the lumen is filled with white mucoid material and has a diameter
of 0.5 cm. Labeled Ct to C2 - tip with tumor; CS - proximal appendix with mucoid material; C4 - margin. Jar 1.

The fourth container is labeled 'rectosigmoid nodule.” it contains numerous fragments of Ian and brown tumor
measuring in aggregate 2.5 x 2 x 0.7 cm. Seottoned. Labeled Di.

The fifth container is labeled 'omentum/gastrocolic.‘ it contains three pieces of yellow-tan omenturn measuring 25 x 6.5
x 0.9 cm; 18 x 3.5 x up to 1.6 cm; and 17 x 6 x 1 cm. The second piece contains a large tan tumor nodule measuring
2.1 cm. Sectioned to show a few smaller tan tumor nodules measuring up to 0.3 cm. Labeled El — largest tumor
nodule and a smaller tumor nodule.

The sixth container ls labeled "right diaphragm nodule.” lt cont ins multiple fragments ol tan tissue measuring in
aggregate i.6 x 1.1 x 0.3 cm. Wrapped. Labeled F1 . i

The seventh container ls labeled "falciiorm ligament.” it contains a portion oi yellow-brown soft tissue measuring 10.8 x
6.7 x 1.2 cm. The surface is ten. smooth, and glistening. Sectioned to show tan and red hemorrhagic tissue. No
delinite gross tumor nodules are seen. A putative tan, unremarkable lymph node is identified me g 0.7 cm.
Labeled GI - putative lymph node; G2 - hemorrhagic soft tissue; GS - unremarkable soft tissue. W

The eighth container is labeled "right diaphragm nodule #2. rule out pleural invasion.” It contains multiple fragments of
