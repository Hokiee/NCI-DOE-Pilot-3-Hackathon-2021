Rectosigmoid colon with an ulcerated rectal carcinoma characterized histologically as a
moderately differentiated colorectal adenoma, extending at most to within 4 cm of the
aboral resection margin, with a diameter of 3 cm at the widest point. Invasive tumor spread
to the periproctic fatty tissue. The minimum distance from the soft tissue resection margin
is 2 cm. Mucosa of both the rectum and colon shows a tubular adenoma of the colon
mucosa, with moderate epithelial dysplasia (synonym: mild intraepithelial neoplasia). In
addition, the mucosa of the colon and rectum show pseudomelanosis.

Oral and aboral resection margins tumor-free.
