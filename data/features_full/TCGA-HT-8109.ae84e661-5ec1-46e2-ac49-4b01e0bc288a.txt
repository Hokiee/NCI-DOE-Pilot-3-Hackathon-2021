Addendum Diagnosis: Right frontal brain tumor, including inferior medial frontal lobe
region: Oligodendroglioma with focal anaplastic progression (grade III).
- MlB-l labeling index: 8.2%

Microscopic Description: Sections of the right frontal tumor demonstrate a diffusely
moderately hypercellular neoplasm composed of mildly to moderately atypical
oligodendrocytes. No microvascular proliferation or necrosis is seen. The tumor diffusely
infiltrates both the gray and white matter. There is a generally consistent cellularity.
However, slide 43 demonstrates nodular foci with both greater cellularity and atypia. In
one of these regions 6 mitoses are seen in 10 high power fields. Overall, this pattern is
consistent with early anaplastic progression of an underlying low grade
Oligodendroglioma. Sections of the inferior medial frontal lobe tumor also demonstrate
a diffuse, moderately cellular Oligodendroglioma. Here, again, there are nodular foci
with greater cellularity. However, only 1 mitosis is identified in 30 high power fields in
this region.
