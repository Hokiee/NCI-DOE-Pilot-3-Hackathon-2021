SPECIMEN
A. Left tube and ovary
B. Uterus, cervix, right tube and ovary
C. Right colon

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS
A. Ovarian serous cyst adenofibroma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Received fresh for frozen section, labeled "left tube
and ovary” is a 658 gram, 12.0 x 10.0 x 8.7 cm. attenuated
white pink—red cystic structure, with an attached, fimbriated, 10.5
cm. fallopian tube averaging 0.25 cm. in diameter. The fallopian
tube lumen is pinpoint and stellate on sectioning. On opening the
cyst contains a copious amount of serous fluid. The inner lining
ranges from smooth white pink to wrinkled tan white—gold. No
papillations are evident. A frozen section is performed {see
frozen
section diagnosis). No definitive residual ovarian stroma is
identified grossly. Representative sections are submitted in six
additional blocks.

B. Received in formalin, labeled ”uterus, cervix, right
tube with ovary" is a 22 gram, 2.8 cm. (superior to
inferior) x 2.5 cm.{cornu to cornu) x 1.5 cm.(anterior to
posterior)
symmetrical uterine corpus with attached 1.5 cm. cervix and right
adnexa. The serosa is smooth, tan pinkwred. The 2.3 x 1.9 cm.
mottled white pink—red ectocervix surrounds a 0.2 x 0.1 cm. 03. The
cervical mucosa is moderately trabecular, tan pink with a 0.6 x 0.2
x 0.2 cm. soft white pink endocervical polyp anteriorly (see block
1). The triangular, 1.8 x 1.0 cm. uterine cavity is lined by flat
white pink endometrium averaging 0.15 cm. The myometrium is
smooth,
pale tan—pink and averages 1.0 cm. in thickness. No intramural
leiomyomata are present. The cribriform tan pink—gold right ovary
measures 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. The stroma is pale tan with

GROSS DESCRIPTION
identifiable corpora albicantia. In addition, there is a single,
0.4 cm. smooth lined serous fluid—filled cyst. The fimbriated tan
pink right fallopian tube measures 4.3 cm. in length and averages
0.3 cm. in diameter with a pinpoint stellate lumen on sectioning.
Representative sections are submitted in five blocks as labeled.
RS-5.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 v anterior cervix; 2 — posterior cervix; 3 —
anterior endomyometrium; 4 ~ poeterior endomyometrium; 5 — right
tube and ovary.

 

C. Received fresh labeled "right colon" is a previously
unopened 30 cm. segment of proximal right colon with
attached 11.5 cm. of distal ileum surfaced by smooth to scabrous
tan
pink serosa with a moderate amount of attached mesentery and
mesocolon. An unremarkable, 4.5 cm. appendix averaging 0.6 cm. in
diameter is present. The proximal and distal margins measure 3.7
and 5.7 cm. in circumference respectively. On opening there is a
well circumscribed, 2.8 x 2.0 rubbery white—pink-red sessile
ulcerated lesion located 20 cm. from the distal margin. A portion
of the tumor and a portion of normal mucosa are submitted for
tissue
procurement as requested. On sectioning the tumor has a maximal
thickness of 0.7 cm., grossly extending into the muscularis to
within 0.6 cm. of the inked free radial serOSal surface. The ileal
mucosa and uninvolved colonic mucosa are unremarkable glistening
tan
pink with regular folds and the walls average 0.5 cm. in thickness.
Several soft to slightly rubbery tan pink tissues in keeping with
lymph nodes measuring up to 0.9 cm. in greatest dimension are
recovered from the attached mesocolon and mesentery.
Representative
sections are submitted in l3 blocks as labeled. RS—13

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — proximal and distal margins; 2 and 3 ~ tumor
full thickness to inked free radial serosal surface; 4 and 5 —

GROSS DESCRIPTION
central tumor; 6 F tumor to normal; 7 ~ ICV; 8 and 9 — random
colonic mucosa; 10 ~ appendix; 11 and 12 w whole lymph nodes; 13 -
bisected largest lymph node. -

14, 4X2, 5

DIAGNOSIS

A. Left tube and ovary, left salpingo—oophorectomy —~ Serous
cystadenofibroma of ovary. Attached fallopian tube, no significant
pathology.
B. Uterus, cervix, right tube and ovary, total hysterectomy and
right salpingo—oophorectomy —— Uterus with atrophic endometrium.
Cervix with endocervical polyp.
Attached atrophic right ovary with several inclusion cysts;
right fallopian tube, no significant pathology.

DIAGNOSIS

C. Right colon, right hemicolectomy ~— Moderately differentiated
adenocarcinoma of the right colon, pT3. All margins are negative
for tumor. All 16 regional lymph nodes are negative for
metastatic disease.

Appendix and portion of ileum, no significant pathology.
