A Received fresh, the specimen is tabeled “right m'd
neurovasculsr margin" and consists of a 0.4 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm pi see
of pink-tan soft tissue. 100%frozen for intraoperaiive
consultation. Sanitary of sections: AtFSQ

8. Received fresh, the specimen is labeled "right posterior para
apical margin" and consists of a 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm piece of
pink-tan soft tissue. 100%frozen for intraoperative
consultation. Sumry of sections: BlFSC

C. Received fresh, the specimen is labeled "right anterior
apical nargin" and consists of a less than 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm
piece of pi nit—tan soft tissue. 100%frozen for intracperative
consultation. Sumry of sections: CiFSQ

D. Received fresh, the specimen is labeled ”prost ate gland and
sent nal vesi cles" and consists of a 40. 5 gram radical
prostatectorry specinen including a 5 x 4.5 x 4 cm prostate, a 3 x
2 x 0.7 cmleft seninai vesicle, a 4,5 x 0.9 x 0.5 cmleft vas
deferens, a 4 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm right sent nal vesicle, and a 3.5 x
0.7 x O. 6 cm right vas def erens. The right side of the speclnen
is inked green and the left side is inked black. The sent nal
vesicle base, bl adder neck and apical margins are shaved and
subnitted. The prostate is serially sectioned fromthe apex to
base with sections designated fromA to E respectively. 01
sectioni n9, mittiple noduiar and cystic areas are seen. Section
B and D are subnitted for research. The prostate is subm’tted
entirety. 131- right and left seminal vesicle; 02- anterior
