1) The specimen in received fresh £0! frozen section, labeled “Right
Level 10 Hediastinal Lymph Node“. It consists of a 0.6 x 9.5 x 6.2 cm lymph
node which in entirely frozen for intraoparative diagnosis.

Summary of Sections:
FBC — frozen section control

2) The spectmen is received fresh for frozen section, labaled “Right
Level 11 Mediaatinal Lymph Node”. It consists of 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm lyngh
node which is entirely frozen for intraoparahiva ﬁiagnosia.

4) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled, “Right. level eleven
msdiastiual lymph node“. It consists of a 1.0 x 0.8 3-: 0.3 can anthracotic
lymph node which is entirely submitted.

Sumary of Sections:
LN - lymph nods

5) . The specimen is received fresh labeled "Right upper lobe of lung“, and
consists of a resectsd lobe of lung measuring 16 x 3.1 x 3 cm. The pleural
surface is pink-tan and smooth. There is n. 17 cm staple line identified on
the medial aspect of the npecimsn. The lateral aspect of the specimen shows
a «E x 3 cm area of pleural thickening. This surface is inked black. This
area also shows a 3 cm incised area containing three blue 3111: sutures.

The stapled margin. bronchial margin. and vessel margins are shaved and
auhmitted entirely. There are multiple anthrscotic paribronoliial lymph
nodes identified and entirely submitted. On bivalving the specimen, there
is a 3.7 x 3.2 x 2.5 cm firm variegated grey—tan tumor nodule underlying the
area. of pleural thickening. It is abuts the pleura and located 1.9 cm from
the bronchial margin and 2.2 cm. from the stapleﬁ margin. The remainder OE
the lung parsnchyma shows diffuse emphysematous chsngee, particularly
surrounding the tumor. There are multiple intraparenchymal lymph nodes
identified and submitted entirely. on complete opening of the bronchus,
there is no lesions identified on the mucous. Representative sections are
submitted. A sample of the tumor is given to TIPS. The specimen has been
photographed.

6) The specimen is receiveé in formalin, labeled. ”Right level four
mediastinal lymph node“. It consists of three fragments of dark anthracstic
lymph nodes with attached fat. measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm in aggregate.
The largest fragment appears to be a single 1.4 cm lymph node. The specimen
is bisected and the remaining two fragments are entirely submitted whole.
