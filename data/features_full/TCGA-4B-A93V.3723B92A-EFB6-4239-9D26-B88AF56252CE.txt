SYNOPTIC REPORT

Tumor slta: Right lower lobe
Specimen integrity: intact
Tumor size: 3 cm
Tumor focality: Unifocal
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma
Histologic grade: Moderate to poorly differentiated (GZ-GB)
Visceral pleural invasion: Not identiﬁed
Microscopic extent of tumor: Tumor surrounded by IUng. without evidence of invasion more proximal than the
lobar bronchus
Margins: Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma
Bronchial margin: Negative for tumor
Vascular margin: Negative for tumor
Parenchymal margin: Negative for tumor
Treatment effect: ' Not identiﬁed
Lymthascular invasion: Absent
Regional lymph nodes: Three lymph nodes are negative for tumor (0/3)
Pathologlc Tumor Stage: pT1b pm)

Comment: Sections from the tumor are remarkable for predominanﬂy moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. More
solid areas are identiﬁed. and therefore, immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratin-7. cytokeratin-SIB, TTF-‘i, and p63
were performed to evaluate for a mixed subtype. The tumor is positive for cytokeratin-7 and TTF-1 only. conﬁrming an
adanocarcinoma. Molecular studies may be indicated.

SPECIMENIS) SUBMITTED: GROSS DESCRIPTION

1.

Right fowerlobe of lung: Received initially in the fresh state labeled "right lower lobe of lung“ is a 201.5 gram. 15.5 x
11.5 x 3.5 cm lung lobe. The pleura displays a abundant anthracotic pigment. Sectioning reveals a well circumscribed 3
cm in greatest dimension ﬁrrn tumor within the anterior basal segment. The tumor lies 2.8 cm from the bronchial margin
of resection. The tumor abuts, but does not penetrate through the overlying pleura. The remaining parenchyma is
spongy red-brown. No hilar lymph nodes are identiﬁed. The pleura overlying the tumor is inked black. Representative
sections are submitted in 5 cassettes as A-B tumor to include overlying pleura. C tumor to include uninvolved lung
parenchyma. D normal lung parenchyma, E bronchial and vascular margins.

Right peribronchial lymph node: In formalin labeled "right peribronchial lymph node" is a 0.7 cm lymph node which is
submitted in toto in one cassette.

Right paratracheal lymph node: in formalin labeled "paratracheal lymph node” are 2 lymph node fragments
aggregating 1.2 cm which is submitted in toto in one cassette.
