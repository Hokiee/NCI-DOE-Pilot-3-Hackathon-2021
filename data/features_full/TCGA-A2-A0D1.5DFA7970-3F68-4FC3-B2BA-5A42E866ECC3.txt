. GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, ,
designated "SENTINEL NODE #1" is a 3.0 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm irregular portion of
soft tissue. Sectioning reveals a 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm pink—tan lymph node.
The lymph node is bisected. One half of the lymph node is submitted in
OCT for CBCP protocol, and the remainder is submitted for permanent.

B. Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, I

, designated "ADDITIONAL LYMPH NODE" is a single, tan-brown
fragment of soft tissue measuring 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. The
specimen is submitted in its entirety in one cassette. 1C1

C Receivrd in formalin, labeled with the patient’s name,

, designated "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2" is a lobulated fragment of
yellow, adipose tissue measuring 1.5 x 2.0 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is
bisected to reveal one lymph node measuring 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.
The specimen is submitted entirely in one cassette. 1C2

D. Received fresh, labeled with the patient’s name, ,

designated "LEFT BREAST LUMPECTOMY" is a globoid portion of soft tissue
oriented with the short stitch superior and long stitch lateral. The

fibrous tissue. No additional lesions are identified. Representative
sections are submitted as follows:
