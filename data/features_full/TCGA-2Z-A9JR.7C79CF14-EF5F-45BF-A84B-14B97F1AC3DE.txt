Gross Description
A. Specimen A is received fresh labeled “right partial nephrectomy Ink is margin.” The specimen
consists of a partial nephrectomy measuring 3.9 x 28- x 2.9 cm weighing 13.1 g. The specimen is
oriented according to the surgeon's designation and is inked as follows:

Parenchymal resection margin ‘mked: Blue

Renal capsule is inked: Black
On sectioning the specimen reveals and irregular iii-defined rubbery intraparenchymal solid tumor
which measures 2.8 7:15 at 2.4 cm- The tumor bulges the renal capsule and extends to within 0.3 cm
or the closest parenchymal resection margin. Cot surface of the tumor is pale yellow to tan brown
locally hemorrhagic. Representative section 0! the tumor in relation to the closest parenchymal
resection margin is submitted for frozen section as FEM. Representative sections of the specimen
are submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory. Additional sections or the specimen are
submitted in 8 cassettes as follows:

AZ-AQ: Tumor with adjacent and involved renat parenchyma and

overlying renal capsule.

B. Specimen 3 received fresh labeled ”deep margin, ink is margin.” The specimen consists of an

Irregular oriented fragment or renal parenchyma measuring 1.? x 1.2 x 0.? cm. The specimen is
oriented aooording to the surgeon's designation and the new paren chymal resection margin Is relnlred
black. The specimen is serially sectioned and Is submitted entirely for frozen section as F331.
