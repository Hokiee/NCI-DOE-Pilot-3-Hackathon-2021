(D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES:
PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 9 (4 + 5). (SEE COMMENT)
TUMOR EXTENDING IN MULTIPLE AREAS INTO EXTRAPROSTATIC TISSUE.
TUMOR INVADING LEFT SEMINAL VESICLE AND LEFT PERIVESICULAR SOFT TISSUE.
FOCAL EXTENSION OF TUMOR TO THE MARGIN OF RESECTION CANNOT BE EXCLUDED.
Right seminal vesicle and segments of vasa deferentia, no tumor present.
SEE PREVIOUS REPORT FOR DIAGNOSIS OF THE PELVIC LYMPH NODES.

COMMENT?

The prostate gland contains a single focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor is located in the right
anterior, mid anterior, left anterior, left anterolateral, left lateral, left posterolateral, left posterior, mid
posterior, right posterior, right posterolateral and right lateral peripheral zone. It is estimated that the tumor
occupies approximately 70% of the prostatic volume. The tumor focus measures 4.5 x 3.0 cm in the largest
cross-sectional dimension and it is present in three cross sections and extensively in the apex and base
regions. The tumor exhibits extraprostatic extension in the left lateral and left posterolateral aspect of the
prostate, left superior neurovascular bundle region and posterior surface of the prostate at the base level.
At the sites of extraprostatic extension, the margin of resection is free of tumor. The tumor extends in the

right posterolateral aspect of the prostate to less than 0.1 mm from the inked surface. Focal marginal
involvement cannot be excluded.

The tumor extensively involves the left seminal vesicle including intra and extraprostatic portions.

Please refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes.

GROSS: DESCRIPTION

Page: 4
!pec1men DatelTlme:

(D) PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES — A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left
seminal vesicles and attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia.

The prostate gland (5.8 x 3.3 x 3.4 cm, 51 grams, post-fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue
present along the left posterolateral aspect of the prostate appears more abundant than along the right side.

Nodules are palpated on the left and right sides of the prostate. Serial cross sections after fixation
demonstrate areas consistent with tumor in the right posterolateral and left posterolateral peripheral zone of
the three cross sections of the prostate.

The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.

SECTION CODE: D1-D3, right seminal vesicle and segment of right vas deferens from the base
towards the tip; D4-D6, left seminal vesicle and segment of left vas deferens from the base towards the tip;
D7, D8, prostatic base, right border; D9—D12, prostatic base, right posterior border; DIB—D22, prostatic base,
central portion; D23, 024, prostatic base, left border; D5-028, prostatic base, left posterior border; D29—DB1,
apex anterior; D32, D33, apex left; D34, D35, apex posterior; D36, D37, apex right; D38-D49, sections of
the three cross sections of the prostate according to specimen radiograph.

The anterior aspect of the prostate is inked in green, left surface in red, right surface in yellow and

posterior surface in black.
