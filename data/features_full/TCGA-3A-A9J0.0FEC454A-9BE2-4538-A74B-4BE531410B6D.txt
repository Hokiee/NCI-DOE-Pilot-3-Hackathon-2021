PANCREATODUODENE‘CTOMY:

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, measuring 4.0 cm, extending

The common bile duct margin is negative for dysplasia and carcinoma.

Gallbladder with chronic cholecystitis.

Comment

Sections through the Amputla show apancreatic ductat adenocarcinoma secondarily invotving the
Ampulla and com mon bile duct. A precursor lesion for the carcinoma is not identiﬁed in the Ampuila,
duodenum or bile duct. The carcinoma, however, is centered on the main pancreatic duct. The
adiancet pancreatic parenchyma hsows PantN 3. These ﬁndings support the interpretation of this as a
pancreatic ductal primary, rather than an Ampullary or common bile duct primary.

Ancillary Testing
immunohistochemical stains with appropriate controls were peﬁoaned on biock 89. These results

Show strong and diffuse expression for MUG-”l , and no expression for MUG—2 and CDXZ. These
results. are consistent with a pancreatobiliary phenotype.

Gross Description

A. Specimen A is received fresh for frozen section analysis labeled “hepatic artery lymph node.”
The specimen consists of a 2.0 x “i .5 x 0.54m, ﬁrm gray-brown irregular lymph node which is bisected
and entirely submitted for frozen section as FEM.

B. Specimen B is received fresh for frozen section analysis labeted “bile duct, gallbiadder portion
of pancreas duodenum and distal stomach.” The specimen consists of a portion of the pancreas {4.5
x. 3.1} x 2.0 cm}, duodenum {8.0 cm in length), gallbladder (10.0 x 3.1.} x 3.0 cm). No distal stomach is
grossly appreciated. The portal vein groove is marked with blue ink, superior mesenteric artery
margin yellow ink, and retroperitoneal surface exterior green ink. The pancreatic duct is probe-patent
for approximately 2.0 cm and is grossly occluded by ﬁrm indurated gray—tan mass (4-0 x 3}} x 2.0 cm}.
Grossly the mass appears to be directly subiacent to the common bite duct and grossty involving the
Ampulla. The remaining pancreatic parenchyraa consists of a yellow lobulated grossty unremarkable
tissue. The common bile duct, is probe-patent but does grossly appear to be somewhat dilated. The
remainder of the duodenal mucosa exhibits normal intestinal folds. No other nodules or polyps are
grossly appreciated. the serosa of the gallbladder is green—yellow and smooth. On opening, there is
a moderate amount of green viscous bile. No calculi grossly appreciated. the mucosal surface of the
gallbladder is green-yellow and velvet-like. No stomach is grossly appreciated. A representative
section of the tumor is submitted to Tissue Procurement Laboratory. A representative frozen section
is taken and submitted as:

FSB‘t: Tangential common bile duct margin of resection
Permanent representative sections are submitted as:
82: Portal vein groove perpendicularly sectioned
33: Superior mesenteric artery tangentially removed and perpendiculady
sectioned.
84' Retroperitoneal surface perpendicularly sectioned.
