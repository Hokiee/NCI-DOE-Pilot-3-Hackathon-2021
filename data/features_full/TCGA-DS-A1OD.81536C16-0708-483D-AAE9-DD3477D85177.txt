RIGHT COMMON ILIAC NODE, BIOPSY:
—No tumor identified in one lymph node (0/1)
—Sinus histiocytes present

UTERUS, RADICAL HYSTERECTOMY:

~Poorly differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
uterine cervix, large cell, focally keratinizing i

~The maximal thickness of the cervical stromal invasion is 19 mm
—The maximal superficial spread of the tumor is 22 mm

—The invasive squamous cell carcinoma involves all four quadrants
of the cervix

-Diffuse CIN III/C15 with gland duct involvement and focal HPV
changes are also present

—Few foci suspicious for lymph0vascular space invasion present
—Focal vaginal extension (upper third, posterior) is present
—The anterior and posterior lower uterine segment show no
evidence of involvement

~No parametrial involvement is identified

-All inked surgical excision margins (paracervical soft tissue
and vaginal margins) are free from involvement

-Associated acute and chronic cervicitis with squamous
metaplasia, nabothian cysts, focal calcific atherosclerosis and
ciliated cell metaplasia are also present

~The endometrium is unremarkable and shows early secretory
changes

-The myometrium shows multiple leiomyomata (4) with evidence of
hyalinization and focal degenerative necrosis (largest leiomyoma
measuring 4.5 cm) and focal adenomyosis

atretic follicles, surface epithelial inclusion cysts, surface
adhesions and focal surface stromal proliferations

8: LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE, BIOPSY:
—No tumor identified in three lymph nodes (0/3)
~Reactive lymph nodes showing sinus histiocytes and focal
intraparenchymal acute inflammation

NOTE: Based on the material examined, this tumor is at least AJCC
stage 181, le1 N0 Mx.

ADDENDUM

Although, accurate estimation of depth of invasion of the carcinoma
is precluded by suboptimal sections. in some sections it appears

to be greater than 50% invasion of the cervical wall. Foci of,
definite and other foci suspicious for lymphovascular space invasion
are present. Dr. ' has reviewed representative sections of
this case.

HISTORY: Ovarian carcinoma

MICROSCOPIC:

See Diagnosis.

GROSS:

l: RIGHT PELVIC NODE

Labeled "right pelvic node" and received in formalin is 4.8 x 4.5 x
2.4 cm aggregate of adipose tissue which contains four firm, tan-pink
lymph nodes ranging from 1.1 up to 2.6 cm in greatest dimension. All
lymph nodes are entirely submitted as labeled.

A. Smaller nodes — 2
B. Mid size lymph node bisected — 2
C. Largest lymph node bisected — 2

2: RIGHT COMMON ILIAC NODE
Labeled "right common iliac node" and received in formalin is a 1.9 x

0.9 x 0.3 cm soft, tan-pink lymph node which is entirely submitted.
D. l
3: UTERUS

Labeled "uterus", received fresh in the Operating Room for gross
consultation and subsequently fixed in formalin is a 420 gram, uterus
with attached cervix. The uterus is 13.1 cm from fundus to
ectocervix, 8.1 cm from cornu to cornu, and 6.1 cm from anterior to
posterior. The serosa is tan—red and dull with focal adhesions. The
cervix is 4.2 cm in length and 4.1 cm in diameter with a 0.3 cm
patent 08. There is a cuff of vaginal mucosa ranging in thickness
from 1.7 cm anteriorly to 3.1 cm posteriorly. The ectocervical
mucosa is tan—pink and smooth. On sectioning, the transformation
zone is distinct and the endocervical canal is 3.0 cm in length.
Along the transformation zone and ectocervix is a 2.0 x 2.0 cm
granular and hemorrhagic area. The paracervical soft tissue and
vaginal margins are inked blue. The endometrial cavity is 7.4 cm in
length and 1.6 cm in width and is lined by smooth, tan—red

endometrium. The endometrium is 0.1 cm in average thickness. The
myometrium measures up to 5.2 cm in thickness and contains four
intramural leiomyomata ranging from 0.5 up to 4.5 cm in greatest
dimension. On sectioning, the largest leiomyomata displays central
areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. Representative sections.

E Smaller leiomyomata — 3

F Largest leiomyoma with central necrosis -2
G Anterior uterine corpus — 1

H. Anterior lower uterine segment — 1

1-0. Entire anterior cervix - 1 each

P. Posterior uterine corpus - 1

Q. Posterior lower uterine segment ~ 1

R-U. Entire posterior cervix — 1 each

4: OBTURATOR

Labeled "obturator" and received in formalin is a 2.1 x 1.7 x 0.3 cm
portion of soft tan-yellow adipose tissue which is entirely
submitted.

V. Multiple

5: RIGHT TUBE OVARY

Labeled "right tube ovary" and received in formalin is a 4.1 cm in
length and 0.5 cm in diameter fimbriated segment of fallopian tube.
The serosa is tan~pink with moderate tube-ovarian adhesions. On
sectioning, cut surface is focally edematous with a 0.2 cm patent
lumen. The fallopian tube is adherent to a 2.6 x 2.1 x 1.9 cm firm,
tan—yellow cerebriform ovary. On sectioning, the cut surface
displays two unilocular cysts which contain a minimal amount of clear
serous fluid. The cystic locules are 0.5 and 1.7 cm in greatest
dimension. The inner cyst linings are smooth without papillary
excrescences. There is a 0.4 cm in greatest dimension firm yellow
nodule on the external surface. Representative sections.

w. Fallopian tube and cysts - 3
x. Larger cyst wall - 3
Y. Ovarian parenchyma with external surface nodule — 1

6: LEFT TUBE OVARY

Labeled "left tube and ovary" and received in formalin is a 3.7 cm in
length and 0.6 cm in diameter fimbriated segment of fallopian tube.
The serosa is tan~pink and smooth. On sectioning, cut surfaces are
focally edematous with a 0.2 cm patent lumen. The fallopian tube is
adherent to a 3.6 x 2.6 x 1.7 cm lobulated and focally cerebriform
ovary with focal hemorrhage. On sectioning, two unilocular clear
fluid—filled cysts are identified which are 0.7 and 1.0 cm in
greatest dimension. No papillary excrescences are identified.

There is also a 2.2 cm in greatest dimension hemorrhagic area.

AA. Larger cyst - 2

BB. Hemorrhagic area - 3

CC. Random ovary - 1

7: LEFT COMMON ILIAC

Labeled "left common iliac" and received in formalin are four firm,
tan-pink lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 up to 1.7 cm in greatest
dimension. All lymph node tissue is entirely submitted as labeled.

8: LEFT PELVIC NODE
Labeled "left pelvic node" and received in formalin is a 3.6 x 2.7 x

1.2 cm aggregate of lobulated adipose tissue which contains three
firm, tan~pink lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 up to 1.7 cm in greatest
dimension. All lymph node tissue is entirely submitted as labeled.

BE. Three lymph nodes (largest node bisected) — 4
Gross dictated by ”
