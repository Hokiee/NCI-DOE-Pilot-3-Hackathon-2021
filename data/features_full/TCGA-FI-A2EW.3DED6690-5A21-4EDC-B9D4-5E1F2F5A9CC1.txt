~ ND EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY
By this signature. I attest that the above diagnosis is

based upon my personal .
examination of the slides(and/or other material indicated in the

diagnosis).

Intraoperative Consultation: . _ _
An intraoperative non—microscopic consultation was obtained and interpreted as:

"Called to pick up 'uterus, cervix, right and left fallo ian tubes with
ovaries,’ conSTStin of a 19.5 x 4.5 x 3 cm uterus with 0th adnexa. Opened to
show a soft polypoi. tumor in mid-fundus. that appears to invade the myometrium.
Tumor and norma tissue sampled for tissue bank and Told to surgeon.

Rest for permanents. 1

Microscopic Description and Comment: .
Microscopic examination substantiates the above Cited diagnosis.

"

Historiu . ' . . .
The patient is a . year old woman with a historg of endometrial carcinoma.
Operative rocedure: EUA. TAH, Bso, pelvic lymp node dissection, omentectomy.

Gross Description V _
The eneri-c-‘ ..- iceived in nine formalin—filled containers each labeled

. The first container is labeled "#1 uterus cervix,
right/left faiiopian tubes and ovaries.“ It consists OT a total abdominal
hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Specimen is already opened
from the intraoperative consultation. The uterus measures 10.5 cm from cervix
to fundus, 4.5 cm from cornu and cornu, and 3 cm from anterior to posterior.
The right ovary measures 4.3 x 1.5 x 1 cm, and the right fallopian tube measures
3 cm in length and a diameter of 0.5 cm. The left ovarg measures 3.5 x 1.3 x
0.8 cm in greatest dimenSion, and the left fallopian tu e measures 3.8 cm in
length wit a diameter of 0.6 cm. The external surface appears smooth with some
adhesions and hemorrhage but no lesion is seen grossly. on opening. the cervix
appears normal Wlth a_rectangular endocerVical canal which measures 2.5 cm
length. The.endometrial caVity is triangular in shape and hemorrhagic; a
polypoid, friable mass is seen but does not appear to invade the myometrium
grossly..measuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The rest of the
endometrial thickness measures 0.2 cm.' The myometrial thickness measures 1.2
A small leiomyoma is seen. measuring 0.5 cm. No other gross lesions are
seen. Labeled A1 - anterior cerVTx; A; - anterior lower uterine segment: A3. A4
- anterior endomyometrium; A5 - posterior cervix; A6 — posterior lower uterine
segment; A7. A8 - sections of the posterior endomyometrium; A9 - section of the
en ometrium: A10 — right ovary.and fallopian tube; A11 - left ovary and
fallopian tube; A12 - parametrial soft tissue from both sides. Jar 2.
The second container is_labeled "left external iliac lymph node." It consists
of multiple irregular pieces of tan to off—white tissue, with some firm areas

which are putative lymph nodes. Submitted in total. Labeled 81 — two lymph
nodes; 32 - two.lymp. nodes' 83. 84 - one lymph node. Jar 0.

The third container is labeled "left parametrium." It consists of irregular
pieces of soft tissue with areas of hemorrhage. measuring 2.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm in
greatest dimension and submitted in total in cassette c1. Jar 0.
The fourth container is labeled "left obturator lymph node." It consists of
multiple putative l h nodes. It measures 1.5 x 1 x 1 cm in aggregate and
submitted in total n cassette 01 to 03. Jar O.

The fifth.container is labeled_"right external lymph nodes." It consists of
multiple irregular pieces of fibroadi ose tissue. There are multiple putative
lymph nodes i entified. It measures .5 x 2 x 1.5 cm in aggregate. submitted

in total in cassette £1 to £3. Jar 0.
The sixth container is labeled "right Obturator lymph node." It consists of one

piece of irregular‘tissue which a pears firm in consistency. measuring 2.5 x 2 x
1 cm in greatest dimenSion. Biva ved. 5me1tted in total. Labeled F1. F2.

The seventh container is labeled "right periaortic lymph node." It consists of

an irregular piece of tan to off—white fibroadipose tissue. measuring 1.5 x 1 x
1 cm in aggregate. submitted in total. Labeled GI. Jar 0.

The eight container is labeled "omentum." It consists‘of an omentectomy
specimen measuring 21.x 6.5 x 1.5 cm in reatest dimenSion. It consists of
fibroadipose tissue wwth areas of hemorr age. No nodules or gross lesions are
identified. Labeled.H1 to H5. Jar 2. ‘

The ninth container is labeled “left periaortic lymph node." It consists of
multiple irregular pieces of tan to off-white firm tissue which appears to be
lymph node. It measures 1.5 x 1 x 1 cm in aggregate. submitted in total.
