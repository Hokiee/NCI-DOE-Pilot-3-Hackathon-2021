CLINICAL HISTORY:
PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left liver lobe tumor
INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULT:

B. Liver, left lobe, lobectomy: Approximately 0.2 cm from the closest parenchymal margin
{marked by long suture).

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
GALLBLADDER

Received in formalin Is a gallbladder measuring 7.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm. The serosal surface is
smooth, glistening and grossly unremarkable. The posterior surface of the gallbladder is slightly
granular and trabeculated but othenlvise unremarkable. On opening the gallbladder it contains
a moderate amount of pink black bile with no stones. The mucosa is velvety, green to yellow,
the average wall thickness is 0.3 cm. No ulceration, mass or any other gross lesion is identiﬁed
in the gallbladder. Representative sections are submitted in 1 cassette.

LEFT LOBE 0F LIVER

Received fresh for tissue procurement and labeled ”left lobe of liver” is a lobectomy of the liver
weighing 1125 gm and measuring 20 x 18 x 9 cm. The serosal surface is smooth and tan with
multiple bulging sub-serosal nodules. Dissections reveal multiple satellite tumor masses
ranging from 1.0 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm’to 13.0 x 12.8 x 8.5 cm. The largest mass shows confluence of
the small fused mass with extension to the capsule but not through. Sections reveal gray,
yellow and friable appearance, focally necrotic and hemorrhagic. There are two stitches
attached to the parenchyma indicating the resection margin. One inked yellow and the other
black. The major large tumor mass is 0.2 cm from the parenchymal margin, and the 2nd largest
tumor mass to the inked black margin is 1.0 cm. The uninvolved parenchyma shows prominent
dilated vessel and occult nodularity. Representative sections are submitted in 10 cassettes.

Cassette 1—3: the largest mass

Cassette 4-5: the 2nd largest mass

Cassette 6: the satellite mass

Cassette 7-8: random section including the yellow inked margin
Cassette 9: nodularity area of the uninvolved parenchyma

Cassette 10: prominent dilated vessel area

RIGHT LOBE LIVER NODULE

Received fresh and labeled ”right lobe liver nodule segment 4” is a segment of liver measuring
3.5 x 2.8 x 3.0 cm. There are 3 stitches attached to specimen indicating superior-single short,
medial-double short, lateral—double long. The specimen is inked as follows: superior-red,
inferior-orange, lateral—yellow, medial-green and posterior-black. Serial sections reveal a well
circumscribed tan gray soft tumor mass located underneath the capsule with less than 1 cm
from it, measuring 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm. On sectioning, it reveals a granular appearance. The rest
of the tissue is unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted in 6 cassettes.

Cassette 1-3: mass entirely submitted

Cassette 4-6: the random section

NEW MARGIN OF SEGMENT VI LIVER

Received fresh and labeled ”new margin of segment VI lesion" is a irregular cauterized fragment
of soft tissue measuring 6.0 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm. There are 3 stitches attached at one aspect of the
specimen, which is inked in blue. Serial sections are unremarkable. Representative sections are
submitted in 3 cassettes.

LEFT LOBE CLOSE PARENCHYMA MARGIN

Received in formalin are 2 irregular shaped brown to tan soft tissue measuring 2.4 x 1.8 x 0.5 cm
and 3.6 x 0.9 x 0.2 cm. One of them is marked with a suture. Both portions are friable. The
fragment marked with suture is falling apart after the suture is removed. These fragments are in
cassette E1 after inked in black. The larger fragment is also inked in black and serial sectioned to
reveal homogeneous tan to brown cut surface. Submitted in total in 3 cassettes.

DIAGNOSIS:

- 1.5 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION
- 1.2 X 1.0 CM ADDITIONAL DIMENSION

- INVOLVING THE MEDIAL AND INFERIOR MARGINS OF RESECTION (GREEN AND ORANGE INKS,
SLIDE C1), SEE COMMENT.

- ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IS PRESENT

- THE NON-NEOPLASTIC LIVER SHOWS FIBROUS EXPANSION OF PORTAL TRIADS.

D. LIVER RIGHT LOBE SEGMENT VI NEW MARGIN, EXCISION:

- NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED, SEE COMMENT

E. LIVER, LEFT LOBE NEW PARENCHYMAL MARGIN, EXCISION:

- NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED

COMMENT: The final parenchymal margin for the right lobe liver nodule (parts C and D) is
negative for tumor (see part D).
