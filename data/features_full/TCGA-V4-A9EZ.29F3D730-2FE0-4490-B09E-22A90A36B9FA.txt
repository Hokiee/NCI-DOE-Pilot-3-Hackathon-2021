Microscopy

The eyeball presents a tumor with the histological features of an uveal melanoma
composed mainly of fusiform cells (70%) with a few epithelioid cells (30%). The
mitotic activity is very low.

The tumor is located at distance of the optic nerve which is free on its entire course.
The cut end of the optic nerve and the meningeal sheaths are also free. There is a

focal inﬁltration of the 1/3 inner part of the sclera, without extra-sclera! extension. The
ciliary body is free of tumor.

Conclusion:

Uveal melanoma mainly composed of fusiform cells with rare epithelioid cells.
Tumor size: 15 mm.

Focal inﬁltration of the inner third of the sclera without extra-scleral extension.

Ciliary body, optic nerve on its entire course and its cut end and meningeal sheaths
free of tumor.
