CLINICAL INFORMATION
Left testicular mass

SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPTION

A) SOURCE: Testicle. left

Received fresh labeled "left testicle" is a 6 x 5 x 2.5 cm testis and

attached 11 cm in length and 1.8 cm in diameter spermatic cord. The tunical
vaginaiis is intact and inked blue. The testis is bisected revealing a 4.6

x 3.8 x 3 cm testis with a solid white. well circumscribed tumor mass,
measuring 3 x 3 x 2.6 cm in the center of the specimen. There is a focus of
normal-appearing testicle in which the seminiferous tubules separate

easily. The proximal resection margin of the spermatic cord is submitted on
chuck #1 and ajmpresentative portion of the turner on chuck #2.

INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULT FROZEN SECTION: "Seminoma,
benign spermatic cord margin" is rendered by

The tumor mass tethers focally to the tunica albuginea but does not extend
through it. No secondary masses are noted. The epididymis is present,
measures 7 x 1 x 1 cm and is notable for a possible cystic space, 0.5 cm.
Note that tissue is taken for possible ancillary studies.

Representative sections are submitted in 13 cassettes labeled:
1. Frozen section, spermatic cord

2. Frozen section, tumor

3. Mid spen'natic cord

4-7. Representative tumor and overlying vaginalis
8. Tumor, normal testis and albuginea

9. Tumor and normal parenchyma

10. Epididymis

11. Epididymis. cystic space, and vaginalis

12. Vaginalis overlying the tumor, no tumor

13. Base of spermatic cord

MICROSCOPIC

Tumor is conﬁned to the testis, but metaplastic adipose tissue is noted.
Technical (tumor cell transfer) artifact of tumor is noted in the specimen
slides.
