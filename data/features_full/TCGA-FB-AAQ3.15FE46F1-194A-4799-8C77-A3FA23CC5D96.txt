Gross Description: Received is 1 specimen with pancreatic and duodenal tissue

with several sutures present. The duodenum measures 19 cm in length x 3.2

cm in diameter. The serosal surface is smooth, glistening, tan-pink with

cautery artifact. The duodenum is opened longitudinally to reveal

tan—brown mucosa with an ampulla that is 5 cm from the proximal margin, and

is surrounded by a 1.7 x 1 cm red—tan ulcerative lesion.

The pancreas measures 7.5 x 6 x 4.5 cm, and the neck margin is removed en

face and submitted for frozen section diagnosis. The pancreas is sectioned to reveal that the major
pancreatic duct

is obstructed approximately 1.5 cm from the neck margin. There is an
ill-defined, indurated, white—yellow lesion that is 2 x 2.5 x 2.3 cm. The

mass possibly invades the common bile duct, which is friable and

hemorrhagic, and dilated to 1.2 cm in diameter. The common bile duct is

patent through the ampulla. The mass is 1 cm to the neck margin, 0.8 cm to
