 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

PART 1: LEFT AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH MODE #1, BIOPSY —
TWO LYMPH NODES, NEGATIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (0/2) (see comment).

 

PART 2:

BﬁEASILLELTtﬁEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY —
A. WM NOTTINGHAM GRADE 2 (TUBULE FORMATION 3, NUCLEAR GRADE 2.
OTIC RATE 1; OTAL S SIS).
B. INVASIVE CARCINOMA MEASURES 2.2 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION.
C DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN-SITU (DCIS), NUCLEAR GRADE 2. SOLID TYPE WITH COMEDONECROSIS.
D. DCIS IS PRESENT ADMIXED WITH INVASIVE COMPONENT AND COMPRISES <5% OF TOTAL TUMOR
VOLUME.
E. MARGINS OF RESECTION ARE NEGATIVE FOR INVASIVE CARCINOMA AND DCIS, INVASIVE CARCINOMA
IS 5 MM FROM CLOSEST (POSTERIOR) MARGIN OF RESECTION.
F. LYMPHOVASCULAR SPACE INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.
G. SKIN, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
