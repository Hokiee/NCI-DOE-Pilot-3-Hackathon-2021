Gross Description:

1). The Specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation and is iabeled "Left renai mass". It consists of a 5 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm
wedge shaped portion of kidney with a suture marking the deep margin. The margin is inked bios and the specimen is serially
sectioned to reveal a fairly circumscribed, hemorrhagic to yellow and focally calciﬁed tumor measuring 3 x 2.2 x 2 cm. The
clearance from the resection margin is 0.2 cm. A representative section of the nearest margin is submitted for frozen section
diagnosis. Representatively submitted. Portions of the tumor are submitted for TPS. The specimen is photographed

Summary of sections:

FSC - frozen section control
T - tumor

M - margin

L — representatiVe sections

2). The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation. labeled "Lett renal margin" and consists of a fragment of pink
tan soft tissue measuring 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. Entirely submitted for frozen section.

Summary of sections:
FSC -- frozen section control

3). The specimen is received fresh , labeied "Portion of left eleven Rib" and consists of a segment of rib measuring 7.5 x 1.2 x 0.6
cm. Red. tan soft tissue is attached. The specimen is bisected to reveal a homogenous red tan granular and bony cut surface.
The cortical surface appears intact. and no discrete lesions are noted. Representative sections are submitted for decalcitioation.

Summary of Sections:
U — undesignated

4). The specimen is received fresh. labeled "Perinephric fat" and consists of several irregularly shaped pieces of yellow tan
iotgulateddadlpose tissue measuring 18 x 12 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. No abnormalities are noted. Representative section are
so mitte .

Summary of sections:
U -- undesignated

5).The specimen is received in formalin labeled. “fat over tumor left the kidney". and consists of multiple pieces of adipose tissue
measuring 6 x 6 x 2 cm in aggregate. Representative sections are submitted.

Summary of sections:
U—~ undesignated

6).The specimen is received in formalin labeled. "left hilar lymph node". and consists of 2 pieces of fatty lymphoid tissue measuring
2.0 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm and 1.5 about 1.0 X 0.4 cm respectively. The specimen is entirely submitted.
