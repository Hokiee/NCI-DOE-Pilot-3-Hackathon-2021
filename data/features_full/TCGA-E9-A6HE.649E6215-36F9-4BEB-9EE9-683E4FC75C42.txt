Gross Description: A. "Right axilla palpable node." A 2.2 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm portion of lymph node bearing
fat contains a 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm hard white nodule. Imprints are prepared, and a portion is selected for
frozen section examination. B. "Right breast stitch marks axillary tail." A he 14.9 x 13.5 x 4.0 cm right
breast with an overlying 8.0 x 4.0 cm keyhole-shaped skin. The areolar complex is unremarkable. There
is a 0.3 cm skin lesion (grossly consistent with seborrheic keratosis), 0.5 cm and located 0.6 cm medial to
the nipple. There is a stellate mass within the central breast 5.7 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm, located 2.0 cm from the
deep margin and occupies the upper and lower outer quadrants as well as the upper inner and outer
quadrants. There is a biopsy marker recognize in the lower outer quadrant (8 o'clock aspect),3.7 cm
from the deep margin. A second biopsy marker is recognized and approximately 1 o'clock, 3.5 cm from
the deep margin. Superior to the main mass is a satellite nodule attached by fibrous strands, 0.7 x 0.5 x
0.5 cm, located 2.0 cm from the deep margin and 1.8 cm superior to the main mass at approximately 12
o'clock. The remaining breast tissue is centrally dense. There are no intramammary lymph nodes. The
margin is a blue. C. "Level 1 and 2 right axillary lymph nodes." A 7.0 x 5.0 x 2.0 cm aggregate of adipose
tissue fragments containing 11 lymph nodes up to 1.5 cm. The lymph nodes all appear involved by
tumor with the largest metastasis measuring 1.4 cm. Extracapsular extension is noted.

in situ component: Lobular carcinoma in situ
Calcifications: Absent
Non-neoplastic breast: Atrophic with intramammary metastases

Estrogen (ER) and Progesterone (PR) Receptors (IMPX): ER strongly positive, PR strongly positive on
previous biopsyHer-Z/Neu (H2N)

Amplification: Negative on previous biopsy
Nipple involvement: Present

Skin involvement: No

Skeletal muscle: Not present

Lymph nodes: Axillary (specimens A and C): 12 metastases (12 nodes examined) The largest metastasis
is 14 mm; there is extensive extracapsular extension.

PTNM Stage: pT3 N3

Diagnosis Details: Subcutis (right axilla): Metastatic invasive lobular carcinoma (presumable an effaced
lymph node) Breast (right): Invasive lobular carcinoma, pleomorphic type with intramammary and
axillary metastases

Comments: Multiple axillary lymph nodes exhibit effacement by invasive lobular carcinoma, with
extensive involvement of extranodal adipose tissue. Invasive lobular carcinoma extends to the
cauterized margin of axilla specimen
