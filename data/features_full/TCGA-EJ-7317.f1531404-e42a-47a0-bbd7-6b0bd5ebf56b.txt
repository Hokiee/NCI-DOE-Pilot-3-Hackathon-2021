Collection Date:

  

PROSTATE ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 3 + 4 = 7. I
THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT LOBES AND HAS A GREATEST NODULAR DIAMETER OF I
1.3 CM IN ONE HISTOL'OGIC SECTION.

THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES 15% OF THE EXAMINED PROSTATE VOLUME.

THE CARCINOMA IS ORGAN CONFINED AND SHOWS N0 EVIDENCE OF EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION.

BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA.

ALL EXAMINED SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA.
