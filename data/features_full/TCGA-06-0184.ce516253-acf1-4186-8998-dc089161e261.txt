L HISTORY
with headaches for 3 weeks; on imaging, large right
frontal mass, partially enhancing and focally necrotic.

OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
Craniotomy for brain lesion.

Operation/Specimen: Brain, resection

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:
Brain, right frontal, excision: Glioblastoma.

See comment.

COMMENT ‘
The specimen is portions of cerebrum extensively infiltrated and effaced by an

astrocytic neoplastic proliferation with frequent mitotic figures,
microvascular cellular proliferation, and extensive zones of necrosis, some
with pseudopalisading. There are also zones of hemorrhage with early

organization.

Special stains to better characterize the tumor are being requested, and will
be reported as an addendum};E 3 : .gam Rag. p

MIBl PROLIFERATION INDEX: 6%.

Results—Comments
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates focal glial fibrillogenesis by

the neoplastic cells. About 25% of the neoplastic nuclei over express the p53
protein. With the M181, a proliferation index of about 6% is determined in
the more active areas.

The results support the diagnosis of glioblastoma.
