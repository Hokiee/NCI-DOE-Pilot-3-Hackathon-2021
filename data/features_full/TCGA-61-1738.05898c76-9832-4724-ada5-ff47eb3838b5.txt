COMMENT:

The entire left ovary was submitted for microscopic examination. Recuts were made from the original section of the left
ovary IOOkll‘lQ for tumor metastasis. A small fragment of tumor is present detached from the ovarian surface Therefore I
consider that fragment to be a contaminant. WT 1 immunostains were performed on the tumor present in the endometrial
polyp as well as In tumor present in the wall of the intestine and the omentum. Their results are controversial and
therefore, they are not contributory to determine if the tumor in the abdomen and right ovary are metastatic from the

endometrial tumor or vise versa, or they are two synchronous inde endent rima tu ‘
are very similar p p ry more. Morphologrcaily, the tumors
