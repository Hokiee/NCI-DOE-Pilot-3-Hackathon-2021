COMMENT

The malignant mixed Mullerian tumor is composed of 60% carcinomatous elements (endometrioid adenocarcinoma, FIGO grade
3, and uterine papillary serous carcinoma) and 40% sarcomatous elements (chondrosarcoma and unclassiﬁed sarcoma). The
myoinvasive tumor and tumor involving the cervix is composed entirely of carcinoma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) UTERUS. CERVIX, PARAMETRIUM, BOTH TUBES, BOTH OVARIES - A uterus (15.0 x 9.0 x 6.5 cm) with cervix (5.0 x 5.0
3.0 cm), unremarkable vaginal cuff (2.0 cm in length), bilateral parametrial tissue (4.5 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm, right; 6.0 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm. lel
bilateral fallopian tubes (8.0 x 2.5 cm, right; 8.5 x 0.5 cm. left ), and bilateral, unremarkable ovaries (3.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm, right; 2.0
1.2 x 0.7 cm, left).

The endometrial cavity has a tan—yellow, partially necrotic and hemorrhagic polypoid mass (9.0 x 7.5 x 4.5 cm) attached
the anterior endometrium and fundus. There is no myometrlal invasion grossly, and the myometrium ranges from 1.6 to 2.0 cm
thick in the area underlying the tumor. The anterior cervix has a tan-white mass (50 x 3.0 x 1.2 cm) involving the ectocervix anc
endocervical canal. with possible extension into the lower uterine segment. Grossly, there is nearly full thickness cervical strom:
invasion. The parametrial tissue is grossly uninvolved.

 

    

The posterior lower uterine segment has a cystic polyp (0.9 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm). The myometrium has two, white,
wail-circumscribed nodules (0.6 cm each). The bilateral fallopian tubes have multiple paratubal cysts.

Representative portions of endometrial mass and myometrium are submitted to tumor bank.

INK CODE: Black - soft tissue surface around the cervix.

SECTION CODE: A1-A10, entire right parametrium, (A1, A2, en face margin); A11-A25, entire left parametrium (A11,
A12, en face margin); A26, en face vaginal cuff margin, 12 to 3 o'clock; A27, en face vaginal cuff margin, 3 to 6 o'clock; A28, en
face vaginal cuff margin, 6 to 9 o'clock; A29, en face vaginal cuff margin, 9 to 12 o'clock; A30—A33, representative endometrial
mass with full thickness myometrium; A34-A43, representative endometrial mass; A44, A45, myometrlal nodules; A46-A49,
anterior cervix with tumor (A46 and A47. one section divided; A48 and A49, one section divided); A50, additional anterior cervical
tumor; A51-A54, anterior endocervix to lower uterine segment, consecutive sections from inferior to superior; A55, A56, posterior
cervix, one section divided; A57-A60, posterior lower uterine segment with polyp entirely submitted); A61, representative posterior
endomyometrium; A62, representative rioht fallopian tube; A63, representative right ovary; A64, representative left fallopian tube;
A65, representative left ovary.
(B) PORTION OF RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE — Two tan tissue fragments (4.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm; 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm) with
metastatic tumor in the larger fragment.

SECTION CODE: 81-63, representative large fragment; B4, small fragment.
(C) RIGHT PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODE - A yellow tissue fragment (2.0 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm) with one lymph node (0.9 x 0.6 x 0.4
cm) entirely submitted in C.
(D) HIGH RIGHT PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODE - Two tan tissue fragments (2.2 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm in aggregate) with the larger
grossly involved by metastatic tumor.

SECTION CODE: D1 and DZ, representative large fragment; DS, small fragment entirely submitted.
(E) LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE - One lymph node (1.2 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm) entirely submitted in E.

CLINICAL HISTORY

Endometrial cancer.
