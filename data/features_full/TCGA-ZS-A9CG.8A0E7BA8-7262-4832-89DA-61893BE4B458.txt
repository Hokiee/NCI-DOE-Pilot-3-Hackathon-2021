Comments and block codes

Received is a portion of liver measuring 200x180x up to 110mm.
Slicing reveals a tumour closely abutting the serosal surface that
measures approximately 85x70x60mm. The serosal surface is puckered
but there is no evidence of macroscpic invasion through the liver
capsule. The cut surface of the tumour is cream with a green tinge
and appears to have a fibrous capsule. The capsule is puckered but
there is no evidence of macroscopic invasion through the liver
capsule. Throughout the rest of the liver there are multiple
distended vessels within portal tracts that appear to be filled
with cream—coloured tissue similar to that of the tumour. The
tumour lies 12mm away from the resection margin which is inked
blue. The background liver does not appear obviously cirrhotic.
Within the background liver a single other cream coloured nodule
is noted that does not seem to be associated with a portal area
that measures 4mm in maximum dimension.

Blocks taken: lA—lH representative sections through the tumour;

11 section of other nodule noted; lJ—lL representative sections

through the dilated vessels in the background liver; 1M normal
background liver.

2. A gallbladder containing bile with no obvious focal lesions
identified.

Comments

A single tumour is surrounded by a fibrous capsule and consists of
sheets of hepatocytes with loss of the normal liver architecture.
There is evidence of cytological atypia and nuclear pleomorphism.
In some areas of the tumour there is formation of variably sized
gland like structures. Outwith the tumour multiple foci of
lymphovascular invasion are identified. There is no significant
bile production by the tumour. The features are those of a
hepatocellular carcinoma.

Within the surrounding normal liver there is evidence of chronic
inflammation and regenerative liver nodules. Within the portal
areas through the rest of the liver there is evidence of portal
vein distention. The portal vein branches are completely full of a
foreign body giant cell reaction to embolic material.

There is no evidence of fibrosis within the background liver.
There is some mild steatosis and mild chronic inflammation within
the portal areas. A Perl's stain for iron does reveal scattered
iron deposition within hepatocytes. There is no evidence of any
obvious underlying pathology to suggest the aetiology of this
hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the presence of iron within
hepatocytes does raise the possibility of a iron storage disorder
and clinical correlation is advised.

Pathological staging: pT2, pNx, pr
2. Sections show a heavily autolysed gallbladder but with no

evidence of malignancy.
