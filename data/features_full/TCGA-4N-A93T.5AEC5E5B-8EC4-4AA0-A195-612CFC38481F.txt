SYNOPTlC REPORT

Tumor site: Proximal ascending colon (larger mass) and distal ascending (smaller mass)
Tumor size: 4.2 cm and 4.0cm
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma
Histologic grade: Low grade (moderately differentiated. (32)
Extent of invasion: Proximal ascending tumor invades serosal surface ; the more distal tumor invades
through muscularis propria into pericolonic tissue
Tumor perforation: Not identiﬁed
Margins: Uninvolved by invasive carcinoma (R0)
Proximal margin: 24.5 cm (proximal tumor); 29cm (distal tumor)
Distal margin: 9 cm (proximal tumor); 4.5cm (distal tumor)
Circumferential radial margin: 3 cm (proximal and distal tumor)
Closest margin: Circumferential radial margin
Lymphovascular invasion: Absent
Perineural invasion: Absent
Treatment effect: No known prior treatment
Regional lymph nodes: Two of twenty—ﬁve lymph nodes are positive for metastatic carcinoma (2/25)
Pathologic Tumor Stage: pT4a (m) pN1b

lmmunohistochemlcal stains for MLH-1, MSH-z, MSH-6 and PMS-2 reveal distinct nuclear staining for all markers. These
ﬁndings indicate an intact mismatch repair (MM R) gene function without evidence of signiﬁcant microsatellite instability (MSl).
Although these ﬁndings make the diagnosis of hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) or Lynch Syndrome very unlikely
this patient. approximately 5% of colorectai carcinomas with defective MMR genes and high MSl may show this apparent normal
pattern of staining. Correlation with the clinical ﬁndings & family history is encouraged.

SPECIMEMS) SUBMlTTED: GROSS DESCRIPTION

Right colon: in formalin labeled "right colon" is a 25 cm in length segment of cecum and right colon with an attached 20 cm of
terminal ileum and a 6 cm attached appendix. Within the right colon there is a 4.2 x 4 cm endophytlc tumor with raised rolled
borders. This tumor is 9 cm from the distal margin and 24.5 cm from the proximal margin. The tumor invades into and through
the bowel wall into the pericolonic fat and is grossly 3 cm from the circumferential soft tissue margin. The tumor also appears to
near the serosa/pentonealized surface of the attached fat. There is an additional 4 x 3 cm polypoid mass 4.5 cm from the distal
margin and 29 cm from the proximal margin. The mucosa and wall adjacent to this mass is ragged, disrupted and hemorrhagic
with hemorrhage and necrosis in the surrounding periooloic soft tissues. No gross invasion beyond the wall is noted and this
mass is 6 cm from the circumferential soft tissue margin. Within the cecum there is an additional 4.5 x 2.7 x 1 .8 cm exophytic
polypoid mass. This mass is 17 cm from the distal margin and 22cm from the proximal margin. Again, no invasion through the
wall is noted and the mass is 9 cm from the circumferential soft tissue margin. The remaining colonic mucosa is tan-pink with
several additional smaller, up to 0.6 cm, mucosal polyps and focal areas of congestion. The ileal mucosa is tan-pink with a few
polypoid projections and a 2.3 x 1.3 cm ﬂat granular area 6 cm from the proximal margin and 27 cm from the distal margin. No
invasion into the mesenteric fat is noted and the lesion is 3.5 cm from the mesenteric resection margin. The cut surfaces of the
appendix display a lumen lined by congested mucosa. Multiple lymph nodes are identiﬁed in the attached fat. Representative
sections are submitted as labeled: A-C tumor in ascending colon to pericolonic fat and serosal/peritonealized surface; D-E distal
ascending colon polypoid mass with adjacent ragged hemorrhagic disrupted area; F—G cecal polypoid mass; H smaller colonic
mucosai polyps; l flat and granular irregular area in small bowel; J small bowel mucosa with small polypoid projections; K distal
margin and en face circumferential soft tissue margin; L proximal margin and appendix; M six lymph nodes; N six lymph nodes;
0 six lymph nodes; P six lymph nodes.
