2. SMALL INTESTINE; RESECTION
- SEGMENT OF SMALL INTESTINE WITH NO PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

Gross Description:

1). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right colon" and consists of a
segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix and ascending colon.
The terminal ileum measures 8.5 cm in length and 4.5 cm in circumference at
the proximal resected margin. The remaining colon measures 29.0 in length
with a circumference of 7.0 cm at the distal resected margin. The attached
appendix measures 4.0 cm in length and averages 0.5 cm in diameter. The
appendiceal and intestinal serosa is pink tan and smooth. Focally
hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose tissue spans the length of the
specimen measuring up to 4.5 cm in thickness. The specimen is opened to
reveal a mass lesion measuring 3.7 cm in length and 4.0 cm in width. The
mass is located in the large bowel 0.3 cm from the ileocecal valve, 11.0 cm
from the proximal margin and 24 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning shows
that the tumor grossly invades through the muscularis and serosa. The depth
of invasion is 0.3 cm grossly. The remaining mucosa is tan-brown with the
normal folds. There are multiple minute polypoid lesions on the terminal
ileum mucosa. The attached adipose tissue is thoroughly examined and all
identified lymph nodes are submitted. Representative sections of the
specimen are submitted for permanent sections and for TPS.

Summary of sections:

P - proximal margin shave

D - distal margin shave

T - tumor

A - appendix representative sections
RP-- polypoid lesion from terminal ileum
RS -representative sections

PD--possible diverticulum

LN - lymph nodes
BLN - bisected lymph nodes

2. The specimen is received fresh labeled "small bowel". It consists of an
unoriented segment of small bowel measuring 21.5 cm in length and 3.6 cm in
circumference. The serosal and mucosal surface is grossly unremarkable.
Representative sections are submitted.

Summary of sections:

SM1 - one margin

SM2 - the other margin

RS - representative sections
