1 Submitted for frozen section
2 Remainder of tissue

G. Received in formalin and labeled “axillary fat (perm)' consists of yellow brown soft tissue measuring 4 x 2 x 3 cm in
aggregate. The entire specimen is submitted in toto in eight cassettes.

H. Received in formalin and labeled 'skin right breast” consists of skin tag measuring 5 x 0.5 x 0.1 cm. A representative
section of the skin tag is submitted in one cassette.

 

l. Received in formalin and labeled “right breast lumpectomy (short stitch superior, long lateral ) fresh” consists of breast
tissue mass measuring 186 grams and measures 9.5 cm medial to lateral. 5.5 cm inferior superior and 8 cm nterlor to
posterior. it is round to oval in shape. it is yellow in color and soft in consistency. The specimen has sutur for
orientation. The specimen is inked as follows: anterior yellow; superior blue: posterior black; interior green: | total orange
and medial red. Serial sectioning of the specimen reveals a well deﬁned round to oval mass measuring 3 x x 3.5 cm. it
is hard in consistency. it occupies 20% of the entire specimen. The nearest margin is at the superior margi which is 1.5
cm from the mass. Remaining margins are away from the mass. There is an area of fibrosis which is situat anterior to
the mass: it is 1 cm away from the mass. The area of ﬁbrosis measures 1 x 1 cm. The breast parenchyma i between

the mass and the fibrosis is normal. The remaining breast parenchyma consists of the fat to stroma ratio 90: 10. The
cassettes are submitted as follows:

Superior margin
