The specimen is received in nine parts. Each part is received labeled with the patient's

name .

A. Received in formalin labeled ”left uterosacral ligament" is a 0.9 x 0,5 x 0.4 cm
yellow—tan fibroconnective tissue biopsy. The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted

in cassette A1.

B. Received in formalin labeled ”left round ligament“ is a 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm nodular

fibroconnective tissue biopsy. The specimen is trisected and entirely submitted in
cassette Bl.

C. Received fresh for tissue banking is a 50 gram. 5.0 x 4.8 x 3.6 cm uterine corpus which
has a separately received. disrupted 11 gram. 2.8 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm cervix. The cervix has an
eccentric 0.4 cm os. The uterus is received with the attached bilateral fallopian tubes
and ovaries and weighed with the tubes and ovaries removed. The cervix cannot be oriented
anterior to posterior, and the ectocervical rim will be inked blue with the deeper tissues
inked black. The uterine serosa has focal hemorrhagic adhesions and subserosal nodularity.
The uterus is bivalved to have a diffusely ragged. friable endometrium. The friable,
ragged endometrium appears to fill the entire cavity and is cauterized near the roughened
removed area of the previously amputated cervix. The ragged tumor—like area is 4.5 x 4.0
cm. Sectioning the myometrium shows a 1.8 cm possibly posterior. calcified leiomyoma
within the myometrium. The myometrium ranges up to 2.2 cm in this region. and there
appears to be possible invasive.tumor extending 1.6 cm. The tumor is sampled for tissue
banking at The tumor grossly appears to involve more than 50% of the
myometrium posteriorly. and the myometrium is disrupted and hemorrhagic on the anterior
surface. The anterior myometrium averages 0.8 cm in thickness. The tumor appears to
extend with 0.2 cm between the tumor and inked serosa. The tumor diffusely extends more
than 50% of the myometrium both anterior and posterior. The right fallopian tube is
disrupted and is 1.7 X 0.4 cm. The fimbria cannot be clearly identified. The right

ovary is 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm. The ovary is sectioned to have a dense fibrous stroma with
multiple corpora albicantia. The left fallopian tube is a 1.5 cm ill~defined hemorrhagic
segment of fallopian tube which is adhesed to a 2.5 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm ovary. The ovary is
sectioned to have a dense fibrous stroma with multiple corpora albicantia. Representative
sections are sampled as labeled:

C1—C3 — representative sections of cervix to include full cross section to
amputation site
C4 — one full thickness cross section of posterior lower uterine segment.

endometrium to serosa and a section of posterior fundic serosa with
subserosa nodules

C5—C7 — additional posterior full thickness cross section of endometrial tumor
to inked serosa

C8—C11 ~ anterior full thickness cross sections of endometrium. myometrium and
inked serosa with tumor

C12—C13 - right ovary and possible tube sampled

C14-C15 — left ovary and possible tube sampled

C16.17 - additional sections of possible fallopian tubes

D. Received in formalin labeled "posterior cul-de—sac" are two hemorrhagic fibroconnective
tissue biopsies. The biopsies are 0.6 and 1.4 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. The larger biopsy is
bisected. and the tissues are entirely submitted in cassette D1.

E. Received in formalin labeled "pericolic gutter" is a 1.4 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm nodular
fibroconnective tissue biopsy. The biopsy is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette
81.

F. Labeled "bladder peritoneum" is a linear. fibromembranous 1.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm

fibroconnective tissue biopsy. submitted in toto in cassette F1.

G. Labeled “left sidewall" is a 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm cauterized fibroconnective tissue
biopsy. The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette 61.

H. Labeled "right sidewall" is a friable 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm tan—white tissue biopsy. The
specimen is trisected. and there are additional fragments within the specimen container.
The specimen container contents are filtered, and the tissues are entirely submitted in
cassette H1.

I. Labeled "left IP ligament“ are two nodular yellow—tan to focally hemorrhagic tissue
biopsies. The biopsies average 0.5 cm. The tissues are submitted in toto in cassette Il.
