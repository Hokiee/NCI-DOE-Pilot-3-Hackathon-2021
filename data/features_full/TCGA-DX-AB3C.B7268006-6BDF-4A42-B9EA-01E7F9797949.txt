7). The specimen is received labeled "right popliteal mass" and is
comprised of a portion of soft tissue measuring 9.5 x 9.5 x 7 cm and is
oriented by four sutures: black stitch inferior, blue stitch posterior,
white stitch biopsy defect, green stitch lateral. The external surface is
covered by numerous staples and is comprised of muscle. tendinous tissue,
fat, smooth glistening tissue, and cauterized irregular tissue. The margins
of resection are inked as follows inferior black, posterior blue, lateral
green, anterior yellow, superior red, and medial orange. The specimen is
serially sectioned revealing a 7.1 x 6.9 x 5.3 cm well-circumscribed mass
with a variegated and friable cut surface, including areas of tan—pink
hemogenous tissue. necrosis (20%) and cystic degeneration. Lateral wall of
the specimen is entirely occupied by a 4.5 cm diameter cyst showing a
red-tan irregular and necrotic lining. Portion of tissue submitted for TPS.
The specimen is photographed. Representative sections are submitted.
