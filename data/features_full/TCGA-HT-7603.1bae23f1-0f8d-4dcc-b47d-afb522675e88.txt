Microscopic Description:

Sections demonstrate a mildly to moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm, the cells of
which resemble mildly atypical oligodendrocytes. No mitotic figures are seen. There is
no microvascular proliferation or necrosis. The tumor infiltrates both gray and white
matter diffusely.

Addendum Discusion:

MIB-l cells are present in vague clusters throughout the tumor. In the most proliferative
areas, a labeling index of 2.3% is calculated, indicative of a modestly proliferative tumor.

Addendum Diagnosis:

Low Grade Oligodendroglioma, Who Grade II
MIB-l Labeling Index: 2.3%
