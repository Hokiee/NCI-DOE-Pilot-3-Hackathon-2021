CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a year old maIe with history of right
frontotemporai mass, who is presenting for a right Stealth craniotomy for
tumor.
DIAGNOSIS:
A. Brain tumor, right frontotemporai mass, craniotomy:
AnapIastic astrocytoma (WHO Grade III)
B. Brain tumor, right frontotemporai mass, craniotomy:
AnapIastic astrocytoma (WHO Grade III)
C. Infiltrated cortex, right frontotemporai mass, craniotomy:
AnapIastic astrocytoma (WHO Grade III)
D. Brain tumor, right frontotemporai mass, craniotomy:
AnapIastic astrocytoma (WHO Grade III) (see comment)
COMMENT: Highly infiltrating glioma is present in 3“ of the above

specimens. AIthough much of the tumor appears to show Iow grade histology

mitotic ﬁgures are present both in routine H&E stains and by
immunohistochemistry study for PHH3. In addition Ki67 immunolabeling
reveals focally elevated labeling indices of up to 10%.

A. Brain tumor
B. Brain tumor
C. lnfiltrated cortex
D. Brain tumor

A. The specimen is received fresh, designated "Brain tumor" and

consists of a 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.6 cm aggregate of beige to gray-tan soft
tissue with cortical gray matter and underlying subcorticai white matter.
A representative portion is submitted for frozen section. Frozen section
diagnosis is "Portion of cortex (gray matter) and subcortical white
matter, and separate fragment of neoplastic tissue" by The
frozen tissue is submitted in cassette FSA1. The remaining tissue is
submitted in cassette A2.

B. The specimen is received fresh, designated "Brain tumor" and
consists of a 2.2 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm portion of beige to gray-tan soft tissue
with a portion of cortical gray matter and subcortical white matter. A
representative portion is submitted for frozen section. Frozen section
diagnosis is ”Neoplasm consistent with astrocytoma, grade deferred to
permanent sections" by . The frozen tissue is submitted in

cassette F531, and the remaining tissue is submitted in cassette 32.

C. The specimen is received fresh, designated “lnfiltrated cortex" and
consists of a 3.5 x 2.8 x 2.4 cm portion of cortical gray matter and
underlying subcorticai white matter. The gray-white junction is well

defined. The entire specimen is submitted in cassettes C1-C6.

D. The specimen is received fresh, designated "Brain tumor" and
consists of a 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm aggregate of beige to pink-tan and
myxoid-appearing soft tissue pieces. A portion is submitted to the

Tumor Bank. The remaining tissue is submitted in cassettes Dl—DZ.

Test description

Reference range: lp/ 19q: Non-deleted
A tumor is considered to have 1p or 19q deletion when the 1p probe to 1q
probe ratio (1p/1q) or the 19q probe to 19p probe ratio (19q/19p) is
1.30. A tumor is considered to have chromosome 1 or 19 gain when the
percentage of nuclei with > or =3 signals is >20%. A normal 1p/1q ratio

is 0.9-1.05 and a normal 19q/19 p ratio is 0.93-1.02.

The test uses two dual—probe 1p36 probe combined with a

control 1q probe and a 19q13.3 probe combined with a control 19p probe.

Probes are specific to the minimally deleted regions of 1p (1p36) and 19q

(19q13.3) to detect 1p and 19q deletion. The selection of tissue and the

identiﬁcation of target areas on the H&E stained slide is performed by a

pathologist. The number of 1p and 19q signals in the area of interest is

scored. The testing was performed and performance characteristics of this

test were validated by the

It has not been cleared or approved by the FDA. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should
not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is

certiﬁed under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments to perform

high complexity clinical laboratory testing.
