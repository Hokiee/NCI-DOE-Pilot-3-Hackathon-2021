Lymphovascular Invasion: not identified
Perineural Invasion: not identified
Margins:

Proximal margin: negative for malignancy; tumor is 5.2 cm from
proximal margin (gross measurement)

Distal margin: negative for malignancy; tumor is 14.6 cm from
the distal margin (gross measurement)

Mesenteric margin: negative for malignancy; tumor is 5.9 cm from
the mesenteric margin (gross measurement)

Distance of carcinoma from closest margin (specify): 5.2 cm,
proximal margin

Regional Lymph Nodes: 28 lymph nodes, negative for malignancy
(0/28)

Additional Pathologic Findings:

— Tubulovillous adenoma separate from tumor, 2.7 cm in greatest
dimension with focal high grade dysplasia

- Appendix with acute serositis

AJCC Pathologic TNM Stage: pT2 pNO

Note: This pathologic stage assessment is based on information
available at the time of this report, and is subject to change
pending clinical review and additional information.

Clinical History:
-year—old female with right colon cancer.

Gross Description:
Specimen A is labeled "right colon".

Specimen fixation: Formalin

Parts of bowel received: Terminal ileum (4.1 cm long x 3.3 cm in
circumference), ascending colon (14.7 cm long x 5.7 cm in
circumference), vermiform appendix (8.1 cm long x 0.6 cm in
diameter) and attached mesentery (22.3 x 8.2 x 3.4 cm).

Measurement: Please see parts of bowel received.
Specimen integrity: Intact

Orientation: Inking: serosa overlying the cecal mass/blue,
mesenteric margin/green

Tumor location: Cecal pouch

Gross appearance of tumor: Filling the cecal pouch is a
tan/brown firm exophytic mass with well—defined rolled nodular
borders. Also within the cecal pouch adjacent to the mass but
not communicating with it is a soft tan/brown sessile polypoid
polyp.

Tumor dimensions: The mass is 5.3

x 4 .7 cm (protruding
into the lumina) and the polyp is 2.7 x

1.7 cm.

Bowel circumference at tumor site: 7.7 cm

Circumferential growth: Mass and polyp occupy the entire cecal
pouch and adjacent luminal circumference involved is
approximately 60%.

Gross depth of invasion: The mass extends 0.9 cm through the
muscularis propria, into the mesentery and grossly retracts the
serosa, but does not extend through it. The polyp is confined to
the mucosal surface.

Gross evidence of perforation through visceral peritoneum: No
Luminal obstruction: The cecal pouch portion of the lumen is

completely obstructed, but the ascending colon lumen just distal
to the mass is patent. ,

Gross distance of tumor from margins: The mass is 5.2 cm from
the proximal mucosal margin, 14.6 cm from the distal mucosal
margin, and 5.9 cm from the mesenteric margin. The polyp is 8.6
cm from the proximal margin, 14.9 cm from the distal mucosal
margin, and 8.1 cm from the mesenteric margin

Other remarkable findings: The appendix is intact, curved and
adherent within the mesentery. The serosa is purple/tan, smooth
and glistening. The lumen is pinpoint with a tan mucosa. The
appendix is uninvolved by mass and the mass is 1.8 cm from the
appendical orifice.

Lymph nodes: Multiple lymph node candidates are identified
ranging from 0.2 cm in greatest dimension up to 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.9
cm in greatest dimension.

Tissue submitted for special investigation: Tumor and normal are
given to tumor procurement foundation.
