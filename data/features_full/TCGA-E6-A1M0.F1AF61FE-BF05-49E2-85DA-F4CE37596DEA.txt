GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. UTERUS. TUBES AND OVARlES

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "uterus, tubes and ovaries" is a distorted
hysterectomy specimen with attached bilateral tubes and ovaries weighing 292 g and measuring 12.5 x
8.5 x 7.5 cm. The serosa is unremarkable; the anterior surface is inked blue and the posterior surface
black. The ectocervix smooth and glistening and is 2.5 x 1.7 x 0.3 cm. The cervical as is slit-like,
patent, and 0.8 cm. The uterus is bivalved; cervical canal has a trabeculated appearance and the entire
endometrial cavity (4 x 4 cm) is covered by an exophytic mass with a necrotic cut surface. It appears
to involve the full thickness of the myometrium. Fallopian tubes are ligated; right tube is 4.2 cm in
length and a 0.5 cm in diameter and the left tube is 3.3 cm in length and 0.6 cm in diameter. The right
ovary is 3.2 x 1.4 x 0.6 cm and the left is 2.3 x 1.4 x 0.9 cm; they are unremarkable. Photograph is
taken. Representatively submitted:

FSA1: frozen section of endomyometn‘al mass

A2: anterior cervix

A3: posterior cervix

A4-A8: full thickness sections of endo- myometrial mass

A9: right fallopian tube and ovary

A10: left fallopian tube and ovary

B. LEFT PELVIC NODES

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and ”left pelvic nodes" is an aggregate
yellow-tan solt tissue. 8.2 x 5.4 x 2.1 cm containing 7 lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm to
6.3 x 1.9 x 1.4 cm. The larger lymph nodes are sectioned and have fatty pink-tan cut surfaces. Lymph
nodes are submitted entirely:

B1: 3 lymph nodes

82-84: 1 bisected lymph node in each cassette

84-88: 1 lymph node, sectioned

C. RlGHT PELVIC NODES

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "right pelvic nodes" is an aggregate of
yellow-tan soft tissue admixed with friable pink-tan tissue, 8 x 7.5 up to 2.7 cm containing lymph nodes
ranging from 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm to 3.1 x 2.3 x 2.2 cm. The larger lymph nodes are sectioned and have
friable and necrotic cut surfaces. Lymph nodes are submitted entirely:

C1-C2: 3 lymph nodes in each cassette

C3-C4: 1 bisected lymph node in each cassette

05-07: 1 lymph node, sectioned

C8: loose friable tissue

D. RIGHT lLlAC NODE

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "right iliac node" is an aggregate of ten soft
tissue, 3.5 x 2 x 0.4 cm. Submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis in cassette FSD.

E. PERIAORTIC NODE

TSS:

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and 'periaortic node" are pieces of yellow-
tan soft tissue in aggregate. 3.5 x 2.4 x 1.1 cm containing two lymph nodes. 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm and 1.1 x
0.8 x 0.3 cm; submitted entirely:

E1: 2 lymph nodes

E2-E3: remainder of soft tissue

F. OMENTUM

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "omentum" is a piece of omentum. 27 x
11.5 x 2.3 cm. Serial sectioning reveals no discrete lesions. Representatively submitted in cassettes

F1 -F3.

INVASION (2/6).

D. RIGHT lLlAC NODE; EXCISION: .
- METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA TO ONE LYMPH NODE WITH
EXTRACAPSULAR INVASION (1/.-1).

E. PERIAORTIC LYMPH NODES; EXCISION:
- REACTIVE LYMPH NODES — NO TUMOR SEEN (0/5).

F. OMENTUM, OMENTECTOMY:
- FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE -— NO TUMOR SEEN.
