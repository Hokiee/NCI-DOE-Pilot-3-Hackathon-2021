A. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and “right obturator lym ph node" is a 3.5 x 3.0 x 0.5 cm aggregate of pale

tan—yellow irregular soft tissue fragments. The specimen is palpated to reveal six possible lymph nodes which measure from 0.4 x
0.2 x 0.2 cm up to 2.0 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm.

A1 Two possible lymph nodes.
A2 Two possible lymph nodes.
A3 Two possible lymph nodes.

B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "left obturator lymph node" is a 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm aggregate of pale

tan—yellow grossly fatty tissue fragments. The specimen is palpated to reveal two possible lym ph nodes which measure 1.0 x 0.5
x 0.3 cm and 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm.

B1 Two possible lymph nodes.

C. Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and "prostate" is a 52 gram prostate measuring 5.8 cm from right to left, 4.3 cm
from anterior to posterior, and 4.9 cm from superior to inferior. The right seminal vesicle appears to be detached but the
remaining portion measures 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm, the right vas deferens measures 3.8 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter, the left
vas deferens measures 3.9 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter and the left seminal vesicle measures 2.6 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The
external surface of the prostate is smooth and tan-pink. The right side of the prostate is inked black and the left side is inked
orange. The prostate is serially sectioned to reveal a 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm white-tan mass in the left anterior lobe. This mass is 0.4
cm from the closest margin. The remainder of the cut-surface is yellow-tan and nodular. The specimen is submitted as follows:
C1 Right bladder neck margin.

CZ Left bladder neck margin.

C3 Right distal urethral margin.

C4 Left distal urethral margins.

05 Right and left seminal vesicle and vas deferens margins. C6
Representative section from the right mid-anterior prostate.

C? Representative section from the left mid-anterior prostate.

08-018 Entire posterior right lobe. from apex to base (cassettesC16-C17 are one section, bisected)
019—031 Entire posterior left lobe, from apex to base.
