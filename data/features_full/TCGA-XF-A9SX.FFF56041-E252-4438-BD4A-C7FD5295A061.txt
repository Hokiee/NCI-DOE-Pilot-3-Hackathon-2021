COMMENT:

The endosalpinigotic gland noted within the perinodal soft tissue of specimen K
probably resulted from prior gynecologic surgery as the adjacent suture granuloma
would suggest. These glands are benign and probably of no clinical significance.

CLINICAL INFORMATION:

Pertinent History 5 Clinical Findings: Hx of hysterectomy

Pre—Op Dx: Bladder cancer

PostvOp Dx: Same

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labelled "R. distal
ureter-F/S". It consists of a 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm portion of ureter which is
entirely submitted for frozen section in cassette AFB.

B: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labelled "L. distal

ureter—F/S". It consists of a 0.7 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm segment of ureter. The specimen
is entirely submitted for frozen section in cassette BFS.

C: The specimen is received fresh from the 0.R. and labelled "Inner aortal caval
L. nodes-F/S". It consists of a fragment of yellow fatty tissue measuring 2.5 x
1.5 x 0.5 cm. Two lymph nodes are grossly identified. These are bisected and

entirely submitted for frozen section in cassette CFS. The remaining tissue is
submitted in cassette CRT.

D: The specimen is received fresh from the 0.R. and labelled “Bladder". It
consists of a cystectomy specimen measuring 16 x 12 x 4 cm overall. The bladder
measures 9 x 8 x 4 cm. The urethra measures 3 x 1.5 cm. A portion of anterior
vaginal wall measuring 4 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm is also present. The right distal ureter
is 7 cm in length and 0.5 cm in circumference and the left distal ureter is 6 cm in
length and 0.5 cm in circumference. The peritoneum is focally involved by tumor.
Within the bladder dome is a 4 x 3 x 3 cm firm, white, infiltrating and ulcerating
tumor mass which grossly invades into the perivesical fat and extends to and
involves the peritoneum. The remaining bladder mucosa is grossly unremarkable.

Both ureters have grossly un emarkab a. are uninvolved by
tumor. The vaginal mucosa is tan—white without tumor involvement. In the right

nodes“. It consists of two fragments of yellow fatty tissue measuring 2.5 x 2 x

0.5 cm. Lymph nodes are inconspicuous. The entire specimen is submitted in two
cassettes.

K: The specimen is received in formalin and labelled "R. obturator/hypogastric L.
nodes". It consists of multiple fragments of yellow and pink fatty tissue
measuring 4.5 x 3.5 x 2 cm in aggregate. A 2.1 cm grossly positive lymph node is

identified. Multiple other lymph nodes are also present. Representative sections
are submitted in four cassettes.

L:: The specimen is received in formalin and labelled "L. node of oloquet". It
consists of multiple fragments of yellow fatty tissue measuring 3 x 1.7 x 0.5 cm.
Three possible lymph nodes are identified measuring up to 1.7 cm are identified.
The entire specimen is submitted in two cassettes.

M: The specimen is received in formalin and labelled "L. external iliac lymph
nodes". It consists of multiple fragments of yellow fatty tissue measuring 3 x 2 x

0.5 cm in aggregate. Multiple lymph nodes up to 1.7 cm are identified. The entire
specimen is submitted in three cassettes.

N: The specimen is received in formalin and labelled "L. obturator hypogastric L.
nodes". It consists of multiple fragments of yellow fatty tissue measuring 6 x 4 x
1 cm in aggregate. Multiple lymph nodes up to 1.6 cm are identified. A 1.6 cm

lymph node has a focal white firm area measuring 0.7 cm. Representative sections
are submitted in six cassettes.
