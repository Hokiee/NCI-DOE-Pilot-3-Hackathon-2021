RESECTION:
INVASIVE POORLY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CARCINOMA INVADING MANDIBLE.

(SEE_COMMENT) _
Bone margins of resection free of tumor.

COMMENT:

This supplemental report is being issued to give the results of additional
sections submitted for deca1cification. Invasion of the mandible was already
reported in the original diagnosis. The additional information provided in
this supplemental report is that the mandibular margins of resection are free

of tumor.

(B) ANTERIOR FLOOR OF MOUTH, ANTERIOR GLOSSE , ERIOR MANDIBLE

RESECTION — A 7.0 x 6.5 x 5.2 cm specimen composed of anterior portion of
tongue (6.0 x 5.0 x 1.8 cm), anterior mandible resection with anterior floor
of mouth (6.5 x 4.7 x 3.0 cm), one portion of skin and subcutaneous tissue
(6.0 x 5.0 x 0.8 cm) covering the anterior portion of the mandible, and
bilateral submandibular tan soft tissue possibly salivary glands (4.0 x 3.0 x
1.5 cm each).

An ulcerated necrotic lesion (2.5 x 2.0 cm) is present in the anterior
floor of mouth extending into the tongue forming a fairly defined tan—yellow
soft mass (2.0 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm), approximately 1.2 cm from the posterior muscle
margin of the tongue. The lesion of the anterior floor of mouth also extends
to the anterior portion of the mandible into the subcutaneous tissue of the
skin forming a ink—yellow necrotic nodule (1.5 x 1.3 x 2.0 cm), 1.0 cm from
the closest rig t skin margin. The lesion in the anterior floor of the mouth
is 0.6 cm from the closest right gingival mucosal margin. Bilateral possible
submandibular salivary glands are grossly unremarkable.

_ Representative mucosal margins are submitted for frozen section
diagnosis. The remaining mucosal margin and representative sections Of the
leSion are submitted for permanent sections. Sections of the lesion through
the anterior floor of mouth and mandible, and the posterior margin of the
mandible (bilateral) will be submitted after bone decalcification.
