A) Left thyroid lobe and Isthmus, resection: Papillary thyroid carcinoma
(3.5 cm), extending through the capsule into the perithyroidal soft
tissues as well as focally into the attached skeletal muscle; the surgical
margins are free; multiple (2 of 2) perithyroidai lymph nodes are both
benign (synoptic report below).

8) Right thyroid lobe, resection: Benign thyroid tissue.

C) Central compartment lymph nodes, excision: One (of total 2) lymph

node is involved by metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma, without
extranodal tumor extension. The specimen also includes benign thymic
tissue with a parathyroid gland.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A) Received fresh for frozen section labeled "left thyroid lobe and isthmus" is a
12-gram lobe of thyroid with isthmus measuring overall approximately 4.5 x 2.8 x 2.4
cm. The capsule grossly appears Intact. The specimen is inked on Its surgical
margins. Sectioning reveals an indurated brown/tan to tan nodule measuring
approximately 3.5 cm in greatest dimension. Touch preps are made.
Representative tissue is submitted for frozen section as A1-A2. The remainder of
the specimen is submitted as A3-A10 for permanent sections. Tissue is also
collected for the _ , .

B) in formalin labeled "right thyroid lobe". The specimen consists of a portion of
dark purple/red thyroid tissue measuring 4.3 x 2.6 x 1.5 cm. 5.5 grams. The
specimen is inked and serially sectioned revealing dark purple/red tissue.
Representative sections are submitted in cassettes 81-85.

 

C) In formalin labeled “central compartment lymph nodes". The specimen consists
of an irregular portion of pink/tan to yellow/tan soft tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.8
cm. Multiple small lymph nodes are identified ranging In size from 0.3 up to 0.8 cm.

The specimen is submitted entirely in cassette C1.
