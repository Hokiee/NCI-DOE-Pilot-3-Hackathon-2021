GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) RIGHT CENTRAL NECK — Multiple fragments of ﬁbroadipose tissue (3.0 x 2.0 x 0.7 cm). Specimen is dissected to reveal
one possible lymph node measuring 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. Specimen is submitted entirely.

SECTION CODE: A1, one possiblelymph node; A2, remainder of the specimen submitted entirely.
(B) BIOPSY RIGHT INFERIOR PARATHYROID GLAND — A piece of tan—red soft tissue (0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm and 0.0028
grams). A touch prep is performed and the specimen is entirely frozen for intraoperative consultation in B.
(C) TOTAL THYROID, STITCH MARKS LEFT LOBE — Total thyroidectomy (left lobe 4.5 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm; isthmus 1.5 x 1 x 0.5
cm, and right lobe 3.4 x 2.4 x 2 cm).

The right lobe is almost completely replaced (>75%) by a ﬁrm well-circumscribed and encapsulated nodule (2.9 x 1.6
x 1.5 cm) that is partially calciﬁed and admixed with soft friable pink-tan parenchyma. The nodule extends to the disrupted
capsule.

The left lobe has a single multicystic nodule (1.2 x 1 x 1 cm) that is well-circumscribed and encapsulated with yellow
tan colloid parenchyma at the inferior portion of the left lobe.

SECTION CODE: C1-C3, right lobe nodule, representatively submitted from superior, middle, inferior aspects,
respectively (C3 pending decalciﬁcation); C4, isthmus, representative; C5, superior left lobe, representative, and inferior
colloid nodule; CS, remaining inferior colloid nodule (entirely submitted); total 6.
