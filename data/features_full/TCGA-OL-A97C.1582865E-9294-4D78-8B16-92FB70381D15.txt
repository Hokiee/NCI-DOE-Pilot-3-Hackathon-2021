FINAL PATHOLOGIC DlAGNOSIS W’ WWQW [,3

A. Sentinel lymph node #1, left, biopsy: . f (9 ‘ 8

-0ne reactive lymph node, negative for tumor (0/1)
WC) 4525/4)
B. Sentinel lymph node #2, left, biopsy:

-0ne reactive lymph node, negative for tumor (0/1).

C. Left axillary lymph node #3, biopsy:

~Two reactive lymph nodes, negative for tumor (0/2).

D. Left axillary lymph node #4, biopsy:

-One reactive lymph node, negative for tumor (0/ 1).

E. Left axillary non-sentinel lymph node, biopsy:

-One reactive lymph node, negative for tumor (0/1).

F. Left breast, mastectomy:

—Malignant phyllodes tumor (25 x 17 x 16.5 cm) with heterologous
(chondrosarcomatous, fibrosarcomatous-Iike, and
fibro—myxosarcomatous-like differentiation).

- Margins of resection are free of phyllodes tumor (0.5 mm from posterior
margin, > 6 mm from closest anterior inferior aspect).

- The tumor abuts the dermis of the nipple areolar complex.

- Nipple without diagnostic abnormality.

- Focus of atypical ductal hyperplasia, see comment.

- Intraductal hyperplasia, usual type.

- Benign skin.

G. Pectoralis major muscle, new outer margin, excision:

-Fibroadipose tissue and skeletal muscle with degenerative changes,

negative for tumor.

Clinical History:

The patient is a -year-old female with breast cancer undergoing simple

mastectomy, breast reconstruction, and sentinel node biopsy.

Comment

F. CKS/ 14 supports a small focus of atypical ductal hyperplasia. All IHC

controls were appropriate.

Specimens Received:

A: F/s lst sentinel node left breast

B: F/s 2nd sentinel node left breast

C: Left axillary lymph node #3

D: Left axillary lymplh node #4

E: Left axillary non—sentinel lymph node
F: Left breast

G: Pectoralid(sp) major muscle

E. The fifth container is additionally identified as, 'left axillary
non-sentinel lymph node‘. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 0.7 x 0.6

x 0.4 CM lymph node that is bisected and submitted in E1.

F. The sixth container is additionally identiﬁed as, 'left breast. Long

stitch-lateral margin. Short stitch-superior margin. Please weigh the specimen

per Dr. . Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 4,580 gm

mastectomy specimen measuring 25 cm from medial to lateral, 20 cm from superior
to inferior and 16.5 cm from anterior to posterior. There is a 25 x 20 cm

wrinkled skin ellipsecovering the entire anterior surface, with a short suture
designating the superior pole and a long suture designating the lateral pole.

The areola measures 5.5 CM in diameter and the nipple measures 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.3

CM. The nipple-areolar complex displays no evidence of ulceration or retraction.

The deep surface is inked black and the specimen is sectioned from medial to
lateral into 12 slices (nipple at slice 6-7) to reveal a 25 x 17 x 16.5 CM mass

with a variegated cut surface characterized by tan, ﬂeshy regions intermixed
with dusky, gray-green regions and golden-yellow adipose, with scattered coarse
granularity and hemorrhage. The superior portions of slices 2-10 contain a

cystic space ﬁlled with hemorrhagic to slightly mucinous fluid. The mass

grossly extends to the posterior margin (slice 9) and is located 0.2 CM from the

green ink. Multiple sections of the mass, skin, and margins are submitted as

follows:

Gross Description:

The specimens are received in seven containers each labeled with the patient's

name and medical record number.

A. The ﬁrst container is additionally identiﬁed as, ‘F/S ﬁrst sentinel node
left breast '. Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis is a 2 x 1.2 x 0.8 CM
lymph node that is entirely frozen and called, 'one benign lymph node,‘ by Dr.

. The frozen section remnants are submitted in A1-A2 FS.

B. The second container is additionally identiﬁed as, 'F/S second sentinel
node left breast'. Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis is a 2.0 x 1.2 x
0.6 CM lymph node that is entirely frozen and called, 'one benign lymph node,’

by Dr. .. The frozen section remnants are submitted in BlFS.

C. The third container is additionally identified as, 'Left axillary lymph node
#3. Count '. Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis are 2 lymph nodes
measuring 0.6 and 1.2 CM in greatest dimension. They are entirely frozen and

called, '2 benign lymph nodes,‘ by Dr. The frozen section remnants are

submitted in C1—C2 FS.

D. The fourth container is additionally identified as, 'Left axillary lymph
node #4. Count— '. Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis is a 1.3 CM
lymph node that is entirely frozen and called, 'one benign lymph node,‘ by Dr.

. The frozen section remnants are submitted in DlFS.

Tissue ﬁxed for at least 6 hours in 10% NBF and no more than 72 hours.

G. The seventh container is additionally identiﬁed as, 'pectoralis major

muscle new outer margin lateral long black, new superior margin black'. Received

fresh and placed in formalin is a 24.3 g, 7 x 4.5 x 2.2 CM portion of irregular,

ragged, partially disrupted fibroadipose and muscle tissue designated with a

long suture marking new outer margin lateral, and a black suture designating new

superior margin. A gross photograph is taken. The specimen is inked as follows:

New outer lateral margin—orange
Superior-blue
inner—black

Anterior-yellow

Posterior-red

The specimen is serially sectioned from superior to inferior into 13 slices to

reveal scattered palpable nodules. Sections are submitted as follows:
