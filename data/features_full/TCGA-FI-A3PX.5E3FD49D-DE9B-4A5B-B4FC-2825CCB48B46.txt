The specimens are received in eight formalin-tilled containers, each labeled The first container is

labeled “uterus. cervix. bilateral tubes and ovaries.‘ it holds a his-gram uterus with attached cervix and bilateral
adnexn. It measures 6.5 x 7.5 x 5.0 cm. The ectocerle is 1.3 cm in maximum diameter. and the extemal as
measures 0.3 cm. The serosa. both anteriorly and posteriorly. are smooth and shiny. The uterus has been previously

bosselated. measuring 2.2 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm. This has grossly normal ovarian parenchyma on cut surface. The attached
fallopian lube. which shows 0.3 cm gray-while plaques on its external aspect. measures 5.0 x 0.5 cm. The right ovary
is gray-white. cerebriform. measuring 2.0 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm. This has grossly normal ovarian parenohyma on out surface.
The attadted tallooian lube segment. which exhibits similar 0.2 - 0.3 cm gray-while plaques. measures 4.0 x 0.5 cm.
