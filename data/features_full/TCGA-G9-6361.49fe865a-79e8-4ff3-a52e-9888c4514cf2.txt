INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:
FSA. Left peivic lymph nodes: Negative for carcinoma. By Dr. called to Dr. -
FSB. Right pelvic lymph nodes: Negative for carcinoma. By Dr., calied to Dr

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. LEFT PELVEC LYMPH NODES
Received fresh are fragments of ﬁbroadipose tissue with aggregate size of 4.0 x 4.0 x 0.7 cm. Multiple
lymph nodes are dissected out of the ﬁbroadipose tissue for intraoperative consultation. Representative
three iymph nodes are submitted for frozen section and re-submitted in cassette At. Remaining lymph
nodes (six) are submitted in cassette A2.
8. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES _
Received fresh are fragments of ﬁbroadlpose tissue measuring 3.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. Muitipie iymph
nodes were dissected for frozen section diagnosis and re-submltted in cassette Bl. Additionat lymph

nodes were aiso submitted in cassette BZ.

C. PROSTATE

Received fresh is a 41 gram prostate measuring 4.8 cm from right to left. 3.5 cm from anterior to
posterior. and 2.5 cm from apex to base, with attached right and left seminal vesicles and vas deferens.
The capsule is ten pink smooth and intact. The specimen is inked as foltows: Anterior-Orange,
Posterior—Black, Apex—Red, Base-Bios, Right-Green, Left—Yellow. After removal of the apex and base,
the remaining prostate weight is 21g. The specimen is seriaily sectioned from apex to base to reveal
ﬁrm tan ﬁbrous parenchyma. No obvious tesions or nodules are grossly identiﬁed. The attached right
and left seminal vesicles are 3.4 x i x 0.8 cm and 3.5 x 2 x 2 cm, respectively. are sectioned to beige
tan cystic tissue with no gross evidence of tumor involvement. The attached right and iett segments of
vas deferens are 3 x 0.7 cm and 5 x 0.4 cm. respectively. are sectioned to reveal ﬁrm tan tubular
structure with no gross evidence of tumor involvement. A portion of the specimen is submitted for
tissue procurement (Level ii). The remainder of the specimen is submitted as ioltows:

01-2: right apex

NOTE: There is microscopic focus of cauterized carcinomatous glands (fess than 1 mm) seen at the
inked cauterized margin in the left iaterai base location. Correlation with clinical and surgical ﬁndings is
recommended. Dr. has seen representative Slides of this case. Verbai report was given to Dr.
