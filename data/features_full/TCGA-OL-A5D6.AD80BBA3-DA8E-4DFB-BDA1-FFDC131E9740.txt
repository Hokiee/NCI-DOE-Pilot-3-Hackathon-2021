Clinical History:

This is a year-old female with history of a right papilloma. A screening
mammogram in showed suspicious densities with calciﬁcations in
the left outer quadrant. By exam showed a 1.5 cm quasi suspicious mass at
4-5200, 3 cm outside the areola margin on the left breast. , she had a
FNA of the left breast showing carcinoma. On tbreast MRI on the
left showed an outer quadrant 4.7 x 3.2 x 3.3 cm enhanced mass with three
additional suspicious foci: one anterior and superior to the index mass, one
adjacent to the nipple, and one suspicious focus at 12 o‘clock. The patient
undergoes a left breast sentinel node biopsy and simple mastectomy.

Specimens Received:

A: Sentinel Node #1

B: Sentinel Node #2

C: Leﬁ Breast Mastectomy with Sentinel Node Biopsies

Gross Description:
The specimens are received in three containers each labeled with the patient' 5
name and medical record number.

A. Container A is further designated 31. sentinel node #14. Received for
frozen section diagnosis is a 1.8 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm rubbery portion of yellow,
lobulated tissue with blue discoloration. It is read as 3one lymph node,

negative for carcinoma4 by The specimen is entirely submitted as
AlFS.

B. Container B is further designated 32. sentinel node #24. Received for

frozen section diagnosis is a 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm portion of pink-tan rubbery
tissue consistent with a lymph node. It is bisected and read as 30ne lymph
node, negative for carcinoma4 by The specimen is entirely submitted
in cassette B 1F S in a mesh bag.

C. Container C is further designated 33. left breast mastectomy with sentinel

node biopsies4. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 975 gm, 39 x 18 x 6
cm mastectomy specimen with an ellipse of white—tan skin with blue discoloration
(27 x 11.2 cm), areola (4.7 x 4.5 cm), and nipple (1.2 x 1.0 x0.4 cm). The
specimen is oriented as follows: short suture superior, long suture lateral.

The deep margin is inked black and the specimen is serially sectioned into 13

slices from lateral (slice #1) to medial revealing a 5 x 5.5 x 4 cm ecchymotic
area in the lower lateral quadrant located in slices #4-7. There is a
well-circumscribed, ﬁrm, white mass measuring 2.5 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm in slice #5,
5.5 cm from the deep margin. It is located inferior to the ecchymotic region.
At 2-3 o'clock adjacent to the ﬁrm mass is an ill-deﬁned, gritty, indurated

area primarily in slices #7 and #8. It extends superomedially with a span of 5.0
x 3.5 x 2.0 cm and is located 2.5 cm from the deep margin. Note: slices #7 and
#8 contain the nipple and areola region.
