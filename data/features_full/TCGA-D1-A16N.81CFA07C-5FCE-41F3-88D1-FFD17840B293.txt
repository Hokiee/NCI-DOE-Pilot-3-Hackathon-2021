Surgical Pathology

DIAGNOSIS:
A. Bladder peritoneum, biopsy: Metastatic adenocarcinoma
consistent * iii—wv~-~

with endometrial primary.

 

B. Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and

bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: FIGO grade III (of III)
endometrial adenocarcinoma, gndometrioid type, is
identified forming

a mass (6.6 x 6.1 x 5.5 cm) located in the fundus. The
tumor

invades 1.1 cm into the myometrium (total myometrial wall
thickness,

2.6 cm). Angiolymphatic invasion is present. The tumor
does not

involve the endocervix or cervix. The cervix is
unremarkable. The

left ovary is involved by metastatic endometrial
adenocarcinoma

forming a 6.2 x 3.7 x 2.5 cm mass. The right ovary is
involved by a

microscopic focus (0.3 cm) of metastatic endometrial
adenocarcinoma. .

The right and left ovarian surface is uninvolved. The
right and

left fallopian tubes are without diagnostic abnormality.

C. Adnexal mass and portion of fallopian tube, right,
excision:

Metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with endometrial
primary

forming a 5.0 x 3.8 x 3.0 cm adnexal mass. Portion of
fallopian

tube is uninvolved.

D—G. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, excision: Multiple left
pelvic

lymph nodes (5 external iliac, 2 internal iliac, 14 common
iliac, l3

obturator) are negative for tumor.

H—K. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, excision: Multiple right
pelvic

lymph nodes (7 external iliac, 3 internal iliac, 2 common
iliac, 3
obturator) are negative for tumor.

L—M. Gonadal vessels, left and right, excision: The left
and right
gonadal vessels are negative for tumor.

N—Q. Lymph nodes, right and left para-aortic above and
below the

inferior mesenteric artery, excisions: Multiple para—
aortic lymph

nodes above the inferior mesenteric artery (6 right, 1
left) are

negative for tumor. Multiple para-aortic lymph nodes
below the

inferior mesenteric artery (2 right, 1 left) are negative
for tumor.

R. Omentum, omentectomy: Mature adipose tissue; negative
for
tumor.

This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic

examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of
the

specimen(s).

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled "bladder peritoneum" is a 3.0 x
2.2 x 0.6

cm aggregate of fibromembranous soft tissue with six
nodules

(ranging in size from 0.2 cm to 0.8 cm in greatest
dimension).

Representative sections are submitted. Grossed by

cystic and

necrotic. Representative sections submitted
