BACKGROUND: '

Mutations in either BRAF or HAS genes or BET/FTC rearrangements are lound in more than 70% of papillary thyroid carcinoma:
(1). BFiAt-‘VGOOE (T1799A) mutation has been associated with more aggressive behavior of papillary carcinoma (2. 3). The
association between BHAF VGOOE mutation and features of tumor aggressiveness have also been observed In papillary
mlcrocarclnomas (4). Mutations In the FIAS genes or PAXB/PPARg rearrangement occur in ~70°/o cl follicular thyroid carcinomas
and with lower irequency in oncocytic (Hiinhle cell) carcinomas (5). Regarding the specificity at these mutations for cancer. BRAF
VGOOE mutation and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPAFig rearrangements are overall specific tor malignancy in the thyroid. although they
have been reported with a very low frequency in benign thyroid lesions (6). FlAS mutations occur in malignant and benign thyroid
tumors, being lound in 40-50% of follicular and anaplastlc carcinoma. 304W. of follicular adenomas and 10-15% OI papillary
carcinomas 6 . '

MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS:
For paraffin-embedded surgical specimens. manual microdlacection was performed to collect tumor tissue. Specimens with the minimum of 5096 of
tumor cells in a mbmdﬁectlcn target are accepted for the analysis. Optical density readmga were obtained. Real-time PCR was performed on the
vplatlonn to amplify BRAF codons 599-601, NFtAS oodon 61. HFMS codon 91, and KRAS oodone 12/13 sequences. Post-PCB melting
curve entail/sis was used to detect possible mutations. It required, the mutation type was conﬁrmed by . sequencing oi the PCR product on
DNA from sample positive hr each at these mutations was used as positive controls. Amplification at 35 cycles orearller was
considered sufﬁcient for the anon/ale. The limit of detection is approximately 10-20% of alleles with mutation present in the background a! nonnai

COMMENT:
Immunohlatochemical stains were performed on Blocks D. F and J. The results are as tollows:

Block B: HBME-t local membranous staining
Galectln 3 - negative.

Block F: HBME—i — negative
'Galectln 3 - negative.

Block J: HBME-t - negative

Galectift 3 - negative.
Theaa immunoatalning results and the ‘bordarllne’ nuclear features of the two moat suspicious nodules (representeu m
block 8, right and block J, left) have made t5; ' a challenging case requiring additional consultation. Thus, this case
was reviewed by M“ For each of these nodules, a maturity opinion was reached

RESULTS: Two blocks (1 B & IJ) were analyzed with the lollowlng results:

13: BET/PTO. The targeted area of the tissue showed 0(0%) of the cells with the rearrangement pattern and 62(100%) oi the cells
with the normal pattern. The targeted area is considered NOT rearranged for the RET/PTC region.

The HET/PTCI Probe did not contain the rearrangement pattern.

IJ: RET/PTC‘. The targeted area at the tissue showed 0(0%) of the cells with the rearrangement pattern and 60(100°/o) oi the cells
with the normal pattern. The targeted area is considered NOT rearranged tor the FiET/PTC region.
