Comment

5 and 6. The tumor involves distal esophagus and extends into the stomach for a distance of 2.0 cm. The tumor is fecally
~ 0.5 mm from the esophageal adventitial margin and also involves perigastric fat. The proximal part of the tumor is
polypoid and is in a background of intestinal metaplasia in residual glandular mucosa.

There is focal mucinous differentiation with small mucin pools and there is focal area of poorly differentiated tumor. The
mucinous component represents approximately 20% of the tumor. There is metastatic adenocarcinoma in 3117 lymph
nodes identiﬁed. There is inﬁltration of perinodal adipose tissue in specimen #7, labeled iymph node station 17.

One lymph node in specimen #6, labeled lymph node station 7, shows small hyalinized nodules with anthracotic pigment
and microscopic birefringent particles. There are no acid fast bacilli or fungi are identiﬁed by the ZN and PAS stains.
