SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

l ATI'EST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF THE SUDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL). AND THAT I HAVE
REVIEWED AND APPROVED THIS REPORT.

*** Report Electronically Signed Out ***

Gross Description:

1) The specimen is received fresh labeled. "Bladder. prostate, seminal vesicles, urachus and urethra, stitch marks left pelvic
sidewall margin". It consists of a bladder with attached prostate and seminal vesicles measuring 15 cm from superior to inferior,
14.5 cm laterally and 4 cm from anterior to posterior. A stitch marks the left pelvic sidewall margin which is inked orange. The
anterior aspect of the bladder is inked blue and the posterior black. The prostatic urethral margin is shaved and submitted. The
bladder is opened anteriorly to reveal a tan-pink endophytic granular tumor measuring 6 x 5.7 cm which is grossly situated within
the dome and left posterior wall and grossly involve the underlying adipose tissue. Within the bladder is a 4 x 3.5 x 2.2 cm free
floating blood clot. The lesion lies 1.5 cm from the left ureterai oriﬁce and 2.5 from the right. Both ureters are probe patent.
measuring up to 0.2 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion is sectioned to reveal a maximum depth of invasion is 3.5 cm and
grossly approaches the inked fat and pelvic sidewall. The remaining bladder mucosa is tan-pink and focally edematous. Discrete
perivesical lymph nodes are not grossly identiﬁed. The prostate is serially sectioned to reveal tan nodular cut surfaces. The
specimen is representatively submitted including two sections from each prostatic quadrant and transition zone. TPS is submitted.
Summary of sections: UM - urethral margin, RUM - right ureter margin, LUM - left ureter margin. RUO - right ureter oriﬁce

LUO - left ureter oriﬁce, FFT-full face of tumor to include dome and left posterior wall. LP - left posterior wall to include tumor

LA - left anterior wall, RP - right posterior wall. RA - right anterior wall. TRI — trigone, DOM — dome to include tumor

TP-tumor to perivesicular fat, PSW-pelvic sidewall (left. at stitch mark). RSV - right seminal vesicle. LSV - left seminal vesicle
RAP - right apex prostate. LAP — left apex prostate, RAM - right anterior mid prostate. RPM - right posterior mid prostate

LAM - left anterior mid prostate, LPM - left posterior mid prostate, RAB - right anterior base prostate

RPB - right posterior base prostate. LAB - left anterior base prostate, LPB - left posterior base prostate; ADD- additional sections
