Microscopic

Sections designated as “parietal tumor or parietal pericystic” demonstrate
infiltrating or mildly cellular diffuse glioma. The tumor cells are characterized by
round nuclei that lack obvious processes and perinuclear halos. The sections
that are designated as arising inone of two cysts show markedly hypercellular
tumor with essentially identical histologic features. They do have modestly
greater hyperchromasia but this may reflect cell density. Only rare mitotic figures
are seen. There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis.

Addendum

MlB-1 reactivity varies significantly within the tumor. lt ranges from 0.7% in the
least proliferative areas up to 9.7%. Whereas this is worrisome for early
anaplastic progression, the diagnosis f grade III anaplastic oligodendroglioma
cannot be made on this alone.

Diagnosis

Oligodendroglioma, grade II
