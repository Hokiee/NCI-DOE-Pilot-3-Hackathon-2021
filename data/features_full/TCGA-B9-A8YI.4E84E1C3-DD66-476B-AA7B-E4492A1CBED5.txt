Clinical History:
-year—old male with a clinical diagnosis of a renal mass.

Gross Description:

Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally
labeled "left renal mass." It holds a 91.1 gram, 7.1 x 6.0 x 5.5 cm
partial nephrectomy. The capsule is yellow, smooth and inked blue.
The parenchymal margin is tan/brown and inked black. Just beneath
the capsule, there is a roughly 4.5 x 4.2 x 2.6 cm partially solid,
partially cystic red/brown to yellow variegated mass. The mass
abuts the capsule, but does not extend through it and comes to

within 0.4 cm of the black inked parenchymal margin. No additional
abnormalities are noted.

Block summary:

A1—A2 — mass with closest approach to blue inked parenchymal margin,
perpendicular

A3—A4 — mass capsule, perpendicular
A5 ~ parenchyma away from mass
Tissue remains in formalin.

Tissue is submitted to Tissue Procurement.
