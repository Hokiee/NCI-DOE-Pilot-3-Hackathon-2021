Gross Description:

Received are three formalin filled containers all labeled with the patient's
name

Part A is received additionally labeled "prostate and seminal vesicles." The
specimen consists of a prostate gland with attached bilateral seminal vesicles
and segments of vas deferens. The specimen is inked in the following manner:
right side yellow, left side black, posterior aspect over-inked in red. The
remaining gland has a weight of 42 g, and a length of 3.3 cm with additional
dimensions of 5.4 x 3.8 cm. The apex and base prostatic margins of surgical
resection are coned and submitted in cassettes A1 -2, respectively. The remaining
gland is step-sectioned in an apex to base manner with sections submitted as
follows:

A3-11 right posterior prostate gland apex to base manner;

A12-20 left posterior prostate gland apex to base manner;

A21 right anterior prostate gland level 2;

A22 left anterior prostate gland level 3;

A23 right anterior prostate gland level 4;

A24 left anterior prostate gland level 6;

A25 right anterior prostate gland level 6;

A26 left anterior prostate gland level 7;

A27 right anterior prostate gland level 8;

A28-29 right and left prostate gland approaching interface with seminal
vesicles, respectively;

A30-32 right seminal vesicle and segment of vas in a base, mid to apex
manner;

A33-35 left seminal vesicle and vas in a base, mid to apex manner.

Part B is received additionally labeled "right pelvic nodes" and consists of

yellow, lobulated, fibrofatty tissues having aggregate dimensions of 5.5 x 3.5
cm by up to 1 cm. These tissues are placed in a "clearing agent" and a
subsequent search reveals six probable lymph nodes that range from 0.5 to 3.5 cm
in greatest dimension. The lymph node candidates are submitted as follows:

B1 four whole probable lymph nodes;

BZ one whole lymph node bisected;

B3—4 one whole lymph node quadrisected, one-half in each cassette.

Part C is received additionally labeled "left pelvic nodes" and consists of
yellow, lobulated, fibrofatty tissues having aggregate dimensions of 7 x 5.5 x 1
cm. These tissues are placed in a "clearing agent' and a subsequent search
reveals six probable lymph nodes that range from 0.5 to 3 cm in greatest
dimension. These lymph node candidates are submitted as follows:

C1 two whole probable lymph nodes;

C2 two whole probable lymph nodes;

C3 one whole probable lymph node;

C4—5 one whole lymph node bisected, one-half in each cassette.

Microscopic Description:

The final diagnosis of each specimen incorporates the microscopic examination
findings.
