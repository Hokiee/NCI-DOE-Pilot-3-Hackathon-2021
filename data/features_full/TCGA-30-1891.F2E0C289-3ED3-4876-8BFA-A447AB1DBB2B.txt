_cm in aggregate). Representative sections are submitted.

SPECIMEN LABELED “OMENTAL TUMOR" (FSA):
Papillary serous carcinoma.
GROSS DESCRIPTION: by “no.
The specimen is received fresh in ten parts, each labeled with the patient's
name and unit number.

Part one, "omental tumor", consists of a 17.2 x 6.5 x 1.1 cm fragment of
omental diffusely involved by tan, firm tumor that infiltrates the fibroadipose
tissue. Representative sections of the tumor are submitted as FSA and for
special studies. Representative sections are submitted.

Micro sections:
Micro 1: frozen section A remnant, 1 frag, RSS.
Micro 2: omental cake, 1 frag, RSS.

Part two, "rectus biopsy biopsy", consists of a 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm fragment of
skeletal muscle that is entirely submitted for special studies.

Part three, "omentectomy tumor specimen", consists of a 28 x 8 x 3 cm fragment
of omentum that is diffusely involved by a tan firm tumor that infiltrates
fibroadipose tissue. Representative sections are submitted.

Micro 3: omentectomy, 2 frags, RSS.

Part four, "tumor from mesenteric colon transverse", consists of a 19.5 x 5 x
3.2 cm fragment of tan, papillary, firm tumor infiltrating fibroadipose tissue.
There are focal areas of necrosis (up to 0.8 cm). Representative sections are
submitted.

Micro 4: tumor with necrosis, 1 frag, RSS.
Micro 5: tumor, 1 frag, RSS.

Part five, "tumor edge of stomach", consists of a 5.8 X 5.8 x 3.5 cm fragment
of tan/papillary tumor that diffusely infiltrates fibroadipose tissue.
Representative sections are submitted.

icro 6: tumor from edge of stomach, l frag, RSS.

Part six, "tumor right colonic gutter“, consists of a 5.8 x 5.9 x 2.0 cm
fragment of fibroadipose tissue, diffusely infiltrate by a tan, papillary tumor
that is focally cystic. The cyst contents are clear to yellow with a
predominately serous, partially gelatinous texture. Representative sections
are submitted.

Micro 7: tumor right colonic gutter, l frag, RSS.

Part seven, "left adnexa", consists of a 4.2 x 0.7 cm fimbriated fallopian tube
with serosal tumor deposits and adhesion, attached to a 3.5 x 2.7 x 1.7 cm
partially disrupted ovary with tumor diffusely involving the surface of the
ovary. The fallopian tube appears to be penetrated by tumor.

Micro 8: ovary, 2 frags, RSS.
Micro 9: fallopian tube, 3 frags, RSS.
Micro 10: fallopian tube and ovary, l frag, RSS.

Part eight, "right adnexa", consists of a 7.2 x 0.8 cm interruption, fimbriated
fallopian tube, with a 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm ovary whose surface is involved by
tumor. Tumor extends up to involve the serosa of the fallopian tube and
diffusely involves the area of interruption in the fallopian tube.
Representative sections are submitted.

Micro 11: fallopian tube, 3 frags, RSS.
Micro 12: ovary and fallopian tube with intervening tumor, 1 frag, RSS.
Micro 13: ovary, 2 frags, RSS.

Part nine, "tumor cul de sac", consists of multiple fragments of tan/yellow
firm tissue, consistent with tumor infiltrating fibroadipose tissue (4 x 3 x l

-Micro 14:

tumor cul de sac, 2 frags, Rss.

I,:3 Part ten, "uterus with cervix", consists of a 79 gm hysterectomy specimen (8.5
‘V x 5.3 x 2.5 cm in overall dimension). The exocervix has a tan, smooth mucosa
and measures 3.5 x 2.8 cm, with a 0.5 cm slit—like 05, leading to a 2.2 cm

endocervical canal. There are heaped up areas of mucosa on the anterior
surface of the endocervix. The endometrial cavity measures 2.5 x 2.5 cm and
the endometrium measures 0.1 cm in thickness with no gross evident lesions.
There is a 1.2 cm intramural leiomyoma. The serosal surface is focally
hemorrhagic and has possible tumor deposits, up to 0.5 cm, particularly on the

anterior side. Representative sections are submitted.
Micro 15: posterior cervix, 1 frag, RSS.

Micro 16: anterior cervix, 1 frag, RSS.

Micro 17: lower uterine segment, 1 frag, RSS.

Micro 18: posterior endometrium with fibroid, 1 frag, RSS.
Micro 19: anterior endometrium, l frag, RSS.

Micro 20: suspicious areas on serosa, 2 frags, RSS.
