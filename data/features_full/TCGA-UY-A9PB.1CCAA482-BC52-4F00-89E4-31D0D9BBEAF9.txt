B. Left ureter, biopsy: No evndence of carcinoma; see comment. (y \6139 // C/

C. Urinary bladder, prostate, right and left seminal vesicles, cystoprostatectomy:
- Urinary bladder: Urothelial carcinoma, high grade, 4.2 cm, involving perivesicle
tissue; see comment.

- Prostate: Benign prostatic tissue.

- Right and left seminal vesicles: No signiﬁcant pathologic abnormality.

D. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, dissection: No tumor seen in 17 lymph nodes (0/17).
E. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, dissection: No tumor seen in 12 lymph nodes (0/12).
F. Left ureter, biopsy: No evidence of carcinoma; see comment.

G. Right ureter, biopsy: No evidence of carcinoma; see comment.

COMMENT:

On slide 81 a few degenerating atypical cells are present. These cells are not present in frozen section
slides. The differential diagnosis includes degenerating umbrella cells versus ﬂoater.

Deeper level sections were performed and evaluated on block 61 to conﬁrm the diagnosis.

Bladder Tumor Synoptic Comment

- Tumor type: Urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma.

E Q.
- Extent of tumor in bladder: Invasion through muscularis propria into perivesical tissue.
- Lymphatic/vascular invasion: None.
- Epithelial abnormalities In bladder: Carcinoma in situ.
- Extension of tumor Into adjacent organs: None (tumor is seen growing toward prostate, but the
prostate is not involved).
- Margins:
- Urethral margin: Carcinoma in situ (best demonstrated in frozen section slides).
- Right ureter margin: Negative.
- Left ureter margin: Negative.
- Perivesical margin: Negative.
- The status of the edges of the main specimen (Part C) are reported above. Additional parts (Parts A,
B, F, G) are submitted by the Surgeon as left and right ureter biopsies. Therefore, evaluation of
the true surgical margin requires clinical correlation.
- Lymph node status: Negative.

- Total number of nodes examined: 29 (Paris D and E).
- Other pathologic findings in bladder: None.
- AJCC/UICC stage: pT3aNOMX.

Intraoperative Diagnosis

F51 (A) Right ureter, biopsy: No carcinoma. —
F52 (B) Left ureter, biopsy: No carcinoma. (“——

F53 (C) Bladder and prostate, cystoprostatectomy: Atypical urothelium consistent with carcinoma in
situ and single focus suspicious for superficially invasive carcinoma.

Clinical History

The patient is a dear-old man who developed gross hematuria i Cystoscopy and CT

showed a right-sided bladder mass. TURBTF)-showed high-grade muscle invasive
urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. He uncle oes radical cystoprostatectomy.

Gross Description

The specimen is received in seven parts, each labeled with the patient‘s name and medical record
number. Parts A-C are received fresh. Parts D-G are received in formalin.

Part A, labeled "right ureter,“ consists of a single unoriented pink fragment of soft tissue measuring 1.2

x 1.1 x 0.3 cm. It is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis 1, with the frozen section remnant
submitted in cassette A1.

Part 3, labeled “left ureter,“ consists of a single unoriented pink fragment of soft tissue measuring 1 x 1

x 0.3 cm. It is entirely frozen for frozen section diagnosis 2, with the frozen section remnant submitted
in cassette Bl.

p -.
Part C is additionally labeled "bladder/prostate,“ and consists of a single unoriented urinary bladder and
prostate specimen weighing 346 grams and measuring 21.6 x 10 x 5.2 cm. The urinary bladder
measures 7.5 x 7 x 6.2 cm with the attached anterior/superior fatty tissue measuring 10 x 8.5 x 3.8 cm.
The prostate measures 4.2 cm medial-lateral x 3 cm anterior—posterior x 2.7 cm superior-inferior. The
serosal surface is mostly smooth and glistening without grossly obvious lesions. The ureterai margins
are flush with the surrounding tissue (i.e., no appreciable length). The left ureter measures 0.6 cm in
average diameter with a 0.2 cm wall thickness; the right ureter measures 0.5 cm in average diameter
with a 0.1 cm to 0.2 cm wall thickness. The right anterior surface is inked green; the left anterior
surface is inked blue; the posterior surface is inked black. The urethral margin is removed and
submitted for frozen section diagnosis 3, with the frozen section remnant submitted in cassette C1. The
urinary bladder and prostate are opened anteriorly to show a large red-tan ulcerated and necrotic mass
occupying almost the entire right lateral bladder wall, measuring 4.2 x 3 cm. The left ureter is patent to
probing; however, the right ureter cannot be probed due to blockage by the mass. Upon serial
sectioning, the mass abuts the green inked margin (right anterior) with a maximum thickness of 1.8
cm. The mass appears to invade the muscularis propria with extension into the perivesical soft tissue.
The mass is 0.7 cm to the black inked margin (posterior) and 2.7 cm to the blue inked margin (left
anterior). The mass also appears to extend to and involve the base of the prostate. Serial sectioning of
the prostate reveals mostly ﬁrm/rubbery porous tissue with punctate orange-brown gritty material
scattered throughout. The base of the prostate appears to be involved by the urinary bladder mass;
however, no other discrete lesions or masses/nodules are identiﬁed in the prostate. Representative
sections are submitted as follows:

Cassette C1: Urethral margin, en face (frozen section remnant).
Cassette C2: Right ureter margin, en face.

Cassette C3: Left ureter margin, en face.

Cassettes C4~CS= Mass, closest to green inked margin (right anterior).
Cassette C6: Mass, closest to black inked margin (posterior).
Cassette C7: Mass and adjacent uninvolved mucosa.

Cassette C8: Mass and prostate.

Cassette C9: Unlnvolved mucosa, dome.

Cassette C10: Unlnvolved mucosa, trigone (adjacent to left ureterai orifice).
Cassette C11: Unlnvolved mucosa, left lateral wall.

Cassette C12: Prostate, right apex.

Cassette C13: Prostate, right mid.

Cassette C14: Prostate, right base, including seminal vesicle.
Cassette C15: Prostate, leﬁ apex.

Cassette C16: Prostate, left mid.

Cassette C17: Prostate, left base, including seminal vesicle.
Cassette C18: Four candidate lymph nodes, submitted whole.

Cassettes C19-C20: Representative sections of perlveslcal fat. .

Part D is additionally labeled "right pelvic lymph node." it consists of multiple soft, irregular pieces of
tan-brown-yeilow, fatty tissue measuring 10.1 x 7.5 x 2.2 cm in aggregate. Eighteen candidate lymph
nodes are found ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 5.3 cm in greatest dimension. The candidate lymph
nodes are submitted as follows:

Cassette 01: Eight nodes.

Cassette 02: Five nodes.

Cassette 03: Two nodes, one node inked and bisected.
Cassettes 04-05: One node bisected.

Cassettes 06: One node bisected.

Cassettes 08-010: One node bisected along the short axis as well as the long axis.
The remaining fatty tissue is returned to the container. ’

Part E is additionally labeled "left pelvic lymph node." It consists of multiple soft, irregular pieces of
tan-brown-yellow, fatty tissue measuring 9.9 x 6.3 x 2.5 cm in aggregate. Fourteen candidate lymph

nodes are found ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 5.2 cm. The candidate lymph nodes are submitted as
follows:

Cassette E1: Six nodes.
Cassette E2: Four nodes.

Cassette EB: One node.

Cassette E4: One node bisected.

Cassettes E5-E6: One node bisected.

Cassettes E7-E9: One node serially sectioned.

The remaining fatty tissue is returned to the container. _

 

Part F is additionally labeled "left ureter.“ It consists of a single soft, unoriented, tubular piece of
off-white tissue with attached tan-brown, fibrofatty tissue measuring 2.5 x 1.3 x 0.2 cm. The tubular
piece measures 0.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. The lumen measures 0.1 cm. The specimen
is entirely submitted in cassette F1. (

Part G is additionally labeled “right ureter.” It consists of a single soft, unoriented, tubular piece ,of off
white-brown tissue measuring 0.9 cm in length and 0.7 cm in diameter. The lumen measures 0.2 cm.
The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette Gi. .

Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. Final diagnosis made by attending pathologist
following review of all pathology slides.
