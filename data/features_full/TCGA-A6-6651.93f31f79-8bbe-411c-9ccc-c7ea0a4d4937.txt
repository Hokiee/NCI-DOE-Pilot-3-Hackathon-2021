SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

SPECIMEN
A. Subtotal colectomy
B. Small bowel mass
C. Appendectomy

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Transverse Colon cancer

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS
B. Serosal fibrosis, no tumor seen on, further

evaluation on permanent sections. —

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. Received fresh in a container labeled "colon" is a

segment of colon 23 cm long. The specimen is received open
at both ends, which are arbitrarily inked blue and black. The
serosal surface is tan-pink and glistening. There is abundant
attached yellow adipose tissue. There is also abundant omentum
present, 42 x 5 x 3 cm in greatest dimensions. The omentum is
serially sectioned, and there are no focal lesions. The segment of
bowel is opened. It averages 6.5 cm in circumference. 5.5 cm from
the black-inked end of the specimen, there is a 5.5 x 5 x 3.8 cm
tumor mass. On cut surface, this tumor grossly invades into, and
apparently through, the muscularis propria, into surrounding soft
tissues. Although extending near to the serosal surface, tumor does
not appear to reach the serosal surface, and is not near the radial
margin. The surface deep to the tumor is inked. 3.5 cm from the
blue-inked margin is a separate 3.5 x 3.3 x 2.7 cm polypoid lesion.
There is some black tattooing in this region. On cut surface, the
polypoid lesion is exophytic, without definite gross invasion into
the bowel wall. The specimen away from the lesions has a tan—pink
glistening mucosa and tan wall. The adipose tissue is dissected,
and multiple tan lymph nodes are identified. RS—22, following
fixation.

BLOCK SUMMARY: Al,A2 — omentum; A3 — proximal and distal resection
margins; A4—A7 — invasive tumor mass, with one lymph node also
included in block A7; A8—Al6 — entire polypoid lesion; Al7—A22 —
lymph nodes.

B. Received fresh in a container labeled "B - small bowel

mass" is a portion of tan tissue with mucosa along one
surface, 3 x 2 cm, and 0.3 cm deep, compatible with small bowel. On
the serosal surface there is a tan-white plaque-like area, 0.8 x 0.5
x 0.1 cm. A section is submitted for frozen section, including the
plaque-like area, and the remainder of the specimen is entirely
submitted for permanent sections in three additional blocks.

C. Received in formalin in a container labeled "appendix"

is a 5.5 cm long x 0.7 cm in diameter appendix. It is
grossly unremarkable, with a tan-pink glistening serosal surface,

wall, and tan mucosa. There are no focal lesions. AS-l.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
The following template summarizes the findings in this case:

Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma of the colon in part A, present in
the lesion submitted in blocks A4—A7.
Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated

Primary tumor (pT): pT3. Adenocarcinoma invades through the full
thickness of the muscularis propria into surrounding adipose
tissue.

Proximal margin: Negative

Distal margin: Negative

Circumferential (radial) margin: Negative

Distance of tumor from closest margin: See gross description

Vascular invasion: Not definitively identified

Regional lymph nodes (pN): leb. There is metastatic

adenocarcinoma in two of thirty-three (2/33) lymph nodes. One of
the positive lymph nodes is the lymph node immediately subjacent
to the tumor submitted in block A7.

Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: Not identified

Distant metastasis (pM): pMX

Other findings: The separate polypoid lesion in part A is a

tubulovillous th focal severe dysplasia. Part A is also
notable for Part B has serosal fibrosis, without tumor
seen. In p appendix is without specific diagnostic

abnormalities, with luminal obliteration.
Note: This case has been reviewed in Intradepartmental
Consultation, with concurrence with the interpretation.

DIAGNOSIS
A. Colon, subtotal excision
- Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, invading through
the full thickness of the muscularis propria and into the
surrounding adipose tissue (pT3, see microscopic
description).
- Separate tubulovillous adenoma, with focal severe dysplasia.

— Margins negative for malignancy.
- Metastatic adenocarcinoma in two of thirty-three (2/33)
lymph nodes.

B. Tissue, small bowel, excision
- Serosal fibrosis, no tumor seen.

C. Appendix, excision
— Luminal obliteration, without specific diagnostic
abnormalities.
