FINAL DIAGNOSIS

1. RETROPERINEAL MASS, EXCISION (A) - CONSISTENT DEDIFFERENTIATED
LIPOSARCOMA. WITH DIVERGENT DIFFERENTIATION RESEMBLING HIGH-GRADE MALIGNANT
PERIPHERAL NERVE SHEATH TUMOR (GRADE 3/3), SEE COMMENT.

2. PERIAORTIC LYMPH NODE #2, DISTAL. EXCISION (B) - NEGATIVE FOR NEOPLASM.

3. PERIAORTIC LYMPH NODE #1, PROXIMAL EXCISION (C) - NEGATIVE FOR
NEOPLASM.

4. ABDOMINAL WALL, EXCISION (D) - FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE ASSOCIATED WITH
ACUTE INFLAMMATION AND FIBRIN.
- NO EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASM.

COMMENT

1. Although the vast majority of this tumor consists of a high-grade

spindle cell sarcoma resembling malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. at
least focally (slide A11 in particular), there is a lower grade area

entirely consistent with a well-differentiated Iiposarcoma. Taken

together, this neoplasm is best classiﬁed as a high-grade dedifferentiated
Iiposarcoma. The dedifferentiated area has the morphologic features of a
high-grade spindle cell sarcoma resembling a malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumor. Because of the close resemblance to a monophasic synovial
sarcoma, parafﬁn-embedded tissue was analyzed by ﬂuorescent in situ
hybridization for the SYT translocation characteristic of synovial sarcoma.
However, this alteration was not identiﬁed.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. Received fresh and unoriented is a mass that measures 30.0 x 23.0 x
13.0 cm and weighs 4.0 kg. The majority of the surface is well

encapsulated, smooth. shiny and tan-pink. However there is an area present
-_on one aspect that measures 22.0 x 10.0 cm and consists of irregular
lobulated hemorrhagic area. The capsule that is present on much of the
specimen surfaceappears to be disrupted in this region. Black ink is

applied to the surface and margins are taken in six aspects of the

specimen, including the area of capsular disruption. The specimen is

serially sectioned revealing an irreguiar lobulated fleshy tan-white m'ass

with extensive areas of central necrosis and cystic degeneration. Areas of
hemorrhage are also present. Present within the specimen is a kidney
measuring approximately 11.0 x 6.0 x 4.0 cm. The tumor encases much of the
kidney, especially in the hilar region. However the tumor does not appear

to invade renal parenchyma. Present approximately 15 cm away is an adrenal
measuring 5.0 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm. The tumor has apparently ﬁlled the space
between the kidney and the adrenal and has completely encased the adrenal.
Sectioning reveals a tan-white nodule measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm and is
present within the medulla of the adrenal. The adrenal gland is otherwise
unremarkable. Also present is a pink-red irregular segment of tissue

possibly representing a portion of liver that measures 7.0 x 6.5 x 4.0 cm.
This portion of possible liver also appears to be encased by tumor and
deﬁnite inﬁltration of the liver parenchyma is not identiﬁed. Gross
photograph of the external portion of the specimen and of the cut surface
showing relationship between the tumor and the kidney are taken. Fresh
tissue is also submitted for frozen archives. Cassettes are submitted in
formalin as follows: A1 representative section of tumor at surface with

black ink; A2 - A6 representative sections of additional tumor margins with
inked capsule; A7 &' A8 representative section of kidney with tumor

interface; A9 - A18 additional representative sections of tumor, with A11

and A12 showing relationship of tumor with adrenal.

B. Received fresh are two ovoid tan-red ﬁrm nodules resembling lymph
nodes measuring 1.1 and 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. The nodules are
totally submitted in formalin in one cassette.

C. Received fresh are nine ovoid tan-red firm nodules resembling lymph 'V
nodes ranging from 0.2 cm to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. The nodules are

totally submitted in formalin in two cassettes: C1 six nodules; CZ three

nodules.

D. Received fresh is a polypoid segment of tan-pink soft tissue measuring
2.2 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is not sectioned. Totally submitted in
formalin in one cassette.
