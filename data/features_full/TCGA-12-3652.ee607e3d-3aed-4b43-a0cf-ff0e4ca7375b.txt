CLINICAL HISTORY:

Left parietal neoplasm 191.3. MRI Findings: Post gadolinium thin section
imaging was obtained through the brain with fiducial markers in place for the
purposes of preoperative localization. A peripherally enhancing mass in the
left parietal region, with a broad contact against the dura is again seen,
which is not significantly changed compared with prior outside MRI. There is
mass effect results in effacement of the atrium and occipital horn of the left
lateral ventricle, as well as partial effacement of the left ambient /
quadrigeminal plate cistern by the posterior medial temporal lobe. This also
remains unchanged. Low Tl signal in the left parietal lobe is not
significantly changed in distribution given differences in technique.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Brain tissue (AFln2)", received fresh for frozen section is a 5 x 5 x 1.5
cm fragment of brown—tan soft tissue. Sectioning reveals a focally necrotic
and hemorrhagic surface. Representative sections are frozen as AF1—2 and the
frozen section remnants are submitted in blocks Al—Z, respectively. Additional
representative sections are submitted in blocks A3—8, with the remainder
retained in formalin.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:

A. "Brain tissue":AFlH2uhigh grade glioma - —

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

Microscopic examination shows brain infiltrated by a malignant astrocytic
neoplasm characterized by cytologic pleomorphism, mitotic figures,
microvascular changes and pseudopalisading necrosis.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. “BRAIN TISSUE" (CRANIOTOMY):

GLIOBLASTOMA (WHO GRADE IV).

FISH INTERPRETATION SUMMARY:

CHROMOSOME 7 CENTROMERE — POLYSOMY (77% OF TUMOR CELLS EXHIBIT POLYSOMY)
EGFR c AMPLIFICATION (96% OF TUMOR CELLS EXHIBIT AMPLIFICATION)

CHROMOSOME 10 CENTROMERE - CENTROMERE LOSS (67% OF TUMOR CELLS EXHIBIT LOSS)

PTEN — ALLELIC L088 (73% 0F TUMOR CELLS EXHIBIT LOSS)

9p21 - L088 (48% OF TUMOR CELLS EXHIBIT LOSS)

CHROMOSOME 9 CENTROMERE — CENTROMERE LOSS (42% OF TUMOR CELLS EXHIBIT LOSS)

4 OF 4 ABNORMAL MARKERS AND 9921 EXHIBITS Loss.

COMMENT: A MULTIVARIATE SURVIVAL ANALYSIS OF - PATIENTS WITH GLIOBLASTOMAS
REVEALS THAT THE HAZARD OE SHORT SURVIVAL AMONG PATIENTS WITH Ow2 ABNORMAL
MARKERS (OUT OT 4) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THAT FOUND WITH PATIENTS WITH
4 ABNORMAL MARKERS EVEN AFTER ADJUSTMENT FOR AGE EETECT.

BOTH FISH AND IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY FOR PTEN REVEAL SIMILAR FINDINGS INDICATIVE
OF LOSS OF PTEN STATUS.
