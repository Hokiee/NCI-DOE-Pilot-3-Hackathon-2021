Intraoperative Consultation:
"Called to pick-up '#1 uterus, cervix, BSO,’ consisting of uterus (11 x 6 x 3.5
cm), right ovary (6 x 3 x 1.5 cm), right fallopian tube (6 cm), left ovary (3.5
x 3 x 2 cm), left fallopian tube (5 cm), weighing 198 grams. The right ovary is
replaced by a gray—tan fleshy nodule with gross apparently intact capsule. The
left ovary is also replaced by a fleshy mass with papillary projections on the
surface grossly. The anterior segment of the uterus is thickened by gray~tan
tissue. The uterus is opened to show a 4 x 2.5 cm endometrial cavity with
unremarkable endometrium. Leiomyomata are identified. Tumor and normal tissue
are sampled for I study from the right ovary. Tissue taken for tumor bank
from right ovary. Rest for permanents," by
Microscopic Description and Comment:
Microscopic examination substantiates the above cited diagnosis.

History:
The patient is a year old woman with peritoneal fluid positive for
adenocarcinoma ), CA125 greater than 1000, and an ovarian mass.

Specimen(s) Received:

A: UTERUS, CERVIX, BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES
B: RECTAL-SIGMOID TUMOR FLAP

C: GASTRO COLIC OMENTUM

Gross Description
The specimens are received in three formalin-filled containers, each labeled
" The first container is further labeled "uterus, cervix,
850." It contains a 198 gram uterus with attached adnexa. The uterus measures
11 cm in length x 6 cm from cornu to cornu x 3.5 cm anterior to posterior. The
serosal surface of the uterus is brown to black with adhesions and yellow—tan
plaques, measuring 1.5 cm and 1.1 cm in greatest dimension, on the anterior
surface of the uterus. The 4 x 3 cm tan exocervix has multiple pinpoint areas
of dark red congestion. The 2.5 cm long endocervical canal is lined by ten
mucosa and has scattered Nabothian cysts, measuring from 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm in
greatest dimension. The endometrial cavity measures 4 x 2.5 cm with
unremarkable mucosa. The myometrium contains six well circumscribed, tan—white
lesions with firm whorled cut surfaces, free of hemorrhage and necrosis,
measuring 0.2 cm, 0.7 cm, 1.9 cm, and 1.5 cm, 0.6 cm, and 0.4 cm in greatest
dimensions. The non-myomatous myometrium measures 1.7 cm in greatest thickness.
The right ovary measures 6 x 3 x 1.5 cm and is replaced by gray~tan fleshy
nodular masses. The right fallopian tube measures 6 cm in length x 0.6 cm in
diameter, with adhesions. Two metal clips are identified at tube-uterus
junction. The left ovary measures 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm and is also replaced by
gray-tan nodular masses. The left fallopian tube measures 5 cm in length x 0.6
cm in diameter, with serosal adhesions. Two metal clips are noted at the tube
and uterine junction. They are labeled A1 — anterior cervix, A2 — posterior
cervix; A3 - anterior endometrium; A4 ~ posterior endometrium; A5, A6 — anterior
uterus with plaque and white~tan lesion; A7, A8 — right ovary; A9 — right ovary
with hilar area; A10 - right fallopian tube; A11, A12 — left ovary; A13 — left
fallopian tube; A14 ~ additional section of uterus, adjacent to the right ovary.
Jar 2.
The second container is labeled "recto—sigmoid tumor flap." It contains
multiple fragments of white tan tissue, ranging from 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm, to 3 x
2.5 x 1.6 cm. Some of these fragments have polypoid white~tan surfaces.
Labeled B1 and B2. Jar 1.
The third container is labeled "gastro-colonic omentum." It contains a firm

nodular omentum measuring 26 x 16 x 2.8 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen
is completely replaced by white—tan, firm tumor intermixed with yellow adipose
tissue. Labeled C1 to C3. Jar 4.
