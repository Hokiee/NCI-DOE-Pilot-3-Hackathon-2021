Comment
I B. Stains for CKAEl/AE3 and myosin-heavy chain support extension of invasive

carcinoma into skeletal muscle at the inferior-anterior aspect of the breast.

Findings were discussed with

Specimens Received:
A: Left modified radicalmastectomy; mastectomy

B: Right simple mastectomy; partial mastectomy

Gross Description:
Received are two containers, each labeled with the patient's name and medical

record number.

A. Container A is further designated ‘1. Left modified radicalmastectomy;
mastectomy.’ The radiographic findings for this breast include an irreglarly

shaped mass measuring 1.4 x 1.2 x 1.9 cm and areas of heterogenous kinetics with
washout. The total extent of the abnormal enhancing is 2.8 x 2.3 x 1.9 cm.
Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 468 gram mastectomy specimen
measuring 14.5 cm from medial to lateral, 17.5 cm from superior to inferior and
3.7 cm from anterior to posterior. It has an axillary tail measuring 11 x 6.5 x

1.5 cm. The skin measures 13.2 x 5 cm and an nipple areola complex measuring 3 x

2.7 cm and a nipple measuring 1 x 1 cm. The specimen is inked as follows:

 

posterior black, anterior-superior yellow, anterior—inferior green. It is

sliced into 11 slices to reveal a lesion that is present from slices 6 to 8 and

the lesion measures 1.9 x 1.5 cm and has a medial to lateral dimension of 1.5
cm. It focally abuts the deep margin and is 3 cm from the inferior margin and 9
cm from the superior margin. No other lesions or masses are identified. A
number of lymph node candidates are identified in the axillary tail, the largest
of which measures 2.5 x 2 x 1.8 cm. This large lymph node is sectioned to

reveal a central area of necrosis.

8. Container B is further designated '2. Right simple mastectomy;

partial mastectomy.‘ Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 350 gram
mastectomy specimen measuring 17 cm from medial to lateral, 13.5 from superior
to inferior, and 2.5 cm from anterior to posterior. There is a skin ellipse
measuring3 x 3.5 cm and an areola measuring 2.5 x 2.7 cm and a nipple measuring
1 x 1 cm. It is sliced into 14 slices in which there is a hematoma cavity

measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 3.1 cm found in slices 3, 4, 5 and 6. The cavity has a rim

of white-tan, ﬁrm tissue around it and the cavity is 1.1 cm from the deep

margin and 0.6 cm from the inferior margin. Also note that the deep margin is
inked red, the anterior-superior margin is inked blue and the anterior-inferior

margin is inked green. No other lesions or masses are identified.

The specimen is inked as follows: posterior red, anterior-superior blue,

anterior inferior green.

The tissue is fixed for at least six hours in NBF and no more than 72 hours.
