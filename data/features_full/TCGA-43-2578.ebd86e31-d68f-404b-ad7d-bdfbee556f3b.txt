GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. Received fresh for tissue procurement, subsequently

fixed in formalin labeled "left upper lobe" is a 21 x 8 x
4.5 cm lobe of lung, which is particularly covered with red
violaceous and glistening pleura showing black stippling present.
One surface of the pleura is inked black on the hilar side and its
opposite side of the pleura is inked blue. The Specimen is
sectioned to Show a pinkwred spongy cut surface with a 1.8 X 1.5 x
1.4 cm tan—white, firm mass which grossly does not involve the
pleural surfaces. The mass is within 0.1 cm of the pleural surface
{pleural surface opposite of hilar side) and comes within 4 cm of
the hilum. The remainder of the specimen is sectioned to show a
pink-red spongy cut surface. A few hilar nodes are grossly
identified. Representative sections of specimen are submitted as
follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1-3 — Entire lesion to pleura, 4 H representative
normal and apical aspect, 5 — representative bronchial and vascular
margins, 6—7 H possible lymphoid tissue at hilum. RS—7.

B. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin labeled
"level 12 node” is a 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm pinkegray
irregular

GROSS DESCRIPTION
soft tissue fragment, which is bisected to show a gray—black cut
surface. The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette. AS~1
C. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin labeled
"level 11 node" are two pink—gray irregular rubbery tissue
fragments, which are 1.2 cm and 0.3 cm in greatest dimension. The
specimens are entirely submitted in one cassette. AS—l
D. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin labeled

"level 5 node" is a 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm gray—pink irregular

 

 

rubbery tissue fragment, which is bisected to show a gray—black cut
surface. The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted in one
cassette. AS—l
E. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin labeled
”level 9 node" is a 1.2 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm yellowalack
irregular rubbery tissue fragment, which is entirely submitted in

one cassette. AS—l
F. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin labeled

"level 7 node" is a 1.2 x l x 0.3 cm pinkhgray irregular
soft tissue fragment, which is entirely submitted in one cassette.

G. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin labeled

"level 10 node" are multiple black—gray irregular tissue
fragments, which are friable, having an aggregate measurement of 2
