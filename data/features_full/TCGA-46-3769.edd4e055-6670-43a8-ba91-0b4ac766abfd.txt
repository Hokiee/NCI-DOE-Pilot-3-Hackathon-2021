VFINAL-DIAGNOSIS

     

LUNG, R UPPER LOBE (BIOPSY, BRONCHIAL BRUSHINGS,
SPUTUM, 0; WASHINGS,

):

RIGHT UPPER LOSE TRANSBRONCHIAL BIOPSY: POORLY DIFFERENTIATED NON—SMALL
CELL CARCINOMA, FAVOR ADENOCARCINOMA.

BRONCHIAL BRUSHINGS: INCONCLUSIVE. ALTHOUGH FEW ATYPICAL CELLS ARE
IDENTIFIED, THEY LIKELY REPRESENT REACTIVE PNEUMOCYTES AND ALVEOLAR
MACROPHAGES. SPECIMEN IS NOT DIAGNOSTIC OF MALIGNANCY.

SPUTUM: NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED. THE SPECIMEN IS COMPRISED OF ORAL
MATERIAL ONLY AND IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF LOWER RESPIRATORX PATHOLOGY.

BRONCHIAL WASHINGS: NO MALIGNANCY IDENTIFIED. THE SPECIMEN IS NOT
DIAGNOSTIC, WITH BLOOD AND ACUTE INFLAMMATION ONLY.

A. The specimen is submitted fresh for frozen section as "level 9 R" and
consists of two pink black 0.4 and 0.5 cm nodules. The smaller will be
marked with black dye and the larger bisected. The specimen is submitted
in toto; 3 (1} labeled FSP for frozen section.

B. The specimen is submitted fresh for frozen section as "right posterior
superior Chest wall“ and consists of three pink red glistening segments of
apparent fibrous tissue ranging 2 x l x 0.4 Cm to 2.4 x 1 x 0.4 cm.
Sectioning is unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted, 3 (1)

labeled "FSP" used for frozen section.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS: Right superior chest wall plaque:
Metastatic carcinoma.

C. The specimen is submitted fresh but not for frozen section as "right
upper lobe“ and consists of a 650 gram (formalin fixed}, 16 x 14.5 x 7.3
cm lung lobectomy with an 11 x 9 cm diffusely firm tan white nodular area
with focal areas of gray tan shaggy fibromembranous adhesions. The
lobectomy is received with a stapled bronchial margin measuring 2.5 cm in
diameter along with multiple stapled vascular margins measuring 0.5 cm in
length x 1.2 cm in diameter to 0.6 cm in length x 2 cm in diameter, and
three stapled margins measuring 3.5 to 4 cm in diameter. The stapled
margins are removed and the underlying parenchyma inked black. The shaggy
pleural surface overlying the firm area is inked blue. Sectioning reveals
a 14.4 x 8.5 x 7 cm well circumscribed gray white mass with a diffusely
friable pink tan centrally necrotic center which extends throughout the
entire lobe grossly appearing to abut the blue inked outer pleural surface
measuring 1 cm from the hilum and 1.3 cm from the closest stapled
resection margin. The remaining uninvolved parenchyma is maroon to red,
spongy, homogenous and grossly unremarkable. No other discrete masses or
nodularities are grossly identified. At the hilum is a 0.5 cm in greatest
dimension gray black lymph node which is submitted entirely intact. Also
noted are multiple gray black to white matted lymph nodes within the
previously described mass measuring 0.8 to 2.2 cm in greatest dimension.
Representative sections of the matted lymph nodes are submitted.

Representative sections are submitted, multiple {10) as follows:

1: Vascular and bronchial margins submitted en face.

2—4: Mass with closest pleural surface including overlying
fibromembranous shaggy soft tissue.

5 and 6: Mass with closest stapled margin and adjacent hilum.

7 and 8: Representative sections of the matted lymph nodes.

9: Uninvolved parenchyma pleural surface.

10: One possible hilar lymph node submitted intact.

D. The specimen is submitted fresh as "neck of fifth rib" and consists
of a segment of bone consistent with rib measuring 1.8 cm in length and
1.4 cm in diameter. A representative section is submitted, 1 (l) for
decalcification.

E. The specimen is submitted fresh as "fourth rib" and consists of two
segments of bone consistent with rib measuring 1.7 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm and 1.8
x 1.5 K 0.8 cm. A representative section is submitted, 1 (1) for

decalcifioation.

F. The specimen is submitted fresh as "tip of superior segment" and
consists of a wedge of pulmonary tissue measuring 4 x 0.9 x 0.6 cm with
stapled surgical margin. The pleural surface is gray and slightly
reticulated with deposits of black carbon pigment. The staple line is
removed and the margin marked with black dye. Serial sectioning is
unremarkable; submitted in toto, 7 (l).

G. The specimen is submitted fresh as "right tracheobronchial angle node"
and consists of a gray 1 cm nodular segment of tissue bisected and
submitted in toto, 2 {1).

H. The specimen is submitted fresh as "right lobar node upper" and
consists of a gray moderately firm nodule bisected; submitted in toto, 2

(1}.
