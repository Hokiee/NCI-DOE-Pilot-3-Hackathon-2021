SLIDE DISPOSITION:

DIAGNOSIS:
A- Uterus, hysterectomy- High grade serous carcinoma is
identified ~—————~__ .m._h_

forming a mass (7.0 x 4.1 x 0.4 cm) circumferentially
involving the

endometrial cavity. The tumor invades 0.4 cm into the
myometrium

(total myometrial thickness, 1.6 cm). The tumor does not
involve

the endocervix. Lymphovascular space invasion is
identified. The

margins are negative for tumor.

B. Lymph nodes, right and left para-aortic,
lymphadenectomy:

Multiple (6 of 9) lymph nodes positive for metastatic
carcinoma,

consistent with endometrial primary.

C. Ovary and fallopian tube, right, salpingo—
oophorectomy: High

involving
the right fallopian tube. The right ovary is atrophic.

D. Ovary and fallopian tube, left, salpingo—oophorectomy:
High

grade serous carcinoma involving the adnexal soft tissue
and

atrophic ovary. The left fallopian tube is unremarkable.

E. Lymph nodes, right and left pelvic, lymphadenectomy:
Multiple

(2 of 21) lymph nodes are positive for metastatic
carcinoma,

consistent with endometrial primary.

F. Omentum, omentectomy: Negative for tumor.

PRELIMINARY FROZEN SECTION CONSULTATION:

A. Uterus, hysterectomy: Serous carcinoma. The margins
are

negative for tumor.

 

C. Ovary and fallopian tube, right, salpingo—
oophorectomy:

Carcinoma involving the right fallopian tube. The right
ovary is

atrophic.

D. Ovary and fallopian tube, left, salpingo—oophorectomy:
Carcinoma involving the adnexal soft tissue and ovary.
The left

fallopian tube is unremarkable.

F. Omentum, omentectomy: Negative for tumor.

A. Received fresh labeled "uterus" is a 123.0 gram uterus
with an

unremarkable cervix. The uterine serosa is smooth There
is a 7.0 x

4.1 x 1.1 cm mass involving the entire endometrial cavity
and lower

uterine segment which grossly appears to invade 0.2 cm
into the 1.6

cm thick myometrium. Representative sections are
submitted.

B. Received fresh labeled "right and left para-aortic
nodes" is a

5.4 x 4.5 x 1.9 cm aggregate of adipose tissue and lymph
nodes. All

lymph nodes submitted.
