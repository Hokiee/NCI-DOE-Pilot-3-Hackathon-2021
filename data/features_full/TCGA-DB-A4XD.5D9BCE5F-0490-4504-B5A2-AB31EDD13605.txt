A-G. Brain, right temporal mass M~P, M—P+l & M-P+2, cortex over right temporal mass, right temporal mass #1 ,
#2, #3, biopsies and CUSA: Anaplastie astrocytoma (WHO grade III).

lmnmnostain p53 will be performed and reported in an addendum.

ADDENDA:
lmmunohistochemical stains were performed on paraffin-embedded tissue using antibodies to p53. p53 protein is
overcxpressed in the majority of tumor cells.
