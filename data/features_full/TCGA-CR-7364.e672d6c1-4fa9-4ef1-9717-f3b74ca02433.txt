GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1) SOURCE: Left Level 2, 3, 4

Received fresh labeled "left level 2, 3, 4" is a single segment of

yellow, lobulated, fibrofatty tissue measuring 6.0 5.0 X 1.0 cm. The
specimen is dissected to reveal 19 possible lymph nodes, ranging in size
from 0.5 up to 1.2 cm. All possible lymph nodes are submitted.

Summary of sections: 1A, 1B, five possible lymph nodes, 5/1 each; 1C-1F,
two possible lymph nodes, 2/1 each; 1G-1I, one possible lymph node, each
bisected, 2/1 each.

2) SOURCE: Right Level 2

Received fresh labeled "right level 2 lymph node" is a single segment of
yellow, lobulated, fibrofatty tissue measuring 4.0 X 3.5 X 1.8 cm. The
specimen is dissected to reveal five possible lymph nodes ranging in

size from 1.0 up to 1.1 cm. All possible lymph nodes are submitted.
Summary of sections: 2A, 2B, two possible lymph nodes, 2/1 each; 2C, one
possible lymph node bisected, 2/ 1.

3) SOURCE: Left Level 1

Received fresh labeled "left level 1" is a single fragment of yellow,
lobulated, fibrofatty tissue measuring 0.7 X 0.4 X 0.3 cm. The specimen
is submitted entirely intact.

Summary of sections: 3A, 1/ 1.

4) SOURCE: Right Level 3

Received fresh labeled "right level 3" is a single segment of yellow,
lobulated, fibrofatty tissue measuring 8.0 X 3.0 X 0.6 cm. The specimen
is eXtensively examined to reveal no distinct lymphoid tissue.
Representative sections are submitted.

Summary of sections: 4A-4C, 2/1 each.

5) SOURCE: Supraglottic LarynX

Received fresh labeled "supraglottic larynX" is a single segment of
yellow, lobulated, fibrofatty tissue measuring 7.0 X 5.0 X 1.5 cm. The

specimen is dissected to reveal 10 possible lymph nodes ranging in size
from 0.5 up to 1.2 cm. All possible lymph nodes are submitted.
Summary of sections: 5A, five possible lymph nodes, 5/ 1; 5B, four
possible lymph nodes, 4/ 1; 5C, one possible lymph node bisected, 2/ 1.

6) SOURCE: Left Lateral Margin

Received fresh labeled "left lateral margin" is a single fragment of tan
soft tissue measuring 1.5 X 1.0 X 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted
entirely.

Summary of sections: 6A, 1/ 1.

7) SOURCE: Supraglottic LarynX-Bisected

Received fresh labeled "supraglottic larynX-bisected-stitch on left" are
multiple unoriented segments of tan soft tissue measuring 6.0 X 4.0 X
1.0 cm in loose aggregate. Two grossly identifiable portions of
epiglottis and supraglottic area are present in the container. One
specimen contains a black suture which indicates left per the specimen
container and measures 3.5 X 1.0 X 0.5 cm. There is a tan-white,
fungating mass present on the inferior aspect of the specimen which
measures 1.0 X 0.8 X 0.5 cm. The other grossly identifiable portion of
epiglottis and supraglottis measures 3.8 X 1.9 X 1.0 cm. There is a
fungating, tan-white mass present on the inferior aspect of this
specimen which measures 2.0 X 1.8 X 0.5 cm. There is a red ulcer present
superior to this mass on this white half of the specimen. The anterior
aspect of the specimen consists of yellow, lobulated, fibrofatty tissue.
Also received in the specimen container are an oriented fragment of
tan-pink soft tissue that appears consistent with the mass and measures
1.5 X 1.0 X 1.0 cm. Serial sectioning through the mass demonstrates that
is appears to eXtend through the cartilage of the larynX. Representative
sections are submitted.

Summary of sections: 7A, 7B, left tumor, 3/ 1, 2/ 1; 7C, 7D, right tumor,
2/1 each; 7E, left superior epiglottis, 2/ 1; 7F, right superior

epiglottis, 2/ 1; 7G, additional representative unoriented fragments, 2/ 1.

8) SOURCE: Right Arythnoid Margin

Received fresh labeled "right arythnoid margin" is a single fragment of
tan soft tissue measuring 1.0 X 0.3 X 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted
entirely.

Summary of sections: 8A, 1/ 1.

9) SOURCE: Right Posterior Paraglottic Margin

Received fresh labeled "right posterior paraglottic margin" is a single
fragment of tan-red soft tissue measuring 1.0 X 0.5 X 0.2 cm. The
specimen is submitted entirely.

Summary of sections: 9A, 1/ 1.

10) SOURCE: Right Lateral Paraglottic Margin

Received fresh labeled "lateral paraglottic margin right" is a single
fragment of tan soft tissue measuring 0.5 X 0.3 X 0.2 cm. The specimen

is submitted entirely.
Summary of sections: 10A, 1/ 1.

11) SOURCE: Anterior Commissure

Received fresh labeled "anterior commissure" are two small fragments of
tan soft tissue measuring 0.5 X 0.2 X 0.1 cm in aggregate. The specimen
is submitted entirely.

Summary of sections: 11A, 2/ 1.
