diameter. The endocervical canal (3.0 cm in length) has a tan herringbone mucosa.

myometrium. The tumor extends into the anterior lower uterine segment by a distance

right ovary has a smooth white outer surface and a white-tan unilocular cyst with
smooth inner and outer surfaces. (1.1 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm) with area of white fibrotic
tissue is present, possibly representing residual ovarian tissue. No corpora
albicantia are seen. The fallopian tube is patent with a fimbriated end and is grossly
