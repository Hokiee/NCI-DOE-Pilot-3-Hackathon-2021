==== GROSS DESCRIPTION: ====================

A. Received in formalin is a wedge of lung, measuring-8.0 x 4.0 x 3.0 cm.
There is a staple line. measuring 8.5 cm. The pleural surface is focally
hemorrhagic, congested, and moderately anthracotic. In addition. the pleura
is retracted adjacent to the staple line. measuring 2.5 cm in greatest
dimensions. The pleural surface is inked black and the staple line margin is
inked blue. Oh sectioning, a poorly circumscribed tan—gray tumor mass.
measuring 3.5 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm is identified. The tumor mass grossly abuts the
pleural surface and comes to within 0.1 cm of the staple line margin. The cut
surface of the mass is hemorrhagic, gritty, and focally friable. The
uninvolved portion of lung is tan—pink and spongy. Representative sections
are submitted in four cassettes as follows: cassette 1 _ tumor mass. pleural
surface, and staple line margin; cassette 2 — tumor mass and pleural surface;
cassette 3 - tumor mass and staple line margin; cassette 4 — uninvolved iung,
APC. Received in formalin is an irregular portion of tanegray soft tissue,
measuring 2.2 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm. Its cut surface shows a poorly circumscribed
tan—gray area. measuring 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely
submitted in one cassette.

8. Received in formalin are multiple irregular pieces of tan-pink
fibroconnective tissue with adjoining lymph nodes, measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 0.5
cm in aggregate. Upon palpation. two tan—gray nodules, measuring 0.2 cm and

GTB cm in greatest dimension, are found. The nodules are entirely submitted
in one cassette.

C. Received in formalin is a 230 gram lobe of lung. measuring 18.0 x 14.0 x
4.5 cm in overall dimensions. There are multiple staple lines adjacent to the
hilum, ranging from 3.0 cm to 10.0 cm in greatest dimension. The pleural
surface is tan—pink, moderately anthracotic and diffusely hemorrhagic and
congested adjacent to the hilum. There is a portion of bronchus at the hilum.
measuring 0.6 cm in length x 2.5 cm in diameter. Also there is a portion of
vessel. measuring 0.4 cm in length x 1.0 cm in diameter. The vascular.
bronchial. and staple line margins are inked blue and the pleural surface is
inked black. On sectioning. a circumscribed tan-gray tumor mass. measuring
0.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm is identified. The mass comes to within 2.5 cm from the
pleural surface. 6.0 cm from the bronchial resection margin. and 5.5 cm from
the closest staple line margin. The cut surface is gray and mucoid. In
addition. directly adjacent to the hilum. approximately 1.0 cm from the
bronchial margin, and 0.1 cm from the closest staple line margin is a very
poorly circumscribed tan—orange lesion, measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. The
lesion comes to within 1.0 cm from the pleural surface. The remainder of the
lung parenchyma is spongy and congested and shows a bulla located at the upper
pole, measuring 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. A single anthracotic lymph node.
measuring 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. is identified at the hilum.
Representative sections are submitted in eight cassettes as follows: cassette
1 - bronchial margin; cassette 2 ~ vascular margin and lymph node at the
hilum; cassette 3 — small tumor; cassette 4 — pleural surface closest to the
tumor; cassette 5 ~ orange lesion adjacent to hilum; cassette 6 - orange
lesion and closest staple line margin: cassette 7 — bulla; cassette 8 — lung
parenchyma.

0. Received in formalin is an irregular portion of tan-pink soft tissue.
measuring 1.5 x 0.7 x-0.4 cm. The specimen contains multiple staples. The
staples are removed and no discrete lymph node is found. The specimen is
entirely submitted in one cassette.

E. Received in formalin is a dark brown to black ovoid nodule, measuring 1.2
x 0.5 x 0,3 cm. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal an anthracotic
cut surface. The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.

==== OPIC DESCRIPTION: ==ezzeeeeeeeez

A 8 APC. Five slides are examined. Sections of lung include a tumor mass
composed of complex anastomosing glands and papillae within fibrous stroma.
The tumor cells have abundant eosinophilic to clear cytoplasm with polygonal
cytoplasmic borders. The nuclei are enlarged and ovoid to irregular. with
thickened nuclear membranes. coarsely granular chromatin and prominent
nucleoli. Scattered mitoses are present. Tumor focally extends into the
visceral pleura, forming a fibrotic nodule on the pleural surface, composed of

more solid nests of cells within fibrotic stroma.

B. One slide is examined. These are sections of lymph node characterized by
moderate sinus histiocytosis and anthracosis. There is no evidence of
involvement by tumor.

C. Eight slides are examined. Sections of lung include residual tumor
(slides 5 and 6 ), composed of abnormal glands. There is surrounding
pneumonitis with aggregated foamy histiocytes present within alveoli.
associated with interstitial infiltration by inflammatory cells. including
lymphocytes. plasma cells and eosinophils. Sections of the second»described
mass (block C3) reveal a circumscribed, but non-encapsulated, nodular mass.
composed of a monotonous population of cells having ovoid to spindle-shaped
nuclei. arranged in a nested/organoid pattern. The cells have bland chromatin
with inconspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic figures are not readily identified. The
grossly—described bullous area is characterized by irregular disruption of the
subpleural alveolar architecture, associated with irregular fibrous thickening
of the pleura, which is infiltrated by chronic inflammatory cells, including
lymphocytes and plasma cells. forming occasional loose aggregates. Clusters
of pigmented histiocytes are present within the dilated alveolar spaces.
Random sections of lung reveal mild patchy dilation of alveoli. most notably
within the peripheral portions of the parenchyma. No other tumor is
identified. Sections of the bronchial margin are lined by ciliated.
pseudostratified columnar epithelium with areas of squamous metaplasia. The
vascular margin of resection is uninvolved by tumor. A peribronchial lymph
node is characterized by sinus histiocytosis and anthracosis. There is no
morphologic evidence of involvement by tumor.

0. One slide is examined, including the entirely submitted specimen. These
are sections of a biopsy portion of lung, composed of benign alveolar
parenchyma. There is adherent fibrofatty tissue, consistent with parietal
pleura. There is no evidence of involvement by tumor. No lymph node is
identified.

E. One slide is examined. These are sections of clotted blood and organizing
fibrin. A few clusters of mildly reactive mesothelial cells are focally
present within the clot, occasionally forming gland—like structures. No lymph
node is identified within the entirely submitted specimen.

=e== SP STAINS: =======================

A section of tumor (block A1) is stained by the immunoperoxidase method for
thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF—l). The tumor cells reveal weak to
moderate intranuclear positivity. consistent with lung primary. A section of
block E is also stained for TTF-l. The clusters of cells morphologically
interpreted as mesothelial cells, are negative by this stain. Also stained is
a section of the spindle cell tumor, seen on block C3. within the completion
lobectomy specimen. The cells comprising the lesion are strongly and

carcinoid tumor. The corresponding controls stain appropriately.
