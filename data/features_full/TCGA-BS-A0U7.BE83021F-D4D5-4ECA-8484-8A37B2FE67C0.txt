Gross Description

A.

Submitted as “right tube and ovary” is an ovary with attached fallopian tube. The ovary measures 2.2 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm in
greatest dimensions and is grossly unremarkable. The tube measures 4.0 cm in length and is also grossly unremarkable.

Representative sections submitted in two cassettes.

Submitted as 'Ielt tube and ovary” is an ovary measuring 2.2 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. Serial sectioning is grossly
unremarkable. The attached fallopian tube measures 4.5 cm in length and is grossly unremarkable. Representative sections

submitted in two cassettes.

Submitted as “uterus and cervix“ is a uterus with attached cervix weighing 83 gm and measuring 7.3 x 3.5 x 4.2 cm in greatest
dimension. The specimen has been opened along the anterior aspect. The ectocervical mucosa is smooth. The endocervical
canal is grossly unremarkable. The endometnal cavity is lined by markedly shaggy mucosa involving most of the mid and
superior portion. The mucosa is friable and raised above the surface 0.7 cm. This area of apparent tumor measures 3.4 x 3.0
x 0.7 cm. Serial sectioning shows apparent early myometrial invasion with grossly approximately 2.0 mm of invasion into the
myometrium which measures 2.7 cm in thickness. The serosal surface is smooth. Also within the myometrium are several
smaller well circumscribed nodules. each with a whorled cut surface. They measure up to 0.8 cm.

KEY To CASSETTES

01-2 - Cervix

C3 - Upper endocervicel canal

C4~8 - Sections of tumor and underlying myometrium
CQ - Right parametrium

C10 - Left parametrium

Submitted as 'leti pelvic lymph nodes" are several fragments of ﬁbrofatty tissue containing multiple nodes. Individual nodes
are submitted in cassettes Di and 02.

Submitted as 'leﬂ aortic node" is a fragment of fibrofatty tissue weighing 2 gm. Lymph node tissue is removed and submitted
intact in cassettes E1 and E2.

Submitted as "right pelvic nodes” are two fragments of ﬁbrofalty tissue containing multiple lymph nodes.

KEY TO CASSETTES
F1-2 - individual nodes
F3 - Single bisected node

Submitted as “right aortic node” is a single fragment of ﬁbrofatty tissue weighing 2 gm. Several lymph nodes are present. The
entire specimen is submitted in two cassettes.

Microscopic Desgrigtion
The microscopic ﬁndings support the above diagnosis.
