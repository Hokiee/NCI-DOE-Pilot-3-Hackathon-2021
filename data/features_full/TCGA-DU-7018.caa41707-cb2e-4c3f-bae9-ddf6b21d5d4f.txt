 

CLINICAL HISTORY

   
   

woman has right frontal brain tumor detected in
and
currently has papilledema and large irregularly enhancing tumor with
midline
shift.

OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
Not Given

Operation/Specimen: A: Right frontal tumor
B: Right frontal tumor

PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:

A and B, Brain, right frontal, excision: Anaplastic
oligodendroglioma.

S e e CODUHRT'I ’Ii .

COMMENT

Parts A and B contain portions of an oligodendroglioma. The neoplasm
has

focal cellular anaplasia, mitotic figures, microvascular
proliferation, and

one zone of necrosis. There are karyorrhectic tumor cells throughout,
and

occasionally in vessels. In part B there is one focal area of
extensive

hyalinization, probably in vessels that become confluent. There is
also focal

mineralization

Special stains to better characterize the tumor are being requested
and will

be reported as an addendum.

MGMT Promoter '
Date Ordered:
Interpretation

POSITIVE - Methylated MGMT promoter is detected.

Results~Comments
Submitted were paraffin curls labeled

TEST DESCRIPTION: Bisulfite treatment of DNA followed by PCR
amplification of

both methylated and unmethylated MGMT promoter sequences, with
products

detected by gel electrophoresis.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results
from a
stand—alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its

performance

characteristics determined by the AP Molecular Pathology laboratory as
required by CLIA '-regulations. It has not been cleared or approved
for

specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA
has

determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are

provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted
only in

the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.

Results—Comments

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates very sparse
gliofibrillarity in

the background, which focally is synaptophysin positive, interpreted
as

evidence of the infiltrative Character of the neoplasm. The §
neoplastic cells

do not over express the p53 protein. With the MIB—l there is a

 

proliferation

index of about 20% in the more active areas. The Neu N { from the
Hermelin

Brain Tumor Center), a neuronal marker, depicts a few positive nuclei,
focally.

Comment: The immunophenotype is consistent with a high histological
grade

oligodendroglioma. There may be a very minor component of neuronal
elements.

as may be observed in some oligodendrogliomas. The diagnosis remains
as

anaplastic oligodendroglioma.
