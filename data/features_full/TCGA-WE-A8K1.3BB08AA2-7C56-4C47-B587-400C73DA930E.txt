HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

***SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT Dated:

CASE HISTORY:

year history of flat pigmented lesion. Traumatic scratch
Nodule appeared. ?pigmented BCC

MACROSCOPIC:

Skin ellipse, 4.3 x 2.2cm, bearing a nodular mass, 1.1 x 0.8cm. The
superior half is mainly brown, and the inferior half, mainly grey.
With the marker suture at lZ’o'clock, the 3'o’clock edge is painted
green and the 9’o’clock edge, blue. A = superior, B = inferior.

MICROSCOPY:
This is a malignant melanoma. Although the main mass is nodular,
small junctional nests in adjacent epidermis suggest that it is of

superficial spreading type. However similar morphology may be seen
in epidermotropic metastasis.

TUMOUR TYPE: Superficial spreading

GROWTH PHASE: vertical

BRESLOW THICKNESS: 1.8mm (please see supplementary)
ULCERATION: present (1.5mm diameter)
LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION: absent

PERINEURAL INVASION: absent

REGRESSION: absent

MICROSATELLITES: A focus of in transit metastasis is present (1.5mm
diameter)

CO-EXISTENT NAEVUS: absent

MITOTIC RATE: 5 mitosis in 1 mm square
TUMOUR INFILTRATING LYMPHOCYTES: absent
EXCISION MARGINS:

Deep: 0.9mm from microsatellite; 5mm from main tumour
Circumferential: 2mm from microsatellite; 6mm from main tumour

STAGE: pT2b

DIAGNOSIS:

EXCISION, RIGHT CALF: MALIGNANT MELANOMA

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT:

Please note that the Breslow thickness is 3mm and not 1.8mm as
originally stated. This alters the stage to pT3b.

HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT
LAB No:

CASE HISTORY:

pT3b melanoma right calf wider excision. 2 x sentinel nodes excised
right groin.

MACROSCOPIC:

Previous report indicates margins are clear of superficial spreading
melanoma with microsatellites.

1. Skin ellipse with a stitch indicating superior from the propose
of this macroscopy is it designated lZ’o’clock and its at the tip.
Skin ellipse measures 12 x 35 x 9mm and bares a well healed linear
scar 40mm. Three nodules identified macroscopically, the largest
9mm in diameter. 3’o’clock margin inked red, D and E = one TS, A =
one TS, B and C = nodes identified in subcutaneous tissue, not
complete TSs.

2. Firm fibrofatty nodular tissue 28 x 20 x 5mm.

3. Fibrofatty nodule 20 x 12 x 6mm containing a lymph node.

MICROSCOPY:

l. Melanoma right calf stitched superior: Shows skin in which there
is scar tissue formation associated with three separate residual
satellite nodules of malignant melanoma seen at the junction of the
deep dermis and subcutis. All nodules do not involve the epidermis
and therefore are best regarded as satellite nodules as seen in the
original resection specimen. The satellite nodules are associated
with lymphovascular invasion and are situated in subcutaneous tissue
and not within lymph nodes. Furthermore the largest satellite

nodule is 9mm in diameter and removed on deep margin by 7mm. The
second largest has a maximum diameter of 6mm and removed on the deep
margin by 11mm and the smallest satellite nodule has a maximum
diameter of 4mm and removed on deep margin by 10mm. All satellite
nodules therefore appeared to be fully removed.

2. Sentinel lymph node 1, right groin: Shows lymph node tissue in
which there is prominent fibrosis and fatty infiltration. No
metastatic melanoma could be found within this lymph node tissue.
3. Sentinel lymph node 2, right groin: Shows lymph node tissue in
which there is also fibrosis and fat infiltration. No metastases
was seen.

DIAGNOSIS:

l. SKIN (RIGHT CALF, WIDE EXCISION): THREE RESIDUAL SATELLITE
NODULES OF MALIGNANT MELANOMA IN SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE; PLEASE SEE
ABOVE.

2. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE l, RIGHT GROIN: FIBROSIS AND FATTY
INFILTRATION ONLY.

3. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE 2, RIGHT GROIN: LYMPH NODE SHOWING REACTIVE
CHANGE WITH FAT INFILTRATION.

AMENDED REPORT

These slides were reviewed for

On review of specimen two (labelled sentinel node one, right groin),
isolated groups of cells within the cortex and capsule of the lymph
node were found, which stained positively for HMB45 as well as 8100.

These findings are therefore regarded as early metastases within
sentinel lymph node number one.

On review of specimens one and three, show features as previously
reported.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

SENTINEL LYMPH NODE ONE (RIGHT GROIN) (SPECIMEN TWO): EARLY
METASTATIC MALIGNANT MELANOMA.

CASE HISTORY:
Positive sentinel node for melanoma

MACROSCOPIC:

1. Lateral lymph node? Fat 2 cm including a 1 cm firm grey nodule.
2. Skin ellipse 13 x 3 cm with a 7 cm scar. A suture is present. 2A
and 2B = sutured area. C = previous biopsy site.

MICROSCOPY:

l. Lymph node with no evidence of metastatic melanoma

2. Three lymph node identified which are negative for metastatic
tumour. However malignant melanoma is present within an occluded
vessel, probably a lymphatic, and apparently unrelated to a lymph

node. The proximity of this to the surgical margins is not possible
to ascertain

DIAGNOSIS:
LEFT GROIN: INTRAVASCULAR MALIGNANT MELANOMA, SEE ABOVE

CYTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

CASE HISTORY:
? metastatic melanoma.

MACROSCOPIC:
3 air dried slides dated

Error logged 2 of 3 slides with material on the wrong side, no
location on form

MICROSCOPY:

This is a highly cellular sample containing short spindle cells
(fibroblast like) with admixed oval and elongated cells with highly
atypical nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Focally there are cells with
fine dusky pigment.

Immunostain for a melanocytic marker was attempted, but this was
unsuccessful.

Overall, in the appropriate clinical context the features would
support the diagnosis of malignant melanoma.

DIAGNOSIS:

CASE HISTORY:

Previous malignant melanoma on right calf. Now has black nodules
that this site

MACROSCOPIC:

1. Piece of connective tissue, 2.5 x l x 2cm. On slicing it
contains numerous black nodules, up to 1 cm in maximum extent. Also
present in the specimen container is a skin ellipse, l x 0.2cm with
underlying tissue to a depth of 0.5cm.

2. Polypoid piece of tissue, 1cm in maximum extent.
MICROSCOPY:
1. Skin with subcutaneous nodules of malignant melanoma showing

central necrosis.

The features are in keeping with completely replaced lymph nodes in
some of the larger nodules. Tumour extends very close to excision
margins.

2. Subcutaneous tissue with a well circumscribed nodule of
malignant melanoma which extends to excision margins. This may
represent a completely replaced lymph node

HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

CASE HISTORY:

Lesion Right thigh. Metastatic melanoma. Specimen has been tissue
banked and area has been inked.

MACROSCOPIC:

An ellipse of skin with underlying fatty tissue. Ellipse measures
6.5 x 3 cm. Entire specimen measures 6.5 x 6 x 2 cm. Deep margin
has been disrupted due to Tissue Banking. Tumour was seen through
aperture on deep margin measuring 2.5 x 2 cm.

MICROSCOPY:

Microscopic examination of the specimen from the right thigh shows
skin with underlying lymph nodes in which the features of metastatic
melanoma. No metastasis was seen with in the skin however within the
underlying tissues and metastatic melanoma was found in at least 4
lymph nodes. The maximum diameter of subcutaneous melanoma is 16 mm
in which this lymph node shows a tumour necrosis as well as
extracapsular extension.

The deep margin of the specimen has been disrupted due to tissue
banking before receipt however tumour appears to be fully removed by
0.3 mm on the deep margin.

DIAGNOSIS:
SKIN AND SUBCUTIS RIGHT THIGH: METASTATIC MELANOMA.
