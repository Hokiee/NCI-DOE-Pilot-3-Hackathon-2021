Gross Description:

Received is a single formalin filled container labeled with the patient's name,

and "uterus and cervix." The specimen consists of a .
hysterectomy specimen including a uterus (11 x 9.8 x 7.2 cm) and attached
cervix. The uterus has been previously incised and the parametrial soft tissue

is inked in blue. The serosa is pink-tan, smooth and glistening with no apparent
abnormalities. The ectocervix is pink-tan with a smooth and glistening mucosa
and has dimensions of 2.7 x 2 cm. The external 05 is slit like with a diameter

of 1.1 cm. The endocervix, which has a length of 2.1 cm, has a pink-tan mucosa
with the normal palmate folds. The endometrial cavity (3.2 cm cornu to cornu,
5.4 cm from fundus to lower uterine segment) is pink-tan and focally hemorrhagic
with a thickness averaging 0.2 cm. The myometrium is remarkable for a 4.9 x 4.8
x 4.5 cm solitary, exophytic mass on the anterior aspect of the uterus that

comes to within 2.5 cm of the lower uterine segment. The cut surface is
tan-white, ﬂeshy and variegated with focal areas of hemorrhage and necrosis.
The remaining myometrium is unremarkable and is pink-tan, ﬁnely trabeculated
with a greatest thickness of 2.8 cm.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:
1-2 12 to 3 o' clock cervix;
3-6 3 to 6 o' clock cervix;
7-9 6 to 9 o'clock cervix;
10-12 9 to 12 o' clock cervix;
13 anterior lower uterine segment;
14 posterior lower uterine segment;
15 mass to show greatest depth of invasion;
16-17 mass to serosa;
18-1 9 representative sections of mass;
20 anterior endomyometrium, full thickness;
21 posterior endomyometrium, full thickness.
