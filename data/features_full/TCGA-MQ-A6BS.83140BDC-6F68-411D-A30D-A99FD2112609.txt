- PARENCHYMAL MARGIN NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. SEE NOTE.

NOTE:

Immunostains on part 4 (right lower lobe nodule) demonstrate that
the tumor cells are positive for CK5I6, 02-40, WT-1 (weak, focal)
and negative for TTF-‘l. The stain for Calretinin is
non-contributory. This immunoproﬁle supports the diagnosis of
malignant mesothelloma.

CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Mesothelioma.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in eleven parts, each labeled with the
patient's name.

1. Part one is received in formalin, labeled 'rlght rib #8'. It

consists of three fragments of bone ranging from 4 to 8.2 cm in
length. The outer surface is smooth and shows scant attached
ﬁbromuscular tissue. Sectioning reveals an unremarkable marrow.
Representative section is submitted in one cassette following
decalciﬁcation.

2. Part two is labeled 'pleura, right'. It consists of three

irregular fragments of pleural tissue measuring 31 x 19 x 1 cm. The
parietal pleural surface shows focal adipose tissue. The wall
thickness ranges from 0.1 to 0.6 cm. Multiple small ﬁrm nodules

are noted studded on the pleural surface. These nodules range from
0.2 to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are
submitted in ﬁve cassettes.

3. Part three is received in saline, labeled 'diaphragmatic pleura,
right'. It consists of pleural tissue fragments ranging 14 x 10 x

1.5 cm. Focally yellow lobulated adipose tissue is attached. The
remainder of the pleura is gray-purple and shows multiple thickened
nodular areas ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. Cut
surface of these nodules is white, ﬁrm. Representative sections of
these nodules are submitted in four cassettes.

4. Part four is received in saline, labeled ‘right lower lobe nodule
#1'. It consists of a wedge of lung measuring 6 x 2.5 x 0.8 cm.
The staple line is inked. The pleural surface is gray-purple and
shows a well-deﬁned ﬁrm tan lesion measuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.4 cm.
Representative sections are submitted.

5. Part ﬁve is received in saline. labeled 'right middle lobe
nodule‘. It consists of a wedge of lung measuring 4.2 x 1.8 x 0.5
cm. The staple line is inked black. The pleural surface is
gray-purple and shows a well-circumscribed pleural based lesion
measuring 1.2 x 0.7 cm. Cut surface of the lesion is tan and
extends into the lung parenchyma. The lesion is 0.7 cm from the
staple margin. Representative sections are submitted.

6. Part six is received in saline, labeled 'level 4 lymph node,

right'. It consists of a portion of ﬁbrofatty tissue measuring 3.5

x 2 x 1.5 cm. Four possible gray-black lymph nodes ranging from 0.8
to 1.2 cm are noted. Entirely submitted in two cassettes.

7. Part seven is received in saline, labeled 'level 9 lymph node,
right'. It consists of a single fragment of tan-brown ﬁrm tissue
measuring 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm. Totally submitted in one cassette.

8. Part eight is received in saline, labeled 'level 7 lymph node,

right'. It consists of two fragments of tissue composed of group of
gray-black lymph nodes measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm and 3 x 1 x 0.4
cm. The entire specimen is submitted in two cassettes.

9. Part nine is received in saline, labeled 'thoracoscopy port site

#1, right'. It consists of an ellipse of skin measuring 2.2 x 0.5

cm, excised to a depth of 0.5 cm. The skin's surface is tan-white
and shows a linear scar measuring 1.3 cm in length. Representative
sections are submitted in one cassette.

10. Part ten is received in saline. labeled ‘thoracoscopy port site
#2. right '. It consists of an ellipse of skin measuring 2.5 x 0.5

cm, excised to a depth of 1.5 cm. The skin's surface is tan-pink

and shows a linear scar measuring 1.5 cm in length. The underlying
soft tissue appears unremarkable. Representative section is
submitted in one cassette.

11. Part eleven is received in saline, labeled 'right azygous vein'.

It consists of a segment of vein measuring 1.7 cm in length and 0.6
cm in diameter. The outer surface is tan—pink and unremarkable.
Representative section is submitted in one cassette.
