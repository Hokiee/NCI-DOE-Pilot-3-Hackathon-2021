Gross Description:

_'

l). The specimen is received fresh and is labeled "rectosigmoid". it
consists o5 a rectosigmoid colon that measures 17 cm in length, 7 cm in
proximal diameter and 13 cm in distal diameter. The serosal surface is
intact. The radial resection margin is inked black and the specimen is
opened to reveal a fungating tumor that is located 9.5 cm from the proximal
margin and 3 cm from the distal margin. The tumor measures 6 cm in length
and 4 cm in width. Serial sectioning reveals tumor invasion to be limited to
the muscularis propria to a depth of 6.4 cm, which is 3.5 cm from the
closest radial margin. The remaining mucosa is unremarkable. Pericolic and
perirectal adipose tissue is submitted for lymph node dissection.
Representative sections are submitted. TPS is submitted.

Summary of sections:

a — proximal margin

1) - distal margin

RM - radial margin

T - tumor

TD — tumor with the deepest invasion
U - uninvolved mucosa

LN» lymph nodes

2}. The specimen is received in formalin. labeled “Additional node from
left colon” and consists of a matted fatty and vascular tissue with possible
intermixed lymphoid material measuring i.8 x 3.8 x 2.2 cm and surrounding
fatty tissue. The matted fatty possible lymphoid tissue is sectioned and
entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U - undesignated

3). The specimen is received in formalinr labeled "distal margin" and
consists of a ring of pink tan soft tissue measuring 2.3 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm.
Multiple sutures and staples are attached. The mucosal surface is pink tan
and focally hemorrhagic. The sutures and staples are removed and the soft
tissue is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U - undesignated

4). The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "proximal margin" and
consists of a silver metal anastomotic pin measuring 7.5 K 2.8 X 1.5 cm. At
the center of the pin, a plastic piece is noted. A ring of pink tan soft
tissue is attached measuring 2.5 x 1.3 x 0.7 cm. The mucosal surface is
pink tan and focally hemorrhagic and the serosal surface is pink tan and
smooth. Several sutures and staples are noted. The sutures and staples are
removed and the soft tissue is entirely submitted.

U - undesignated
