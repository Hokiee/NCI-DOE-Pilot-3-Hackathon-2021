Summary Statement

The left upper lobe neoplasm is an invasive moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma measurinm - i
microscopic satellite focus of squamous celi carcinoma Mme-Wm 0 -section i
are free of tumor. Visceral pieural' Invasion is Identified. All lymph nodes sampled show no evidence of metastativ
carcinoma. The stage Is T4 N0 MX (due to the presence of a microscopic satellite focus).

Addendum

The WG stains Show viscera! pieurai' Invasion by the carcinoma. The PAS and PASI'D stains Show rare positivity' In the neoplastic
cells (less than 1%) The mucicarmine stain Is negative. The diagnosis IS unchanged
