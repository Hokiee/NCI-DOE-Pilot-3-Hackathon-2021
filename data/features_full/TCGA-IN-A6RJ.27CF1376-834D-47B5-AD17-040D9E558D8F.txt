Results
INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES AND PROBE INFORMATION;

Probe: HER2 DNA Probe
Probe Description: The HER2 DNA probe is a 190 Kb directly labeled ﬂuorescent DNA probe
speciﬁc for the HER2 gene locus The CEP 17 DNA probe is a 5.4 Kb directly labeled

ﬂuorescent DNA probe speciﬁc for the alpha satellite DNA sequence at the oentrorneric region of chromosome 17
The probes are pro-mixed and pro-denatured in hybridization buffer.

interpretation:
HER2 negative: HER2 gene/chromosome 17 ratio less than 2.0
HER2 positive: HER2 genelchromosome 17 ratio greater than 2.0

Results should be considered along with other clinical information.

has modiﬁed the suggested manufaaurer protocol for HER2 FISH testing.
The modiﬁcations have been tested and validated. The modifications are as follows: Slides are daparafﬁnized in Tissue is
digested in protease 31 minutes; Tissue and probe are co-denatured at 90 C for 12 minutes; Paraffin pretreatment reagents and
control slides are prepared in house. Ampliﬁed. non-ampliﬁed, and internal (centromere 17) controls were used in the testing. The
laboratory takes responsibility for the test performance.

FISH analysis was manually performed and quantitatively assessed by analysis of a minimum of 60 cells using the HER2
and the CEP17 probes.
