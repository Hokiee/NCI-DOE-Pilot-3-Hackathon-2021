MACROSCOPIC DESCRETION

Four specimens received.

I. "Leﬂ inguinal block dissection". An ellipse of skin, 300 x 55mm with
attached underlying subcutaneous tissue 3I0 x 80mm to a depth of 90mm. No
abnormality of the skin surface is seen. No orientation has been given. In

the centre of the subcutaneous fat there is a nodule 65 x 55 x 40mm. The
nodule has a variegated tan and a cream cut surface with areas of darker

tan. It appears well circumscribed and is 30mm from the skin surface. The
mass appears to consist of 3-4 matted nodes. Two other smaller nodes were

found but, despite careful and repeated examination, no further lymph nodes / C 5’ ﬂ ’ 3

MICROSCQPIC REPORT

I. "Left inguinal block dissection". The large nodule show massive
replacement of lymph nodes by deposits of spindle cells consistent with
metastatic melanoma. No evidence of malignancy is seen in the other two nodes.

ll. “Left external iliac lymph node mass". Metastatic malignant melanoma,
more pleomorphic and cpithelioid than in Specimen I and showing considerable
necrosis.

m. "Leﬂ obturator lymph node". & IV. "Let-t external block cornmcm iliac
node". No evidence of malignancy seen in any of the lymph nodes examined.
