lntraoperative Consult Diagnosis:
FSD: Left upper lobe, bronchial margin:
Negative for malignancy.

F/S TAT: 15 mins.

Gross Description:
Received are six containers labeled with the patient name "

The first is received with formalin labeled "A-left lung #6 anterior and
anterior left lymph nodes," and contains ten grossly apparent whole lymph nodes
ranging in size from 0.3 to 1.8 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted
entirely in the following manner:

A1 four whole lymph nodes;

A2 four whole lymph nodes;

A3 two whole lymph nodes.

The second container is received with formalin labeled "B-hilar left lymph
node," and contains a single probable lymph node measuring 0.5 cm in greatest
dimension. The specimen is submitted in toto in a single cassette labeled B1.

The third container is received with formalin labeled "C-left lung #10
tracheobronchial node," and contains four grossly apparent lymph nodes ranging
in size from 0.3 to 1.4 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is submitted
entirely in the following manner:

C1 one largest lymph node bisected;

C2 three possible small lymph nodes.

The fourth container is received without formalin for intraoperative frozen
section consultation labeled "D-left upper lobe bronchial margin," and contains
a lobectomy specimen measuring 14.5 x 9.5 x 3.2 cm. The bronchial margin is
left open. The bronchial margin is trimmed and submitted for frozen section
diagnosis, with the residual tissue now resubmitted for permanent section in
cassette D1. The pleural surface is blue-gray and smooth-glistening with a
reticular pattern of black pigmentation. The pleura is somewhat fibrotic and
puckered in one area, overlying a palpable mass. The lung parenchyma is stapled
in three short segments near the hilum. Each of these three segments is trimmed
and the resulting cut surface is inked black. Sectioning through the lung
reveals a mass measuring 5.0 x 4.1 x 2.4 cm involving the above noted pleural
surface. The mass has a heterogeneous white-tan, fibrous cut surface with
speckling of black pigmentation. The mass approaches up to the pleural surface.
Two lymph nodes are present at the bronchial hilum measuring 0.4 and 1.2 cm in
diameter. The mass appears grossly to be confluent with possible
intraparenchymal lymph nodes. Representative sections are submitted in the
following manner:

D1 bronchial margin;

D2 two lymph nodes from the bronchial hilum;

D3 mass adjacent to bronchus;

D4,5 mass to pleura and inked stapled surface including possible
confluent lymph nodes;

D6 mass to pleura;

D7 uninvolved lung.

The fifth container is labeled "E-left lower lobe anterior vasal tissue," and
contains a wedge biopsy of lung tissue measuring 2.2 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm with two
stapled edges. The specimen is previously partially incised perpendicular to
the stapled edges revealing a central area of fibrosis which measures 1.0 x 0.6
x 0.6 cm. The stapled edges are trimmed and resulting cut surfaces inked blue.

The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted entirely (with the exception of
the stapled edges) in cassettes E1 through E3.

The sixth and final container is received with formalin labeled "F-Ieft Iu ng
A\T\P window," and contains two probable lymph node fragments measuring 0.5 and
0.7 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is submitted in toto in a single

cassette labeled F1.

Addendum Comment

At the request of Dr. , a representative portion of this case was
sent for EGFR mutation analysis to. This addendum is

created only to report those findings.

EGFR MUTATION ANALYSIS

Patient Name:

DOB: _ Case #:

Patient ID #: SSN: Gender:

Date Collected: Date Received:
Referring Physician: - Client Lab ID #:
Treating Physician: Hospital ID #:

Client Specimen ID:

Body Site: Left lung Specimen(s) Received:

Paraffin embedded tissue
Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma

RESULTS: No mutation detected.

INTERPRETATION:

No mutations were identified; however, 18-20% of patient with non-small-cell
lung cancer and without identifiable mutations are reported to be responsive to
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies.

COMMENT:

This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain; based on the
current literature, the vast majority of mutations are expected to occur in

these exons. The analytical sensitivity of the assay is 10-20%, thus mutations
present in a low percentage of cells may not be detected.

Most data published to date pertain to gefitinib (Iressa). Similar data have
been seen in studies using erlotinib (Tarceva).

A frequently occurring sequence change 2361 G>A was identified. This
polymorphism is not likely to have clinical significance.

This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The clinical
significance and utility of this test in other tumor types is unknown.

METHOD LIMITATION:

Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant rumor is selected or
analysis, DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified and amplified by

polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to exons 18-21 of the EGFR gene.
PCR products are analyzed by bi-directional direct DNA sequencing using
capillary electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or negative
results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants or somatic
heterogeneity of the tissue sample.
