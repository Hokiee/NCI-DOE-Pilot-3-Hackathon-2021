GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled "Total thyroid" is a total thyroidectomy specimen, weighing
14.8 grams. The right lobe measures 4.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm. The isthmus measures 1.8 x
1.0 x 0.2 cm. The left lobe measures 2.5 x 2 x 1.4 cm. The pyramidal lobe is present
and measures 1.0 cm in length. The parathyroid glands are not identified grossly.
The surface is inked black. The right lobe, superior pole, reveals two minute
lesions, 0.2 cm each. There is a gray—tan, light brown, well—defined nodule, 1.5
x 1.2 x 1.0 cm, located less than 0.1 cm from the outer resection margin. The isthmus
contains a light~brown nodule, 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. Cut sections through the left lobe
reveal a gray—white, nodular process in the superior, mid and inferior poles. These
nodules measure 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm and the largest measures 1.3 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm with
cystic changes. The largest nodule is located in the mid pole, less than 0.1 cm to
0.2 cm from the outer resection margin. The specimen is submitted in toto in eighteen
cassettes as fellows:
