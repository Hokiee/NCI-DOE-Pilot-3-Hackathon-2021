THIS REPORT.

 

The specimen is received in ﬁormalin labeled “transverse colon, stitch

1).
marks distal“ and consists of a 23 cm in length by 3 cm in circumference

portion of bowel with a stitch marking the distal end. The seroaa is
ten-brown and smooth with up to 17 cm of attached yellowatan, lohulated
fibroadipose tissue. Opening oﬁ the colon reveals reveals a 4.5 cm length
by 7 cm in diameter, tan~pink, lohular, ﬁooally muooid, centrally ulcerated
lesion. Sectioning reveals firm, mucinoua out surfaces with difiuge
invasion through the Heroes and into the unearlying fat. The depth of
invasion is up to 2 cm. with a 1.5 x 1.5 cm satellite tumor focus in the
attached fat, approximately 5 cm away. The remainder of the mucosa is
tan—brown and normally rugated. A portion 0: the specimen is sent for TPS.
The Specimen is sent for lymph node dissection and all identifiable lymph
nodes are aubmitteé. Representative sections are submitted.
