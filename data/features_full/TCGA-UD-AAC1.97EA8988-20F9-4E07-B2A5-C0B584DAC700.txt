MACROSCOP IC Z Non:
Right pleural mesothelioma: Roughly triangular shaped piece of pleural 5“
tissue measuring 100mm x 70mm and up to 15mm in thickness. The Nm
surfaces appear nodular and irregular with some haemorrhage present on Mei
both surfaces. Tiie pleura appears thinner towards the tailing narrow
end which measures up to 35mm. There appears to be a cut through the Em
nodular thickened area. The cut surface shows a lobulated and whorled MW
grey tan yellowish cut surface focally. Specimen is sliced from the we

inicker end to the thinner and the cut surface is relatively wmc
homogeneous fr:m one end to the other (A—G 7X1, H lxM,

MICROSCOPIC: ma
Sections show the specimen to be almost entirely infiltrated by a ”W“
malignant tumour. The tumour is forming nests and poorly formed mm
glandular structures and is composed of epithelioid cells with round Pmmg
nuclei, prominent nucleoli and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. The
tumour infiltrates from the pleural surface through fat and focally is 0mm!
seen at the deep margin of the biopsy. Geographic areas of necrosis Th“
are eVident. A :ocal papillary pattern is seen along the surface. mmk
