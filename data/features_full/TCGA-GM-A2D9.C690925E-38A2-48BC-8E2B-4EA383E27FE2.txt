COMMENT
Tumor markers have been performed on prior core biopsy i ). FISH study for HERZ/neu gene amplification will be

ordered. Results will be issued in an addendum.

The periphery of the invasive carcinoma shows neuroendocrine features. Although the tumor is negative for the neuroendocrine

markers (chromogranin and synaptophysin) on the core biopsy material, these markers will be repeated and report in an
addendum.

(C) LEFT BREAST SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY - A specimen of segmental mastectomy (6.0 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm). The specimen is
oriented with short stitch at superior aspect and with long stitch at lateral aspect. The specimen is serially sliced from medial to

lateral aspect (seven slices). A tumor measuring 1.6 x 1.6 x 1.2 cm is identified, which is 0.2 cm to the closest posterior margin.
The tumor appears to be ill-defined, tan-pink-yellow and firm.

SUMMARY

'4'

Tissue section of the invasive carcinoma 05 was evaluated for HER-2/neu gene amplification by interphase
fluorescence in situ hybridization technique using the Patthsion HER-2/neu DNA Probe Kit (LSI HER-2/neu
SpectrumOrange/CEP17 SpectrumGreen).

Slide adequacy is satisfactory. Sixty tumor nuclei were counted and showed an average of 2.23 copies of LSI HER-Zlneu gene
per nucleus and an average of 1.93 copies of CEP17 per nucleus.

Negative and positive controls (established by _ with this batch are appropriate.

Two representative images have been archived.

INTERPRETATION

The tumor cells demonstrated no amplification of the HER-2/neu gene copy levels (HER-2/neu: CEP17 signal ratio: 1.16 )
Normal levels (HER-2/neu: CEP17 signal ratio) <2.0

NOTES

  
 

The LSI HER-Zineu probe is specific for the HER-2/neu gene Locus (17q 11.2-q12) and the CEP 17 DNA probe is specific for the
alpha satellite DNA sequence at the centromeric region of Chromosome 17 (17 p11.1 -q11.2).

This test has been cleared and approved for specific uses by the US. Food and Drug Administration. lts system is operating
. within the performance specifications stated in the product insert.
