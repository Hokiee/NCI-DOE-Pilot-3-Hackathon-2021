PRDCEDURE: SPHS

Right adrenal mass. Two short stitches adrenal vein with thrombus coming out
of vein. iuo long inferior aspect of tumor. One long lateral aspect of tumor.
Two double long superior aspect of tumor. lnking according to sarcoma
template. Yellow anterior, blue superior, green inferior, red medial, orange
lateral, black posterior.

PROCEDURE: spas \

7. ”Adrenal gland.” Received in formalin in a large container is a 1060 gm
(15.5 x 14.5 x 13.5 cm) adrenal gland with attached partially disrupted vessel
oriented as above. The gland is surrounded by a thin membranous capsule and an
8.0 x 6.0 x 1.3 cm segment of fibroadipose tissue is attached to the inferior
surface. The vessel extending from the medial surface is partially disrupted
exposing a tumor mass in the vascular lumen. Per the surgeon, this does not
represent a real margin as the tumor mass extended upwards towards the atrium.
Inking as follows: Yellow anterior, blue superior, green inferior, red medial,
orange lateral, black posterior. Sectioning reveals a tan parenchyma that is
focally hemorrhagic and largely necrotic extending the entire dimension of the
gland. A central area of yellow discoloration is noted, 3.5 x 1.0 cm, near the
center of the specimen. No lymph nodes are present within the attached
fibroadipose tissue.

1A~B. Representative sections of tumor to inferior margin.

iC—D. Representative sections of tumor to anterior margin.

iE-F. Representative sections of tumor to superior margin.

iGrH. Representative section of tumor to medial margin.

1I~J. Representative sections of tumor to posterior margin.
