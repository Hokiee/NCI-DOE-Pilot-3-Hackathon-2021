Gross Descrlmlon

1. The specimen labeled with the patients name and as "resection adrenal gland mass left" contains an adrenal gland
with surrounding ﬁbroadipose tissue. The specimen measures 7.0 x 6 .0 x 5.0 cm and weighs 70.2 g. The surface is
painted with silver nitrate and the fat is removed. The adrenal gland measures 5.2 x 4.0 x 5.0 cm and weighs 47.3 9. On
section, there is a well—circumscribed multilobulated mass that measures 4.4 x 4.0 x 5.0 cm. The cut surface of the tumor
has a variegated light brown to tan color. solid and firm. The rest of the adrenal tissue is unremarkable grossly. The tumor
and normal tissue are stored frozen. The adrenal tissue is submitted as follows:

1A—AG adrenal gland serially sectioned and submitted in toto

2. The specimen labeled with the patients name and as "fat" contains a single piece of a grossly unremarkable
ﬂbroadipose tissue that measures 5.5 x 2.2 x 1.7 cm.
