Patient: . Specimen #:

FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued):

** Report Electronically Signed Out **

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY:
year old female with right breast invasive cancer

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right breast invasive cancer

POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right breast invasive cancer

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled with patient's name

designated "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE" is a 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm lymph node with
attached fibrous fatty tissue. Specimen is bisected and entirely submitted
in cassette one.

B. Received fresh labeled with patient's name ,
designated "NON—SENTINEL LYMPH NODE" are two irregular portions of
presumed previously intact lymph node each measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.1 cm.
Sectioning reveals uniform tan and whtie cut surface. Specimen entirely
submitted in three cassettes as follows:

Bl-B2: first portion of node (match of B1 submitted in OCT for CBCP

protocol)
B3: remaining portion of lymph node.

C. Received fresh labeled with patient’s name
designated "RIGHT BREAST LUMPECTOMY" consists of an irregular portion of
fibrofatty tissue oriented with Single stitch medial and two stitches
superior. The specimen measures 10 cm medial to lateral, 7 cm anterior to

black. Serial sections reveal well defined 2.7 X 2.7 x 2.2 cm firm pink
white gritty mass subadjacent to and involving the nipple. Surrounding
breast tissue is fibrofatty and otherwise unremarkable. Cassette key:
