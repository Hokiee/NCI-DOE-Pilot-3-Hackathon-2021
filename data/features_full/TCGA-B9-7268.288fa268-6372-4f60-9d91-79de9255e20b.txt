inical History:

Gross Description:

Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally
labeled "left kidney" and is a 159.8 gram 8.5 x 7.3 x 5.5 cm
circumscribed soft nodule, partially covered with a
predominantly intact capsule with a 1.3 cm irregular area of
disruption. The exposed parenchymal margin is 5.7 x 5.2 cm and
is inked black. The intact capsule is inked blue. Sectioning
demonstrates a solid soft golden yellow/tan cut surface abutting
blue and black inked capsular and parenchymal margins,
respectively. It also communicates with the orange inked
previously described defect. No cystic component is identified.
There is a rim of renal parenchyma along the black inked
surgical margin. There is a small amount of attached perinephric
fat. The renal tissue at the periphery grossly appears
unremarkable.

Block Summary:

Inking: capsule/blue, parenchyma/black, defect/yellow

Al — tumor in relationship to black inked parenchymal margin
A2—A3 — tumor and overlying capsule

A4 — edge of defect

A5—A6 — central tumor
