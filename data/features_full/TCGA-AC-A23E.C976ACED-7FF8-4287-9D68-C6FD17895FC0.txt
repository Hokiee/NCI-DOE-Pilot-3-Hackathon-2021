GROSS DESCRIPTION: “
The specimen is received in three containers labeled with
the patient‘s sname

A. ContainerA is additionally labeled 'right axillary

sentinel node’ and contains a 1. 5 cm yellow-tan f rm fatty
nodule consistent with possible lymph node. The nodule is
bisected and entirely submitted for frozen section with the
residual entirely resubmitted for permanent section in
cassette A labeled

B. Container B is additionally labeled 'right breast' and
contains a 1050.0 9. 22.0 x 18. 5 x 6 5 cm simple mastectomy
specimen partially surfaced by a 22. 5 x 12 5 cm portion of
pink-tan skin bearing a central 1. 5 x 1. 3 x 0 7 cm everted
nipple. Orientation is not offered or possible. Located 5 0

cm from the nipple is a 2.3 cm partially healed pink-tan
linear incision possibly consistent with previous biopsy

site. Additionally, three tan-brown granular lesions are
identiﬁed. Thesé'lesions range from 0.4 up to 1.0 cm in
greatest dimension and reside 3.0 to 6.0 from the nipple.
The deep margin is inked and the specimen is serially
sectioned to reveal a 3.8 x 3.5 x 2.6 cm gray‘white firm,

gritty mass surrounded by fibrosis. This mass resides 2.0 cm
below the skin's surface and approaches to within 2.3 cm of
the inked deep margin. The remainder of the cut surface is
comprised of predominantly yellow-tan adipose tissue admixed
with moderate amounts of interspersed gray—white cystic
fibrous tissue. No additional lesions are identiﬁed.
Representative sections are submitted in cassettes B1 - 11
labeled designated as follows: B1, nipple;

32, skin lesions; BS, inked deep margin. perpendicular; B4 -
BB. mass; 89 - B11, uninvolved tissue from each of the three
uninvolved quadrants. Additionally. a yellow and green
cassette are submitted for genomics research each labeled

U. container U is additionally labeled 'right axillary
sentinel node #2' and contains a 0.9 cm yellow-tan firm
fatty nodule consistent With possible lymph node. The
specimen is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette C
labelec‘
