Comment
The prostatic adenocarcinoma exhibits some degree of tumor cell shrinkage,
possibly from prior hormonal therapy. Please correlate clinically.

Interpretation performed by the Attending Pathologist and reviewed with the
Resident/Fellow, [] MD, PhD
Electronically Signed Out by [L MD

Clinical History:
Patient is a year-old male with bladder cancer who undergoes cystectomy with
ileo-conduit.

Specimens Received:

A: Right pelvic lymph nodes

B: Left pelvic lymph nodes

C: Prostate and bladder

D: Left distal ureter — suture on non-margin side
E: Right distal ureter - suture on non-margin side

Gross Description:

The specimens are received in ﬁve containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.

A. The ﬁrst container is additionally identiﬁed as, "1. Right pelvic lymph
nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 10 x 7.2 x 2 cm portion of
soft lobulated yellow-tan adipose tissue. The specimen is searched for lymph
nodes, and 16 candidates are identiﬁed ranging in size from 0.5 em up to 3.5 cm
in greatest dimension; All the lymph nodes are submitted as follows:

A1: 5 lymph nodes
A2: 4 lymph nodes
A3: 2 nodes

A4—5: 1 node bisected
A6-7: 1 node bisected

B. The second container is additionally identiﬁed as, "2. Left pelvic lymph
nodes". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 10 x 8.5 x 2.5 cm aggregate
of soft yellow-tan ﬁbroadipose tissue. The specimen is searched for lymph
nodes, and 26 candidates are identiﬁed ranging in size from 0.6 em up to 2.6 cm
in greatest dimension. All of the lymph nodes are submitted as follows:

B1-3: 6 nodes in each cassette

B4: 4 nodes ’

B5: 2 nodes

86-7: 1 node bisected in each cassette

C. The third container is additionally identiﬁed as, "3. Bladder and

prostate". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 554.8 g, 19.0 x 12.0 x 5.0
cm cystoprostatectomy specimen consisting of a 9.5 x 7.5 x 4.0 cm bladder with
attached mesenteric fat and a 5.5 x 4.0 x 3.8 cm prostate. The right seminal
vesicles measure 4.5 x 2.2 x 0.6 cm and right vas deferens measures 7.5 x 0.3
cm. The left seminal vesicles measures 4.5 x 1.8 x 0.7 cm and left vas deferens
measures 8.0 x 0.3 cm. The right ureteral stump measures3.0 x 0.7 cm, the leﬂ:
measures 2.5 x 0.5 cm, and both demonstrate intact, patent lumens. Two detached
segments of vas measuring 7.5 x 0.3 cm and 8.0 x 0.3 cm are found separately in
the same container as the main specimen.

The right half of the prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left half is

inked black. The bladder and prostate are opened anteriorly along the urethra.
The prostate is surrounded by a thin, intact membranous capsule and sectioning
demonstrates rubbery, pink-tan, peri-urethral nodularity with 0.9 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm
discrete indurations in the left lateral half. The prostatic apex is disrupted
along the posterior aspect. Approximately 50% of the prostate is submitted.

The opened bladder reveals a 7.5 x 5.5 cm indurated, hemorrhagic, edematous,
shaggy, mucosa with central ulceration measuring 4.5 x 4.0 cm located in the

posterior wall, right lateral wall and right anterior wall. On cut section, the

mass extends through the muscularis propria, and is 0.2 cm from the deep margin.
The greatest dimension of tumor extension to the margin is approximately 2.6 cm.
The urethral oriﬁces and trigone are spared. The surrounding bladder mucosa is
edematous, wrinkled, congested, pink-tan with a uniform 0.8 cm wall thickness.
Bilateral ureteral oriﬁces, adjacent to the trigone, are identiﬁed and probe

patent. Gross photographs are taken.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

C1: Left ureter resection margin

C2: Right ureter resection margin

C3: Urethral margin

C4-C6: Distal prostatic (apex)

C7-C8: Bladder mass/Ulceration, greatest invasion, tandem sections
C9-C10: Bladder mass/Ulceration, greatest invasion, tandem sections
C1 l-C13: Bladder mass/Ulceration,

C14: Uninvolved bladder mucosa bladder dome

C15: Uninvolved bladder mucosa anterior wall

C16: Uninvolved bladder mucosa posterior wall

C17: Additional section of Bladder mass/Ulceration,

C18-C25: Representative right lobe of prostate from apex to base
C26 C33: Representative left lobe of prostate submitted from apex to base
C34: Right bladder wall

C35: Left bladder wall

C36: Right vas deferens and seminal vesicle

C37 : Left vas deferens and seminal vesicle

D. The fourth container is additionally identiﬁed as, "4. Leﬁ distal ureter,

suture on non-margin side". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 1.7 cm in
length by 0.6 cm in external diameter pink-tan portion of tubular tissue with a
lumen consistent with ureter. One aspect is stitch indicating the non-margin
side.. The non~margin side is inked in black, and the true margin side is inked

in blue. Each side is shaved and submitted en face in D1.

E. The ﬁfth container is additionally identiﬁed as, "5. Right distal ureter,
suture on non-margin side".

Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 2.5 cm in length by 0.9 cm external
diameter pink-tan tubular structure with a lumen consistent with ureter. One
aspect has a stitch indicating the non-margin side. This aspect is inked in
black, and the true margin side is inked in blue. Each margin is shaved and
submitted en face and E1.
