DIAGNOSIS

FOCI OF “ANAPLASTIC MIXED GLIOMA" IN A BACKGROUND OF PREDOMINANTLY GRADE II
OLIGODENDROGLIOMA. SEE COMMENT.

COMMENT

Sections show a diffusely infiltrating glioma predominantly oligodendroglioma with uniform, round nuclei, perinuclear halos and
thin-walled capillaries in a chicken wire pattern. There are identifiable mitoses, up to 4/10 HPF in the oligodendroglioma areas
(slide 30) and focally vascular endothelial proliferation. Several sections (in particular 2A) show astrocytoma component with
mitotic activity (more than 2 mitotic figures).

Immunohistochemical stain results of GFAP shows variable positivity, IDH1 Is positive and MlB—1 shows overall average labeling of
approximately 5%.

Molecular testing for lp19q status was performed and is positive for co—deletion. See separate molecular pathology report.

1p36! 1q25 and 19q13/ 19p13

FISH Probes: 1p36, 1q25 and 19q13 19p13 Nuclei Scored: 50
Result: POSITIVE FOR 1p GENE DELETION

Total # signals/total # nuclei counted for 1p probe = 62
Total # signals/total # nuclei counted for 1q probe = 90

1p/1q = 0.69
POSITIVE FOR 19q GENE DELETION

Total # signals/total # nuclei counted for 19q probe = 60
Total # signals/total # nuclei counted for 19p probe = 97

19q/19p = 0.62

Background: The most prevalent genetic anomaly in both grade II and grade III oligodendrogliomas is co-deletion of
chromosome arms 1p and 19q 1. it was recently shown that the co-deletion of 1p and 19g is mediated by an
unbalanced translocation t(1;19)(q10;p10) 2. Loss of 1p and 19q has been used as a diagnostic as well as prognostic
marker of oligodendroglial tumors. Recent literature 2’3 suggests that oligodendrogliomas with loss of 1p and 19g are
likely more responsive to chemotherapeutic drugs/ radiation therapy, and such tumors may represent a "favorable"
form of oligodendrogliomas.

Method: The ' 1p36/ 1q25 and 19q/ 19p13 were applied to the provided paraffin-embedded tissue
sections. This probe set contains 1p36 and 1q25 ' in one vial. The other
set/vial contains 19q13 and 19p13 , The probe sets were applied

individually to treated tissue sections and then sections were viewed and interphase nuclei were examined for
corresponding signals.
