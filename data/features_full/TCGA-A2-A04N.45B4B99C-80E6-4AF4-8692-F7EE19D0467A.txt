SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Patient: , __ Specimen #:

FINAL DIAGNOSIS (continued):

** Report Electronically Signed Out **

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY:
—year—old white female with 2.5 cm right outer mid breast tumor. Fine
needle aspiration positive for atypical cells consistent with carcinoma.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:
A: RIGHT BREAST - INFILTRATING DUCTAL CARCINOMA

Results relayed to Dr. in person.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. WIDE LOCAL EXCISION RIGHT BREAST received fresh and consists of a piece
of fatty tissue measuring 9.0 x 8.0 x 3.0 cm. The specimen is oriented
with sutures by surgeon. Ink code: Red=medial lateral, blue=superior,
green=inferior, yellow=anterior, black=posterior. Sectioning reveals a
firm, tan, well—circumscribed mass, 1.7 cm in greatest dimension in the
mid portion of the specimen; the mass is located 0.8 cm from the deep
margin. A frozen section is prepared (block Al). There is a second
well-circumscribed, tan nodule, 0.7 cm in diameter, located 0.5 cm
superior anterior to the main mass. Sections harvested for breast
protocol include (1) mass, OCT embedded (2) mass, flash frozen, and

(3) grossly normal breast from the medial end of the specimen, flash
frozen (matching paraffin sections=A1 and A2, respectively). Additional
representative sections are submitted in sequential order from lateral to
medial in cassettes A3 through A12. First mass in cassettes A1, A5, A6,
A8, and the second mass in A7, A9, A10, and A11. 12CF

B. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE NUMBER ONE "NON-SENTINEL NODULE NUMBER ONE"
received in formalin and consists of two irregular fragments of tan soft
tissue with attached yellow adipose tissue measuring 2.0 and 1.7 cm in
greatest dimension. The fragments are bisected and submitted in their
entirety in two cassettes, one node per cassette. 2C4
