LYMPH—VASCULAR INVAS ION: Present

DERMAL—LYMPHATIC INVASION: Present

PATHOLOGIC STAGING: Primary Tumor: pTlc

Lymph Nodes: pNX

ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: Fibrocystic changes

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. In formalin labeled with the patient‘s name and "left breast skin biopsy" is a 3 x 0.8
x 1.5 cm wedge biopsy of brown skin and underlying fatty tissue. The specimen is bisected
lengthwise and totally submitted in blocks A1 and A2.

B. Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and "left breast lumpectomy. stitch
marks area of interest" is a 7 gram aggregate of fibroadipose tissue. The specimen
measures 6 x 5 x 2 cm. There is one portion which is sutured. and this portion measures
4 x 2 x 1.5 cm. On cross section. this portion shows an admixture of adipose tissue and
Streaky gray—white tissue possibly representing tumor. A section of this portion is
Submitted in blocks 81-33. Additional sections of the other fragments of tissue are
submitted in blocks Bd—BS.

C. Received fresh for frozen section labeled with the patient‘s name and ”left breast” are
several fragments of firm. fatty tissue which measure together 2.5 x 2 x 1 cm. A
representative portion of the firmer area is submitted in block C1 for frozen section. A
cytologic scrape prep is prepared for Diff-Quik stain. The complimentary tissue submitted
for frozen section is provided to the Tissue Bank coordinator. The remainder of the soft
tissue is submitted in block C2 for permanent section.

MICROSCDPIC DESCRIPTION:
E—cadherin stains on specimens B and C demonstrate that they are positive. Control block
stained appropriately.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
C. FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS. LEFT BREAST BIOPSY:
— MALIGNANT CONSISTENT WITH INVASIVE CARCINOMA. POSSIBLE PLEOMORPHIC LOBULAR
CARCINOMA
— TISSUE PROVIDED TO TISSUE BANK COORDTNNHOR
