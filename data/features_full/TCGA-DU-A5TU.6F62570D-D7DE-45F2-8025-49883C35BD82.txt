Comment ‘
The sections contain small fragments of a glioma that diffusely infiltrates the cerebral cortex, and has
some
microcystic change. There are not mitotic ﬁgures. There is some endothelial hyperplasia, but not
microvascular
cellular proliferation or tumor necrosis.
The features are those of a low histological grade glioma, with positive IDH 1, a low MlB-1 proliferation
index of 2%,
and a negative LOH (there is not codeletion of 1p, 19q), i.e. an astrocytoma, WHO grade 2.

Loss of Heterozygosity 1p, 19q Assay (LOH)
Date Ordered: Date Reported:
Interpretation
NEGATIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1p and chromosome arm 19q is NOT detected.

, Page 2 of 3
Informative loci are: D1 3552, 013468, 0131612, D1 3496, D193412, 0193606
Results-Comments
Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor parafﬁn block -A1. DNA
extracted from a corresponding
blood specimen was used as a normal reference control.
H and E stained sections were examined and no microdissection was needed to enrich tumor DNA.
TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)/ Tumor DNA
pairs using 3
markers at both 1 p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1p are 013548, D1 31 592, and 013552 (with 013468,
D131 612, and

013496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are 0193219, D193412, and PLAZG4C (with
0193606 and '

D1931182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a
minisatellite (26
nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and
ease of
interpretation. The backup markers are used if the ﬁrst line markers at that chromosome arm are
uninformative or
otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm
represents the
typical ﬁnding in oligodendrogliomas with 1p and 19q deletion.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand-alone diagnostic
test. This test
was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the
as required
by CLIA ' 88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for speciﬁc uses by the US. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These
results are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in the context of established
procedures
and/or diagnostic criteria.
TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in the sample may preclude the
detection of
allelic loss.
