SPECIMEN
A. Right colon and terminal ileum
B. Hernia sac, left inguinal
C. Omentum

CLINICAL NOTES

PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Right colon cancer.

CLINICAL HISTORY: Large cecal cancer, bilateral inguinal hernia
left

containing small bowel and sigmoid. Right containing appendix.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Received fresh for tissue procurement labeled "right
colon and terminal ileum" is a previously unopened 25 cm.
segment of proximal right colon with attached 20 cm. of distal
ileum
surfaced by smooth to scabrous tan pink serosa with a copious
amount
of attached mucin colon, mesentery and unremarkable omentum. An
appendix measuring 6.6 cm. in length which ranges from 0.7 cm.
proximally up to 1.5 cm. distally is present. A scant amount of
tan
white fibrinopurulent exudate appears to be present, adjacent to
the
distal tip. On sectioning, the lumen is pinpoint, surrounded by
unremarkable tan pink mucosa and no discrete transmural defect is
identified. The proximal and distal margins measure 4.0 and 5.8
cm.
in circumference respectively. On opening, there is a nearly
circumferential 10.0 x 7.8 cm. firm tan pink to papilliferous tan
red lesion present at and distal to the ileocecal valve. On
sectioning, the lesion has a maximal thickness of 3.4 cm. with
extension into the surrounding mesentery to within 0.5 cm. of the
inked free radial serosal surface. The colonic mucosa is otherwise
glistening tan pink with regular folds in the wall averaging 4 cm.
in thickness. Several additional purple tan pink to tan red
polypoid lesions measuring up to 1.2 cm. in greatest dimension are
present. The largest polyp is 7 cm. distal from the mass. The
ileal mucosa is unremarkable, glistening tan pink with regular
folds
and the wall averages 0.5 cm. in thickness. A portion of tumor and
portion of normal mucosa are submitted for tissue procurement as
requested. Multiple rubbery tan white to tan pink tissues in
keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 6 cm. in greatest
dimension. The four largest lymph nodes appear involved by
metastasis (representative sections only given). Representative
sections are submitted in eighteen blocks as labeled. RS—18.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Proximal and distal margins; 2—5 — tumor to inked

free radial serosal surface (cassette 4 and 5 contain bisected
single slice with point of continuity inked orange); 6 — tumor to
distal mucosa; 7—9 — additional colonic polyps (7 — one polyp, 7

distal from large tumor, 8 and 9 — two polyps per cassette); 10 —
random ileum and colon; 11 — proximal appendix and one—half of

bisected distal tip; 12 — remainder of bisected distal tip; 13 —

whole lymph nodes; 14 — five whole lymph nodes; 15 — four whole
lymph nodes; 16 — representative of two grossly positive lymph

in

"hernia left inguinal" is an 11 x 6.5 x 1.5 cm. pink—tan
fibromembranous saccular tissue with yellow lobular fat. The
specimen is sectioned to show no other discrete gross lesions
identified. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted

two cassettes. RS—2
C. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin

labeled

"omentum" is a 13 x 8 x 3 cm. piece of fatty tissue
consistent with omentum. The specimen is sectioned to show a yellow
lobular fatty cut surface which is grossly consistent with omental
fat. No discrete gross lesions are identified or palpated.
Representative se ions of the specimen are submitted in eight
cassettes. RS—8

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

A. Microscopic examination of the right colon and

terminal
ileum resection specimen reveals
Histologic type: Invasive adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified
Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated
Primary tumor (pT): Tumor originates in cecum and extensively

infiltrates through the wall of the cecum and is present on the
serosal surface/penetrates visceral peritoneum (pT4A)

Proximal margin: Negative for tumor

Distal margin: Negative for tumor

Circumferential (radial) margin: Not applicable.

Distance of tumor from closest margin: 20 cm. from proximal margin
Vascular invasion: Prominent lymphatic space invasion is present.
Regional lymph nodes (pN): Metastatic adenocarcinoma is present in

4 of 17 lymph nodes (pN2a)

Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: Present with prominent extranodal
tumor metastases adjacent to the appendix in the periappendiceal
fat
and adjacent to the large pericolonic lymph nodes.
Distant metastasis (pM): Cannot evaluate pr
Other findings: Five adenomatous polyps are present. Deep to the
largest adenomatous polyp which is 7 cm. distal from the large
primary tumor there is intracolonic metastasis with additional
adenocarcinoma present in the muscularis propria and in dilated
lymphatic spaces.

B. Microscopic examination reveals benign fibromembranous

tissue lined by mesothelium consistent with hernia sacs.
No tumor is identified within the hernia sac tissue.

C. Microscopic examination of the omentum reveals fatty

tissue. No metastatic tumor is identified in the omentum.

DIAGNOSIS
A. Right colon and terminal ileum, resection:
Invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the
cecum
invasive through the entire colonic wall through the visceral
peritoneum present on serosal surface (pT4a).
Much lymphatic space invasion present, intracolonic
metastasis
present 7 cm. distal to tumor.
Five additional adenomatous polyps present.
Metastatic adenocarcinoma present in 5 of 18 pericolonic
lymph
nodes (pN2a). Extranodal tumor present including
periappendiceal extranodal metastatic tumor.
Mucosal margins negative for tumor.
B. Hernia sac, left inguinal, resection:
Benign hernia sac tissue, no malignancy identified.
C. Omentum, excision:
Benign omental fat, no malignancy identified.
