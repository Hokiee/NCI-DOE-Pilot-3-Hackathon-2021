TISSUE DESCRIPTION:

3 A1 A2 Bl 32 BS 54 BS BS B? BB B9 310 Bil C1 D1 E1 E2
Left lobe of liver [1425.0 grams, 17.0 x 14.0 x 11.0 cm],
gallbladder (8.5 x 1.2 cm) and, separately submitted, common hepatic
artery, supra—duodenal and retro choledochal lymph nodes

DIAGNOSIS:

Liver, left lobe, partial hepatectomy: Grade_ 3 (of 4]
hepatocellular carcinoma 15 identified forming a single encapsulated
14. 0 x 10. 0 x 8.0 cm well— circumscribed tumor confined to the liver.
The margins of resection are negative for tumor (tumor free margin
is 3.0 cm]. Extra—tumoral vascular invasion is not identified. The
non—neoplastic liver will be evaluated and reported in an addendum.

Gallbladder, cholecystectomy: Acute and chronic serositis. No gall
stones are identified.

Lymph nodes, common hepatic artery and retro choledochal, excisions:
Multiple [2 common hepatic artery and 1 retro choledochal] lymph
. nodes are negative for tumor, both specimens.

Soft tissue, supra duodenal region, excision: Tissue submitted as
supra duodenal lymph node shows benign fibroadipose tissue. No
lymph node is identified.
