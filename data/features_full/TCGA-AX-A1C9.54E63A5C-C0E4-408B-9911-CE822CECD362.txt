C? Slide Key:

A] - Two nodes
A2 - One node, bisected
A3—4 - One node, bisected

Tissue "B" - A SO-gram, 5.5 x 4 x 3.5 cm. uterus and cervix has attached leﬁ adnexa and a separate right
adnexa. The serosa is smooth (inked black). The ecto- and endocervical mucosae are unremarkable. The
right anterior and posterior endometrium is involved by a papillary, bulky, friable tumor, 1.5 cm. from
the lower uterine segment. The anterior and posterior tumors average 2.3 x 2 x 1 cm. each. The tumor
seems to track along the isthmus. These tumor plaques appear to push into the underlying myometrium,
but unequivocal myometrial invasion is not seen. The remaining endometrium is ﬂat, except for a 0.7
cm., plaque—like nodule, possibly a subserosal ﬁbroid. The remaining myometrium has an additional 0.5
cm. ﬁbroid.

Clinical History:
Operation/Procedure: da Vinci hysterectomy/ Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy / Nodes / Biopsy
Gross: Tissue "A" - The 3 cm. piece of fat has 0.3-2.5 cm. lymph nodes submitted as follows:

Slide Key:

A1 - Two nodes

A2 - One node, bisected
A3-4 - One node, bisected

Tissue "B" - A SO-gram, 5.5 x 4 x 3.5 cm. uterus and cervix has attached left adnexa and a separate n'ght
adnexa. The serosa is smooth (inked black). The ecto— and endocervical mucosae are unremarkable. The
right anterior and posterior endometrium is involved by a papillary, bulky, friable tumor, 1.5 cm. from
the lower uterine segment. The anterior and posterior tumors average 2.3 x 2 x 1 cm. each. The tumor
seems to track along the isthmus. These tumor plaques appear to push into the underlying myometrium,
but unequivocal myometrial invasion is not seen. The remaining endometrium is flat, except for a 0.7
cm., plaque-like nodule, possibly a subserosal ﬁbroid. The remaining myometrium has an additional 0.5
cm. fibroid.

The right adnexa is 74 grams and includes a 6 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm. unilocular cyst with thin, clear colorless
ﬂuid. The inner lining is smooth. Normal ovarian parenchyma is identiﬁed. The right, 4.5 x 0.5 cm.
fallopian tube has scant delicate adhesions. The left, 1.7 x 1.3 x 0.7 cm. ovary has atrophic cut surfaces
and an adjacent 5 x 0.5 cm. fallopian tube with small paratubal cysts. Tissue is submitted from Parts B
and D for research as requested.

Regional Lymph Nodes: Twenty (20) regional lymph nodes all free of metastatic tumor
Venous/Lymphatic Invasion: Not identified

Comment: Tissue "B" - The vast bulk of this tumor exhibits the histology of a moderately well—
differentiated endometrioid—type adenocarcinoma. In a few small foci, however, this tumor exhibits
high~grade features which closely approach, but do not quite attain the histologic character of serous
carcinoma (Dr. . . Therefore, an unequivocal serous component is not identiﬁed in this
specimen.

Diagnoses:
Tissue "A" ~ Para-aortic lymph nodes - Three lymph nodes, all free of metastatic tumor.

Tissue "B": ‘
Uterus - Adenocarcinoma of endometrium, endometrioid type, Grade’II/III, with foci of superﬁcial
myometrial invasion (see comment).

Right ovary - Benign serous ovarian cyst.

Right fallopian tube - No diagnostic features.

 

Left ovary - No diagnostic features.
Left fallopian tube - No diagnostic features.

TiSSuc "C" - Right pelvic lymph nodes - Nine lymph nodes in adipose tissue, all free of metastatic
tumor.

Tissue "D" - Left pelvic lymph nodes - Eight lymph nodes in adipose tissue, all free of metastatic tumor.

Tissue "E" - Omental adipose tissue - No tumor present.
