Microscopic

Sections demonstrate a variably cellular glioma that diffusely infiltrates both the
gray and white matter. In the gray matter, perineural satellitosis, perivascular
satellitosis and subpial condensation are all seen. The tumor cells consistently
have round nuclei with mild to moderate atypia. Most have perinuclear halos.
Neither microvascular proliferation nor tumor necrosis are seen. As noted,
cellularity is variable, ranging from modest to nearly confluent. In these more
cellular areas, scattered mitoses are seen with iup to 4 mitoses per 10 high
power fields, although most areas show fewer.

Addendum

Scattered MlB-1 reactive cells are present throughout the tumor. In the most
proliferative region, a labeling index of 4.4% is calculated. This is evidence
against anaplastic progression. Nevertheless, the mildly elevated mitotic count
warrants close follow up.

Diagnosis

Low grade oligodendroglioma grade II
