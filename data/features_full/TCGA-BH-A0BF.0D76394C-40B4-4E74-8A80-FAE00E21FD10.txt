COMMENT:
Part 2: The above measurement of the micromeustatlc tumor Within the lymph node is made on the slide _ -_,. The
original frozen section slide was re-reviewed with Dr. ' " ' and there was no diagnostic changes Identiﬁed.

Part 3: lmmunohistochemical staining for e-cadherin/p120, support the ductal phenotype of the carcinoma in situ
