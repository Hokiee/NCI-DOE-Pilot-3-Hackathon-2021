Frozen Section Pathologist:, MD

Clinical History:

The patient is a —year-old female with stage 2

squamous cell carcinoma of the right lateral oral tongue. HPV
testing is requested.

Gross Description:

Specimen A is additionally labeled "right tongue medial margin"
and holds a 9 x 6 X 3 mm red/tan soft tissue fragment. The
specimen was completely submitted in block FSAl,

Specimen B is additionally labeled "right tongue lateral margin"
and holds a 6 x 3 x 2 mm red/tan soft tissue fragment. The
specimen is completely submitted in block FSBl,

Specimen C is additionally labeled "right tongue anterior
margin" and holds a 7 x 4 x 2 mm red/tan soft tissue fragment.
The specimen is completely submitted in block FSCl,

Specimen D is additionally labeled "right tongue posterior
margin" and holds a 6 x 3 x 2 mm red/tan soft tissue fragment.
The specimen is completely submitted in FSDl,

Specimen E is additionally labeled "right tongue anterior deep
margin" and holds a 10 x 6 x 3 mm red/tan soft tissue fragment.
The specimen is completely submitted in block FSEl,

Specimen F is additionally labeled "right tongue posterior deep
margin" and holds a 5 x 4 x 2 mm red/tan soft tissue fragment.
The specimen is completely submitted in block FSFl,

Specimen G is additionally labeled "right tongue suture
anterior" and is a 6.4 cm anterior to posterior x 2.5 cm medial
to lateral x 2.5 cm dorsal to ventral portion of oral tongue.
The base of the specimen is composed of cauterized
fibromuscular tissue. There is a 1.0 x 0.7 cm granular,
erythematous lesion on the lateral aspect of the tongue
extending to the right base of tongue. This lesion comes within
0.8 cm of the right lateral margin, 1.5 cm from the medial
mucosal margin, 3.8 cm from the tip anterior margin, and 1.7 cm
from the posterior margin. The specimen is inked as follows:
medial/blue, deep/black, posterior/green. Tissue is given to

from the ulcerated mucosal lesion. Sectioning
from anterior towards posterior reveals a 1.5 cm ill-defined
firm tan stellate mass beneath the previously described mucosal
ulceration. This mass comes within 0.3 cm of the blue inked
medial margin, 0.7 cm from the black inked deep margin, 3.2 cm
from the anterior tip and 1.7 cm from the posterior margin. The
surrounding soft tissue is composed of red/tan fibromuscular
tissue with no additional lesions noted.

Block Summary:

Inking: Medial/blue, deep/black, and posterior/green

G1 — Anterior tip and representative section from anterior half
of specimen

G2 — Anterior edge of tumor in relationship to closest blue
inked medial margin

G3-G4 — Additional sections of tumor in relationship to black
inked deep margin

G5 — Perpendicular section to green inked posterior margin
Oriented tissue remains in formalin

Specimen H is labeled "right cervical lymph node level 1A" and
is a 5.4 x 2.4 x 1.2 cm aggregate of cauterized yellow/tan
fibrofatty tissue, dissected for lymph node candidates. Lymph
node candidates up to 0.4 cm in greatest dimension are
identified.

Block Summary:
H1 — Three lymph node candidates
H2—H6 — Remainder of fat,

Specimen I is labeled "right cervical lymph node level 1B" and

is a 4. x 4.2 x 2.0 cm salivary gland with attached cauterized
fibrofarty tissue. Sectioning the salivary gland reveals a
lobulatec glandular architecture with no discrete mass or lesion
identified. The attached fat is dissected for lymph node
candidates up to 18 cm in greatest dimension are identified.

Block Summary:

Il — Representative section from salivary gland
I2 — Four lymph node candidates

I3 - One lymph node candidate, bisected (largest)
I4 — Remainder of fat

Salivary gland remains in formalin.

Specimen J is labeled "right cervical lymph node level 2" and is
a 3.6 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm aggregate of focally cauterized yellow/tan
fibrofatty tissue is dissected for lymph node candidates. Lymph

nodes up to 2.2 cm in greatest dimension are identified.

Block Summary:

J1 — Five lymph node candidates

J2 - One bisected lymph node candidate
J3 — One lymph node candidate, trisected
J4 — Remainder of fat,

Specimen K is labeled "right cervical lymph node level 3" and is
a 3.2 x 1.7 x 0.4 cm aggregate of cauterized yellow/tan
fibrofatty tissue is dissected for lymph node candidates. Lymph
nodes up 7n 0.6 cm in greatest dimension are identified.

Block Summary:

K1 — Five lymph node candidates
K2 - Five lymph node candidate
K3-K4 — Remainder of fat,
