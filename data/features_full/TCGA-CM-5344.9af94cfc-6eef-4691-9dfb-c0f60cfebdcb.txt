Gross Description:

1). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "total colectomy"" and consists
oi a segment of terminal ileum, cecum with attached appendix, ascending,
transverse, descending and sigmoid colon. The terminal ileum measures 12 cm
in length and 3.5 cm in circumference at the proximal resected margin. The
remaining colon measures 95.5 in length with a circumference o£ nine cm at
the distal resected margin. The attached appendix measures 8 cm in length
and averages 0.5 cm in diameter. The appendiceal and intestinal serosa is
pink tan and smooth. Focally hemorrhagic lobulated yellow tan adipose
tissue spans the length oi the specimen measuring up to 2.5 cm in thickness.
The specimen is opened to reveal a mass lesion measuring 3 cm in length and
4 cm in width. The mass is located in the sigmoid Colon. 85 cm from the
proximal margin and 7 cm from the distal margin. Sectioning shows that the
tumor invades the muscularis propria and possibly the serosa. The depth of
invasion is 0.3 cm grossly. The remaining mucosa shows two sessile polyp,
measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0 .3 and 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. The attached adipose
tissue is submitted for lymph node dissection and all identified lymph nodes
are submitted. The colon is extensively sampled with representative sections
submitted for permanent sections and for TFS.
