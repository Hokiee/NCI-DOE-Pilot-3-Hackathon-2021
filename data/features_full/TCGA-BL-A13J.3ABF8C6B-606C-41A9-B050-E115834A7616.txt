CLINICAL NOTES
CLINICAL HISTORY: Bladder cancer.
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Bladder cancer.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS

A) Ureter, right distal, excision — Inflammation with variable
epithelial atypia.
B) Ureter, left distal, excision - Inflammation with variable

epithelial atypia.
C) Lymph node, left pelvic, excision — Metastatic carcinoma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Received fresh for frozen section labelled "right

 

distal
ureter" is a segment of ureter that measures 0.4 x 0.4 x
0.3 cm in dimension. Tissue is entirely frozen.
B. Received fresh for frozen section labelled "left distal
ureter" is a segment of ureter that has a dilated lumen

and
measures 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm in dimension. Tissue is entirely
frozen.
C. Received fresh labelled "left pelvic lymph node" is an
irregular~shaped fragment of fibroadipose tissue that measures 3.5
x

1.5 X 1.2 cm in dimension. Within the tissue, a lymph node is
identified that measures 1.7 cm in dimension. The lymph node is

GROSS DESCRIPTION
entirely frozen as FSCl and FSCZ. ,A.u”-
D. Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin
labeled "bladder and prostate" is.a 21 x 10 x 6.5 cm
bladder and prostate, which is partially covered with abundant
yellow lobular fat. The bladder itself is approximately 8.5 x 7.8

x
6 cm and the prostate is approximately 35 grams, 4.5 x 3.5 x 3.2
cm.
The left ureter is approximately 5 cm x 0.7 cm and is markedly
dilated. The right ureter is approximately 4.5 x 0.5 cm. There
are

 

adhesions on the posterior aspect of the bladder wall in a 4 x 3.5

cm

cut

the

area. The right half of the specimen is inked blue and the left
posterior aspect of the specimen is inked black. The left anterior
aspect of the specimen is inked also blue. The specimen is opened
in a Y-shaped incision to show a friable area of tumor in the
posterior wall. There is also tumor present in the left lateral
wall. This entire area is 6.7 x 6.5 cm. This comes within 5.5 cm
of the prostatic urethral margin. There is also a tumor polyp
measuring 1 cm in the right anterior part of the wall, which is
located 7 cm from the prostatic urethra. The cut surface of the
polyp showed no discrete invasion through the wall; however, the

surface of the large tumor mass shows invasion through the left
lateral wall and through the posterior wall. This comes within 0.1
cm of the radial margin. No discrete tumor is grossly identified
within the left ureter; however, the ureter is markedly dilated up
to 0.7 cm in diameter. No lymph nodes are grossly identified in

surrounding fat. The seminal vesicles average 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm.
The vasa deferentia could not be grossly identified.
Representative sections of the specimen are submitted following
further fixation.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — apical bladder margin with prostatic urethral
margin en face; 2—3 - prostatic urethra, with full-thickness
prostate composite slice; 4 — bilateral ureteral margins and
representative seminal vesicles; 5 — representative anterior
bladder; 6 - representative dome of bladder to tumor,

full—thickness; 11—12 - left side full-thickness composite bladder
with ureteral orifice; 13 - possible representative left side vas
deferens within tumor and representative section of right-side
seminal vesicle; 14 — additional representative section of
full—thickness tumor to posterior wall; 15 - entire right—sided
polyp full—thickness; 16-22 — representative section of prostate as
follows: Block 1 — full-thickness composite; 17—18 — full—thickness
composite; 19—20 — full—thickness composite; 21-22 « full—thickness
composite. RS—22.

E. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin labeled

"right pelvic nodes" is a 4.5 x 3.2 x 2.0 cm aggregate of
yellow lobular fatty tissue. Lymph nodes are grossly identified
which range from 0.5 cm to 3.5 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph
nodes are entirely submitted as follows:
BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — three possible lymph nodes; 2 — one possible
lymph node bisected; 3—4 — one possible lymph node bisected,
one~half in each.

 

 

 

 

F. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin

labeled
"left pelvic lymph nodes" is 4.5 x 4.0 x 2.2. The
specimen
is palpated to identify multiple lymph nodes which range from 1.2
cm
to 7.5 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely
submitted as follows:
BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 ~ three possible lymph nodes; 2—5 — one possible
lymph node sectioned.
G. Received fresh, subsequently fixed in formalin
labeled

"appendix" is a 5.5 x 0.5 cm appendix which is partially covered
with pink—tan smooth glistening serosa and yellow lobular fat. The
specimen is sectioned to show an intact wall with an average
thickness of 0.3 cm. The lumen ranges from pinpoint to 0.2 cm. No
other discrete gross lesions are identified. The appendix is

GROSS DESCRIPTION
entirely submitted in two cassettes with the proximal end inked
(fat
and staples retained). AS-2.
H. Received fresh subsequently fixed in formalin labeled
"sigmoid colon" is a 14.5 cm. long portion of colon which
is opened at one end inked blue and the opposite end is stapled and
is inked black. The serosa of the specimen is pink tan, smooth and
~glistening and is partially covered with abundant yellow lobular

fat. There are a few adhesions on the specimen, however, no
hemorrhage or fibrinous exudate is grossly identified. The
specimen

is opened to show pink tan smooth glistening mucosa with an average
circumference of 4.5 cm. There is a 0.3 cm. sessile polyp which is
located on a fold, 4.5 cm. to the blue inked margin. A few
diverticula are grossly identified and show no gross evidence of
submucosal abscesses or perforation present. Representative
sections of the specimen are submitted as follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — representative luminal margins; 2 - sessile

polyp; 3 - representative normal; 4 through 8 — representative
sections of the remainder of the specimen including diverticula.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
3‘ Histologic type: Urothelial carcinoma.
Histologic grade: High grade
Associated epithelial lesions: Papillary urothelial carcinoma,
high

the

grade and carcinoma in situ.
Primary tumor (pT): Tumor invades through the full thickness of

wall into the adjacent adipose tissue and invades into prostatic
stroma from the prostatic urethra, pT4.

Margins of resection: Tumor extends to the soft tissue margin of
excision on the posterior surface of the bladder and is present at

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

pro

the prostatic urethral margin.
Regional lymph nodes (pN): 2 of 11 lymph nodes positive for
metastatic carcinoma (2/11), pN2.

Distant metastasis (pM): pr

Vascular invasion: Present.

Other findings: Perineural invasion by tumor is present. Tumor is
present surrounding the left side vas deferens. The prostatic

urethra shows changes of carcinoma in situ and invasive urothelial
carcinoma extending from glands into prostatic stroma. The

state“

shows glandular and stromal hyperplasia.

pos

associated inflammation.
B. Urethra, left distal, excision — Focal urothelial atypia with
associated inflammation.
C. Lymph node, left pelvic, excision — l lymph node positive for
metastatic urothelial carcinoma (1/1).
The size of the metastasis is 1.7 cm. in greatest dimension.
Extracapsular extension by tumor is identified.
D. Bladder and prostate, excision — Invasive poorly differentiated
urothelial carcinoma involving the bladder and prostatic urethra.
1 Tumor extends through the full thickness of the wall into the
adjacent soft tissue and is present at the posterior soft
tissue margin of excision.
Tumor extends to the prostatic urethral margin of excision.
Tumor is present within the prostatic urethra and invasive
urothelial carcinoma is present in prostatic stroma (see tumor
Characteristics in the prostatectomy template).
E. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, excision - l of 4 lymph nodes
itive

 

 

 

 

DIAGNOSIS

 

 

for metastatic carcinoma (1/4).
F. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, excision~ 6 lymph nodes negative for
metastatic carcinoma (0/6).
G. Appendix, appendectomy - No significant histopathologic
abnormality.
H. Colon, sigmoid, excision — Diverticulosis with diverticulitis
with focal changes consistent with chronic diverticulitis with
associated fibrosis in the pericolonic adipose tissue with
inflammation and reactive changes.
Adenomatous polyp.
The margins of excision do not show adenomatous change.
