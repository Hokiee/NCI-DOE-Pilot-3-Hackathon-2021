CLINICAL DATA: Tongue CA. Partial glossectomy.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: A) Received in formalin labeled " ", and designated "right partial
glossectomy, single stitch = anterior, double stitch = medial" is a 4.3 cm AP x 3.6 cm ML x 2.2
cm SI partial glossectomy specimen with a single long suture on one aspect and a double suture
at 90%. The single suture is arbitrarily designated 6 o'clock/anterior, and the double stitch is
arbitrarily designated 3 o'clock/medial. Gross photographs are taken. The mucosal aspect
measures 4.2 cm AP x 2.6 cm ML and is resected on an irregular plane on the lateral side.
Centrally located is a 1.6 x 0.9 x up to 0.8 cm deep ulcer, located grossly 0.4 cm from the lateral
mucosal resection margin at approximately 9 o'clock. The specimen is inked as follows: 12
o'clock to 3 o‘clock - black; 3 o'clock to 6 o'clock - red; 6 o'clock to 9 o'clock - blue; 9 o'clock to
12 o'clock - green. The specimen is sectioned from posterior to anterior and a 2.7 cm AP x 1.8
cm ML x approximately 1.2 cm SI, white, ﬁrm lesion is identiﬁed. The lesion comes to within
0.2 cm of the deep margin at approximately 9:30-10 o'clock. It comes to within 0.3 cm of the
blue mucosal margin at approximately 6:30-7 o‘clock, 0.5 cm of the red mucosal margin at
approximately 4 o’clock, 0.8 cm from the green mucosal margin at approximately 11 o'clock, and
is approximately 1 cm from the closest black mucosal margin; Cassette summary: Al - deepest
extent of tumor, complete cross-section; A2 - closest blue mucosal margin and closest red
mucosal margin; A3 - suspicious small nodule midline at approximately 3 o‘clock/9 o'clock; A4 -
closest green and closest black mucosal margin. B) The specimen was received fresh in the
frozen section room labeled with " ", is designated "frozen anterior", and consists of a 0.5 x 0.4
x 0.2 cm portion of white/pink soft tissue with a possible mucosal surface. The specimen is inked
blue and entirely submitted for intraoperative evaluation. The frozen section remnant is
submitted in its entirety in cassette B/C/DFSl. C) The specimen was received fresh in the frozen
section room labeled with " ", is designated "frozen lateral", and consists of a 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm
portion of white/pink soft tissue with a possible mucosal surface. The specimen is inked black
and entirely submitted for intraoperative evaluation. The frozen section remnant is submitted in
its entirety in cassette 8/ C/DF S 1. D) The specimen was received fresh in the frozen section room
labeled with " ", and is designated "frozen posterior", and consists of a 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm
portion of white/pink soft tissue with a possible mucosal surface. The specimen is inked red and
entirely submitted for intraoperative evaluation. The frozen section remnant is submitted in its
entirety in cassette B/C/DFS 1. E) The specimen was received fresh in the frozen section room
labeled with " ", is designated "frozen medial", and was received in two parts: the ﬁrst part
contained a scant fragment of tissue which appeared cauterized and would not survive
processing, so a second portion of tissue was submitted for part B. This tissue measures 0.6 x 0.4
x 0.4 cm, and has a white, verrucous appearing surface. The specimen is inked red and entirely
submitted for intraoperative evaluation. The frozen section remnant is submitted in its entirety in
cassette E/F/GF S 1. F) The specimen was received fresh in the frozen section room labeled with "
", is designated "frozen anterior deep", and consists of a 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm portion of skeletal
muscle. The specimen is inked black and entirely submitted for intraoperative evaluation. The
frozen section remnant is submitted in its entirety in cassette E/F/GFSl. G) The specimen was
received fresh in the frozen section room labeled with " ", is designated "frozen posterior deep",
and consists of a 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm portion of skeletal muscle. The specimen was inked blue and

entirely submitted for intraoperative evaluation. The frozen section remnant is submitted in its
entirety in cassette E/F/GFS l.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: BFS,CFS,DFS: All negative for carcinoma
EFS,FFS,GFS: All negative for carcinoma

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

A) Tongue, right, partial glossectomy: Moderately to poorly-differentiated, invasive squamous
cell carcinoma, with the following features:

 

1. Size: 1.6 cm

2. Depth of invasion: 1.2 cm

3. Arising in a background of high- grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (carcinoma in—situ).
4. Lymphovascular invasion is not identiﬁed.

5. Margins: Invasive carcinoma extends no closer than 0.3 cm to the deep aspect of the posterior
lateral margin, 0.4 cm to the deep aspect of the anterior medial margin, and 0.5 cm to the anterior
lateral mucosal margin. All margins are free of in-situ carcinoma.

6. Minimum pathologic stage: pTl NX MX (AJ CC, 6th edition, 2002).

B-G) Tongue, anterior, lateral, posterior, medial, anterior deep, posterior deep, biopsies: No in-
situ or invasive carcinoma identiﬁed.

Procedures used to establish the diagnosis: Routine
