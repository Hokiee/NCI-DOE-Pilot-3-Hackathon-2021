PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:
SPECIMEN DESIGNATED "LEFT KIDNEY, NEPHRECTOMY":

POORLY DIFFERENTIATED MONOPHASIC SYNOVIAL SARCOMA (3.2 cm) involving
kidney.

Mitoses number up to 50 per 10 HPF.

No necrosis identified.

Focal lymphovascular invasion is present.

Ureter, artery, vein, and soft tissue margins are negative for tumor.

Tumor is 0.7 cm from the closest soft tissue margin.

NOTE: The non—neoplastic kidney will be evaluated by Renal Pathology, and the
findings will be reported in an addendum.

CLINICAL DATA:

History: History of desmoid tumors. Now with synovial sarcoma L kidney.
Operation: Resection L retroperitoneal mass, left nephrectomy.
Operative Findings: Not provided.

Clinical Diagnosis: Left retroperitoneal sarcoma.

TISSUE SUBMITTED:
A/l) left kidney (tissue bank).

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received fresh, labeled with the patient's name, unit number,
and "left'kidney", and consists of a 189—gram left nephrectomy specimen
including kidney (12.2 x 6.2 x 4.4 cm) with minimal surrounding attached
perirenal fat measuring up to 2.0 cm in thickness. Extending from the renal
pelvis, is a ureter (7.0 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter), renal vein (1.2 cm
in length x 0.7 cm in diameter) and renal artery (1.6 cm in length x 0.6 cm in
diameter). There is no adrenal gland grossly identified. The perirenal fat
and capsule are inked black. In the mid to lower pole of the kidney, there is
a tan/pink focally hemorrhagic soft friable slightly mucinous interpolar mass
(3.2 x 2.7 x 2.3 cm) that is located 2.1 cm to the artery, 3.0 cm to the vein
and 5.8 cm to the ureter. No vascular invasion is identified. The mass is
located in the cortex and abuts the renal pelvis and is located 0.2 cm to the
inked fatty margin. The mass abuts an area of hemorrhage and the lower pole
(2.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm). There are two smooth lined cystic areas immediately
adjacent to the mass, measuring up to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The
remainder of the renal cortex is tan/red with a mildly effaced corticomedullary
junction. The papillae are mildly blunted and the average cortical thickness
is 1.0 cm. No calculi are seen. The adipose tissue in the hilar region is
thinly sectioned and palpated and no lymph nodes are identified. Focal
portions of the perirenal fat of the cortical surface retracted during the
fixing process. Representative sections of the tumor are submitted for
cytogenetics, electron microscopy, quick fix, and tissue bank. Representative
sections of normal kidney are submitted for tissue bank, electron microscopy,
and immunofluorescence. Also received with the specimen is a portion of
tan/yellow lobulated fatty tissue, which is unoriented, measures 3.2 x 2.2 x
1.3 cm, and is representatively submitted for histological examination. GrOss
photographs of the specimen are taken.

ADDENDUM:
RENAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION OF THE KIDNEY PARENCHYMA:
LEFT KIDNEY (RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY):

IgA NEPHROPATHY, MILD (SEE NOTE)

MODERATE CHRONIC CHANGES OF THE KIDNEY, INCLUDING:
‘ FOCAL GLOBAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS (14% OF GLOMERULI)
- FOCAL TUBULAR ATROPHY AND INTERSTITIAL FIBROSIS (10% OF THE PARENCHYMA)

— ARTERIAL AND ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS, MODERATELY SEVERE (SEE NOTE)

NOTE:

This nephrectomy specimen shows moderate chronic changes of the parenchyma, as
detailed above. The biopsy also reveals sparse granular deposits of IgA/IgM in
the mesangium, most suggestive of a mild form of IgA nephropathy; there are no
signs of a currently active glomerulitis. The chronic changes may be related to
a moderate degree of vascular sclerosis; a potential contribution of the IgA
nephropathy to the chronic changes is probably minimal.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:

Sections of formalin—fixed, paraffin—embedded tissue (block A9) were evaluated
using HaE, PAS, anes' silver methenamine, and AFOG (trichrome) stains by light
microscopy. An HaE-stained frozen section and semi~thin toluidine blue—stained
section were also evaluated by light microscopy.

The sample consists of cortex and medulla. There are two hundred nine (209)
glomeruli present, of which thirty (30) (14%) show signs of hypoperfusion or
global or segmental glomerulosclerosis. The remaining glomeruli reveal a small
tuft, open capillaries, and frequent wrinkling of the basement membranes. The
mesangium is mildly expanded but does not have significant hypercellularity.
Signs of active inflammation, fibrinoid necrosis of the tuft, or crescent
formation are not evident. On PAS and Jones' silver stain, the glomerular
basement membranes appear irregular in thickness but without discernible
"spikes"; few loops reveal distinctive double contours. Tubules reveal mild
patchy atrophy and few contain PAS-positive casts. The interstitium is focally
expanded by connective tissue and mild focal mononuclear inflammation with two

discrete perivascular lymphoid aggregates with germinal centers. Approximately
10% of the sample shows tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, as evidenced
on the trichrome stains (AFOG). Arteries show moderate changes in the wall,
with duplication of the cells and matrix layers of the media and subintimal
accumulation of connective tissue; these changes have resulted in irregular
narrowing of the lumina. Arterioles reveal sclerosis of the media, and focal
hyperplasia of the cells in this layer. There are interstitial calcium
phosphate crystals in the renal papilla.

IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY REPORT

KIDNEY BIOPSY

The sections were incubated with antibodies specific for the heavy chains of
IgG, IgA, and IgM, for kappa light chains, lambda light chains, C3. Clq,
albumin, and fibrin—related antigens.

The sample consists of kidney cortex and outer medulla. There are twenty-two
(22) glomeruli present. One (1) glomerulus is globally sclerosed. There is
diffuse granular deposition of C3 (trace), IgM (1+/4+), and IgA (1+/4+, lambda
stronger than kappa) along the peripheral capillary walls and in the mesangial
areas; Clq is negative. Fibrin deposits (l+/4+) are present segmentally within
the glomerular tufts and in Bowman's space in one (1) glomerulus. Isolated
glomerular epithelial cells in three (3) glomeruli contain protein reabsorption
granules (albumin, IgG, IgA, C3). Several casts in the distal tubules are
reactive for polyclonal IgA. The interstitium reveals scattered fibrin
deposits. Coarse IgM and C3 deposits (1+/4+) are present in the walls of
several arterioles. Arterioles show focal C3 reactivity. There is no
difference noted in the intensity of the staining for kappa and lambda light
chains in the casts or in the background of the tissue.

ELECTRON MICROSCODV DunnnT
KIDNEY BIOPSY
BlOCkS: 4; blocks examined: 4 thick sections; 1 thin section,

The tissue examined at the ultrastructural level includes two (2) glomeruli.
Few capillary loops appear collapsed with wrinkling of the basement membrane
(hypoperfusion). There is only minimal focal effacement of visceral epithelial
cell foot processes. The basement membranes appear of normal thickness. There
are no electron dense deposits present along the peripheral capillary loops.
The mesangium is expanded by matrix and increased cell projections. There are
few small and often illwdefined electron dense deposits present in the
mesangial areas. Several arteries were also examined. They reveal mild

distortion of the vessel wall, with fine-granular material between the cellular
and matrix components of the media.
