(A) RIGHT MID JUGULAR LYMPH NODE - A single possible lymph node measuring 0.7 cm in its greatest dimension.
Entirely submitted in cassette A.
(B) RIGHT SUPERIOR PARATHYROID LYMPH NODE - A single fragment of ﬁbrofatty tissue measuring 0.8 cm in its
greatest dimension. Entirely submitted in cassette 8.
(C) RIGHT MEDIASTINAL CONTENTS - Three fragments or norofatty tissue measuring in aggregate I x 1 x 0.8 cm. Entirely
submitted in cassette C. .
(D) DELPHIAN NODE — A single possible lymph node with attached fatty tissue measuring 1 x, 0.8 x 0.4 cm. Entirely
submitted in D.
(E) PORTION OF LEFT SUPERIOR PARATHYROID GLAND —- A (0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm) pink-tan soft tissue fragment. Entirely
submitted for frozen section diagnosis in E.

‘FSIDX: PARATHYROID TISSUE PRESENT.
(F) LEFT NECK CONTENTS -— A single fragment of fibrofatty tissue measuring 6.5 x 3 x 1 cm. Dissection reveals multiple
possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 up to 0.7 cm in their greatest dimension. Possible lymph nodes are entirely submitted.

SECTION CODE: F1, five possible lymph nodes; F2, ﬁve possible lymph nodes; F3, ﬁve possible nodes.
(G) RIGHT PARATRACl—IEAL AND MEDIASTlNAL CONTENTS — A single fragment of ﬁbrofatty tissue measuring 5.5 x 2 x
1.0 cm. Dissection reveals multiple possible lymph nodes, ranging from 0.4 up to 1.1 cm in their greatest dimension.
Possible lymph nodes are entirely submitted.

SECTION CODE: G1, six possible lymph nodes; (52, five possible lymph nodes; GS, one sectioned possible lvmoh
node; G4, one sectioned possible lymph node; GS, one lymph node; GS, one lymph node; G7, one lymph node.
(H) TOTAL THYROIDECTOMY AND LEFT PARATRACHEAL MEDIASTINAL CONTENTS - A total thyroidectomy with
anterior strap muscles covering the anterior portion of specimen (6 x 6 x 2 cm). The thyroid shows nodular changes
suggestive of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. The right lobe has diffuse changes of thyroiditis. Within the isthmus, a superior
nodule is ﬁrm, tan, extending and focally adherent to the skeletal muscle and extending into the left thyroid lobe (2 x 1.6 x 1.5
cm). The left lobe also shows nodular changes, suggestive of ihyroiditis with a slightly ﬁrmer and inferior nodule (1.5 x 1 x 0.5
cm). Within the surrounding ﬁbroadipose tissue, possible lymph nodes are identified.

SECTION CODE: H1, H2, sections of right thigh superior to interior, H3, H4, tumor at isthmus with attached soft
tissue; H5, H6, superior left thyroid and adjacent isthmus nodule; H7, inferior left thyroid; H8, a separate nodule submitted
with specimen, bisected; H9, additional possible lymph nodes: H10, additional adipose tissue.

CLINICAL HiSTORY
