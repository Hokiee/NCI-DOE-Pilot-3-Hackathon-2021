I. SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

   

Gross Description;

The specimens are received' In eight lormalin- tilled containers, each labele ilrst container is
labeled pelvic tumor. F81. " ltcontalns a pink—tan friable portion of tissue cm The surface‘ :5
irregular and slightly papillary in nature, Serially sectioned to show homogeneous. tan, fleshy material Also. there IS a
white plastic cassette labeled "F81. which contains a pink-tan fragment oi tissue measuring 1. 7 x 1. 4 x 0 3 cm
Labeled A1 (F81); A2, A3 - representative sections. Jar 1.

The second container is labeled ”right tube and ovary." It contains a pink-tan tuba-ovarian complex measuring 7.1 x
4.5 x 3.2 cm. and a separate fragment oi pink-purple tissue measuring 2.7 x 2.5 x 1.6 cm. The fallopian tube measures
7.0 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm. The surface contains irregular pink~maroon papillary tissue on approximately half of the serosal
surface. The associated pink-tan ovary measures 3.7 x 2.4 x 2.2 cm. The entire surface is covered by pink-tan
papillary tissue. The ovary is serially sectioned to show a orange-red corpus luteum measuring 1.1 cm. The remaining
ovarian parenchyma is partially composed oi the pink-tan tissue. which is covering the surface. The fallopian tube is
serially sectioned to show a lumen that is partially filled b red-tan papillary projections. Labeled Bl to BS -
representative sections of the fallopian tube and ovary.

The third container is labeled ‘left tube and ovary.‘ it contains a maroon—pink tubo-ovarian complex measuring 7.5 x
4.6 x 4.0 cm. The surface of the entire tissue is covered by pink—tan papillary projections. The different components of
the specimen are hard to discern but the area thought to represent the fallopian tube measures 6.0 x 1.6 x 1.1 cm.
Upon sectioning. there Is a pinpoint lumen. The surface. as stated before. is covered with the pink-tan papillary
projections. The area of the ovary measures 3.2 x 2.5 x 2.3 cm. Cut sections of the ovary show an orange-maroon
corius luteum measuring 1.1 cm. Labeled Ci - fallopian tube; 02. 03 - ovary; C4 to CB - remainder of fallopian tube.

The fourth container is labeled "uterus and cervix." it contains a 90 gram pearwshaped uterus measuring 9.3 x 6.9 x 5.1
cm. The serosal surface of the uterus ls slightly rough with pink-tan papillary tissue on the anterior surlace just above
the peritoneal reflection. The ectocervix is pink-white and measures 3.4 x 3.0 cm with an oval os measuring 0.2 cm.
The uterus is bisected to show an unremarkable endometrial cavity. measuring 5.0 x 1.3 cm. The endocervix
measures 3.0 x 1.1 cm. The uterus is serially sectioned to show a 0.8 cm circumscribed area of white trabecuiation in
the posterior myometrium. The myometrium contains no other gross lesions. Labeled Dl - anterior cervix; D2 —
posterior cervix; D3, D4 -.anterior endomyometrium; DS, {)6 - posterior endomyomelrium including lesion in DB. -

The fifth container is labeled “cul de sac tumor.“ It contains multiple pink—tan Iragments of '

measuring 5.0 x 4.0 x 2.2 cm. Most of the tissue is composed of pink-tan papillary tissue.

The sixth container is labeled “appendix.“ It contains a red-tan vermiform appendix with periappendiceai soft tissue,
measuring 5.6 x 2.6 x 1.6 cm. The majority of the surface of the appendix and the periappendiceal soft tissue is

smooth and glistening. There is a 0.5 x 0.4 cm area oi at h l ular tissue. The appendix is serially sectioned to
show a pinpoint lumen with no gross lesions.

The seventh container rs labeled "omentum. " it contains multiple pink-yellow fragments of adipose tissue, aggregately
measuring 27 x 14 x 6. 5 cm. The surface of the omentum contains multiple areas of pink- -tan papillary tissue.
Sectioning the adipose tissue shows diffuse infiltration by the pink- -tan papillary tumor.

The eighth container is labeled ’perihepaticW multiple fragments of pink-tan papillary tissue,

aggregately measuring 5.7 x 5.0 x 1.4 cm.

SYNOPTIC REPORTING FORM FOR MALIGNANT OVARIAN NEOPLASMS

 

HISTOPATHOLOGIC TYPE
The histologic diagnosis is serous adenocarclnoma

TUMOR LOCATION
The the primary tumors are the right and left ovary (synchronous primary tumors)

Page 3 of 4

 

 

    

The histologic grade is poorly differentiate-

TUMOR INVASION
Tumor is identified on the ovarian surface(s)
Tumor does invade the adjacent fallopian tube/peritubal soit tissue

TUMOR iNVOLVEMENT

Tumor involvement of the pelvic peritoneum/soft tissue is present
Metastatic involvement of the extrapelvic peritoneum is present
Metastatic involvement of the omentum is present

TUMOR SIZE
The maximum dimension of tumor implants outside the true pelvis is greater than or equal to 2 cm

PRIMARY TUMOR (1)
Based on the above information. the primary tumor is classified as macrosco ic eritoneal metastasis beyond pelvis
more than 2 cm in greatest dimension or regional lymph node metastasis &

 
   
    

REGIONAL LYMPH NODES (N)
The regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed

DISTANT METASTASIS (M)
The status of distant tumor site cannot be assessed

  

The pathologic stage assigned here should be regarded as provisional. and may change after integration oi clinical
data not provided with this specimen.
