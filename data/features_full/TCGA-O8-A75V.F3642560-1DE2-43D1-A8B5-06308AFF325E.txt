PROCEDURE
Robotic assisted liver resection

HISTORY
Hepatocellular carcinoma

GROSS
Received in formalin, labeled "liver resection," is a 4 x 3.5 x
2 cm, lO—gram irregular—shaped portion of liver. It has previously
been incised. The surface is partly smooth and mostly roughened.
The surgeon has marked the superficial with yellow ink, the deep
with red ink, the medial with orange ink, and the lateral with black
ink. Ink has spilled into the area where it has been previously
incised. Cut section shows a 2.4 x 2.2 x 2 cm tan circumscribed
mass. The mass is 0.1 cm to the yellow margin, 0.1 cm or less to
the red inked deep margin, 0.2 cm to the orange inked medial margin,
and 0.1 cm or less to the black inked lateral margin. The unvinolved
liver is tan.. Submitted entirely in 10 cassettes. ’

Tissue is submitted for the TCGA research study per protocol.
Total time in 10% neutral buffered formalin from collection through
processing: 21 hours. Total cold ischemia time:

HISTOLOGIC TYPE AND GRADE: HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, TRABECULAR
PATTERN,

GRADE II.

TUMOR EXTENSION: TUMOR IS CONFINED TO THE LIVER.

LYMPH-VASCULAR INVASION: NOT IDENTIFIED.

PERINEURAL INVASION: NOT IDENTIFIED.

MARGINS: THIS IS A LARGELY ENCAPSULATED TUMOR WITH THE TUMOR MARGIN

DEFINED

BY NARROW BAND OF DESMOPLASTIC FIBROUS STROMA. ALL MARGINS ARE
NEGATIVE WITH

THE EXCEPTION THAT THE POSTERIOR MARGIN IS INDETERMINATE DUE TO
ENCROACHMENT

OF THIS MARGIN AFTER EXCISION OF THE TUMOR.

ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: TUMOR IS PRESENT ON A BACKGROUND OF
