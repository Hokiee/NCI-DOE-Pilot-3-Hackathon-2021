Four lymph nodes negative for carcinoma (0/4).

E. Bladder and prostate, cystectomy and prostatectomy:

Bladder: Urothelial carcinoma, high—grade (grade 3/3),
status post biopsy, at least 2.9 cm in greatest dimension, with
invasion into the superficial half of the muscularis propria and
invasion of the prostatic glands and stroma, negative for
lymphovascular invasion. Surgical margins free of involvement.
Focal adjacent carcinoma in situ. This tumor corresponds to an AJCC
pathologic stage grouping pT4a, NO. Biorepository sample positive
for invasive carcinoma.

Prostate: Focal high—grade prostatic intraepithelial
neoplasia. Seminal vesicles negative for malignancy.

PRELIMINARY INTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Intraoperative Pathologist(s):
A. Right ureter, frozen section diagnosis: Negative for carcinoma.

B. Right pelvic nodes, frozen section diagnosis:
.Bl—B5, ten apparent lymph nodes, cannot identify metastases.

C. Left distal ureter, frozen section diagnosis: Negative for
carcinoma.
D. Left pelvic nodes, frozen section diagnosis:
D1—D3, eight lymph nodes, negative for carcinoma.
E. Bladder and prostate, frozen section diagnosis: Distal urethral
margin negative for carcinoma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled and "right ureter" is
a single cylindrical, pink—tan portion of tissue 0.5 x 0.4 cm.
Entirely submitted following frozen section in one cassette labeled

." , Al.

B. Received fresh labeled and "right pelvic
nodes" is a portion of fibrofatty tissue containing ten lymph nodes
that are from 0.4 cm to 1.8 cm in maximum dimension. Entirely
submitted following frozen section in five cassettes labeled
, Bl-BS. B1) Three nodes; 82) one node serially sectioned;
B3) one node serially sectioned; B4) two nodes, one bisected after
inking; B5) three nodes.

C. Received fresh labeled and "left distal
ureter" is a cylindrical portion of tissue 0.5 x 0.4 cm partially
surrounded by fat. Submitted following frozen section in one
cassette labeled - Cl.

D. Received fresh labeled and "left pelvic
nodes" is a portion of fat containing eleven possible lymph nodes
from 0.2 cm to 1.5 cm. Submitted in six cassettes labeled
D1—D6. D1) Frozen section of serially sectioned node; D2) frozen
section of two nodes; D3) frozen section of a single bisected node;
D4) three additional nodes; 05) two additional nodes; D6) two
additional nodes.

E. Received fresh labeled and "bladder and
prostate" is a radical cystoprostatectomy specimen, 12 x 8.5 x 6 cm.
The bladder has a prominent ulceration involving the right lateral
and anterior aspect, including the right trigone. This ulceration is
up to 2.5 x 2 cm with underlying indurated gray-white tumor tissue.
There is apparent tumor extending into the wall but not grossly
definitively into the perivesicular fat. A second area of prominent
ulceration is present on the right side of the prostatic urothelial
surface. The remaining bladder mucosa is edematous with no
additional mass or ulcer. The prostate is grossly involved by
granular, indurated, gray—white tumor encircling the prostatic
urethra, predominantly on the right side. The left side of the
prostate is inked black, the right side blue. No nodules are
identified within the attached perivesicular fat. Sampled in

twenty—two cassettes labeled El—E22. Summary of sections:
E1) Frozen section distal urethral margin; E2—E5) tumor right
bladder wall; E6) right ureteral orifice; E7) left ureteral orifice;
E8) left lateral bladder; E9) bladder dome; E10) posterior bladder;
E11) mirror image of biorespitory samples, IRE # . E12) left
prostate apical margin; E13) right prostate apical margin; E14) left
apical prostate; E15) right apical prostate; E16) left midprostate;
E17) right midprostate; E18) left base; E19) right base; E20) left
seminal vesicle; E21) right seminal vesicle; E22) tumor underlying
right side of proximal prostatic urethra.
