CLINICAL HISTORY:
Pelvic mass.

 

GROSS EXAMINATION: .

A. "Right fallopian tube and ovary", received fresh for frozen section is a
partially disrupted 10 x 3 x 3 cm, 337 gram ovary. The serosa demonstrates
numerous fibrinous adhesions. The opened ovary is covered with tan-yellow
papillary tumor. There is no normal ovarian architecture identified. Attached
to the ovary is an 8.0 cm long fallopian tube with an average diameter of 0.5
cm. The fallopian tube does not grossly appear to be involved by tumor.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

BbOCK SUMMARY:

Al— frozen section remnant.

A2~ fallopian tube.

A3-A4- representative sections of tumor and overlying serosa.

A5—A6u representative sections of fibrillary tumor projecting into lumen of

ovary.

B. "Left fallopian tube and ovary". Received in formalin is a 52.4 gram,
specimen consists of a 4.0 x 3.0 x'2.5 cm ovary with an attached 6.0-cm long
fallopian tube with an average diameter of 0.5 cm. Contiguous with the ovary
is a multiloculated cyst. The cyst wall thickness varies from 0.1 cm to 0.5 cm
and lacks papillary excrescences. The cut surface of the ovary is tan—white,
whorled fibrous tissue. -

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Bl- ovary. -

32— thick wall of multiloculated cyst and additional cyst wall.
B3- fallopian tube.

B4- additional sections of ovary. .

C. "Uterus and cervix". Received in formalin that is a 109.5 gram, 10.5 x 6.5
x 4.0 cm uterus with a 3.0 cm cervix that demonstrates a 0.6 cm cervical 05.
The uterus is opened longitudinally and demonstrates a 4.0 cm in diameter
intramural whorled nodule grossly consistent with leiomyoma. There are two -
additional nodules consistent with leiomyomata projecting from the fundus {1.5
cm and 2.0 cm in diameter). The myometrium has a uniform thickness of 2.0 cm.
The endometrium is 0.2 cm thick. The trabeculated endocervical canal and
smooth, pink ectocervix demonstrates no gross abnormalities. The serosa is
smooth, tan—pink and glistening.

BLOCK 30mm;

Cl- anterior endocervix.

€2- posterior endooervix.

03- largest leiomyoma.

C4~ anterior endomyometrium.
C5- posterior endomyometrium.

D. "Left pelvic side wall". Received in formalin is a 5.0 x 4.0 x 0.2 cm
specimen of fibroadipose tissue entirely submitted in block D1.

E. "Posterior cul de sac". Received in formalin is a 5.0 x 4.0 x 0.5 cm
specimen of fibroadipose tissue that demonstrates a 1.0 cm tan nodule. The
tissue is sectioned and entirely submitted in blocks El—EZ.

F. "Omentum". Received in formalin are multiple sections of omentum with an
aggregate measurement of 15.0 x 14.0 x 0.4 cm. There are no focal lesions,
' ' ' ' ' ' Fl.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
A. "Right fallopian tube and ovary“: AFl— carcinoma consistent with serous

carcinoma

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL FINDINGS:

Sections from the paraffin block are cut at 4—5 micrometers, placed on
poaitively—charged glass slides, deparaffinized in organic solvents, treated
with methanolic H202 to quench endogenous peroxidase activity, and rehydrated.
Sections are treated with primary antibodies to detect the antigen(s} in 7
question, or with non—immune rabbit immunoglobulin(s) or mouse isotypefs} as a
negative control; appropriate positive tissue controls are also tested.
Sections are sequentially reacted with biotinylated secondary antibody and
with streptavidin or avidin—biotin—complex labeled with horseradish
-peroxidase. Immunoreactivity is visualized using diaminobenzidine as the
chromogen. Counterstaining is performed. The results are as follows:

Tumor cells in the left and right ovary have the following immunoprofile:

CA—125, EMA — positive
Calretinin, inhibin — negative.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. "RIGHT OVARY AND FALLOPIAN TUBE" {SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY):

TYPE: SEROUS ADENOCARCINOMA

FIGO GRADE: 2 (MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED
TUMOR SIZE: 10 X 3 X 3 CM.

WEIGHT: 337 BEAMS

SEROSA: UNINVOLVED.

PATH STAGING: 2B FIGO. SEE NOTE.
EALLOPIAN TUBE, NO PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS.

NOTE: Information on atholo sta in and the o erative probedure is being
transmitted to this “a required for
accreditation purposes y e Pathology staging is based

solely upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not
incorporate information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology
section, past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Anatomic pathology staging is only a component to be considered in
determining the clinical stage, but should not be confused with nor
substituted for it. The exact operative procedure is available in the
surgeon's operative report.

B. "LEFT OVARY AND FALLORIAN TUBE" (SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY):

OVARY WITH SEROUS CARCINOMA, 1.5 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION AND LEIOMYOMA
FALLOPIAN TUBE WITH PREDOMINANTLY MUCOSAL CHANGES OF SEROUS CARCINOMA.

C. "UTERUS" (HYSTERECTOMY):

ENDOMETRIUM: PROLIFERATIVE.
MYOMETRIUM: LEIOMYOMATA.

CERVIX: NO PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS.
SEROSA: NO PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS.

D. "LEFT PELVIC SIDEWALL" (BIOPSY):
