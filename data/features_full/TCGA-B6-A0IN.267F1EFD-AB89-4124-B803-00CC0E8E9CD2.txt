GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. “Reexcision right lateral breast, long suture lateral, short suture
superior", received fresh and placed in formalin. The specimen is a 10 x 5.5 x
3 cm predominantly fatty tissue specimen with a 6 x 1 cm skin ellipse with a
well healed central linear scar. The specimen is inked blue anteriorly, black
posteriorly, and red superiorly in accordance with the short and long sutures.
The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 2 x 2.2 x 0.7 cm indurated
white fibrotic area most consistent with biopsy cavity with additional
fibrofatty tissue and no abdominal masses is present. The area containing the
biopsy cavity is submitted in toto in Blocks Al—AB. Additional medial tissue
is submitted in Blocks A9-A10 (please refer to l for specific location in
biopsy).

B. "Right breast biopsy, long suture lateral, short suture superior", received
fresh and placed in formalin. The specimen is 72.4 gram, 8.5 x 6.2 x 2.5 cm
excision of breast tissue with a triangular skin resection measuring 5.2 x 1.5
cm. The specimen is inked blue anteriorly, black posteriorly, red superiorly
and sectioned from medial to lateral to reveal a 2.2 x 2.1 x 1.1 cm white—tan
and white irregular nodule which approaches the initial posterior margin of
resection grossly. The tissue medial to the mass is submitted in Blocks Bl—BZ
and the tissue containing the mass is submitted from medial to lateral in toto
in Blocks B3~B9 (refer to mammogram for specific location). An additional
section of uninvolved lateral tissue is submitted in Block B10. Additionally
there is a free floating fragment of predominantly fatty tissue with a suture
which measures 4 x 3.5 x 0.7 (designated new posterior margin per surgeon).
The portion of tissue containing the suture is Block 811. Tissue is submitted
fresh for estrogen and progesterone receptors.

RESULTS WILL BE ISSUED IN AN ADDENDUM.

COMMENT: Intraductal carcinoma is seen at the posterior inked surgical margin
of resection in part "B". However, the region further designated as "new"
posterior margin is negative for tumor.

Focal mucinous differentiation is present in the main invasive tumor mass
(part "8"). However, this represents a minority of the invasive component
which otherwise is poorly-differentiated.

ADDENDUM 1:

Tissue was sent to the 7 for assay of the estrogen
and progesterone receptors. The estrogen receptor activity was judged to be
positive with an estimated FMOL value of 54. The progesterone receptor
activity was judged as negative with an estimated FMOL value of 0. Please
refer to for a complete report.

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).

ADDENDUM 2:
HERZ/neu IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS

Immunostaining for HERZ/neu (c—erbB-Z) oncoprotein is performed on recut
sections of block 87. The tumor cells exhibit staining of their cell membrane
(score 2+), indicating that they do overexpress HERZ/neu oncoprotein.

METHOD: The immunostaining is done using DAKO rabbit anti-human c—erbB-Z
oncoprotein which is an affinity-isolated antibody

). The immunostaining is performed after antigen retrieval by heating the
unstained sections at 95 degrees centigrade for 20 minutes in 10 mM citrate
buffer, pH 6.0. The primary antibody is used at a dilution of 1:3000 (manual
staining), with an incubation for one hour at 37 degrees centigrade. The
Histostain Plus kit is used as the detection system.

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).

" HEFQ/NEU FISH ANALYSIS

RESULTS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes for the
HERZ/neu region of chromosome 17 (l7qll.2q12) and the centromere of chromosome
17 (D1721) was performed on block B7. The HERZ/neu and centromere 17 signals
were enumerated in 60 nuclei from an invasive area of the tumor located by
comparison with the hematoxylin and e031n stained adjacent section. The
HERZ/neu to centromere l7 ratio was 2.00 +/- 0.89 (mean +/- 1 S.D.). For
comparison, analysis at a ratio of 2.18.

INTERPRETATION: This specimen IS NOT AMPLIFIED for the HERZ/neu gene. A
HERZ/neu to 01721 ratio greater than 2.00 usually indicates HER2/neu gene
amplification. In this case, statistical analysis of the results indicate
that the result IS NOT significantly greater than 2.00. Most nuclei had 2
copies of the chromosome 17 centromere and 3 copies of the HERZ/neu gene.

METHODOLOGY: The Patthsion Her2 DNA Probe Kit was used to obtain these
results. The Patthsion HERZ DNA Probe Kit is designed to detect

and Drug Administration. This test is not intended to screen for or diagnose
breast cancer. It is intended to be used as an adjunct to existing clinical
