Poorly-differentiated adenocarcinom Hith extensive necrosis. clinical
Diagnosis: Esophageal cancer. Operative Procedure:

1. ”Proximal stmch distal esophagus'. Received in formalin in a large
container is a 6.5 cm long distal esophagus with a 6.5 x 4.2 x 1.3 an attached
proximal stomach. The edventitie is ragged. The mucosa of the esophagus is
gray-white and prominently folded. The mucosa of the stomach is tan and
rugated. The esophageal moose is remarkable for a 4.2 x 3.3 x 1.3 on gray- tan
necrotic lesion that is located at the esophageal gastric junction however the
mid point of the tuner is 1.5 cm above the esophageal gastric jmction. The
tuner is 6.1 on: any the proximal margin of resection and 2.2 cm away from the
gastric margin of resection. The tuner has a maximum depth of 0.3 cm and
extends to the muscularis. The tuner is friable and «mostly necrotic. Multiple
possible lymph nodes are identified ranging up to 1.2 cm. The cut surface of
the largest is graycuhite. No other abnormalities are noted.
