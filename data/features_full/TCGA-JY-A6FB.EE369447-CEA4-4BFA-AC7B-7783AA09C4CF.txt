Part 6A

A Val559Asp mutation in exon 11 of the KIT gene is present in this sample using PCR and bi-directional sequencing
analysis.

DNA was extracted from parafﬁn embedded posterior gastric nodule tissue. block 6A. and ampliﬁed using primers speciﬁc
for exons 9. 11. 13 and 17 of the KIT gene ). and axons 12 and 18 of the PDGFRA gene
The PCR products were puriﬁed. sequenced and then compared with the reference sequence

The presence of a o.Val559 Asp mutation in exon 11 of the KlT gene was detected by PCR and

sequencing. Two polymorphisms, (p-) and (p.-).
gene were also identiﬁed in this patient _

The mutation detection sensitivity by sequencing is 10-15%.

This analysis is based on our current knowledge of the KlT or PDGFRA activating mutations and their association with
GlSTs. Demonstration of a mutation In the KlT or PDGFRA gene supports the diagnosis of GIST and predicts response to
imatinib. This test was developed and its performance characteristics deterrnlned by

Block 12E '
There is no evidence for the presence of KIT or PDGFRA mutations in this sample using PCR and bi—directional

sequencing analysis.

DNA was extracted from parafﬁn embedded tissue, block 12E, and ampliﬁed using primers specific for exons 9, 11, 13
and 17 of the KIT gene ‘ and axons 12 and 18 of the PDGFRA gene The PCR products
were puriﬁed, sequenced and then compared with the N08! reference sequence

No mutations were detected in exons 9. 11, 13 and 17 of the KIT gene or exons 12 and 18 of the PDGFRA gene by PCR
and sequencing. Two polymorphisms, (p—) and (p-). in exons 12

‘ and 18 of the PDGFRA gene were identiﬁed in this sample. Negative results do not rule out the possibility that a mutation

may be present in a region not covered by our current testing protocol. PCR and sequencing results might be
compromised due to the suboptimal DNA quality of parafﬁn embedded tissue. Fresh or frozen tissue is recommended

whenever possible.
The mutation detection sensitivity by sequencing is 10-15%.

This analysis is based on our current knowledge of the KIT or PDGFRA activating mutations and their association with
GISTs. Demonstration of a mutation in the KIT or PDGFRA gene supports the diagnosis of GIST and predicts response to
