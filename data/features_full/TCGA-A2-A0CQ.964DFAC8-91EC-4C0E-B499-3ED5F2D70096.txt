CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY:

-year-old female status post core biopsies, bilateral breast consistent
with, on the right, infiltrating ductal carcinoma; on the left DCIS with
cribiform features.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. RIGHT SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 Received fresh, labeled with the patient’s
name, designated "RIGHT SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1". The specimen consists of
a piece of fatty tissue, 3.0 cm x 1.7 cm x 0.2 cm, containing a 1.2 cm
lymph node. A small portion of this node is submitted for the CBCP
protocol.

B. LEFT SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1 Received fresh, labeled with the patient’s
name, designated "LEFT SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1". The specimen consists of a
1.2 cm lymph node. A small portion is submitted for the CBCP protocol.

C. LEFT BREAST LUMPECTOMY Received fresh, labeled with the patient's

name, designated "LEFT BREAST LUMPECTOMY 9:00 POSITION (NEEDLE
LOCALIZATION)". The specimen consists of a piece of fatty tissue, 9.8 cm x
5.0 cm x 1.4 cm with an overlying ellipse of brown skin, 2.4 cm x 0.3 cm.
A needle localization wire is in place and enters the specimen anteriorly,

GROSS DESCRIPTION (continued):

through the skin. The accompanying radiograph is reviewed and shows a
well—defined density anteriorly. The specimen is oriented with sutures and
inked as follows: Yellow=medial, red=lateral, blue=superior,
green=superior, black=posterior. Sectioning anterior to posterior reveals
a well—defined, 1.2 cm tan, friable lesion with focal cavitation and
hemorrhage anteriorly. Two sections of this lesion, as well as a section
of skin and grossly normal fibrofatty tissue are submitted for the CBCP
protocol (matching paraffin sections=C2-C4, C1, and C5 respectively).
Sections are submitted from anterior to posterior.

Slide key: C1: Skin. C2—C4: Tumor. C5: Representative normal. C6—C7:
Single representative section. C8—C10: Single representative section.
C11—C12: Single representative section. C13: Single representative
section. C14-C16: Single representative section. C11-C16 sections
through the area sampled for CBCP protocol. C17—C18: Representative
section. C20-21: Representative sections. C22: Cassette not submitted.
C23—25: Representative sections.

D. LEFT BREAST FINAL SUPERIOR MARGIN Received fresh, labeled with the
patient's name, designated "LEFT BREAST FINAL SUPERIOR MARGIN". The
unorientated specimen consists of a 4.5 cm x 2.1 cm x 0.5 cm fatty tissue
fragment. Serial sectioning reveals abundant yellow adipose tissue admixed
with a moderate amount of white, dense, interdigitating fibrous tissue.
One side is arbitrarily inked in black. ”

E. RIGHT BREAST LUMPECTOMY Received fresh, labeled with the patient’s
name, designated "RIGHT BREAST LUMPECTOMY 6:00". The specimen consists of
a piece of fatty tissue, 8.5 cm x 4.5 cm x 2.8 cm impaled with a needle
localization wire. A radiograph accompanies the specimen and shows a
well—defined mass. The specimen is oriented with sutures; per discussion
with Dr _ . the long stitch indictates lateral and the short stitch
superior. Ink code: Red=medial and lateral, blue=superior, green=inferior,
yellow=anterior, black=posterior. On sectioning, the specimen reveals a
firm, well—defined, tan tumor, 2.2 cm in greatest dimension, closely
approximating the black inked margin. A portion of the tumor appears

tan and friable. One section of tumor and one section of fibrofatty
tissue is submitted for CBCP protocol (matching paraffin sections—E1 and
E2 respectively).

Slide key: E1: Tumor. E2: Rest of the fibrofatty tissue. E3~E6= Single
