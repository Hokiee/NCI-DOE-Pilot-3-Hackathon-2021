INTERPRETATION AND DIAGNOSIS:

1. SOFT TISSUE, “R4“ (BX): ONE (1) BENIGN LYMPH NODE.

2. RIGHT LUNG (PNEUMONECTOMY):
~ INFILTRATING POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE LUNG

INVADING THROUGH THE PLEURA AND INTO BONE AND SOFT TISSUES OF THE
CHEST WALL (7.5 CM).

~ THE TUMOR EXTENDS TO WITHIN 1 MM OF THE FASCIAL RESECTION PLANE.
THE BRONCHIAL MARGIN IS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. THE CHEST WALL SOFT
TISSUE MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

— FIVE (5) PERIBRONCHIAL LYMPH NODES ARE NEGATIVE FOR METASTATIC

CARCINOMA. THESE LYMPH NODES DEMONSTRATE SCATTERED HYALINIZED
GRANULOMAS.

- THE PATHOLOGIC STAGE IS T3 N0 MK.

3. SOFT TISSUE, "R10“ (BX): ONE (1) BENIGN LYMPH NODE WITH SCATTERED
HYALINIZED GRANULOMAS.

4. SOFT TISSUE, "R11" (BX): ONE (1) BENIGN LYMPH NODE.

5. SOFT TISSUE, “STATION 7" (BX): ONE (1) BENIGN LYMPH NODE WITH
SCATTERED HYALINIZED GRANULOMAS.

NOTE: This cae was amended to clarify the status of the margins. The
diagnosis did not change.

PART #1: FS: R4
Resident Pathologist:

ﬁFROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS ~—
FS: R4: NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

The specimen is received fresh labeledﬂand is designated
as R4. It consists of multiple pieces an lack soft tissue,
measuring 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm. Entirely submitted for frozen section.

PART #2: RIGHT LUNG
Resident Pathologist:

The specimen is received fresh labeled and is designated
as right lung. It consists of a 740 gram right lung, measuring 23 x 21
x 0.8 cm. Attached to the right upper lobe is a segment of chest
wall, including four ribs, each measuring 11 cm in length. A large
mass is present in the right upper lobe centered in the anterior,
peripheral portion of the lobe and extending through the middle two
ribs, obliterating the ribs. Tumor extends to the inked superior
anterior chest wall margin. Tumor measures 7.5 x 6 x 4.5 cm and is
fleshy, white tan with no large regions of necrosis. Tumor extends
from the peripherally—located mass centrally towards the hilum,
surrounds a more central branch of the pulmonary artery and may invade
a periarterial 0.6 cm lymph node by direct extension. No vascular
invasion is noted. Dissection of the hilar bronchi reveals no grossly
apparent bronchial invasion. Tumor surrounding vessel and extending
into one node with two adjacent nodes bisected is submitted in
cassettes G and H. Tumor extending into lung is submitted in cassette
I. Uninvolved lower lobe is in cassette J. Palpation and sectioning
of the uninvolved lobes reveals alveolated lung parenchyma without
masses or lesions suspicious for carcinoma.
