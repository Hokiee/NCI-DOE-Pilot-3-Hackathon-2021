MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
A. Sections show two lymph nodes with effecement of ardtite'cture by sheets of malignant epithelloid cells.
with brisk mitoses. prominent nudeoli pigment and large areas of necrosis. consistent with metastatic melanoma.
Penneurel invasion is noted There is scant surrounding residual lymphoid tissue. There is surrounding salivary

glandular parenohyma and there is skeleta muscle at the periphery of the tissue. In both nodes there are areas of
extrecapsular extension with tumor eels extending into the surrounding adipose tissue and sallvay glandular

 

pamnchyma. There are separate nodules of malignant cells within salivary glandular parenohyma. There is

lymphvascular space invasion. Melanoma ls less than 1 mm lrom the Inked tissue edge, no melanoma is Identiﬁed at
ink.

8. Sections show a single intraparench mal I h node \M'th adjacent salivary tissue. An atyplcd cellular infiltrate is
not identiﬁed. Negative for malignancy. $
