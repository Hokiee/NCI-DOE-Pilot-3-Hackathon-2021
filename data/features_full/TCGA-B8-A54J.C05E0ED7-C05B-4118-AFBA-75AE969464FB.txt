AJCC Stage: pTZa pNx pr
This staging information is based on information available at
the time of this

report, and is subject to change pending clinical review and
additional
information.

Clinical History:
-year-old male with a right renal mass.

Gross Description:

Specimen fixation: formalin

Type of specimen: right nephrectomy

Side of specimen: right

Size and weight of specimen: 1,274 grams; 24.5 x 14.5 x 9.5 cm
Orientation: The margins are inked blue

Presence/absence of adrenal gland: absent

Tumor site: The tumor involves the renal cortex and medulla of
the lower pole.

Tumor description: The tumor is heterogeneous and consists of
solid and

cystic areas (primarily solid) with foci of

hemorrhage and interspersed yellow/orange and brown areas of
necrosis.

The tumor is well circumscribed.

Tumor size: From inferior to superior pole is 8.6 cm, from
medial to lateral is

8.3 cm, the anterior/posterior is 6.2 cm.

Presence/absence of multicentricity: absent
Confinement/non—confinement to the kidney: confined, abutting
the renal

capsule

Extent of invasion:

Perirenal adipose tissue: tumor does not involve

Gerota' s fascia: tumor does not involve

Renal vein: does not involve

Ureter: does not involve

Renal Sinus: does not involve

Pelvicaliceal: does not involve

Adrenal: does not involve

Other organs: does not involve

Surgical margins:

Perirenal adipose tissue: negative; The tumor pushes the renal
capsule and

is 1 mm from the perirenal adipose tissue and 1.0

cm from the blue inked edge of the perirenal adipose tissue
margin.

Renal vein: negative; The tumor is 2.5 cm from the margin.
Renal artery: negative; The tumor is 2.8 cm from the margin.
Ureter: negative; The mass is 1.5 cm from the ureter margin.
Description of kidney away from tumor: The remaining renal
parenchyma is

compressed with multiple cysts (the largest has a

greatest diameter of 3.1 cm).

Hilar lymph nodes: none identified

Other significant findings: none

Tissue submitted for special investigations: yes; Tumor and
normal tissue

were submitted to Tissue Procurement.

Digital picture: not taken
