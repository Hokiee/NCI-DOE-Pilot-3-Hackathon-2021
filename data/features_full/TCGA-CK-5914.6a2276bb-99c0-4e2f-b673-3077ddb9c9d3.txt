 

PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:

A. SPECIMEN DESIGNATED "SIGMOID COLON, PARTIAL COLECTOMY" (17 cm}:

ADENOCARCINOMA, low grade, moderately differentiated (4-9 cm

in greatest dimension).

Tumor forms a polypoid mass and has an infiltrating border.

Tumor invades through muscularis propria.

Proximal, distal, and radial resection margins are negative for tumor.

Invasive tumor is 5.0 cm from proximal resection margin, 5.1 cm from
distal resection margin, and 2.5 cm from radial resection margin.

Lymphovascular invasion is not identified.

Extramural venous invasion is not identified.

Perineural invasion is not identified.

Peritumoral lymphoid response (including Crohn?s—like infiltrate) is
mild.

Residual adenoma is absent.

Regional lymph nodes (positive:total): 2:13 [see also part B].

AJCC Classification (6th edition}: T3 N1 MK.

B. SPECIMEN DESIGNATED "ADDITIONAL PROXIMAL MARGIN":
Segment of colon, negative for tumor-
Two lymph nodes, negative for tumor {0:2}.

C. SPECIMEN DESIGNATED “DISTAL DONUT":
Segment of colon, negative for tumor.

D. SPECIMEN DESIGNATED "PROXIMAL DONUT":
Segment of colon, negative for tumor.

D. proximal donut

GROSS DESCRIPTION: '
The specimen is received fresh, in four parts, labeled with the patient's name

and medical record number.

Part A, "#1. sigmoid, staple side is proximal, open and return", consists of
one sigmoid colectomy (17.0 cm in length x 6.6 cm in diameter} with a proximal
stapled resection margin [6.6 cm, inked black} and a distal open resection
margin (2.0 cm, inked blue], with attached mesentery (1?.5 x 6.0 cm). The
antimesenteric side is inked red where the bowel is opened by the prosector.
The mucosal surface demonstrates one tan/pink fungating polypoid mass [4-9 x
4.5 x 1.6 cm) present 5-0 cm from the proximal resection margin, 5-1 cm from
the distal stapled resection margin, and 2.5 cm from the radial resection

margin (inked orange). The tumor grossly invades into the muscularis, but not
the pericolonic fat. There is a white/tan soft nodule (? necrotic lymph node
metastasis) (1.5 x 0. 9 x 1. 5 cm) which is present in the mesentery adjacent and
2.0 cm from the main mass and 1.1 cm from the radial margin. The remainder of
the mucosa is tan/brown and unremarkable- Twelve candidate lymph nodes are
identified, the largest measuring 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. Gross
photographs are taken. -

Part B, "#2. Additional proximal margin“, consists of one unoriented segment of
colon (1.1 cm in length x 2.5 cm in diameter] with two stapled resection
margins (4.5 cm inked black, 4.1 cm inked blue) with attached mesentery (2.1 x
6.0 cm). No lesions are grossly identified. Two candidate lymph nodes are
identified, the largest measuring 0.5 cm in greatest dimension.

Part D, "#4. Proximal donut", consists of one metal disc (2.8 x 2.8 x 0.5 cm)
with an attached stem(4.4 cm in length x 0.7 cm in diameter) with a segment of
colon (0-5 cm in length x 1.2 cm in diameter] . No lesions are grossly
identified- The metal object is submitted for gross e'xamination only.
