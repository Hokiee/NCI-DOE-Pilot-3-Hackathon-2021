RECEIVED IN 2 PARTS.

PART A RECEIVED LABEme RIGHT BREAST DOUBLE BLACK
STITCH 12 O'CLOCK AT NIPPLE IS A 1, GRAM MASTECTOMY MEASURING 28.5 CM
FROM MEDIAL To LATERAL, 26.5 CM FROM SUPERIOR TO INFERIOR, AND UP To 6
CM FROM ANTERIOR To POSTERIOR. A SUTURE 13me 12 O'CLOCK. THE NIPPLE
Is FLAT WITH THE SURROUNDING AREOLA MEASURING 6 CM IN DIAMETER. IN THE
UPPER OUTER OUADRANT 6 CM FROM THE NIPPLE THERE IS A 0.3 CM ULCERATION.
AT THE MOST LATERAL ELLIPTICAL TIP OF TEE SKIN Is A 2ND SMALL ULCERATION
0.5 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION. THIS IS 16 CM FROM THE. NIPPLE. THE SKIN
ELLIPSE MEASURES 25.6 x 11.5 CM. THERE IS A PALPAELE MASS AT 12
O'CLCCK. ”"MRM Is WRITTEN ON THE) SPECIMEN AT 12 O'CLOCK. THE ANTERIOR
MARGIN IS MARKED BLUE AND THE DEEP IS MARKED BLACK. SECTIONING REVEALS
THE MAJORITY OF THE BREAST To CONSIST OF BLAND YELLOW FATTY TISSUE WITH
FINE EIEROUS BANDS. THERE ARE BROADER AREAS OF FIBROSIS IN THE MORE
CENTRAL ASPECT OF THE SPECIMEN. IN THE 12—1 O'CLOCK AREA THERE Is A
FIRM GRATSTAN MASS WHICH IS GREATER THAN 1. CM FROM THE DEEP MARGIN
MEASURING 5.8 CM FROM SUPERIOR TO INFERIOR, 2.5 CM FROM ANTERIOR TO
POSTERIOR, AND 4 CM FROM MEDIAL T0 LATERAL. CENTRALLT THERE IS AN
IRREGULAR AREA OF RED—BROWN DISCOIORATION. THIS IS ALSO GREATER THAN 1
CM FROM THE OVERLYING SKIN. A COIL CLIP IS IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE
LESION. SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS mLLOWS: A1—-NIPPLE, A2~SKIN
