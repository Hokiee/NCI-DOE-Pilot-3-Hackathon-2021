6. The specimen is received fresh and labeled "uterus
tubes/ova:iss/paramctrium/vagina inked margins and send for tumor studies".
The specimen consists of a total hysterectomy specimen measuring 10.0 cm
from fundus to cervical mucosa, 4.3 cm from cornu to cornu and 3.0 cm from
anterior to posterior. The attached cervix measures 4.5 x 4.0 x 4.0 cm with
a rim of vaginal cuff. The 05 is slit-like and measures 0.8 cm. Located at
the three o‘clock to nine o'clock aspect is a pink-tan. bosselated,
protruding mass measuring 2.0 x 1.5 cm. The anterior is inked green and the
posterior is inked black. A 0.6 cm portion of taken for research from the
nine o'clock aspect. The specimen is opened to reveal the mass grossly
extends the entire length of the cervix and into the uterus for an overall
measurement of 7.8 x 4.1 x 2.0 cm. The triangular endomntrial caviLy
measures 6.0 x 2.0 cm and the distal portion is distorted by the mass. The
specimen is serially sectioned to reveal the mass grossly extends to the
posterior margin [from approximately 6 o'clock to the 10 o‘clock) and 0.1

cm from the anterior margin.

The attached right adnexa is composed o£ o Elmbrialcd fallopian tube
measuring 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and an attached, cerebrilorm ovary measuring
2.7 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm. The fallopian tube is serially sectioned to reveal a
pinpoint lumen. The ovary is serially sectioned to reveal normal ovarian

parenchyma with a corpus albicans.

The attached left adnexa are composed of a fimbriated fallopian tube

measuring 7.5 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm and a tan-pink, cerebritorm ovary measuring
?.7 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. The fallopian tube 13 serially sectioned to reveal a
