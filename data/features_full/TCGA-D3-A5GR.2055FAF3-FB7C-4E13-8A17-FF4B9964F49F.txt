GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) CONTENTS OF LEFT INGUINAL FOSSA — Soft tissue containing large lymph nodes (13.0 x 12.0 x 5.0 cm), overlying skin
which is light tan (6.0 x 2.5 cm), lymph nodes which range from 1.0 cm to the largest measuring (6.5 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm). The largest
node is grossly positive with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. Sections from the grossly positive node is given to both clinical
and research tissue bank.

SECTION CODE: A1, mirror image normal skin; A2, mirror image grossly positive large lymph node; A3-A7,
representative sections of the largest grossly positive lymph node; A8, A9, one lymph node, serially sectioned; A10-A12, one
lymph node, serially sectioned; A1 3-A16, one lymph node, serially sectioned; A17, one lymph node, bisected; A18, one lymph
node, bisected.

(B) COMMON lLlAC LYMPH NODES - A single fragment of fibroconnective tissue containing lymph nodes (11.0 x 1.3 cm x 0.5
cm).

Dissection reveals the presence of multiple lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.4 to 2.3 cm.

SECTION CODE: B1, one lymph node, serially sectioned, entirely submitted; B2, one lymph node, serially sectioned,
entirely submitted; B3, one lvmnh node, bisected; B4, one lymph node, bisected; 85, three possible lymph nodes; 86, four
possible lymph nodes. -

(C) OBTURATOR NODE, LEFT — A single fragment of lobulated fibroconnective tissue (7.7 x 2.5 x 0.9 cm). Dissection reveals
the presence of multiple lymph nodes ranging from 1.5 to 3.3 cm (largest lymph node 3.3 x 2.2 x 0.9 cm). The largest lymph node
appears grossly to be a fatty lymph node.

SECTION CODE: C1-C3, one lymph node, serially sectioned, entirely submitted; C4, C5, one lymph node, serially
sectioned, entirely submitted; 06, one lymph node, bisected, entirely submitted; C7, one lymph node, serially sectioned, entirely
submitted; C8, one lvmoh node, bisected; CQ, one lymph node, serially sectioned and entirely submitted; C10, three possible
lymph nodes.

(D) LEFT STERNAL lLlAC NODES — Two fragments of fibroconnective tissue (10.0 x 3.4 x 1.5 cm) containing lymph nodes.

Dissection of the specimen reveals multiple lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 to 2.1 cm.

SECTION CODE: D1, one lymph node, serially sectioned, entirely submitted; DZ, one lymph node, serially sectioned,
entirely submitted; D3, one lymph node, bisected; D4, one lymph node, serially sectioned, entirely submitted; D5, D6, one lymph
node, serially sectioned, entirely submitted; D7, one lymph node, bisected; D8, one possible lymph node, bisected; 09, one lymph

node, serially sectioned, entirely submitted; D10, one lymph node, bisected; D11, three possible lymph nodes; D12, four possible
lymph nodes; D13, one possible lymph node, bisected.
