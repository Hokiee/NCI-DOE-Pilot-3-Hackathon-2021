COMMENT: The keratin positivity noted in the prior biopsy is entirely consistent with
leiomyosarcoma. Although some loci (A15) showed cells which resemble
rhabdomyoblasts, MyoD1 is negative. No glandular component is identified in the
resection specimen and no keratin positivity is identified in a section stained from this
case, which argue against a malignant mixed mullerian tumor. The findings were relayed
to Or. by campus email.

A. UTERUS. BlLATERAL TUBES. OVARIES AND CERVlX

Labeled with the patients name, labeled “uterus. bilateral tubes, ovaries and cervix". received fresh for
intraoperative gross consultation, and subsequently fixed in formalin is a 190 gram total hysterectomy
and bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy specimen. The uterus is about 7.5 x 6.0 x 8.0 cm. The cervical
portion of the uterus is 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.2 cm. The endometrial cavity is about 4.0 cm wide and about 4.0 cm
in length. The endometrial lining is 0.1 cm. The muscular uterine wall ranges from 1.2 to 2.0 cm in
maximum thickness. There are parametrial tissues attached to the uterus. Those on the right are about
2.5 x 1.5 x10 cm and hose on the» left are about 2.5 x12 x 0.8 cm. The right ovary is 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm.
A i .3 x 0.? x 0,2 cm portion of right ovary appears to have been previously removed for research _
purposes. The right fallopian tube is 4.5 cm in length and 0.3—0.5 cm in diameter. The lumen is 0.1 cm.
The left ovary is 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The left fallopian tube is 4.5 cm in length and 0.406 cm in diameter.
The lumen is 0.1 cm.

  

There is a soft, tan, friable, hemorrhagic. pedunculated 5.5 x 5.0 x 3.5 cm endometnal tumor that largely
replaces the uterine fundus, corpus. and lower uterine segment. The tumor invades greater than 95% of
the myometriai wall in the lower uterine segment (grossly 2.0 cm into a 2.0 cm myometrial wall). The
tumor abuts the serosa of the anterior and posterior lower uterine segment but does not grossly extend
through the serosa. The tumor does not grossly extend into the ectocervix or parametrlal soft tissues. A
1.0 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm nodule is present in the posterior endocervical wall, possibly representing tumor versus
postfixation artifact. The endocervical canal is otherwise uninvolved by tumor. No metastatic tumor is
identiﬁed in the adnexa.
