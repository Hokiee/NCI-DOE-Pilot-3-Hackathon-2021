4). The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Total thyroid suture marks right lobe" and consists of a thyroid weighing 29.5 g. The
right lobe measures 4.5 x 3.3 x 2.4 cm . the left lobe measures 4.1 x 2.9 x 1.7 cm and the isthmus measures 1.6 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm.
The external surface is covered by a thin ﬁbrous capsule. The posterior surface of the specimen is inked black, and the anterior is
inked blue. Three encapsulated nodules are identiﬁed in the left lobe, measuring 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.6, 1.3 x 1.3 x 0.8, and 1.6 x 1.5 x 1.4
cm. The left lobe nodules are arbitrarily designated; smallest left lobe nodule N1, the middle N2, and the largest N3. Nodule N2 and
N3 are adjacent. located in the upper pole. N3 is focally calciﬁed. N1 is located in the lower pole of the left lobe. Sectioning through
the remaining tissue reveals four encapsulated nodules in the right lobe ranging from 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 to 2.9 x 1.7 x 1.0cm. The right

N7 Is located at the superior pole of the right lobe. N5 is focally calciﬁed and abuts the anterior capsule. At the junction of the left
lower pole and isthmus is a 2.0 x 1.5 x .0 cm encapsulated gelatinous nodule. The remaining thyroid parenchyma is red tan and
beefy. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted for and a photograph has been taken. The remaining tissue
is serially sectioned and ' submitted.
