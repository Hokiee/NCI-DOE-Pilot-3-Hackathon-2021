Diagnosis

1. Predominantly moderately differentiated bilateral multifocal adenoca1cinorna of the prostate
in he per ipherai zone (Gleason 3+4=7, Gleason 4: 30%). Maximum tnmo: diameter 1.6 cm.
Tumor inﬁltration of periprostatic fatty tissue in the left basal and left reetolateral region

(invasion front 1 mm, max. 0.2 mm depth) and the right basal region (invasion front 1 mm, max.

0.2 mm depth). Extensive multifocal tumor involvement of perineural sheaths.
Tumor-free surgical preparation margins.

Additional foci of a prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (high-grade PIN) and signs of
myoglanduiar prostatie hyperplasia. Urothelium of the prostatie urethra without
dysplasia.

Tumor-free, regular seminal vesicles and seminal ducts.

2. Lymph nodes on the right: four tumor-free lymph nodes (0/4).

3. Lymph nodes on the left: one tumor—free lymph node (0/1).

Summary tumor classiﬁcation:
pT3a, max. tumor diameter 16 mm, Gleason 3+4=7 (Gleason 4: 30%), pNO (0/5), R0.

 

Remark

Tumor portions were identiﬁed in the region of the yellow—labeled artefactual preparation
margins in the left rectolateral region. However, the surgical blue and green—labeled preparation
margins are tumor-free and, together with the prior frozen section analysis, the tumor can be
assumed to have been completely excised.

The Gleason 4 portion was already seen in the preliminary punch biopsy.

Immunohistochemical investigations were initiated to establish whether there was any tumorcus
vessel invasion, the results of which will be presented in a follow-up report.

Communicated tumor classiﬁcation:
pT3a, max. tumor diameter 16 mm, Gleason 3+4=7 (Gleason 4: 30%), pNO (0/5), R0.

Immnnohistochemical investigation of two representative tumor blocks showed no evidence of
blood or lymph vessel invasion.

Summary tumor classiﬁcation:
pT3a, max. tumor diameter 16 mm, Gleason 3+4=7 (Gleason 4: 30%), LOIVO, pNO (0/5), R0.
