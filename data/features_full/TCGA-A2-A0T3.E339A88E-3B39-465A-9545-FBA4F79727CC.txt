PART A RECEIVED FRESH LABELED * RIGHT BREAST PARTIAL
MASTECTOMY LONG STITCH EQUALS LATERAL S ORT STITCH EQUALS POSTERIOR, IS
AN OVOID PORTION OF YELLOW-PINK FIBROFATTY TISSUE MEASURING 6.8 x 6.2 x
3.6 CM. TWO SUTURES ORIENT THE SPECIMEN. THE MARGINS ARE MARKED AS
FOLLOWS: LATERAL ORANGE, SUPERIOR GREEN, MEDIAL RED, INFERIOR BLUE,
SUPERFICIAL BLACK, DEEP YELLOW. SECTIONING REVEALS TWO MASS LESIONS.
THE SMALLER IS MEDIAL MEASURING 1.5 x 0.9 x 0.9 CM. THE CLOSEST MARGIN
IS SUPERFICIAL AT 0.5 CM, WITH ALL OTHER MARGINS GREATER THAN 1 CM. THE
SECOND IS LATERAL AND MEASURES 1.6 x 1.5 x 2.3 CM. THE CLOSEST MARGIN IS
SUPERFICIAL TOWARD THE LATERAL BORDER, WHERE IT IS 0.5 CM FROM THIS
MARGIN AND 0.5 CM FROM THE SUPERFICIAL MARGIN SUPERIORLY. A RIBBON CLIP
IS IDENTIFIED IN THE MORE LATERAL ASPECT OF THE SPECIMEN. TISSUE IS
TAKEN FROM BOTH NODULES PER PROTOCOL. SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED AS FOLLOWS:
A1--PERPENDICULAR MEDIAL MARGIN; A2--PERPENDICULAR LATERAL MARGIN;
A3--PERPENDICULAR LATERAL LESION WITH SUPERFICIAL MARGIN LATERALLY;
A4—-LATERAL LESION WITH SUPERFICIAL MARGIN SUPERIORLY; As--MIRROR IMAGE
OF THE AREA TAKEN PER PROTOCOL OF THE LARGER TUMOR To INCLUDE SUPERFICIAL
MARGIN; A6 THROUGH Ae--THE REMAINDER OF THIS CROSS—SECTION TO INCLUDE THE
INFERIOR, DEEP AND SUPERIOR MARGINS, RESPECTIVELY; A9 AND Io—-FULL
CROSS-SECTION OF LATERAL LESION TO INCLUDE SUPERFICIAL MARGIN; A11
THROUGH A14--FULL CROSS-SECTION TO INCLUDE THE MORE MEDIAL SMALLER
LESION, WITH A11 THE MIRROR IMAGE OF THAT SUBMITTED PER PROTOCOL To
INCLUDE THE SUPERIOR SUPERFICIAL MARGIN. THE REMAINING CROSS-SECTION IS
SUBMITTED As SUPERIOR DEEP, DEEP INFERIOR AND INFERIOR SUPERFICIAL,
RESPECTIVELY. A15 THROUGH A18 IS THE LATERAL PORTION OF THE LESION TO
INCLUDE THE LESION WITH THE SUPERFICIAL SUPERIOR MARGIN, THE SUPERIOR
DEEP MARGIN, THE DEEP INFERIOR MARGIN AND THE INFERIOR SUPERFICIAL
MARGIN, RESPECTIVELY. A19 IS A FIRM AREA BETWEEN THESE TWO NODULES
GREATER THAN 1 CM FROM ALL MARGINS MEASURING 1 x 1 x 0.4 CM. A20 IS THE
.TISSUE BETWEEN BLOCK A19 AND THE MOST LATERAL LARGER LESION WHICH IS
GROSSLY UNREMARKABLE.

PART B RECEIVED FRESH LABELED RIGHT BREAST MEDIAL

REEXCISION STITCH AT NEW MARGIN, IS AN OVOID PORTION OF YELLOW FATTY
TISSUE WITH FOCAL BLUE DYE MEASURING 4.9 X 2.8 X 1.5 CM. A SUTURE
DENOTES A NEW MARGIN, AND THIS SIDE IS MARKED WITH BLUE INK WITH A
PERIMETER OF BLACK INK, SECTIONED AND SUBMITTED LABELED Bl THROUGH 5.

SENTINEL NODE HOT AND BLUE, IS A 1.8 X 1.2 X 0.9-CM OVOID PORTION OF
YELLOW FATTY TISSUE. SECTIONING REVEALS A 1.1-CM LYMPH NODE WITH BLUE
DYE. ONE-HALF IS SUBMITTED PER PROTOCOL. THE REMAINDER IS SUBMITTED

PART D RECEIVED FRESH LABELED RIGHT BREAST SECOND
SENTINEL NODE BLUE, IS A 1.5 X 1.0 X 0.7-CM OVOID PORTION OF PINK-TAN
TISSUE AND ADJACENT YELLOW FAT. SECTIONING REVEALS A GROSSLY
RAT-REPLACED LYMPH NODB WITH FOCAL BLUE DYE MEASURING 1.1 CM IN DIAMETER.

PART A RIGHT BREAST, PARTIAL MASTECTOMY:_ IN SITU AND INFILTRATQETJNKH'
CARCINOMA WITH TWO SEPARATE NODULES TING DUCT CARCINOMA
PRESENT IN THE SPECIMEN. THE LARGE (1.7 CM) NODULE IS POORLY
DIFFERENTIATED, NUCLEAR GRADE III/II T HIGH MITOTIC INDEx. FOCAL
DUCT CAETINDHH - .' WITH COMEDONECROSIS IS PRESENT ASSOCIATED WITH
THIS LESION * ”INS INTO'BREAST‘EHT AT LEAST 1.5 CM FROM THE TUMOR.
THE SECOND (1. 2 CM) LESION IS MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED, NUCLEAR GRADE
III/III WI MITOTIC INDEX. THIS LESION IS ALSO ADMIXED WITH
AREAS OF HIGH-GRADE DUCT CARCINOMA IN SITU OF THE CRIBRIFORM,
MICROPAPILLARY, AND COMEDOCARCINOMA TYPES. INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS LOCATED
3 MM FROM THE SUPERFICIAL MARGIN ON THE LATERAL SIDE. THERE IS A
MICROSCOPIC FOCUS OF SOLID TYPE DUCT CARCINOMA IN SITU AT THE MEDIAL
MARGIN. DUCT CARCINOMA IN SITU INVOLVES THE SUPERIOR MARGIN AND THERE IS
A MICROCALCIFICATION WITH COMEDONECROSIS SUSPICIOUS FOR DUCT CARCINOMA IN
SITU AT THE INFERIOR MARGIN, ALTHOUGH THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS IS A
DETACHED ARTIFACTUALLY DISPLACED FOCUS OF DCIS CANNOT BE TOTALLY
EXCIUDED. THE DEEP MARGIN IS FREE OF TUMOR BY AT LEAST 1 CM.

 

  
 
 

PART B RIGHT BREAST MEDIAL MARGIN, REEXCISION: FATTY BREAST TISSUE WITH
NO RESIDUAL TUMOR IDENTIFIED.

PART C RIGHT FIRST AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODE BIOPSY: METASTATIC
INFILTRATING DUCT CARCINOMA IDENTIFIED IN THE SUBCAPSULAR PORTION OF THE

LYMPH NODE WITH SEVERAL FOCI PRESENT. THE LARGEST CONTIGUOUS FOCUS OF
TUMOR SPANS A DISTANCE OF APPROXIMATELY 1 MM. THE TUMOR IS VISIBLE ON
BOTH ROUTINE H&E AND CYTOKERATIN IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAIN.

PART D RIGHT SECOND AXILLARY LYMPH NODE BIOPSY: LYMPH NODE WITH NO
EVIDENCE OF METASTATIC DISEASE, SUPPORTED BY NEGATIVE CYTOKERATIN
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY.
