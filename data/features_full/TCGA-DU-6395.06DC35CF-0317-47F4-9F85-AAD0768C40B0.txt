UPDATED REPORT - SEE ADDENDUM SPECIAL STAIN REPORT:
MIB-l LABELLING INDEX 40%
PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:
A AND B. BRAIN, LEFT FRONTAL, EXCISIONAL BIOPSIES: GLIOMA, HIGH
HISTOLOGICAL GRADE (IV). WITH NECROSIS AND HYALINIZING VASCULOPATHY.
SEE MICROSCOPY DESCRIPTION AND COMMENT.
SPECIAL STAIN REPORT: MIB—l LABELLING INDEX 40%.
Operation/Specimen: Brain, left frontal.
Clinical History and Pre-Op Dx: year old man with history of a
mixed glioma with atypical features biopsied in , recent onset
seizure, and ? tumor recurrence.
GROSS PATHOLOGY: A. Received fresh, four fragments, l x 0.8 x 0.4 cm
in aggregate. Soft, tannishsgrey, focally hemorrhagic. In total #1
and 2.
INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Frozen section diagnosis: Brain, left
frontal: Malignant glioma.
B. Received fresh, three fragments, 1.0 cm in aggregate, soft,
hemorrhagic. In total #3.
INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION, Frozen section diagnosis: Brain, left
frontal: Malignant glioma.
MICROSCOPIC: A. Portions of brain extensively infiltrated by a
cellular neoplastic proliferation of glial cells with nuclear
anaplasia, mitotic figures, focal necrosis and microvascular cellular
proliferation. There also are vessels with thick hyalinized walls. In
the smears, but also in the tissue, many cells have an oligodendroglial
phenotype.
B. Portions of brain heavily infiltrated by a neoplasm similar to that
described for part A. In here, however, there are extensive areas of
coagulation necrosis and small vessels with prominent hyalinizing
vasculopathy.
COMMENT: The lesion is a high histological grade (grade IV) glioma
with extensive necrosis and hyalinizing vasculopathy. The neoplasm has
Cont'd....
a focal oligodendroglial component. The vasculopathy and probably some
necrosis are secondary to radiation. A MIB—I is requested and an
addendum report will follow.
ADDENDUM REPORT:
A MIB—l immunoperoxidase stain was performed on block #2.
A MIB—l labelling index of 40% was determined in the more cellular
areas.
