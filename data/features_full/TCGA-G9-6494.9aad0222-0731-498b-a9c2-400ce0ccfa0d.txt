GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES:
Received fresh for frozen section is a tan pink fatty lymph node 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.80m. The specimen is
serially sectioned and submitted in toto in FSA.

B.LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES:
Received fresh for frozen section is a tan pink lymph node 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.50m. The specimen is serially

sectioned and submitted in toto in FSB.

C. PROSTATE:
Received fresh is an 859 resected prostate (7.0cm from left to right, 4.5crn from apex to base and

4.00m from anterior to posterior), with attached right and left seminal vesicles and vas deferens. The
capsule is ten pink smooth and intact. The specimen is inked as follows: Apex—Red, Anterior-Orange.
Right Lateral~Green. Left Lateral-Yellow. Base-Blue, Posterior-Black. After removal of the apex and
base, the remaining prostate weight is 549. The specimen is serially sectioned from apex to base to
reveal gray-white, ﬁrm, spongy tissue. A nodule is identiﬁed in level 1 1.2cm in greatest dimension. The
attached right and left seminal vesicles are 3.5 x 1.5 x Micro and 2.0 x 1.8 x 1.0cm, respectively, are
sectioned to reveal beige tan cystic structure with no gross evidence of tumor involvement. The
segments of right and left vas deferens are 3.0 x 0.60m and 3.6 X 0.80m respectively, and are sectioned
to reveal beige tan tubular structure with no gross evidence of tumor involvement. A portion of the
specimen is submitted for tissue procurement (levels 1 & 3). The remainder of the specimen is
submitted as follows:

DIAGNOSIS:
A. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE, EXClSlON:
- REACTIVE LYMPH NODE (on).

 

 

8. LEFT PELViC LYMPH NODE, EXCISION:
- REACTIVE LYMPH NODE (011).

c. PROSTATE, PROSTATECTOMY:
- PROSTATic ADENOCARClNOile OF THE LEFT & RlGHT LosEs, GLEASON'S SCORE (4 + 3 2
7/10), lNVADlNG THE ADIPOSE TISSUE AND THE BLADDER NECK.

- THE LEFT AND RlGHT BASE MARGINS ARE EXTENSIVELY lNVOLVED BY CARCINOMA (SEE
NOTE)

- SEE TEMPLATE.

Note: The bladder neck involvement is best seen in 030. The positive margins are seen on 028, C29,

630, and 032.
Dr. agreed on the bladder neck involvement.
