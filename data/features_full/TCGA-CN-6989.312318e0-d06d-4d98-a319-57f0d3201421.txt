GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received fresh in six parts.

Part 1 is received labeled with the patient' s name, initials XX and "right
neck dissection, levels 2, 3 and 4, stitch at 2B". The specimen consists of a
segment of fibroadipose tissue measuring 10.0 x 7.0 x 1.0 cm. There is a
surgical stitch in one of the extremities of the specimen. Upon section, at
level 2, eight possible lymph nodes were identiﬁed. At level 3, ten lymph
nodes were identiﬁed the largest one measures 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. At level 4
no grossly Visible lymph nodes were identified. The specimen is submitted as
follows:

1A-1B - level 2 lymph nodes

1C - level 3 lymph node bisected

1D-1F - level 3 lymph nodes

1G—1H - level 4 soft tissue with possible lymph nodes.

Part 2 is received labeled with the patient' s name, initials XX and "left
neck dissection, levels 2, 3 and 4, stitch at level 2B". The specimen consists
of a segment of yellow soft tissue measuring 12.0 x 5.5 x 1.0 cm. Upon
section, 11 lymph nodes were identiﬁed in level 2; eight lymph nodes were
identiﬁed in level 3 and 10 lymph nodes were identiﬁed in level 4. The
specimen is submitted as follows:

2A-2C - level 2 lymph nodes

2D-2E - level 3 lymph nodes

2F—2H - level 4 lymph nodes.

Part 3 is received labeled with the patient' s name, initials XX and "base of
left tongue, clip is medial". The specimen was previously submitted
intraoperative evaluation. It consists of a 2.0 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm of white ﬁrm
tissue. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette 3A (frozen section).
Part 4 is received labeled with the patient' s name, initials XX and "left
lateral pharynx". The specimen was previously submitted for intraoperative
diagnosis. The specimen consists of a 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm segment of soft,
yellow tissue. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette 4A (frozen
section).

Part 5 is received labeled with the patient' s name, initials XX and "larynx".
The specimen consists of a total laryngectomy measuring 10.5 x 6.5 x 4.5 cm,
including the hyoid bone 2.0 cm on the right side and 0.5 cm on the left
side; the larynx from the epiglottis to infraglottic and one tracheal ring.
There is an ulcerated exophytic mass measuring 4x3x2cm located in the
supraglottis, base of the tongue involving the lateral wall, the right side of
the epiglottis and the soft tissue surrounding the epiglottis. The lesion
comes within 1.0 cm from the right false vocal cord. A rough, irregular 1.0 x
0.5 cm area is also identiﬁed in the left true vocal cord. The specimen is
serially sectioned and submitted as follows:

5A - frozen section right base of tongue

5B - frozen section right lateral pharynx mucosal margin

5C - frozen section soft tissue base of the tongue, perpendicular margin
5D - tracheal margin

5E - tumor

5F - pyriform sinus, left side

5G - epiglottis and tumor right side

5H - epiglottis tumor, deep margin

51 - tumor and false vocal cord right

5] - false vocal cord, right

5K - left false vocal cord

5L - irregular area in the left true vocal cord

5M - pyriform sinus right side

5N - soft tissue posterior

50 - left side possible lymph nodes

5P - right side possible lymph nodes.

Ink code:

Black: soft tissue

Red: hyoid bone location.

Part 6 is received labeled with the patient' s name, initials XX and "right
base of tongue, soft tissue margin excision". The specimen consists of a 2.0
x 1.5 x 0.3 cm of soft yellow tissue with small areas of hemorrhage. The
specimen is entirel submitted in cassette 6A.
