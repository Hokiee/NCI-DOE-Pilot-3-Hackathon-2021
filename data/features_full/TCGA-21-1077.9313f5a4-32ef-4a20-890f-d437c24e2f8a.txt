Source of Tissue: 4. Labeled # 4, "left upper lobe of lung"

Frozen Section Diagnosis: 4FA— POSITIVE BRONCHIAL MARGIN, 4F 83- ADHESIONS
IN RELATIONSHIP TO LUNG TISSUE; PLEURA POSITIVE.

Gross Description: Received fresh for frozen section in a container labeled "—
and _, left upper lobe of lung". It consists of a 256 gram lobe of lung
measuring 20.5 x 9.0 X 7.0 cm. The bronchial margin was procured for frozen section and
the residue is in 4FSA. At the hilum, multiple grayish-black rubbery to ﬁrm lymph nodes
are found measuring from 0.5 up to 1.6 cm. A few of the nodes at the superior aspect of the
hilum are potentially involved by lesion. Upon opening of bronchial tree, a large superior
branch is grossly involved by a mass. The bronchial tree in this area is obliterated by
aforementioned mass. The pleural surface superiorly has multiple fibromembranous and
ﬁbroadipose adhesions and gross tumor is present involving the pleura and possibly the
adhesions. Two representative sections from this area were selected for frozen section and
the residue is in 4F SB. Sections in this area disclose ﬁrm tan tumor measuring 5.5 x 4.5 x
4.0 cm, involving the pleura and bronchial margin. Adjacent to the lesion there is some
bronchiectasis. The tumor involves approximately 35% of the left upper lobe.
Representative sections are submitted in 4A—K.

Designation of Sections: 4A- vascular margins, 4B-4C- lymph nodes, 4D~4F- additional
sections from hilum [D is adjacent to the bronchial margin], 4G— pleura with adhesions, 4H-
pleura with adhesions, 41- additional section of left upper lobe lung tumor, 41- uninvolved

tissue adjacent to tumor, 4K- uninvolved tissue away from tumor
