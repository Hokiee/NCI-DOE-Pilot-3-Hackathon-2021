DIAGNOSIS

(A) RIGHT COLON: MIWQW 0&4 0;
Colon with tubular adenomas (x3 ranging from 0 3 cm to 2. 2 cm) and sessile serrated adeno (1.4 cm) 05/ j 01 Z [17’
No high-grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma in colon. 99a

Unremarkable non-neoplastic colonic mucosa.
Vermiform appendix with small hyperplastic polyp.
Terminal ileum, no tumor present.
Fourteen lymph nodes, no tumor present (0/14).
(B) RIGHT KIDNEY, PARA CAVAL LYMPH NODES:
PAPILLARY RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (4.5 X 4.0 X 3.5 CM). TYPE 2, FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3.
CONFINED TO THE KIDNEY. (SEE COMMENT)
Margins of resection free of tumor.

COMMENT

The renal cell carcinoma is composed of papillae and nests lined by cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.
lmmunohistochemical stains for P5048 and vimentin are strongly positive in the tumor cells. CD10 is positive with a membranous

staining pattern. Cytokeratin 7 is positive in rare cells. The morphologic features and immunohistochemical proﬁle are consistent
with a type 2 papillary renal cell carcinoma.

The right colon specimen has been reviewed by The above diagnosis is
based on her interpretation.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) RIGHT COLON - A right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of segment of large bowel (30.0 cm in length and 10 cm
circumference), attached segment of small bowel (6.0 cm in length and 4.0 cm circumference), and appendix (4.5 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm).

There are ﬁve polypoid lesions identiﬁed. The largest (2.2 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm) is a sessile colonic polyp located 13.0 cm from
the distal margin and 17.0 cm from the ileocecal valve. The polyp is superﬁcial.

There is a second polyp (1.4 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm) in the colon located 5.0 cm from the ileocecal valve and 12.0 cm proximal to
the 2.2 cm polyp. The polyp is also superﬁcial.

There is a third colonic polyp (0.4 cm in greatest dimension) located 4.0 cm from the distal margin and 8.0 cm distal to the
2.2 cm polyp.

The cecum shows two small polypoid lesions. The ﬁrst (0.6 cm in greatest dimension) is superﬁcial and is 6.0 cm from
the ileocecal valve. The second (0.3 cm in greatest dimension) is also superﬁcial and 3.0 cm from the ileocecal valve.

No invasive tumor is identiﬁed. The surrounding colonic mucosa is unremarkable. The small bowel mucosa and
appendix are both unremarkable. Multiple possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed in the surrounding adipose tissue.

SECTION CODE: A1, representative appendix; A2, proximal and distal margins; A3, normal small and large bowel
mucosa; A4, 0.6 cm cecal polyp; A5, 0.3 cm cecal polyp; A6, 0.4 cm colonic polyp; A7, A8, 1.4 cm colonic polyp; A9-A14, 2.2 cm
colonic polyp; A15, six possible lymph nodes; A16, six possible nodes; A17, six possible nodes; A18, four possible nodes; A19,
one possible node, serially sectioned (possibly vessel).

(B) RIGHT KIDNEY, PARA CAVAL LYMPH NODES - A radical nephrectomy specimen (15.0 x 11.0 x 4.0 cm), including a kidney
(12.0 x 6.0 x 3.5 cm), segment of renal artery (1.0 x 0.4 cm). renal vein (1.0 cm x 0.7 cm) and ureter (10.0 cm in length x 0.4 cm in
average diameter). There is no adrenal identiﬁed. There is no lymph node identiﬁed.

There is well-circumscribed ﬁmt tumor (4.5 x 4.0 x 3.5 cm) in the lower pole of the kidney. The tumor is gray-tan with
small area of hemorrhage (less than 5%). There is no necrosis identiﬁed in the tumor. The tumor is conﬁned to the kidney. The
tumor does not invade into perinephric adipose tissue and does not extend to Gerota's fascia. The tumor is pushing the renal sinus
adipose tissue but does not invade into the renal sinus adipose tissue.

The adjacent kidney parenchyma is unremarkable. Pelvicalyceal system is smooth and devoid of any lesion. Lymph
nodes are not identiﬁed.
