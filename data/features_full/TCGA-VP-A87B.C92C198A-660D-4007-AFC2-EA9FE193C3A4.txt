TERTIARY PATTERN OF 3 (SEE SYNOPTIC)

By this signature, I attest that the above diagnosis is
based upon my personal

examination of the slides(and/or other material indicated in the
diagnosis).

***Report Electronically Reviewed and Signed Out By
Intraoperative Consultation:
An intraoperative non—microscopic consultation was obtained and interpreted as:
"Called to pick up ‘prostate,’ consisting of a 37 gram prostate with attached
bilateral seminal vesicles. The prostate measures 4.5 x 4.5 x 2 cm. Inked.
Tissue taken for tumor bank. Rest for permanents," by
Microscopic Description and Comment:
Microscopic examination substantiates the above cited diagnosis.

History:
The patient is a year old man with localized prostate carcinoma. Operative
procedure: Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node

dissection.

Specimen(s) Received:

A: LYMPH NODES, BILATERAL PELVIC
B: PROSTATE

 

Gross Description
The specimens are received in two formalin—filled containers, each labeled

The first container is labeled "prostate." It contains a
previously sectioned and inked 37-gram prostate with attached bilateral seminal
vesicles. The prostate measures 4.5 x 4.5 x 2 cm. The right seminal vesicle
measures 1.5 x l x 0.3 cm; the left, 1 x l x 0.5 cm. The prostate shows
elliptical defects measuring 2.5 cm on either side, representing tissue taken
for tumor bank. Sectioned to show a 0.7 cm tan—white nodule in the right base,
within 0.1 cm of the inked margin. Sectioning the area of the right apex also
shows a well—defined, tan—white nodule measuring 1 cm, abutting the inked
margin and suspicious for carcinoma. Sectioning the left lobe shows a tan-white
to tan—yellow cut surface. Sectioning the bilateral seminal vesicles shows
tan-yellow cut surfaces. Labeled Al, A2 - right apex; A3, A4 — right base; A5,
A6 — left apex; A7, A8 — left base; A9 - left apical margin (perpendicular); A10
— right apical margin (perpendicular); All — bladder neck margin (shave); A12 —
left seminal vesicle; A13 — right seminal vesicle. Jar l.
The second container is labeled "bilateral pelvic lymph node." It contains two
fragments of tan—yellow fibroadipose tissue, the larger measuring 4.5 x 2.5 x
0.7 cm; the smaller, 4 x 2 x 0.5 cm. Sectioned to show two fat-infiltrative
lymph nodes with tan—yellow cut surfaces. Labeled Bl, BZ - one node; B3 to B6 —
one node. Jar 1.

B. PROSTATE:
SYNOPTIC WORKSHEET - PROSTATE CARCINOMA

NEOPLASM
A neoplasm is present

HISTOPATHOLOGIC TYPE
The tumor type is adenocarcinoma, acinar type

INTRAGLANDULAR TUMOR EXTENT

The intraglandular tumor extent (reported as percent of prostate gland involved
by carcinoma) is lO—l5%.

GLEASON'S GRADE
The Gleason's Grade is 4+ 4 = 8 with tertiary pattern of 3.

TUMOR LOCATION

The location of the tumor involves the
right base
right apex

PERINEURAL INVASION
Perineural Invasion is identified

VASCULAR INVASION
Focal lymphvascular space invasion identified (seen on slide A4)

EXTRAPROSTATIC EXTENSION

Patienwm-I—
;_1-__ _______ lire

Extraprostatic (extracapsular) extension is absent

 

SEMINAL VESICLES
Seminal vesicles are free of tumor

SAMPLED SPECIMEN MARGINS
All sampled surgical margins are free of tumor

METASTATIC LYMPH NODES
The lymph nodes are as follows (expressed as the number of metastatic nodes in
relation to the total number of nodes examined)
Bilateral pelvic: 0/2
PRIMARY TUMOR (T)
Tumor involves more than one—half of one lobe but not both lobes (TZb)

REGIONAL LYMPH NODES (N)
No regional lymph node metastasis (N0)

DISTANT METASTASIS
Distant metastasis cannot be assessed (not evaluated by any modality) (MX)

STAGE GROUPING
Based on this information, the overall AJCC/UICC stage of the tumor is
TZ/NO/MO/Gleason score 4+4 =8 with tertiary pattern of 3 (Stage II)

The pathologic stage assigned here should be regarded as provisional, and may
change after integration of clinical data not provided with this specimen.

The performance characteristics of some immunohistochemical stains, fluorescence
in— situ hybridization tests and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry cited in
this report (if anv) were determined by the _

‘ part of an ongoing quality assurance program and in
compliance with federally mandated regulations drawn from the Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Act of 1988 (CLIA '88). Some of these tests rely on the
use of "analyte specific reagents" and are subject to specific labeling
requirements by the US Food and Drug Administration. Such diagnostic tests may
only be performed in a facility that is certified by the Department of Health
and Human Services as a high complexity laboratory under CLIA '88. The FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used
for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for
research. Nevertheless, federal rules concerning the medical use of analyte
specific reagents require that the following disclaimer be attached to the
