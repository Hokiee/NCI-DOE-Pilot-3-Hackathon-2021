Clinical History

The patient is __-_,_______ man. Review of the electronic medical record reveals a positive
family history of prostate cancer. The patient has been followed for many years with serial PSA
testing, which was steadily rising WHEN“)! lead to ultrasound needle
core biopsies of the prostate performed at and reviewed at * in
consultation , confirming the diagnoSIs or prostatic aueuocarcinoma, Gleason grade 4+4, of
the left Iatera ase. A subsequent bone scan was negative, and the patient undergoes a radical
prostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection.

Gross Description

The specimen is received in three parts, each labeled with the patient‘s name and medical record
number.

Part A, additionally labeled "right pelvic lymph nodes," consists of a single irregular, unoriented
segment of soft, yellow-tan, fibrofatty tissue (5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm). Three firm, ovoid, pink~tan lymph
node candidates (1.5-2.0 cm) are identified. The entire specimen is submitted as follows:

A1: One lymph node candidate, bisected.
A2: One lymph node candidate, bisected.
A3: One lymph node candidate, bisected.
A4: Remaining fibrofatty remnant. .—

Part B, additionally labeled "left pelvic lymph nodes," consists of two segments of soft, irregular,
unoriented, yellow-tan fibrofatty tissue (4 x 3.5 x 1 cm in aggregate). Six ovoid to irregular, pink-tan,
soft lymph node candidates (0.4-2.3 cm) are identified. The entire specimen ls submitted as follows:
Bl—BZ:0ne lymph node candidate, bisected.

B3: Two lymph node candidates, bisected.
B4: Three lymph node candidates, Intact.
BS: Remaining fibrofatty remnant.

Part C, additionally labeled "prostate and BSV,” consists of a radical prostatectomy specimen (35 gm; 4
cm from apex to base it 4.5 cm in width x 3 cm from anterior to posterior) with attached seminal
vesicle/v35 deferens bundles (right 4 x 2 x 0.5 cm, left 5 x 2 x 0.5 cm).

GROSS PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: There is a single solid, white, roughly lobular tumor (1.8 x 0.6 x 1.5
cm) noted in the left lateral mid gland through base (slices 4-8) which abuts the lateral capsule in all
involved slices. No other masses or lesions are identified. The remaining peripheral tissue is pink-tan
and semi-porous. The central-transitional zone is slightly lobular and makes up approximately 20% of
total gland volume. The anterior fibrous stroma is open. The remaining capsule has been surgically
incised and sutured closed prior to receipt in Pathology.
