.TL‘GA—CJ—4641
(A) LEFT KIDNEY: I

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (9.5 CM MAXIMUM DIMENSION), CONVENTIONAL TYPE (40% CLEAR CELLS, 60%
EOSINOPHILIC CELLS). FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 4, lNVASIVE INTO RENAL VEIN AND RENAL

SINUS ADIPOSE TISSUE. (SEE COMMENT)
Margins of resection free of tumor.
Adrenal gland, no tumor present.

COMMENT

The renal cell carcinoma shows few loci of rhabdoid cells. There are a few small tool with spindling of cells. however. an unequivocal
sarcomatoid component is not present. Mulllfocal necrosis is present.

The renal cell carcinoma is invasive into the proximal segment of the renal vein; however, the renal vein margin of resection is free of
tumor. Tumor also invades into the renal sinus. Perinephric adipose tissue is free of tumor.

 

RROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT KIDNEY - An 18.0 x 9.5 x 7.0 cm radical nephrectomy specimen. There is a 9.5 x 8.0 x 7.0 cm lobulated. poorly
circumscribed. hemorrhagic and necrotic mass located in the lower and mid pole. Focal areas within this mass are pink—tan and have
a ﬂeshy appearance. The remainder of the tumor is red-brown to yellow. The tumor invades and ﬁlls the proximal portion of the renal
vein. and is located 1.0 cm from the renal vein margin. The renal artery and ureter are grossly free of tumor. The tumor grossly
appears to involve the renal sinus. The perinephric adipose tissue appears to be free of tumor.

The uninvolved renal parenchyma is red-tan and grossly unremarkable.

Also present is a 1.5 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm grossly unremarkable adrenai gland.

lNK CODE: Blue — perirenai adipose tissue.
SECTION CODE: A1, renal vein, renal artery. ureter margin; A2-A4. tumor in renal vein; A5, A6. tumor invading renal sinus; A7. A8,

tumor with tan-pink ﬂeshy areas; A9—A13. additional sections of tumor, including sections with perinephric lat; A14, grossly normal

renal parenchyma; A15. adrenal gland. representative section.
Portion of the tumor was submitted for the Vascihe protocol. as well as a portion of the tumor is submitted for electron microscopy.
