CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant corpus uteri. Pertinent clinical history: grade 2 to 3 endometrial
adenocarcinoma for B and C. Procedure is laparoscopic total hysterectomy with
bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy. '

  
  

      
  

   

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Uterine serosal biopsy (AF1)", received fresh for frozen section diagnosis
is a 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm fragment of soft brown tissue which is placed in
formalin on The remnant is resubmitted in its entirety in
block Al.

B. "Left common iliac lymph node (BF1)", received fresh for frozen section
diagnosis is a 4 x 3.8.x 0.9 cm aggregate of tissue. A 2 x 2 x 0.4 cm lymph
node candidate was frozen as BFl and resubmitted as Bl. The remaining tissue

is sectioned and submitted in its entirety in 82-3.

C. "Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries", received is a 254 gram, 10.5 x 8 x 5.5
cm bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen with attached cervix (4 cm in
diameter with a 0.6 cm patent os) . The serosal surface is remarkable for
innumerable brown, red and white irregularities which stud the serosal
surface. The endocervical canal (3 cm in in length x 0.5 cm in diameter) is

posterior cervix). The cervix does not appear to be involved with the
irregular white masses. The endometrial canal (8 cm in length x 4 cm from
cornu to cornu) is red and hemorrhagic and demonstrates innumerable white
irregular lesions. Sectioning the endometrium demonstrates a 0.1 cm
endometrium overlying a 1.8 cm myometrium with innumerable white, nodular,
invasive lesions. These lesions appear to extend through the myometrium to

the serosa. The lower uterine segment grossly appears to be involved (C3 5%
anterior lower uterine segment, C4 lower uterine segment). C5 and C6 are Egg
anterior and posterior endomyometrium respectively. C7 demonstrates serosal 5:3
nodules. ==n

The right tube (5.5 cm in length x 0.8 cm in diameter) is grossly unremarkable 5*

(C8) . The right ovary (3.2 x 2.1 x 0.6 cm) is white, cerebriform and grossly

The left tube (4 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter) is grossly unremarkable
(C10). The left ovary (8 cm, 2 x 2 x 0.6 cm) is white-tan cerebriform and is
grossly unremarkable (C11) .

D. "Left pelvic lymph nodes", received fresh and placed in formalin_
- is a 3.5 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm aggregate of fibroadipose tissue whic is
dissected for lymph nodes and submitted as follows:

Dl— two lymph node candidates
132— four lymph node candidates

E. "Right pelvic nodes", received is a 5 x 3.2 x 1.8 cm aggregate of
fibroadipose tissue which is placed in formalin . The
specimen is dissected for lymph nodes revealing one large lymph node candidate
(3.2 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm) which is grossly positive and submitted in its entirety
in El-4.

F. "Left periaortic lymph nodes”, received is a 5 x 3 x 2.8 cm aggregate of
lymph nodes. Five lymph nodes are identified ranging from 1 cm in greatest

G. "Left IP", received is a 4 x 3.5 x 1 cm fragment of fibroadipose tissue
which is placed in formalin Serial sectioning is
unremarkable in the fragment. section is submitted in G1.

H. "Right aortic", received fresh and placed in formalin on —
s ranging from 2.5 cm in greatest dimension to 4.8 cm in -

greatest dimension. Representative section of each lymph node is submitted in
Hl—4.

    

RATIVE CONSULTATION:
A. "Uterine serosal biopsy":AFl (in toto)-malignant undifferentiated neoplasm

B. "Left common":BFl (rep)-metastatic carcinoma (Dr. 1

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL FINDINGS:
The immunoperoxidase tests reported herein were developed and their

performance characteristics were determined by the _. >
' " F . Some of them may not be cleared or approved by

the U.S. food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such
clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical
purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. UTERUS, SEROSA (BIOPSY):
N
UNDIFFERENTIATED CARCINOMA.
B. LYMPH NODE, COMMON ILIAC, LEFT (BIOPSY):
ONE LYMPH NODE POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (l/l).

C. UTERUS AND EILATERAL OVARIES AND FALLOPIAN TUBES (HYSTERECTOMY AND
BILATERAL SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY):

UTERUS: 254 GRAMS
CARCINOMA OF THE ENDOMETRIUM:
TUMOR SITE:_DIFFUSE.

FIGO GRADE: 3.

TUMOR SIZE? 8 x 4 CM.
MAXIMUM DEPTH OF MYOMETRIAL INVASIONzTUMOR PENETRATES WALL To SEROSA
LYMPHATIC/VASCULAR INVASION: PRESENT, EXTENSIVE.
ADJACENT NON—NEOPLASTIC ENDOMETRIUM: EIN.
REMAINING MYOMETRIUM: No PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS.
CERVIX: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.
SEROSA: POSITIVE FOR CARCINOMA.
SPECIMEN MARGINS: NOT INVOLVED.

OVARY, LEFT: METASTATIC CARCINOMA IN LYMPHATIC/VASCULAR SPACES.
OVARY, RIGHT: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.
FALLOPIAN TUBES, BILATERAL: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.
vaOMMENT: A panel of immunoperoxidase stains was performed. The tumor cells
are reactive with cytokeratin, EMA (focally), and beta-catenin and nonreactive
with desmin and SMA. Scattered cells are reactive with CDlO. This

immunophenotype supports the above diagnosis. Appropriately reactive control
slides were examined.

D, LYMPH NODES, PELVIC, LEFT (BIOPSY):

FOUR LYMPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (0/4).
E. LYMPH NODE, PELVIC, RIGHT (BIOPSY):

ONE LYMPH NODE POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (l/l).
F. LYMPH NODES, PERIAORTIC, LEFT (BIOPSY): '

FIVE LYMPH NODES POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (5/5).
G. IP, LEFT (BIOPSY):

BENIGN FIBROADIPOSE.
NEGATIVE FOR MAIGNANCY.

H. LYMPH NODES, AORTIC, RIGHT (BIOPSY):

FOUR LYMPH NODES POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (4/4).

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).
