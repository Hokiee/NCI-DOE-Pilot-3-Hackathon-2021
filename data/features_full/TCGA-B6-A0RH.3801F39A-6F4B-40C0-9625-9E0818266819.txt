Left breast ca.

GROSSVEXAMINATION:
A. "Left breast". Container additionally labeled with patient's name, history
number and date. Fresh. A specimen from a left modified radical mastectomy.

changes are noted. Underlying the ellipse of skin is breast tissue with
overall measurements of 16.3 x 15.2 x 3.3 cm., and an attached axillary tail
measuring 12.0 x 8.5 x 1.7 cm. The deep surgical margin is inked in blue, and
the specimen is step sectioned. A 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. firm white mass is seen
underlying the skin ellipse at the medial edge of the areola at approximately
the 9:00 position. This mass is relatively well-defined, but does appear to
diffusely infiltrate into surrounding fat for a short distance along its outer
edges. The cut surface is white, firm, and homogeneous; no necrosis is grossly
identified. Tumor grossly extends to within 1.2 cm. of the deep surgical
margin. Portions of the tumor are submitted for estrogen and progesterone
receptor analysis, and additional portions are submitted to the tissue bank.
The remainder of the breast parenchyma is largely fatty, with interspersed,
unremarkable appearing fibrous white parenchyma. No additional lesions are
identified. Sections of the breast are submitted as follows:

Block A1 - nipple and areola.

Block A2 - skin overlying tumor, medial aspect of skin ellipse.
Block A3 - A4 - tumor.

Blocks A5 and A6 — tumor and adjacent breast tissue.

Block A7,A21,A22 — deep margin.

Block A8 - left upper inner quadrant.

Block A9 — left lower inner quadrant.

Block A10 - sections from 9:00 (medial) breast, adjacent to tumor.
Block All - left upper outer quadrant.

Block A12 - left lower outer quadrant.

The axillary tail is arbitrarily divided into three levels, with level 1 being
that cloSest to the breast. The axillary tail is examined for lymph nodes.
Several large but grossly benign nodes are identified, and numerous smaller
nodes are present. Lymph node candidates are submitted as follows: '

Block A13 - lymph node candidates from Level 1, with single large node inked
and bisected.

Block A14 - single large lymph node from Level 1.

Block A15 - lymph node candidates from Level 1.

Block A16 — lymph node candidates from Level 1.

Block A17 - lymph node candidates from Level 2, a single large node inked
and bisected.

Block A18 - lymph node candidates from Level 2. ‘_ H

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
The predominant part of the tumor has a cribriform pattern, and that includes
the infiltrating part of the carcinoma. The tumor cells are characterized by
moderately pleomorphic nuclei with prominent nucleoli. The mitotic rate varies
from area to area, but 2—3 mitosis are observed in some high power fields. The

cells, but a classic comedo carcinoma is not identified. In some areas, a
minor component of infiltrating tubular carcinoma is identified. Abundant
desmoplastic stromal response accompanies the infiltrating neoplasm. In areas,
lymphatic vessels within the breast parenchyma adjacent to the tumor, contain
malignant cells. Adjacent to the tumor, intraductal carcinoma (cribriform
papillary types), is seen in focal areas.

 

In a random section from the upper—outer quadrant (Block All), there is a
focus of atypical ductal hyperplasia. No frank ductal, intraductal or
infiltrating carcinoma is observed at this site.

COMMENT:
The histologic pattern of this carcinoma, is similar to the so-called
cribriform ductal carcinoma. The nuclei of the cancer cells, however, are

lesion may be better regarded as infiltrating breast carcinoma of no special
type because of the degree of atypia present.
