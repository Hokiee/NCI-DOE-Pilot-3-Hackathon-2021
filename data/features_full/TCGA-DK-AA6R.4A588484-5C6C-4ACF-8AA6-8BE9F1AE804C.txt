Gross Description:

1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section
diagnosis, and is labeled "Right distal ureter". It consists of
a fragment of white—tan tissue surrounded by adipose. The entire
specimen is submitted for frozen section diagnosis.

Summary of sections:
FSC - frozen section control

2) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section
diagnosis, and is labeled "Left perivesicle lymph nodes". It
consists of a tiny piece of rubbery tan tissue measuring 3.0 x

1.2 x 1.0 cm. It is bisected, and half is submitted for frozen
section..

Summary of sections:
FSC — frozen section control
U — undesignated remaining unfrozen tissue

3) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Bladder, Prostate,
Seminal Vesicles and Perivesicle Lymph Nodes". It consists of a
cystoprostatectomy specimen measuring 14 x 11 x 5 cm and
consisting of a urinary bladder, attached segments of bilateral
ureters, prostate, seminal vesicles, vasa deferentia and
perivesicle adipose tissue. The bladder measures 6 x 5 cm.
Attached segment of the right ureter measures 3 cm in length and
up to 1 cm in diameter. A segment of left ureter measures 3 cm
in length and 0.4 cm in diameter. The right lateral wall of the
bladder shows an ulcerated, focally necrotic tumor measuring 3.5
x 2 x 1 cm. The tumor extends to the trigone and to the
prostatic urethra. The right ureteral orifice is 0.2 cm from the
tumor. It is markedly edematous, congested and the ureter
proximal to it is dilated. The tumor has a maximum thickness of
1 cm and appears to extend through the entire wall into the
periprostatic fat. The right ureter shows focally hemorrhagic
and granular mucosal surface. The left ureteral orifice and the
left ureteral mucosa are grossly unremarkable. The remainder of
the bladder mucosa is congested and edematous.

The specimen is received fresh and labeled Prostate and Seminal
Vesicles. It consists of a radical prostatectomy specimen which
includes prostate, seminal vesicles, and portions of right and
left vasa deferentia. The specimen weighs 42 gm. The prostate
measures 3.6 cm from apex to base, 5.4 cm transversely, and 3.5
cm from anterior to posterior. The right seminal vesicle
measures 3.4 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm and the left seminal vesicle measures
2.8 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm. The external surface of the prostate is
smooth. The prostate is serially sectioned from apex to base at

approximately 3 mm intervals. 100% of the prostate tissue is
submitted.

Summary of Sections:

RA - right apical margin

LA — left apical margin

EN - bladder neck margin

RSV - right vas deferens and seminal vesicle
LSV - left vas deferens and seminal vesicle
RP - right prostate (apex to base — A to Z)
LP — left prostate (apex to base — A to Z)
BN - bladder neck

RUM - right ureteral margin

RU — right ureter, granular mucosa
