FINAL DIAGNOSIS: .
PART 1: W2 O'CLOCK, SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY —

INMASIMEQWNDMA..NO SPECIAL TYPE.

NOTTINGHAM GRADE 2 (TUBAL FORMATION: 2, NUCLEAR PLEOMORPHISM: 2, MITOTIC ACTIVITY: 2;
TOTAL SCORE 6/9).

THE INVASIVE TUMOR MEASURES 1.5 CM IN LARGEST DIMENSION.

LYMPHOVASCULAR SPACE INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), NUCLEAR GRADE 2, CRIBRIFORM TYPE WITH COMEDO NECROSIS.
THE DCIS CONSTITUTES 20% OF THE TOTAL TUMOR VOLUME AND IS PRESENT ADMIXED WITH AND
AWAY FROM THE INVASIVE COMPONENT.

MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA; INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS 0.5 CM FROM THE NEAREST
(SUPERIOR) MARGIN.

FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES, COLUMNAR CELL CHANGE, AND DUCTAL EPITHELIAL HYPERPLASIA.
PREVIOUS BIOPSY SITE CHANGES.

INVASIVE TUMOR CELLS ARE POSITIVE FOR ESTROGEN AND PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS AND
NEGATIVE FOR HER-ZINEU BY FISH _

K. PATHOLOGIC STAGE: pT1c, pN1a, pMX.
