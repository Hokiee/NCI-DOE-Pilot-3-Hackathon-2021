in 11 parts, ea: I abeled with the patient's i

Part 1, "rectus muscles", consists of one fragment of red/tan/brown soft tissue
(2.5 x 2.3 x 1.5 cm) grossly consistent with skeletal muscle. The entire

specimen is submitted for special studies.

Part 2, "omental tumor mass w FS", consists of one fragment of yellow/tan/pink
fibroadipose tissue (34 x 8 x 4 cm) with multiple firm, yellow/white nodules
(up to 6 cm). A representative section of one nodule is frozen and submitted
as "FSA". Representative nodules are submitted for special studies and tumor
bank. Some of the nodules have areas of hemorrhage and necrosis.
Representative sections are submitted.

Micro 1 — FSA remnant, l frag, -
Micro 2 w omental tumor mass, 1 frag, -

Part 3, ”tumor from stomach", consists of a 5 x 4 x 4 cm fragment of
yellow/tan/white fibroadipose tissue with a 3.2 x 3 x 1.6 cm firm, white/tan,
ill—defined mass. Representative sections are submitted.

Micro 3 — tumor from stomach, 3 frags,-

Part 4, "right tube and ovary", consists of a 5.3 x 4.0 x 1.9 cm ovary and

fallopian tube. The fallopian tube (approximately 8.8 x 1.1 cm} has areas of
edema and adhesions to a 3.1 x 1.6 x 1.4 cm ovary. Thar are multiple papillary
excrescences in the adnexal tissue. Representative sections are submitted.

Micro 4—6 — right tube and ovary, 1-2 frags each, -

Part 5, "left tube and ovary", consists of a 5.0 x 1.0 cm fimbriated edematous
fallopian tube, a 2.6 x 1.4 x 1.3 cm ovary and associated adnexal tissue. The
ovary has a yellow/white. slightly rough, nodular surface. There are multiple
tan, papillary excrescences (up to 0.4 cm) throughout the adnexa.
Representative sections are submitted.

Micro 7—9 ~ left tube and ovary, 1—2 frags each,-

Part 6, "cul de sac tumor", consists of multiple fragments of firm,
yellow/white, hemorrhagic tissue (6 x 5 x 2 cm in aggregate) . Representative

sections are submitted.
Micro 10—11 - cul de sac tumor, 3 frags each, -

Part 7, "uterus and cervix”, consists of a 98g hysterectomy specimen (9 x 6 x 4
cm in overall dimensions) which has a rough, nodular, focally hemorrhagic
serosal surface and a subserosal leiomycma (2 cm}. The exocervix (3.1 cm in
diameter) has a 0.7 cm slit—like os leading to a 2.4 x 1.0 cm endocervical
canal. The endocervix has a tan, glistening herringbone—like appearance.

The endometrium (4.4 cm from cornu to cornu, 4.5 cm in length and 0.2 cm in
thickness) is tan and glistening with multiple polyps (from 0.1 to 2.5 cm).

The myometrium (1.3 cm in average thickness) has an intramural leiomyoma (0.6

cm) . Representative sections are submitted.

“Part 8, “cul de sac tumor II", consists of two fragments of white/tan/yelIOIw
soft tissue with a papillary, friable texture (in aggregate 5 x 4.2 x 2.1 cm).
Representative sections are submitted.

 

Micro 19 — cul de sac tumor II, 3 frags,

TOM—304862

 

Part 9, "tumor on appendix", consists of a 2. x .1 x 1.1 cm fragment 0
white/tan, papillary appearing, firm tissue. Representative sections ar
submitted.

Micro 20 — tumor on appendix, 2 frag-

Part 10, "appendix and tumor", consists of a 4.5 x 3 x 2.3. cm multiloculated
cystic mass filled with green and tan mucinous fluid. Near the re-section
margin is a 1 x l x 1 cm area of white/tan, nodular, firm tissue. The
resection margin of the appendix is 0.6 cm in diameter and has an obliterated
lumen. Representative sections are submitted.

Micro 21 — resection margin & possible tip, 2 trays,-
Micro 22 — appendix 3: tumor, 3 frags, -

Part 11, "umbilical hernia sac", consists of a 3.9 x 2.5 x 0.7 cm fragment of
yellow/tan, hemorrhagic soft tissue. Representative sections are submitted.
