Comment

Sections show a hypercellular tumor with marked atypia, areas of necrosis and increased mitosis.
The above ﬁndings are compatible with a diagnosis of ieiomyosarcome.

Uterine ieiomyoearooma.

Gross Description

A. The specimen is received fresh labeled "uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries" and consists of a
1319 gram, markedly distorted, 17.2 x 9.8 x 13.4 cm, suprecervical uterus with attached adnexa. The
serosa is focally shaggy and congested on the right lateral wall and fondue. 0n opening, there is a
eubmucosal polyp distorting the endometrial cavity, Sectioning reveals a 14.9 x 9.8 cm, lobulated,
focally congested, glistening, tan gray tumor with approximately 15% necrosis. The tumor extends up
to the disrupted serose at the right cornu. The endometrial surface is glistening, tan and 0.1 cm in
thickness. The myometrium is dense, tan gray and 3.2 cm in thickness. It contains 3 intramural,
bulging, whorled, dense, gray white nodules which measure up to 5.0 cm. The 6.5 cm right faliopian

tube is edematous, purple gray. Sectioning reveals a patent Ramon. The 2.5 x 1.8 x 1.1 cm right ovary-
is smooth, tabulated, tan grey. Sectioning reveals a dense, tan, grey stroma. The
previously-transected, 8.5 cm left fallopian tube is smooth to shaggy, purple grey. Sectioning reveals
a dilated lumen filled with tan yellow material. The 2.7 x 2.5 x 1.6 cm left ovary is smooth to shaggy,
purple gray. Sectioning reveals a 1.5 cm hemorrhagic subcorticel cyst. The stroma is dense, purple
gray. Representative sections are submitted as labeled:

A1-A5: Full-thickness tumor to disrupted serosa
A6«A7: Turner to adjacent endometrium

A8: Turner to serosa at fundue

A9: Tumor to adjacent myometrium

A10: Largest myometrial nodule

A11: Smailer myomeirial nodules

A12: Lower uterine segment

A13: Right ovary and fallopian tube

AM—MS: Left ovary and fallopian tube

A16—A1 7: Right parametrium
