PART #1: TOTAL THYROID AND CENTRAL NECK
Dictated:

The specimen is received fresh, labeled with the patient‘s name, xxxx, and designated
'Total Thyroid and Central Neck.’ The specimen consists of a complete intact thyroid
weighing 18.3 grams and measures 8.0 x 4.0 x 0.8 cm in total. The specimen has been
oriented with a stitch to indicate the tumor nodule. The posterior surface is inked black
and the anterior surface orange. The specimen is serially sectioned from superior to
inferior to reveal a tan nodule with inﬁltrative borders and cystic areas that measure 2.6 x
1.6 x 1.1 cm located in the isthmus lobe. The nodule grossly abuts the posterior margin.
Sectioning through the remainder of the right and leﬁ lobes does not reveal any other
grossly identiﬁable nodules. The right lobe measures 3.6 x 2.1 x 0.8 cm and the left 2.0 x
2.1 x 0.5 cm. The isthmus measures 3.0 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm. The thyroid specimen also comes
with a small central neck dissection measuring 1.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. The soﬁ tissue is
submitted in its entirety, although no grossly identiﬁable lymph nodes are seen. The
specimen is submitted in its entirety.
