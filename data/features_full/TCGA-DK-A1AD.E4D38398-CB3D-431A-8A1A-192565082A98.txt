Gross Description:

1) The specimen is received fresh, labeled “Bladder, prostate. seminal vesicles, urachus, perivesical nodes. urethra". It
consists of a 6.0 x 5.5 x 4.7 cm bladder with a 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm attached prostate. The specimen is opened anteriorly to reveal a
4.0 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm tan-white, inﬁltrative tumor, present in the right-inferior aspect of the bladder. The surface of the lesion is
ulcerated. The lesion is 1.8 cm from the urethral resection margin. Additionally. there is a 1.2 x 1.0 cm ulcerated area present in
the junction of bladder and urethral mucosa. The mucosal surface of the dome, left aspect of the bladder is grossly without lesions.
The perivesical adipose tissue is grossly unremarkable. The left ureter is opened to reveal tan-pink, smooth mucosal surfaces.
The right side ureter is possibly obliterated by the tumor and is grossly not identiﬁed. The prostate is cut to reveal tan, soft cut
surfaces. No additional tumor is grossly seen. Multiple possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed in the perivesical adipose tissue. The
specimen is photographed and TPS is sampled. Representative sections are submitted.

The prostate weighs 68 grams. The prostate measures 3.8 cm from apex to base, 4.0 cm transversely, and 3.2 cm from anterior to
posterior. The right and left seminal vesicles measure 4.0 x 2.3 cm and 4.0 x 2.0 cm, respectively. The external surface of the
prostate is smooth. The prostate is inked (right - green; left - blue) and ﬁxed in formalin overnight. The prostate is serially
sectioned from apex to base at approximately 3 mm intervals. The prostate is entirely submitted.

Summary of Sections:

UR - urethral area

LUR - left ureter

TUR - tumor to urethra

T - tumor

8 - random sections of bladder
RA - right apical margin

LA - left apical margin

BN - bladder neck margin

RSV- right seminal vesicle

LSV - left seminal vesicle

A—G - serial sections of prostate (apex to base)
PLN - Possible lymph nodes

2) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Right vas deferens". It consists of a tubular shaped fragment of vas
deferens surrounded by adipose tissue, measuring 3 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. Representative sections are submitted.

Summary of sections:
U - undesignated

3) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left vas deferens". It consists of a tubular shaped fragment of vas
deferens measuring 3 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. Representative sections are submitted.

Summary of sections:
U - undesignated

4) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left pelvic lymph nodes". It consists of multiple fragments of adipose
tissue measuring in aggregate 3 x 2 x 0.6 cm. Entirely submitted for all of the possible lymph nodes.

Summary of sections:
U - undesignated

5) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Right pelvic lymph nodes". It consists of multiple pieces of adipose tissue
measuring in aggregate 6 x 4 x 1 cm. Multiple lymph nodes are identiﬁed ranging from 0.5 up to 2 cm in greatest dimension. The
largest lymph node is bisected. The nodes are entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
LN - lymph nodes

6) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Right hypogastric lymph nodes". It consists of two lymph nodes ranging
from 1 up to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. The nodes are entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
LN - lymph nodes

7) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left distal ureter". It consists of a fragment of unremarkable ureter
surrounded by adipose tissue. The ureter measures 1.5 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter. Representative sections are
submitted.

Summary of sections:
LU — left ureter

8) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Right distal ureter". It consists of a fragment of unremarkable ureter
surrounded by adipose tissue. The ureter measures 2 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. Representative sections are submitted.

Summary of sections:
RU —- right ureter
