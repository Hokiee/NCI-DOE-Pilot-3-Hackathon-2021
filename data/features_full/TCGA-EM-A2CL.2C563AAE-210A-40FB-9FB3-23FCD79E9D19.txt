Gross Description

The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "Soft Tissue: Left thwoid lobe and isthmus"
consists of a left hemithyroidectomy specimen that is not oriented and weighs 15.3 g. The lobe
measures 5.3 cm SI x 2.8 cm ML x 1.8 cm AP and the isthmus measures 2.2 SI x 1.3 cm ML x
0.9 cm AP. The external surfaces have fibrous adhesions. No parathyroid glands or lymph
nodes are identified grossly. The external surface is painted with silver nitrate. The lower pole of
the lobe contains a well delineated nodule that measures 2.5 cm SI x 2.3 cm ML x 1.8 cm AP.
The remainder of the thyroid tissue is unremarkable. Sections of nodule and normal tissue are
stored frozen. The remainder of the specimen is submitted as follows:

1A-J lobe, superior to inferior
1K-M isthmus
