COMMENT

a .

Both the right and left ovaries are replaced by a poorly
differentiated papillary serous adenocarcinoma. The tumor shows a
predominant papillary and cribriform architecture but also shows
significant areas of solid proliferation. Cystic areas lined by
flattened layers of tumor.cells are also present. The tumor cells
are large with marked cellular and nuclear pleomorphism. and
modeiate amounts of granular eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic'
figures are numerous and foci of necrosis are easily identified
Focal areas also show clear cell differentiation.

Surg. Path. ho.:

 

The tumor grossly and microscopically invOlved the surfaces of the
ovaries, the mesovarium. and microscopically also involved the
left fallopian tube. The thickened areas on the uterine serosa
noted grossly represented foci of metastatic tumor. Many of the
regional lymph nodes were replaced by tumor, and some or the
nodules showed no identifiable residual lymph node tissue, and may
represent sort tissue metastases.
