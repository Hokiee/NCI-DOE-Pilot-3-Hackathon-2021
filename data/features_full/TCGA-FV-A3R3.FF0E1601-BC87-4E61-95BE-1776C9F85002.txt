COMMENTS:

There is a hepatocellular neoplasm with prominent atypia involving the partial resection of liver. The neoplasm is positive for keratin CAM5.2 and Hepar.
There is a focus positive for CK7. CKZO is negative. Reticulin stain show disruption of the reticulin ﬁbers which are located predomiantly in ﬁbrovascular
areas. The liver parenchyma in the non-tumor areas shows normal staining pattern with reticulin. There is no increase in staining with iron or trichrome.
The neoplasm is a hepatoceliular carcinoma. It does not have features of ﬁbroiamellar type.

This case has been reviewed by D who are in agreement with the diagnosis.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

Specimen is received fresh labeled with the patient's name and consists of a 1.5 kilogram, 20.0 x 16.0 x 11.5 cm portion of liver

received with attached gallbladder. The gallbladder is 11.5 x 5.5 x 3.0 cm. The serosa is purple-gray and glistening. On opening, the lumen contains
dark green viscid bile along with multiple yellow—tan multifaceted choleliths aggregating to 7.5 x 3.0 x 1,5 cm. Some are present near the cystic duct. The
liver is partially surfaced by pink-tan smooth and glistening to focally shaggy capsule. Exposed parenchyma is identiﬁed at the margin. This margin is
inked. the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal an 18.0 x 12.0 x 9.5 cm encapsulated, nodular mass that abuts the liver capsule and approaches to
within 1.5 cm of the inked parenchymal margin. This mass features a yellow~tan friable, focally hemorrhagic cut surface with areas of yellow—green
discoloration. This mass is present at the gallbladder bed however invasion into the gallbladder is not present. Normal appearing pink-tan liver
parenchyma is present near the margin. Additional masses are not identified. Representative sections are submitted for frozen section with the residual
entirely resubmitted for permanent section in cassettes 1 and 2 labeled designated as follows: 1--tissue previously designated FSA1
(region 48): 2--tissue previously designated FSA2 (region 5). Additional lep.ese..._...e sections are submitted in cassettes 3-12 designated as follows:
3—cystic duct margin; 4 and 5--mass to gallbladder; Gwadditional parenchymai margin, perpendicular; 7—mass to normal hepatic parenchyn ‘ "nd liver
capsule; 8 and Q—edditional mass to liver capsule; 10—12~—additionai mass. Additionally, a yellow green and blue cassette are submitted for L,
research each labeled '
