Gross Descrlmn

1. The specimen labeled with the patients name and as "right lobe", consists of a right hemithyroidectomy specimen that
is oriented with a stitch at the upper pole and weighs 7.1 g. The lobe measures 3.4 cm SI x 2.5 cm ML x 1.5 cm AP and
the Isthmus measures 1.5 SI x 0.2 cm ML x 0.2 cm AP. The external surfaces have ﬁbrous adhesions and are painted
with liquid bluing. No parathyroid glands and/or lymph nodes are identiﬁed grossly. The lower pole contains one
delineated nodule(s) that measure 1,4 cm SI x 1.3”cm ML x 1.2 cm AP. The remainder of the thyroid tissue is grossly
normal. Sections of nodule and normal tissue are stored frozen. The remainder of the specimen is submitted as follows:
