DIAGNOSIS

(A) RiGHT KiDN EY:

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA:
- CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR CELL) TYPE,
- FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3,
- 10.4 X 7.0 X 5.0 CM,
- INVADING THE RENAL VEIN.
Resection margins (renai veln, renal artery, ureter and perirenai soft tissue), no tumor present.

(B) RIGHT ADRENAL GLAND:
Adrenal gland, no tumor present.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) RIGHT KIDNEY - A radicai nephrectomy specimen (24.0 x 13.0 x 6.5 cm), includes: the right kidney (15.5 x 8.5 x 5.0 cm), a segment of
the renal artery, the renal vein, and ureter (14.0 cm in length and 0.2 cm average diameter). The adrenal gland is not present with the
specimen.

There is a 10.4 x 7.0 x 5.0 cm welt-circumscribed tumor in the lower pole of the kidney. The tumor is yellow with focal areas of
hemorrhage and myxold change. No distinct necrosis is identifled. The tumor does not appear to invade the renal sinus, renal pelvis or
the perinephrio adipose tissue. The tumor extends to the renal vein but it does not involve the renal vein margin. The tumor does not

extend to Gerota's fascia.
The adjacent kidney parenchyma is unremarkable. The pelvicaiyceal system is smooth and devoid of lesions. No lymph nodes are

identified in the hilum of the kidney.
Portions of the kidney are submitted for electron microscopy (on hold). Portions of the tumor and normal kidney are submitted in a
sterile fashion for research purposes.

INK CODE:

Black - Gerota's fascia.

SECTION CODE:

A01, ureter and renal vein margin;

A02, renal veln thrombus;

A03, A04, normal appearing kidney;

A05, A06, tumor with relationship to renal pelvls;

A07, A08, tumor with relationship to Gerota's fascia;

A09-A13, representative sections of tumor
(B) RIGHT ADRENAL - An adrenal gland with surrounding fat (10.5 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm). The adrenal gland measures 4.5 x 3.5 x 1.7 and

weighs 15.0 grams. Serial sectioning revealed rossly unremarkable adrenal cortex and medutla. Representative sections are submitted
in three cassettes (80% of the adrenal gland).

CLINICAL HISTQRY
