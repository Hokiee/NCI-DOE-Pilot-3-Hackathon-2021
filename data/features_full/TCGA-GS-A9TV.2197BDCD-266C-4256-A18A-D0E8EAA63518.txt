CERVICAL LEI-‘l' LYMPH NODE:
Lymph node of 2 x 1,2 x 0,6 cm. The cut surface is whitish and
homogeneous.

CERVICAL LYMPH NODE, EXCISION:
- PRIMARY MEDIASTINAL DIFFUSE LARGE B CELL LYMPHOMA

Histological sections show a lymph node with a proliferation of atypical large
cells forming nodules which are separated by some fibrosis bands. The
neoplastic cells have immunoblastic and Reed-Sternberg morphology,
forming clusters and extend to the perinodal adipose tissue.

The large cells are positive for CD20, PAXS, and partially for CD30 and
CD23, and are negative for C015. Several reactive T-cells are observed
(CD3+ CD5+). The Ki67 proliferation index is 40%. The in situ
hybridization for the Epstein—Barr virus (EBER) has been negative.
