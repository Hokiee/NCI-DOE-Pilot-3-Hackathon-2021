FINAL DIAGNOSIS
A. (Level 7 lymph node, dissection): Fragments of lymph nodes, negative for

malignancy.

B. (Level 11 lymph node, right, dissection): Fragments of lymph nodes,

negative for malignancy.

C. (Level 11 lymph node, right, dissection): One lymph node, negative for

malignancy. (0/1).

D. (Level 9 lymph node, right, dissection): One lymph node, negative for

malignancy. (0/1).
E. (Right lower lobe, lobectomy): Invasive adenocarcinoma with papillary
features, grade 3. Margins of resection are free of involvement. pTZaNO. See

note.

F. (Level 11 lymph node, dissection): Fragments of lymph nodes, negative for

malignancy.

6. (Level 10 right lymph node, dissection): Fragments of lymph nodes,

negative for malignancy.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION

E. FROZEN: RIGHT LOWER LOBE: Adenocarcinoma with focal mucinous features.

Bronchial margin negative for tumor. (E91 bronchial margin, E92 tumor)

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. The specimen is labeled level 7 lymph node. Received are multiple
fragments of pink—tan soft tissue measuring in aggregate 2.7 x 1.4 x 0.6 cm.

The entire specimen is submitted in cassettes A1 and A2.

B. The specimen is labeled level 11 node, right. Received are multiple

fragments of tan lymphoid tissue measuring in aggregate 3.1 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm.

The entire specimen is submitted in cassettes Bl and El.

C. The specimen is labeled level 11 right lymph node. Received is a 0.6 x

0.3 x 0.3 cm lymph node. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette C1.

D. The specimen is labeled level 9 lymph node. Received fresh is a 0.8 x 0.5
x 0.5 cm lymph node. The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted in

cassette D1.

E. The specimen is labeled right lower lobe of lung. Received fresh for

frozen section analysis is a 21.5 x 12.5 x 2.7 cm right lower lung lobe. In

the lower posterior aspect of the lung there is a 3.4 x 2.1 x 1.9 cm firm

white lung mass. This lung mass measures 2.4 cm from the bronchial margin of

resection. The bronchi is opened showing a fungating tumor mass in its lumen.
The tumor measures 0.5 cm from the pleural resection margin. The adjacent

lung to the tumor has mucus plugs in the bronchi and is focally consodlidated.
There do not appear to be any additional nodules within the lung. The lung

at the upper aspect of the lobe (away from the tumor) is crepitant and

unremarkable in appearance. Representative sections are taken and submitted

as follows: E1, vascular margin; E2, bronchus with adjacent tumor; E3, vessels
with adjacent tumor; E4, tumor and adjacent normal; E5, tumor and inner

parenchymal lymph nodes; E6, consolidated lung adjacent to tumor; E7, normal

lung away from tumor; E8, hilar lymph node.

F. The specimen is labeled level 11 node. Received fresh is a 1.0 x 0.5 x
0.5 cm fragment of brown-tan lymph node with accompanying red-yellow
fibroadipose tissue. The lymph node is bisected and submitted entirely in

cassette F1.

G. The specimen is labeled level 10R. Received in formalin is a 0.5 x 0.2 x
0.2 cm brown-black possible fragment of lymph node with accompanying red soft

fibrous tissue. The entire specimen is submitted in cassette Gl.
