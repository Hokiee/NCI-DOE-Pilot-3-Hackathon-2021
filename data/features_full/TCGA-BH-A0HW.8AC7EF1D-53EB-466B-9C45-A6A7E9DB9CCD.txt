FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
PART 1: WM. 3 O’CLOCK. SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY -
A. ASIVg DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN PART NECROTIC WITH CRIBRIFORM PATTERN AND
MICROCALCIFICATION, NO HAM SCORE 6/9 (TUBULAR FORMATION 2, NUCLEAR GRADE 3, MITOSES
1) (tee comment).
8. THE TUMOR IS 2.0 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION.

C. THE TUMOR EXTENDS TO THE INKED POSTERIOR SURGICAL MARGIN, AND APPROACHES THE INKED

@ INFERIOR SURGICAL MARGIN WITHIN 0.1 CM (SLIDE 1A). THE OTHER SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF
TUMOR.

THE TUMOR IS REPORTED TO BE POSITIVE FOR ER. AND NEGATIVE FOR PR, AND NO AMPLIFICATION OF
HER-ZINEU

FIBROCYST CHANGES WITH FLORID DUCTAL EPITHELIAL HYPERPLASIA, ASSOCIATED
MICROCALCIFICATION AND REACTIVE FIBROSIS WITH HEMOSIDERIN PIGMENT AND FAT NECROSIS
INCIDENT TO PREVIOUS BIOPSY.

F. MICROSCOPIC PERLOBULAR HEMANGIOMA, INCIDENTAL (section 13).
G. SKIN WITH NO SIGNIFICANT HISTOPATHOLOGICAL ABNORMALITIES.

PART 2'. NEW INFERIOR POSTERIOR DEEP MARGIN. SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY -

A. MICROSCOPIC Focus OF RESIDUAL DUCTAL CARCINOMA WITH THERMAL ARTIFACTS ls PRESENT
(section 2A. m comm-m).

B. INKED RESECTION MARGINS (NEW MARGINS) ARE FREE OF TUMOR.
C. SKELETAL MUSCLE WITH NO SIGNIFICANT HISTOPATHOLOGICAL ABNORMALITY.

PART 3: SENTINEL LYMPH NODE NUMBER 1. RIGHT. BIOPSY -
ONE LYMPH NODE NEGATIVE FOR METASTATIC TUMOR (ZERO/ONE) (0/1).
