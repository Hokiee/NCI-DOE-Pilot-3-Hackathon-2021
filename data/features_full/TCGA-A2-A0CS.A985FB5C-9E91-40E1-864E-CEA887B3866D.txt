COMMENT:
The report is amended on to add the extent of extracapsular

extension of tumor in response to a request from the tumor board. The
measurement is the distance from the estimated location of the obliterated
lymph node capsule to the outer extent of the tumor deposit on the
microscopic slide.

wrap.

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY:
—year—old white female with left breast cancer.

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left breast cancer.

POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Operative Findings: Left breast cancer.
Post—Operative Diagnosis: Left breast cancer.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received fresh, labeled with the patient’ 5 name,

a designated "INTERPECTORAL NODE" consists of an apparent lymph node,
measuring 1. 3 x 0.9 x O. 6 cm. The node is bisected revealing firm, yellow
and tan tissue. One half of the specimen is submitted for the CBCP
protocol. The remaining half is submitted for permanent section.

B. Received fresh, labeled with the patient’ s name,

designated "LEFT BREAST AND AXILLARY CONTENTS" consists of a 508.0 gram
modified radical mastectomy specimen. The breast measures 17.5 x 14.5 x
3.8 cm, attached axillary contents measure 13.0 x 5.2 x 1.5 cm, and
overlying nipple-bearing skin measures 13.0 x 9.5 cm.

INK CODE: Blue=superior superficial, green=inferior superficial, and
black=deep.

The axillary contents are examined and disected from the breast and has
multiple palpable lymph nodes, many of which are suspcious for metastasis.

A large portion of the skin is covered with gauze dressing, which is
removed, revealing areas of retraction and ulceration (largest 2.2 x 1.6
cm) superior to the nipple/areolar complex, overlying a large palpable
tumor.

The breast is sectioned from the posterior aspect revealing a 7.0 x 5.1 x

3.5 cm tumor, which anteriorly erodes through the skin and posteriorly

involves a 3.0 x 2. 5 cm segment of skeletal muscle. The tumor is

centrally located and extends into the upper mid and upper inner portions
. of the breast. It has a firm, tan, gritty cut surface. The remaining
