Clinical Diagnosis & History:
Leiomyosarcoms abdominal/pelvic.

Specimens Submitted:

1: SP: Radical resection of pelvis and retroperitoneel sarcoma, sigmoid
resection and small bowel resection x 2 and resection of left ureter

2: SP: Left broad 1igament

3: SP: Distal small bowel

4: SP: Resection of sigmoid

DIAGNOSIS:

1) SOFT TISSUE, PELVIS AND RETROPERITONEUM, SIGMOID COLON, SMALL
BOWEL, AND LEFT URETER; RADICAL RESECTION:

- HIGH GRADE LEIOMYOSARCOMA, MEASURING 28 X 22 X 12 CM, WITH FOCAL
NECROSIS (15%, MICROSCOPIC
ASSESSMENT), AND A MITOTIC INDEX OF 28 MIT./10 HPF; MARGINS NOT INVOLVED.
- BENIGN SMALL AND LARGE BOWEL AND URETER.

NOTE: THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE TUMOR IN CONTEXT WITH THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED
IMMUNOPHENOTYPE FITS WELL WITH A LEIOMYOSARCOMA. A FEW

IMMUNOSTAINS
ARE PENDING TO VERIFY THE FINDINGS. RESULTS WILL BE REPORTED IN AN ADDENDUM.

2) SOFT TISSUE, LEFT BROAD LIGAMENT; RESECTION:
- BENIGN OVARY AND FALLOPIAN TUBE.

3) SMALL BOWEL, 915111.; Rsszcnon:
- BENIGN SEGMENT OF SMALL BOWEL wrm smousrnrosxs.

4) COLON, SIGMOID; RESECTION:
- BENIGN SEGMENT OF SIGMOID COLON.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL). AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

Gross Description:

1)The specimen is received fresh labeled, llradical resection of pelvic and
retroperitoneal sarcoma, sigmoid resection and small bowel resection x 2 and
resection of left ureter', and consists of one piece of irregularly shaped
unoriented tan white soft tissue that measures 28 x 22 x 12 cm. The entire
tumor is covered by a thin fibrous capsule and has a nodular appearance.
There is a segment of small bowel identified attached to one side of the
specimen that measuresll cm in length and 2 cm in diameter. External
surfaces of the tumor are inked black. Possible left ureter is identified
attached to one side of the specimen that measures 7 cm in length and 0.5 cm
in diameter. Attached to the other side of the tumor a segment of colon is
identified that measures 13 cm in length and 2 cm in diameter. The lumen of
the small bowel segment and colon are opened and no gross abnormalities are
identified on the mucosal surfaces. The tumor is grossly not involving the
wall of the small bowel loop or colon. Cut surface of the tumor is ten white
trabeculated and firm. Focal necrosis is identified that involves less than
10% of the tumor. Hemorrhagic foci are identified. Multiple cyst formation
is seen. Tissue is submitted to TPS. Gross photographs are taken.

2.) The specimen is received fresh labeled 'left broad ligament'I and
consists of a tan rubbery fibrous structure with attached fat measuring 4.6
x 3.5 x 1.3 cm. Sectioning reveals soft cut surface resembling ovarian
stroma with scanty firm foci. A portion of fallopian tube measuring 2 cm in
length by 0.5 cm in diameter is also present. Representative sections are
submitted for permanent.

Summary of sections:
U-undesignated
F fallopian tube

3.) The specimen is received fresh labeled “distal small bowel" and consists
of a portion of small bowel received closed at both ends without orientation
measuring 22 cm in length by 4.5 cm and both circumferential surgical

fibrotic. Opening reveals tan glistening unremarkable mucosa.
Representative sections are submitted.

4.) The specimen is received fresh labeled “resection of sigmoidI and
consists of a portion of colon received closed at one end and open at the
opposite and measuring 4.2 cm in length by 8.5 cm in circumference at both
circumferential margins. The open margin is inked blue and the closed margin
is inked green. Opening reveals tan glistening grossly unremarkable mucosa
and underlying muscularia appears thickened. Representative sections are
submitted.
