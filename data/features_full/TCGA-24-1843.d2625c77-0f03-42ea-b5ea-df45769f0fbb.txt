examination of the slide ‘ d in the diagnosis).
"‘Fieport Erectionicaily Reviewed and Signed Out By
lntraoperative Consultation:

An intraoperative non microscopic consultation was obtained and interpreted as: 'Brought to Irozen 'right tube and
ovary, peivic sidewall' consisting of a 77-gram, 7 x 4.5 x 3.2 cm ovary and fallopian tube. The ovary is replaced by a 7
cm tan—white mass with tumor on the sun‘ace. The fallopian tube is draped over the ovarian mass and appears normal.
Sections of the ovary show a solid iobulated mass. A portion is frozen as FS1A (surface inked for orientation). Also in

the container is an irregular 2.8 x 2 x 1.5 cm tan-white mass. A portion is froz ' n of lhe ovarian
mass and normal fallopian tube is taken tor-. Rest for permanents.‘

Gross Description;

The specimens are received in 12 formalin-filled containers, each labeled The first is additionally

labeled “anterior abdominal wall mass." It holds a solid piece of tan-white, firm, fibrous tissue measurin 3 x 2 x15
cm. Seclioned to show a yellow-brown solid cut surface with a central 0.2 cm cystic space. i

The second container is labeled "pelvic sidewall, right lube and ovary, FS1A/18/X." it holds two white tissue cassettes.
The first, labeled FS1A, holds a previously sectioned piece of fan tissue measuring 2 x1 x 0.1 cm. Labeled B1 (FSlA).
The second white tiesue cassette, labeled FSt B, holds a previously sectioned piece of ten fibroadipose tissue
measuring 2.2 x 0.5 x 0.1 cm. Labeled 82 (F51 B). Also in the container is a previously sectioned right fallopian tube
and ovary specimen as described above the intraoperative consultation. The specimen measures 7 x 4.5 x 3.2 cm and
has a focal area of black ink designating tumor on the ovarian surface. The cut surface is solid with a vaguely lobular
pattern separated by fibrous bands. The 5 X 0.5 cm fallopian tube is diffusely adhesed to the ovary and, on cut
surface. has an unremarkable 0.1 cm lumen. Also in the container is a previousty sampled piece of [an tissue
designated as tumor from the pelvic sidewall measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm. Labeled 83 and B4 — section of tumor in
area of surface ink; BS and BS — additional sections of tumor; B7 - tumor in relationship to fallopian tube; 88 — remainder
of pelvic side wall tumor.

The third container is labeled "bladder peritoneum." It holds multiple fragments of firm tan~white tissue measuring 4.5 x

Mot these fragments show firm while nodules consistent with involvement by metastatic tumor.

The fourth container is labeled “left pelvic sidewall." it holds multiple pieces of tan firm tissue consistent with
involvement by metastatic disease. These fragments measure 4 x 3 x 1.5 cm in aggregate.

The fifth container is labeled “left tube and ovary.“ It holds a 21-gram left ovary and fallopian tube specimen. The
ovary measures 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. The periovarian and peritubalsoll tissue is matted with a firm white nodule
opposite the fallopian tube ﬁmbria and measures 3 x 2 x 1.5 cm. The remainder of the 4.2 x 0.5 cm fallopian tube is
unremarkable with the exception of multiple paratubal cysts. Labeled E1 - mass in relationship to fallopian tube; E2 -
mass in relationship to ovary; E3 - ovary; E4 — additional sections of fallopian tube.

The sixth container is labeled ”small bowel tumor.‘ It holds an unorlenled piece of adhesed small bowel measuring 15
cm in length with a uniform diameter of 2.5 cm. Centrally located is a seroeal-based firm white mass measuring
approximately 4 cm in greatest dimension causing extensive bowel adhesions. On sectioning. the mass has a solid
white cut surface with local areas of central degeneration and encroaches onto the bowel lumen with gross evidence of
extension into the muscularis but not the mucosa. On opening, the small bowel mucosa has a normal folding pattern
with no mucosat—based lesions or masses. Labeled F1 and F2 - margins; F3 to F5 - mass in relationship to bowel wall.

The seventh container is labeled ”appendix.” it holds an 8.1 cm long appendix with attached mesoappendix measuring
1.5 cm in greatesl depth. The appendiceai across is studded with multiple white nodules, the largest located 1.5 cm
from the appendiceal tip and measures 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. The appendiceal diameter ranges from 0.6 in
the uninvolved areas to 1.2 cm in the involved areas. No appendices! perforations or serosal exudates are noted.
Sectioned to show an obliterated appendiceal lumen. Mufti le firm densities are present in the mesoappendix
consistent with involvement by metastatic disease. h

The eighth container is labeled “small bowel nodule.n It holds multiple - ' grossly consistent with the
tumorr seen at previous sites, measuring 2 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm. Wrapped.

The Walled "cecal nodule.” it holds a single tan-white firm tissue fragment measuring 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.2
cm.

The tenth container is labeled "large bowel tumor.“ it holds multiple pieces of fibroadipose tissue studded with firm

white nodules ro ‘ with metastatic tumor. These tissue fragments measure 4 x 3.5 x 0.3 cm in
aggregate.

The 11th container is labeled “omentum.” it holds a single piece of libroadipose tissue grossly consistent with
omentum, measuring 15 x 12 x 2 cm. Multiple tumor deposits are present th suring 5.5 cm in greatest
dimension. On cut surface. these tumor deposits are solid and white.
