- Pathology Report

Microscopic Discussion:

1,2 Sections demonstrate a moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm. The tumor
is composed predominantly of ordinary gemitocytes and fibrillary astrocytes. A
minor population of smaller gemistocytes is seen but definite oligodendroglioma
differentiation is not noted. Atypia is moderate to marked but no mitotic figures
are identified. There is no microvascular proliferation or necrosis.

Addendum Discussion:

The neoplastic cells are immunoreactive for p53, suggesting astrocytic origin.
MlB-1 reactive cells are present throughout the tumor. A labeling index of 6.2%
is calculated. This is at the high end of the range expected in a grade II
astrocytoma but would be relatively low for a higher grade tumor. Overall, this
does not warrant classification of the tumor as anaplastic, but does indicate the
need for close observation

Final Addendum Diagnosis:

Well-differentiated astrocytoma (WHO grade II)
