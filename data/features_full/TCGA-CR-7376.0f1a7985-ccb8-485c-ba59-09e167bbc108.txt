GROSS DESCRIPTION:

1) SOURCE: Floor of Mouth, Tongue, Mandibular Periosteum, T onsillar Pillar,
Palate

Specimen received fresh, labeled "ﬂoor of mouth, tongue, mandibular
periosteum, tonsillar pillar, palate stitched anterior," contains a complex
mucosal resection measuring 4.5 cm anterior to posterior, 4.5 cm right to
left, and 1.3 cm from superior to inferior. The specimen weighs 13.75
grams. The specimen is inked in the following fashion: anterior orange,
posterior black, right red, left yellow, and deep blue. The resection
margin has marked cautery artifact. The mucosal surface is white-pink and
is remarkable for a 3.5 x 2.9 cm centrally located ulcerated lesion that
abuts the left anterior margin. Sectioning through the specimen reveals the
tumor to extend 0.9 cm deeply. Portions of tissue are taken for research,
placed in glutaraldehyde, and frozen in a -80 degree freezer. On cut
surface, the tumor is firm, white and circumscribed. The tumor is 4 mm to
the red inked margin and is 1.8 cm to the posterior inked margin.
Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Summary of sections: 1A, red clipped vascular margin, anterior and
posterior margins, 3/ 1; 1B, tumor to deep surface and left anterior margin,
2/ 1; 1C, right and deep margins, 3/ 1; 1D, deep margins, 2/ 1; 1E, left and
deep margins, 2/ 1; 1F, posterior and left margins, 2/ 1.

2) SOURCE: Right Neck Level 1
Specimen is received fresh, labeled "level 1, right neck" and is an

aggregate of fatty tissue containing submandibular gland and lymph nodes
that measure 5.6 x 4.0 x 1.3 cm in aggregate. The tan, lobular, glandular

tissue measures 4.0 cm in greatest extent and has a glistening, lobular
surface. Sectioning through the submandibular gland reveals no definitive
lesion. Multiple candidate lymph nodes are identified and are entirely
submitted. Representative portions of the submandibular gland are
submitted.

Summary of sections: 2A and 2B, submandibular gland 2/1 each; 2C and 2D,
multiple candidate lymph nodes, 3/1 each.

3) SOURCE: Right Neck Level 2

Specimen is received fresh, labeled "right neck, level 2" and is a portion
of fibrovascular, fatty, and lymphoid tissue measuring 4.8 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm
in aggregate. Sectioning through the tissue reveals multiple candidate
lymph nodes, the largest of which measures 1.6 cm in greatest dimension.
All lymphoid tissue is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections: 3A, 4 possible lymph nodes, 4/ 1; 3B, single largest
lymph node, bisected, 2/ 1.

4) SOURCE: Right Neck Level 3

Specimen is received fresh, labeled "right neck, level 3" and is a portion

of fibrofatty tissue containing lymph nodes that measure 8.4 x 2.0 x 0.7

cm. The tissue is searched for nodes and multiple candidate lymph nodes are
identified and are entirely submitted.

Summary of sections: 4A, multiple lymph nodes, M/1; 4B, 4 possible lymph
nodes, 4/ 1.
