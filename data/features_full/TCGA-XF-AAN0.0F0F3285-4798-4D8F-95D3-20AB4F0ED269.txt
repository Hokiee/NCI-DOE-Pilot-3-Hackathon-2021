MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

A—C: See final microscopic-diagnoses.

D: Permanent sections of the apical urethral margin show single and small clusters
of malignant cells in the periurethral soft tissuel particularly around and within
muscle bundles. A review of the original frozen sections shows rare atypical
cells, that when viewed in context with the main tumor in the bladder and the
permanent sections of the urethral margin are interpreted as representing
carcinoma. The urethral mucosa itself and the immediate underlying support tissue
shows no evidence of urothelial dysplasia or malignancy.

E: Sections of the bladder show an invasive poorly differentiated urothelial
carcinoma composed of cells with enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei with coarse
chromatin and prominent central macronucleoli (El—6). Some of the tumor cells
display eignet ring cell features. The tumor invades through the muscularis
propria into the perivesical fat and involves the entire anterior bladder wall as
well as the right and left lateral bladder wall regions. Urothelial carcinoma in
situ (flat lesion) is identified in association with the invasive carcinoma (E4,5)
as well as in the trigone region where it is represented by pagetoid spread. Other
random sections of bladder mucosa exhibit foci of moderate urothelial dysplasia and

areas of reactive atypia. The inked bladder reSection margins are free of
malignancy. ‘

Sections of the prostate show extensive urothelial carcinoma involving
periprostatic soft tissue (E17-23.25) with invasion of prostatic stroma from "the
outside in" (E18-21). Lymphovascular invasion is seen (E21,25). Tumor extends to
the right posterior inked margin of the prostate (319,23). Tumor involves tissue
around the seminal vesicles without involving the seminal vesicles themselves
(E26,27). The uninvolved prostate shows cystic atrophy and rare foci of high grade
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN II). No prostatic adenocarcinoma is seen.
