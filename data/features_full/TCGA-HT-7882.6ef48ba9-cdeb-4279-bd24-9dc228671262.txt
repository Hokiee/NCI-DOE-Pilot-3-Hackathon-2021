Microscopic Description:

Sections demonstrate an anaplastic glioma. The tumor cells demonstrate round to oval
nuclei with coarse chromatin and irregular nuclear contours. In areas, the tumor cells
demonstrate clear cytoplasm with a distinctly “fried egg” appearance. Fifteen mitoses are
counted per ten high power fields. Hemorrhage and necrosis are observed. Focal areas of
microvascular proliferation are observed. The tumor diffusely invades the surrounding
brain.

Diagnosis:
Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma (who grade III)
