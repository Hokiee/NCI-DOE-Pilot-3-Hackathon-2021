A. Received fresh and labeled ‘right breast 1 short stitch superior, 1 long stitch lateral“ specimen consist of r‘

t breast

oriented with 1 short stitch superior resection margin and 1 long stitch in lateral resection margin, 18.0 x 15 0 x 5.0 cm and
weighs 775.0 grams. The skin mesures 13.0 x 8.0 cm, nipple measures 1.2 cm and the areola. 4.0 cm in ci mferenoe.

Sedions reveal abundant grossly unremarkable tibroadipose tissue. The central area reveal white-tan. fibr

stic area,

2.0 cm in greatest dimension. No tumor or any other lesions are grossly identified. Representative sections are submitted

in ten cassettes as follows:

1 Perpendicular representative sections from superior resection margins
2 Perpendicular representative sections from inferior resection margins
3 Perpendicular representative sections from medial resection margins

C. Received in forfhalin and labeled “left rotter lymph node" specimen consist of one lymph node, 6.0 x 5.0 3.0 cm and
weighs 35.0 grams. Sections reveals pink-tan, well defined multinoduiar . No calciﬁed or hemorrhagic ar
identitiﬁed. Representative sections are submitted in eight cassettes:

D. Received fresh and labeled “left breast and axilla 1 short suture superior; 1 long suture lateral" is a mast
with axillary contents. weighing 1150.0 grams and measuring 21.0 x 21.0 x 6.0 cm and the axillary conten s, 14.0 x 12.0 x
2.0 cm. There is an anterior ellipse of white skin. 20.0 x 10.0 cm. Located centrally within this ellipse of sk there is a
nipple areola complex 3.5 cm in circumference and 1.0 cm in circumference. Located toward the outer qu drant there are
two verrucose shaped hyperkeratosis lesions, 0.7 x 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The remainder of the s in surface is
unremarkable. The rest of the specimen is covered by yellow-tan lobulated adipose tissue. The sUrgical r section
margins are inked din black. Multiple cross sections reveals an ill circumscribed gray-tan, hard greatly ma s, 2.0 cm in
greatest dimension. The mass is located in the outer quadrant approximately 1.00 o'clock position, 1.5 cm from the
superior resection margin (nearest margin) and 2.5 cm from deep resection margin. Located in the same uadrant 2.5 cm
from the mass previously described there is a second ill circumscribed gray-tan, hard nodule measuring 2. cm in greatest
dimension. this mass is 2.8 cm from deep resection margin (closest margin). The remainder of the specim n shows a
heterogeneous breast tissue. No other lesions or masses are grossly identified. The strorna to fat ratio is .70. Multiple
sections through the axillary contents reveal eighteen possible lymph nodes ranging in size from, 0.3 cm i 2.0 cm in
greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Superior resection margin nearest to the 1.00 o'clock mass

inferior resection margin

Medial resection margin

Lateral resection margin

Deep margin closest to 1.00 o'clock mass (outer upper quadrant)

Deep margin closest to the second mass (outer upper quadrant)
