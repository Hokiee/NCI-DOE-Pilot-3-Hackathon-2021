COMMENT:

The multiple sections from the tumor reveal patchy areas of tumor inﬁltration

extending up to lactiferous ducts. In addition, the tumor cells also display unfavorable
nuclear features in many areas. The ER, PR and Her-2/neu have been performed on the

 

previous biopsy _ The PanKeratin Immunostain is performed on specimens A, B
and C.

GROSS:

A. The container is received fresh unﬁxed labelc :ﬁ sentinel lymph node #1

for frozen section”. The specimen consists of an ovoid mass of pink-tan soft rubbery
tissue mixed with fattv tissue measuring 0.6 cm. in greatest dimension. Frozen section is
obtained by , The entire specimen including ﬁozen section in one block.

The container is received fresh unﬁxed labelet 'leﬁ sentinel lymph node #2
for frozen section”. The specimen consists of an ovoid mass of tan-gray soft rubbery
tissue with attached fat. Frozen section is obtained by . The entire specimen
including frozen section in one block.

Lab No.:

The container is received fresh unﬁxed labele sentinel lymph node #3 for
frozen section”. The specimen consist of an ovoid mass of pink-tan soft rubbery tissue
measuring 1.3 cm. in diameter in the aggregate. Frozen section is obtained by

The entire specimen including frozen section in one block.

The container is received fresh unﬁxed labelet “left breast”. The specimen
consists of an 809 gm. apparent leﬁ breast which is 23 x 15 x 4 cm. in greatest overall
dimension. There is an inverted nipple. The attached skin ellipse is 21 x 9.5 cm.
Sectioning through the breast stroma reveals dense gray—white ﬁbrous tissue varying up
to 7.5 cm. in greatest dimension. This area has been previously marked with blue dye.
There are scattered cystic spaces varying up to 0.1 cm. in greatest dimension ﬁlled with
an amber-colored ﬂuid. Sectioning also reveals a ﬁrm tan-gray striated tumor mass
which is 7 x approximately 5.5 cm. in greatest overall dimension and is approximately
0.7 cm. from the deep/underlying resection margin. The specimen is submitted in ten
blocks.

Key Note Block Summary: 1—nipple, 2 through 4——cystic spaces, 5—random, 6
through lO—tumor mass.
