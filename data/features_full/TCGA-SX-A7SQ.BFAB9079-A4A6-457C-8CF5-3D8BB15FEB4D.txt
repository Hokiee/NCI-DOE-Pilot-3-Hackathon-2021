Tumor #1
Histologic type: Papillary renal cell carcinoma (see comment).
Histologic Fuhrman grade: Grade 2/4.
Tumor size: 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm.

Tumor focality: Not applicable.
Sarcomatoid features: Absent.
Tumor necrosis: Absent.
Microscopic tumor extension: The tumor extends into the renal
sinus.
Margins: Not involved.
Lymphovascular invasion: Absent.

DIAGNOSIS COMMENT:
Immunostains in tumor #1 showed:

Page 2 of 3

racemase: positive

CK7: positive

C-Kit: negative.

.CD10:on1y rare positivity.

The results are those typically reported in papillary renal cell
carcinoma.

CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Left renal mass.

SPECIMEN(S):
AzLeft kidney

PRELIMINARY INTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Intraoperative Pathologist(s):

A. Left kidney, frozen section diagnosis: Renal cell carcinoma.
Tissue sent for

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
Performed by
A. Received fresh labele and "left kidney."
Procedure: Radical nephrectomy.
Specimen laterality: Left.
Tumor site: Lower pole and a second tumor upper pole inferior.
Tumor size: Lower pole tumor: 3.5 x 3 x 2.5 cm. Upper pole tumor:
1.8 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm.
Tumor focality: Multifocal.
Gross extent of tumor:

Extension into perinephric tissue: Present. The tumor in the
lower pole abuts the renal sinus and perinephric tissue.

Extension beyond Gerota's fascia: Absent.

Extension into renal sinus: Absent.

Extension into collecting system: Absent.

Adrenal gland: Adrenal gland absent.
Gross notes:

Gross tumor characteristics: The tumor #1 in the lower pole is
necrotic and somewhat papular. Tumor #2 in the upper pole is
well-circumscribed and yellow—orange with focal necrosis.

Kidney weight: 478 g with fat and 184 g without fat.

Kidney dimensions: 10.5 x 6 x 5.2 cm.

Ureter dimensions: 6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm.

Inking details: The perinephric fat is inked over the mass in
the lower pole.

Block summary for specimen A,

Al) Frozen section — tumor; A2) ureteral and vascular margins;
A3-A4) sections of tumor #1 in lower pole; A5) fat in capsule over
lower pole tumor; A6-A7) sections of upper pole tumor; A8) section
of lower pole tumor abutting renal sinus.
