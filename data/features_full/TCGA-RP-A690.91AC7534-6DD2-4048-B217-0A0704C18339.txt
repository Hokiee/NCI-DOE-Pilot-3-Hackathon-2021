Tumor ID - MAB
5‘12 ; 47.2 D

. . 94) :21. /3
Microscopic Description: b/ /
Microscopic examination reveals a cellular neoplasm with considerable hemorrhage. The overall
configuration is that of a spindle cell lesion with relatively uniform nuclei and occasional mitotic figures.
Nucleoli are not prominent. Blood vessels appear intermixed uniformly throughout the lesion, some
having prominent walls.

Addendum discussion:

The neoplastic cells are diffusely immunoreactive for both HMS-45 and S-100, consistent with
melancytic origin. They are negative for synaptophysin and GFAP. MlB-1 demonstrates scattered
reactive cells with significant variability in proliferative activity in different tumor areas. In most areas,
the labeling index would be about 1% and the highest area had a labeling index of 4.6%. in primary CNS
melanosytic lesions, MlB—l labeling indices >2% are more consistent with melanoma than
melanocytoma.

Diagnosis:
Spinal Cord Tumor
Melanocytic lesion, consistent with melanoma.

Comment: This lesion does not demonstrate the mitotic activity that was seen in the previous biopsy.
However, overall this tumor did demonstrate proliferative activity that is greater than that seen in
melanosytoma. Also, the aggressive course based on the MRI ﬁndings are indicative of a malignant
lesion.
