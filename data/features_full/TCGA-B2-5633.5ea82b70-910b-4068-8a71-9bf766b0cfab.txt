SPECIMEN
Right kidney

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Right renal mass.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
Received fresh, for tissue procurement labeled "right
kidney" is a 12.0 x 6.5 x 5.5 cm. right kidney with
attached, probe patent, 4.5 cm. ureter averaging 0.3 cm. and a
copious amount of perirenal adipose tissue. No adrenal tissue is
evident. On sectioning, there is a well—circumscribed, 5.8 x 3.5 x
3.5 cm. tan gold—red tumor mass centrally which approaches the
inked
capsular surface to within 0.15 cm. A portion of tumor and a
portion of normal parenchyma are submitted for tissue procurement
as requested. The renal pelvis is smooth glistening tan white.
Uninvolved parenchyma is uniform red brown with a well—defined
corticomedullary junction and a maximal cortical thickness of 1.2
cm. No additional mass lesion or abnormality is identified.
Representative sections are submitted in 9 blocks as labeled. RS9.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Vascular and ureteral margins; 2—4 — tumor to
inked capsular surface; 5 and 6 — tumor to normal p chyma; 7 —
renal pelvis; 8 and 9 — random normal parenchyma.
