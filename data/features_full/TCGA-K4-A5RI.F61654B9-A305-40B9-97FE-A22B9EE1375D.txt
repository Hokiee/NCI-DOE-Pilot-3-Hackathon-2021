Gross Description

A. Received in ﬁormalin labeled with the patient's name and
"left pelvic lymph nodes F8" are three fatty, yellow—tan tissue
fragments measuring up to 2 X 1.2 x 0.2 cm thick. The entire
specimen is submitted in Al.

B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient‘s name and
"left pelvic lymph nodes NFS" are multiple fragments of finely
divided fat, measuring 3 x 3 x 3 cm in compact aggregate.
Residual induration is submitted in Bl—B3.

C. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"right pelvic lymph nodes F3" are two elongated, fatty, pink—tan
tissues measuring 2 x 1.1 x 0.2 cm thick. The entire specimen
is submitted in cl.

D. Received in fermalin labeled with the patient's name and
"right pelvic lymph nodes NFS" are multiple fragments of finely
divided fat, measuring 3 x 3 x 3 cm in compact aggregate.
Residual induraticn is submitted in Dl—D3.

F. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
”appendix" is a qrossly unremarkable vermiform appendix with
attached periappendiccal fat measuring 7 x 0.4 cm thick, with
the surgical margin revealing a staple closure. The appendiceal
lumen is pinpoint. A shave Of the resection margin adjacent to

 

5% Prepared: '

the staple closure and entire appendiceal tip is submitted in
El.
F. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and

n '-

ieft ureter FS" is yellow tan, sort tissue measuring 1 x l x
3.2 cm. Totally submitted in F1.
G. Received in formalin labeled with the patient‘s name and
”right ureter F3" is yellow—tan, soft tissue measuring 9 x 6 x 1
mm thick. The specimen is submitted totally in 01.
H. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
”uterus, bilateral tubes and ovaries, bladder, anterior vaginal
wall" is a specimen so designated, measuring overall 13 cm
superior to inferior, 10 cm right to left, 8 cm anterior to
posterior. The uterus and cervix measure 7 cm superior to
inferior, 4.5 cm right to lefL, 2.2 cm anterior to posterior.
Unremarkable right and left fallopian tubes, measuring 6.5 x 0.6
and 6 x 0.5 cm with unremarkable, atrophic appearing right and
left ovaries measuring 2 x l.5 x 0.6 and 2 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm in
greatest dimensions. The included portion of anterior vaginal
wall is continuous with the perineal and distal urethral mucosa,
it measures up to 5 cm in width superiorly and appears
unremarkable. The cervix is 3 cm in diameter with a 1.2 cm
linear on. The specimen previously has been inked blue on the
left, black on the right, and the bladder cavity is exposed.
The bladder wall appears indurated with a diminished bladder
cavity measuring 2.5 cm right to left, superior to inferior, 2
cm anterior to posterior. The posterior superior aspect of the
bladder is replaced by an area of ulceration and induration,
measuring 3 x 3 cm. Section code: Hl=distal urethra; HZ=shaved
entire left vaginal resection margin; H3=shaved entire right
vaginal resection margin; H4=left cross sections mid urethra;
H5=right mid urethral cross sections; H6=half left ovary;
H7eleft fallopian tube; H8=half of right ovary; H9=right
fallopian tube; HlO=posterior cervix; Hllzanterior cervix;
312—H13=anterior posterior uterine wall, including thin
endometrium and two fibroid-like nodules with uterine cavity
measuring 1.2 cm in width, 2 cm in length; H14~HlB=extensivo
”sampling of bladder tumor, which measures up to"2 cm thick,
deeply penetrating posterior bladder fat. H19—H20=tumor to
inked left posterior soft tissue margin. The included stubs of
ureter are deeply retracted and are not sampled at this time due
to their presence in parts F1 and Si ;
