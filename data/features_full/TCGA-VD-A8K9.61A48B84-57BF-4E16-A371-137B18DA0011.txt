MICROSCOPY

Histologically, the enucleated eye demonstrates a normal
anterior segment with an unremarkable cornea, a deep
anterior chamber and open angles. The iris leaves are
unremarkable. The ciliary muscles showed advanced atrophic
changes and there is moderate hyalinisation of the ciliary

processes. The lens is cataractous.

In the posterior segment, a small choroidal melanoma can be
seen. This is dome-shaped with a retinal detachment. The
retina overlying the tumour is atrophic with degenerative

changes.

The tumour is pigmented and consists predominantly of

spindle cells. The epithelioid cell component is minimal.The
melanoma cells are immunoreactive for MelanA and HSP-27
(score 3) .

The number of mitoses is moderate approx. 7/40 high power
fields.

The microvasculature of the melanoma is prominent, but
closed loops are not seen in the tissue planes examined.

The lymphocytic infiltrate within tumour is minimal.
Macrophages are scattered throughout the tumour in a mild
density. -

There is no evidence of scleral invasion or of extraocular
growth. The optic nerve is tumour free, and demonstrates
mild atrophic changes. The examined vortex veins are free of
tumour.

DIAGNOSIS

Choroid melanoma of spindle cell type.

COMMENTS:

Molecular genetic examination of DNA extracted from the
tumour cells will be performed using multiplex—ligation
dependent probe amplification (MLPA) , looking at chromosomes
1, 3, 6 and a. A supplementary report will follow as soon as
these investigations are complete.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT

In the meantime, molecular genetic analysis of tumour DNA
extracted from the fresh uveal melanoma tissue was performed
using the technique termed multiplex ligation-dependent
probe amplification (MLPA) . These investigations were
performed in the '

‘. ... .__1

 

The kit P027 from ., which examines for gains or
losses in 31 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8, was used.
The DNA concentration was measured using and the
quality assessed using multiplex-PCR prior to the MLPA
reaction. .

The DNA concentration was high and of good quality on
assessment. The MLPA reaction was run at least twice on
differing oceasions, resulting in similar results.

The results of the sequence analysis of the MLPA products is
printed on a separate report.

In summary, sequence analysis demonstrated: normal
chromosome 1, disomy 3, gains in chromosome 6 and gains in
chromosome 8q.

These molecular data require correlation with the clinical
and morphological data for metastatic risk assessment.
