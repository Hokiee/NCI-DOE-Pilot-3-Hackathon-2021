COMMENT‘S’ <3¢AD-¢%sll‘/

The sections demonstrate a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma involving the head of
pancreas and ampullary region extending into the duodenal wall without duodenal mucosal
involvement. Based on the overall morphologic findings. the carcinoma is best classified
as arising from the pancreaticobiliary tract rather than from the ampulla. This
distinction‘ however. can be somewhat problematic in tumors involving both regions.

This tumor does demonstrate extraprostatic extension as well as vascular and perineural

GROSS DESCRIPTION :

A. Received fresh for frozen section labeled with the patient's name and "pancreatic
margin" is a 2 x 2 x 0.5 cm portion of pancreas. A stitch marks the true margin. The
specimen is submitted in block A for frozen section of the margin.

B. Received fresh for frozen section labeled with the patient‘s name and ”common bile
duct margin” is the common bile duct margin consisting of two dilated ducts. one measuring
1.5 cm and an adjacent smaller duct measuring 0.8 cm. A suture marks the true margin.
Blue ink is applied to the true margin. The specimen is submitted on face in block B for
frozen section.

C. Received fresh in the operating room labeled with the patient's name and "whipple
contents“ with request for tissue banking is a Whipple resection. The following
measurements are obtained: length across from the lesser curvature 10 cm. length along
greater curvature 9 cm. proximal gastric margins 7 cm. duodenum 13 cm in length and 3 cm in
diameter. common bile duct 1 cm in length. 1.5 cm in diameter at margin, and pancreatic
head approximately 5.5 x 5 x 4 cm. There is a posterior—inferior staple line which
measures 4.5 cm in length. Adjacent to this is a stitch which marks the
uncinate/retroperitoneal margin. Yellow ink is applied to this margin. The pancreatic

margin measures 2 x 1.5 cm. Blue ink is applied to this margin. There is a stent

within the common bile duct. Black ink is applied to the common bile duct margin. Black
ink is also applied along the stapled gastric margin and blue ink is applied along the
stapled duodenal margin. The adipose tissue adjacent to the lesser and greater curvature
are separated for lymph node dissection. The specimen is opened lengthwise along the
lesser curvature and along the border of the duodenum. The mucosa surrounding the ampulla
of Vater is heaped up and hyperemic for three—fourths of the circumference. I am hesitant
to completely open the specimen in the fresh state as that this may represent an ampullary
or periampullar area tumor which would require better fixation. In an attempt to see if
there is a pancreatic head mass, I placed an incision along the posterior aspect of

the pancreas going into the head of the pancreas revealing a possible tumor within the
pancreatic head where the pancreatic tissue has a more gray—white appearance and fibrotic
texture. within the plane of section. this area measures approximately 1.5 cm. A small
portion of this area is provided to the tissue bank coordinator. The specimen is then
pinned out on corkboard and placed into formalin for overnite fixation prior to further
sectioning and evaluation. Blue ink is further applied to the staple line adjacent to the
uncinate process.

The fixed specimen is evaluated. A longitudinal cut is made from the ampulla of Vater
through to the common bile duct margin. In this plane. a tumor is identified in the
periampullary region from the ampulla of Vater extending for 2.3 cm. The tumor tapers at
the junction of the common bile duct and pancreatic duct. This area is contiguous with the
area in the pancreatic head identified at the time of initial evaluation for tissue

banking and the mass is judged to measure approximately 3 cm. Several peripancreatic

lymph nodes are identified which range from 0.8 to 1.5 cm. Several lymph nodes are
identified along the lesser curvature ranging up to 1 cm.
