This staging information is based on information available at
the time of this report, and is subject to change pending
clinical review and additional information.

Comment:
A portion of this case was reviewed in consultation with
who concurs with the grade and stage of this tumor.

Clinical History:
-year-old male with right renal mass who presents for robotic
partial right nephrectomy.

Gross Description:

Received is one appropriately labeled container, additionally
labeled "right renal mass." Requisition states "stitch marks
closed collecting system." It holds an 89.8 gram, 6.5 x 5.2 x
4.3 cm partial nephrectomy. The parenchymal margin is tan/brown
and inked black. Within the center of the parenchyma there

is a stitch marking the closed collecting system, this area is
inked red. The capsule is tan/yellow, intact, bulges and is
inked blue. Beneath the bulging capsule there is a 5.7 x 5.3 x
3.6 cm tan/brown firm, well circumscribed mass with areas of
hemorrhage adjacent to the capsule. The mass is abutting the red
inked stitched area designated by the surgeon as a closed
collecting system, is 0.4 cm from the black inked parenchymal
margin, and bulges but does not extend through the capsule. The
uninvolved renal parenchyma is tan/brown with a distinct
corticomedullary junction. A representative section of the mass
is submitted to Tissue Procurement.

Block summary:

Al—AZ - mass with respect to red inked closed collecting system,
perpendicular

A3—A4 - mass with respect to black inked parenchymal margin,
perpendicular

A5—A6 - mass with respect to capsule, perpendicular

A7 — uninvolved kidney parenchyma away from mass
Tissue remains in formalin.
