FROZEN SECTION INTEROPERATIVE REPORT:
FSA. Brain, right frontal tumor, biopsy: Metastatic tumor consistent with melanoma

Diagnosis called in at

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. RIGHT FRONTAL TUMOR

Received fresh labeled with the patient‘s identiﬁcation and designated "right frontal tumor" are
multiple fragments of red-tan soft tissue measuring 2.3 x 0.9 x 0.2 CM in aggregate. Touch
preparations are performed. Entirely submitted for frozen section, FSA.

B. RIGHT FRONTAL TUMOR

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "right frontal tumor" is a
portion of red—tan soft tissue measuring 4.1 x 2.9 x 0.9 CM. Sectioning shows soft red friable cut
surface. One half the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement, the remainder entirely
submitted, Bl-B4.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. BRAIN, RIGHT FRONTAL TUMOR, BIOPSY:

— METASTATIC MELANOMA. SEE COMMENT.

B. BRAIN, RIGHT FRONTAL TUMOR, RESECTION:

— METASTATIC MELANOMA. SEE COMMENT.

Comment: Tumor cells are immunoreactive to 5-100, Melan-A, HMB-45. Rare individual cells are
weakly immunoreactive for GFAP. These findings support the diagnosis of metastatic melanoma.
