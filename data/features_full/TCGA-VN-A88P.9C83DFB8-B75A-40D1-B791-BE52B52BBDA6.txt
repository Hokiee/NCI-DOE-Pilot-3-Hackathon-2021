with the following measurements:

Left-right: 4.7

Anterior-posterior: 4

Apex-base: 5.0

Left seminal vesicles: 4.8 x 2.2 x 0.8 cm

Left vas deferens: 4.8 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter

Right seminal vesicles: 4.6 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm.

Right vas deferens : 4.7 cm in length x 0.7 cm in diameter

The prostate is inked as follows: Urethra in yellow. anterior 1/3 in
black, right posterior 2/3 in blue. and left posterior 2/3 in red.

Gross photographs are taken. One out is made revealing a tan soft

dimensions, positioned in through left mid base anteriorly.
Approximately 0.9 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm of tissue from the left mid base
nodule and approximately 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm of nonnal—appearing
prostatic tissue from the right anterior aspect are procured for the
