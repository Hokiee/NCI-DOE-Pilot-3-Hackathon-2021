HISTORY
No clinical notes.

MACROSCOPIC
Three specimens received

1: The specimen is labelled ‘ right upper lobe’ and consists of a lobe of lung

that has been previously sampled for research purposes. This lobe measures 140
mm (51), 20 mm (ML) and 180 mm (AP). There is puckerlng of the pleural surface
on the anterolateral surface measuring up to 25 x 20 mm. Scarring is noted on
the posterolateral surface measuring up to 10 x 10 mm. The apex shows some
emphysematous changes. On sectioning a ﬁrm cream tan tumour with black
pigmentation is identiﬁed within the lung parenchyma It has a maximum cut
surface area of 32 x 20 mm in dimension. The tumour is located 30 mm away from
the bronchial resection margin. It is located within 1 mm of the pleural

surface. [Representative sections: 1A, bronchial resection margin; 13,
perlbronchial node bisected; 100 one node bisected one slice each block;1E,
one node bisected; 1F, sections of tumour nearest to pleural surface; IG,

tumour; 1H tumour and the surrounding lung paranchyma; 1i, lung with
emphysematous changes; 13, scarring of lung; 1K; presumed normal lung tissue;
IL, further bronchial margin]

2: The specimen is labelled ‘ hilar lymph node' and consists of a lymph node
measuring 5 x 3 x 3 mm in dimension. [Bisected and BIT: 2A]

3: The specimen is labelled No 4 and No 10 lymph node' and consists of
multiple pieces of yellow brown tissue ranging in size from smallest S x 3 x 3
mm to largest 32 x 25 x 20 mm. The largest node appears to be involved with
tumour. No extra capsular Spread identiﬁed {3A four possi ihle nodes; 33- C 1R5
of largest node}

MICROSCOPIC

1; Sections reveal a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma showing
areas of clear cell change. The tumour does not directly invade visceral

pleura. There is extensive lymphatic invasion with tumour present in adjacent
lymphatic channels within pleura, pulmonary septa and along the course of
bronchovascuiar bundles. Tumour is present within a lymphatic vessel at the
bronchial resection margin. No tumour is identiﬁed within bronchial wall at

the bronchial resection margin. The peribronchial lymph nodes are involved by
tumour. The tumour deposits are present within afferent lymphatic channels,
subcapsular sinuses, and are also distributed throughout lymph node parenchyma.
Lymph node tissue also shows reactive changes with sinus histiocytosis, carbon
pigment deposition, scattered flecks of birefringent material consistent with
silicate, and hyalinized silicotic nodules. No vascular invasion or perineural
permeation by tumour is seen. immediately adjacent to the tumour there is a

localised area of endogenous lipoid pneumonia. Remaining lung parenchyrna shows
emphysema and respiratory bronchiolitis. Vascularised pleural adhesions are
also present.

2: Sections reveal lymph node tissue which is partially involved by squamous
cell carcinoma showing clear cell change.

3: Ali sectiOns (BA-3C) reveal lymph. node tissue whida is partially involved by
squamous cell carcinoma showing clear cell change. Lymph node tissue also
shows reactive changes with follicular hyperplasia, sinus histiocytosis, carbon
pigment deposition, scattered ﬂecks of birefringent material consistent with
silicate, and hyalinized silicotic nodules.
