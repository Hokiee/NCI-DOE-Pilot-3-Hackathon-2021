SLIDE DISPOSITION:

DIAGNOSIS:

A. Uterus, Teft and right fa110pian tubes and ovaries, h sterectomy
and biiateraT saTeingo—oophorectomy: MaTignant mixed Mu1 erian
tumor with hetero ogous differentiation (60% gianduTar, 40% stroma1
differentiation) is identified forming a mass, 7.5 x 7.0 x 2.0 cm,
circumferentia11y invoiving the uterine cavity. The tumor invades
2.0 cm into the myometrium (tota1 wa11 thickness 2.4 cm). The tumor
does not invoive the endocervix. Lymphovascu1ar space invasion is
not identified. The margins are negative for tumor. Bi1atera1
fa110pian tubes disp1ay severe epitheTiaT atypia. The ovaries are
unremarkabie. Seen in consuTtation with Dr. '

B. Lymph nodes, right pe1vic, excision: Mu1tip1e (19) 1ymph nodes

GROSS DESCRIPTION: ‘

A. Received fresh labeled "uterus, left and right fallopian tube
and ovary" is a 195.0 gram disrupted uterus wit attached bilateral
tubes and ovaries. The cervix is nearly detached, 4.5 cm from the
ectocervical margin. Multiple portions of a polypoid exophytic mass
measuring 6.5 x 6.4 x 5.0 cm in aggregate are present, separately.
There is a 7.5 x 7.0 x 2.0 cm exop ytic/polypoid, friable mass
circumferentially involving the endometrial cavity, grossly invading
2.0 cm. The myometrial thickness is 2.4 cm. There are no

leiom omas. There is a 2.1 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm right ovary with a

smoot outer surface and a cystic cut surface with a 6.9 x 0.4 cm
right fallopian tube which is unremarkable. There is a 1.9 x 1.7 x
1.3 cm left ovary with a smooth surface and a solid cut surface with
a 6.8 x 0.4 cm left fallopian tube which is unremarkable. on cut
surface, the left ovary contains a 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm white yellow
solid nodule. Representative sections are submitted.

B. Received fresh labeled "right eelvic lymph nodes” is a 4.9 x 4.8
x %.4 cmdaggregate of adipose and ymphatic tissue. Lymph nodes
su mitte .

C. Received fresh labeled ”left pelvic lymph nodes" is a 4.4 x 3.3

x 1.5 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. Lymph nodes all
submitted.

D. Received fresh labeled "left para—aortic lymph nodes” is a 3.2 x
2.2 x 1.4 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. Lymph nodes
submitted.

E. Received fresh labeled ”right para—aortic lymph nodes" is a 1.9
x 0.5 x 0.5 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. Lymph
nodes submitted.
