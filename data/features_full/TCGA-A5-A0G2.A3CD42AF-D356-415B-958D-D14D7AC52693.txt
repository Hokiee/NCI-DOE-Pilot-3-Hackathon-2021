HISTORY: Endometrial carcinoma

MICROSCOPIC:

Redacted
mmmummmnm

)Cb

Neoplasm (8—2) is a high grade carcinoma with many areas of solid
cell nests, focal papillary features, marked anisokaryosis and
poikilokaryosis, and many mitoses. Scattered small tumor islands have

clear cell features (T,W,Y).

STAGING:

At its deepest point (T) the tumor is about 0.2 cm from the uterine
serosa, and a metastatic nodule is in the adjacent serosa (T). In
one area (Y) the serosa lS retracted in toward the invading tumor

OTHER FEATURES:

, and right
parametrium (N) have metastatic tumor. In eleven lymph

nodes from

Omentum (A—C), appendix (L,M), left parametrium (O), and lower
uterus/endocervix (P~R) are free of tumor. Background endometrium
(S,U,V,X) is thin and atrophic without hyperplasia or atypia. Small

mucus cysts and lymphoid aggregates with germinal centers in
posterior cervix (Q). Many uterine serosa fibrovascular adhesions
(S,X—z). Right ovary (AA) has several small inclusion cysts. Left
ovary (BB) and the two tubes (AA,BB) essentially normal.

GROSS:

l: OMENTUM BIOPSY NO.l

Labeled "omentum biopsy #1" and received in formalin is a 20 x 12 x

0.8 cm piece of yellow lobulated omentum that is soft and pliant _

with no palpable nodules. Serial cut surfaces show multiple areas of
dark red hemorrhage and no neoplasm.

A. Representative sections ~ 4

Labeled “omentum #2" and received in formalin is a 17 X 14 x 0.8 cm
similar piece of omentum.

B. Representative sections - 4

similar piece of omentum.

Labeled" biopsy, cul de sac" and received in formalin are three
white-tan tissue fragments measuring 0.3, 0.3, and 0.5 cm.

D. All embedded — 3

5: FROZEN SECTION No.1, FROM SPECIMEN No.4

Labeled "frozen section #1 from specimen #4" and fixed in Bouin
solution is a 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm tissue disc.

E. All embedded - 1

Labeled "biopsy, right uterosacral ligament“ and fixed in formalin
is a 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm tissue fragment.

F. All embedded — 1

Labeled "frozen section #2 from specimen #6" is a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.1 cm
tissue disc in Bouin fluid.

8: UTERUS, TUBES, OVARIES

Labeled "uterus, tubes, ovaries", received fresh in surgery and then
fixed in formalin, is a small uterus including cervix, fallopian
tubes and ovaries weighing 66 grams. The uterus measures 5.5 cm
fundus to ectocervix, 4.5 cm lateral to lateral, and 2.5 cm anterior
to posterior. The parametria are marked with blue dye and all
embedded. The serosa is smooth and pink-tan with focal hemorrhage.
The exocervix measures 2.5 x 2.0 cm, has a 0.2 cm slit—shaped Cs,
and is covered with smooth gray—tan mucosa. The endocervical canal
measures 2.5 cm in length and has a variegated gray—tan mucosa. The
endometrial cavity measures 3 cm cornu to cornu and 2.5 cm fundus to
lower uterus. A large tan polypoid mass in the posterior superior
fundus wall and left cornu measures 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm. It has
several areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. The tumor extends into
the right posterior myometrium to within 0.5 cm of the serosa The
anterior endomyometrial wall averages 1.4 cm and the posterior 1.5
cm. Endometrium away from the tumor is smooth and averages 0.1 cm.
Each fallopian tube measures about 4.5 x 0.5 cm, includes the
fimbria, and has a smooth serosa. Each ovary is grey— tan, atrophic,
and cerebroid and measures about 2 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm. Small clear
fluid—filled cysts in the right vary from 0.2 to 0.4 cm.
