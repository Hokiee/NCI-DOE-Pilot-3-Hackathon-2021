CSCESION

Addendum Discussion
1p/i9q FISH

Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for deletions of chromosomes 1p
and 19q are performed on sections from block "2A".

Calculated 1p/1q ratio = 0.57 (<0.74 is deleted)
Calculated 19q/19p ratio = 0.55 (<0.BB is deleted)

The results are interpreted as deleted for 1p and 19q. This assay was read by
A result of a deleted 1p and 19q suggests a favorable prognosis.
