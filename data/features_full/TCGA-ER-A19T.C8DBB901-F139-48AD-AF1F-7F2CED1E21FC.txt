COMMENT:

FOCAL ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION SEEN.
MITOSIS 16 PER 10 HIGH POWER FIELDS.

NO TUMOR INFILTRATING LYMPHOCYTES.
MARGINS OF RESECTION FREE OF NEOPLASM.

Part 1: The soft tissue metastatic melanomas In fatty tissue show circumscription but since no lymphoid tissue
consistent with lymph node structure is identiﬁed around. these are considered as soft tissue metastasis. The separately
submitted 8.5 cm melanoma shows pseudo encapsulation close to the margin and ﬁbrous sepiae same as other larger
fool but deﬁnite evaluation is difﬁwlt as of the node! origin of this metastasis.

Part 2: The morphology is of acral lentigln
