previously inked and sectioned which reveals a 3.0 by 2.2 by 1.7 cm tumor mass, located 2.0 cm from
posterior resection margin and 1.0 cm from anterior resection margin. The tumor mass if firm and focally
hemorrhagic. Representative sections are submitted labeled "Al-A2" tumor and anterior resection margin; "A3-
A4" tumor and superior resection margin: "AS-A6" lateral resection margin; "A9—A10" posterior resection
margin; “All-A12" medial resection margin; "AlB-A14“ additional sections of the tumor; "A15" skin with
