Gross:

LcﬁEadreﬁal with tumor (weight 60g, 80x50x35 mm). Tumor consists from two thinly

adjacent and probably related nodules, smaller 25x35x20 mm, larger 60x40x40 mm. On cut,

both are grey-pink and soft. In the center of the larger nodule, yellow focus probably

scariﬁcation.

Smaller nodule was processed in representative cross-section with the largest diameter in 1

block (1A), larger nodule similarly (l B-lE).

Micro:

In excisions form both nodules were found similar structures of alveolarly shaped

pheochromocytoma with large regressive changes in the center of the larger nodule. On the

periphery of tumor excisions, adrenal cortex remnants with pressure atrophy, somewhere with
extracapsular proliferates. No pheochromocytoma inﬁltration in the periadrenal tissue was

found in the examined excisions.

lmunohistochemic examination:

$100 protein — slightly variable density, but clear presence of sustentacular cells

MIB-l < 1% tumor nuclei
