SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

DIAGNOSIS:
A. UTERUS, BILATERAL TUBE AND OVARIES, TOTAL ABDOMINAL HYSTERECTOMY,
BILATERAL SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY
Cervix
- Negative for malignancy
- Acute and chronic cervicitis
Endometrium
- Adenocarcinoma, endomet_rioid type, FIGO grade I of III (See comment)
- Background atrophic endometrium
Myometrium and serosa
~ Endometrioid adenocarcinoma with focal superﬁcial myoinvasion (less than 1/3 of inner
myometrium) (See comment)
- No angiolymphatic invasion identiﬁed
- Serosa negative for malignancy and other pathologic ﬁndings
Right and left ovaries
- Negative for malignancy
- Endosalpingiosis, left ovary
Right and left fallopian tubes
- Negative for malignancy
- Features consistent with prior tubal ligation
AJCC Pathologic stage (2002, 6th Ed): ple/pNx

COMMENT: The myoinvasion is best seen in the permanent sections cut from the remaining
tissue used for frozen section. It is superﬁcial myometrial involvement mostly conﬁned to the
ﬁbromuscular cores of the endometrioid papillary projections.

B. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE, DISSECTION
- One lymph node negative for malignancy (1)

C. LEFT PERIAOR’I‘IC LYMPH NODE, DISSECTION
- One lymph node negative for malignancy (1)

D. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE, DISSECTION
- Fibrovascular and mature adipose tissue negative for malignancy; no lymph nodes
identiﬁed

E. RIGHT PERIAORTIC LYMPH NODE, DISSECTION

A. UTERUS, BILATERAL TUBE AND OVARIES

Labeled with the patient's name, labeled "uterus, bilateral tube and ovaries", and received in formalin is a 75 gram
opened uterus with attached bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries. The uterus measures 7.5 x 5.0 x 4.0 cm. The
exocervix measures 3.0 x 2.5 cm. The endocervix measures 2.5 x 1.0 cm. The left ovary measures 1.7 x 1.0 x 0.5
cm. The right ovary measures 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The fallopian tubes are status post tubal ligation. The residual
left fallopian tube measures 4.8 cm in length and 0.5 cm in width. The residual right fallopian tube measures 5.2 cm
in length and 0.5 cm in diameter. The endometrial wall thickness is 0.6 cm. The myometrial wall thickness is 1.4
cm.

The endometrial surface is tan. On the posterior wall there is a cut ﬁrm tan mass which measures 2.0 x 1.8 x 0.6
cm. The serosal surface is shiny tan. There are no other lesions identiﬁed. The ectocervix and endocervix are
grossly unremarkable. Representative sections.

A10. Right ovary and fallopian tube - 4

A11. Left ovary and fallopian tube - 4

B. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE
Labeled with the patient's name, labeled "left pelvic lymph node", and received in formalin are six pieces of

fibrofatty tissue ranging in size from 0.6 to 1.2 and aggregating to 2.5 x 2.0 x 0.7 cm. Entirely submitted.
Bl. 6

C. LEFT PERIAORTIC LYMPH NODE

Labeled with the patient's name, labeled "left periaortic lymph node", and received in formalin are three portions of
fibrofatty tissue measuring from 0.5 to 1.5 cm in largest dimension and aggregating to 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm. Entirely
submitted.

C1. 3

D. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE

Labeled with the patient's name, labeled "right pelvic lymph node", and received in formalin is a piece of ﬁbrofatty
tissue measuring 2.3 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. Entirely submitted.
D1. 1

E. RIGHT PERIAORTIC LYMPH NODE

Labeled with the patient's name, labeled "right perlaortic lymph node", and received in formalin are two pieces of
ﬁbrofatty tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm and 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. Entirely submitted.
