GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY, SHORT SUPERIOR, LONG LATERAL, PURPLE INK DEEP - One pale—yellow
segmental mastectomy specimen (9.5 x 8.0 x 4.2 cm) with a short stitch to mark the superior, long stitch to mark lateral and purple
ink to mark the deep. The specimen is inked, serially sectioned from medial to lateral into twelve slices. Located at slice 3 through
slice 8, there is one pale-gray, ﬁrm, ill-deﬁned nodule (3.2 x 21.8 x 2.7 cm) is identiﬁed, located at 0.2 cm from deep margin, 0.2
cm from the anterior margin, 0.2 cm from superior margin, 1.2 cm from inferior margin, 0.6 cm from medial margin and 2.2 cm
from lateral margin. One clip is identiﬁed at slice 5, central portion. A portion of normal tissue and tumor is submitted for tumor
bank.

INK CODE: Blue— superior; green- inferior; yellow- superﬁcial; black- deep; red- lateral and medial.

SECTION CODE. A1 slice 1 entirely submitted of the slice, perpendicular for medial margin; A2, slice 12, central portion
lateral margin perpendicular; A3. slice 2 central portion with deep margin section adjacent to the lesion at slice 3; A4, slice 3,
central portion nodule with anterior margin; A5, slice 3, central portion nodule with deep margin; A6, slice 3, central to inferior
portion with the anterior margin; A7, slice 3 central to inferior portion tumor with the deep margin; A8-A14, entirely submitted of the
slice 4 from superior to inferior direction; A15-A20, entirely submitted of the slice 5 from superior to inferior direction (A16
associated with clip); A21-A28, slice 6, entirely submitted of the slice submitted from superior to inferior direction; A29. slice 7,
inferior portion with inferior and deep margin; A30, slice 8, superior portion with the superior margin; A31, A32, slice 8, central
portion nodule with the deep nodule submitted from superior to inferior direction; A33, slice 9, central portion section adjacent to
the lesion at slice 8.

*GROSS EVALUATION: TUMOR EXTENDS SUPERFICIAL/SUPERIOR AND DEEP MARGINS.
(B) LEFT BREAST IMPLANT AND PARTIAL CAPSULECTOMY - An 11.5 x 11.5 x 2.5 cm tan-yellow plastic breast implant
devoid of contents. There is a 7.0 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm irregular piece of tan-yellow ﬁbroadipose tissue attached to the surface of the
breast implant. No inscriptions are noted. Representative sections of the ﬁbroadipose tissue is submitted in 81-82.

Photos are also taken.
(C) NEW SUPERFICIAL INFERIOR MARGIN, INK MARKS TRUE MARGIN - One pale-yellow ﬁbroadipose tissue (4.5 x 1.8 x 0.6
cm) with one side inked with purple to mark the true margin. The true margin is reinked and the specimen is serially sectioned and
entirely submitted.

INK CODE: Blue - true margin.

SECTION CODE: C1-C4, entirely submitted of the specimen.
(D) ADDITIONAL SUPERFICIAL MARGIN, INK ON TRUE MARGIN - One pale-yellow ﬁbroadipose tissue (2.5 x 1.6 x 0.6 cm)
with purple ink to mark the true margin. The true margin is inked and the specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.
Also in the container, there are two unremarkable pale-gray skin strips (5.2 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm, 3.6 x 0.4 x 0.6 cm, respectively). The
resection margin of the skin is inked and specimen is serially sectioned and entirely submitted.

INK CODE: Blue - resection margin.

SECTION CODE: 01, entirely submitted of the ﬁbroadipose tissue; 02, D3, each containing one piece of skin strip.

(E) LEFT AXILLARY, LEVEL 1 AND 2 LYMPH NODES - An 11.0 x 7.5 x 2.5 cm portion of yellow ﬁbroadipose tissue which yields
multiple possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 cm to 4.0 x 3.2 x 1.5 cm. The largest lymph node has a solid tan-white lobulated
cut surface suggestive of metastases. The lymph nodes are submitted entirely.

SECTION CODE: E1-E4, one lymph node bisected in each cassette; E5, two lymph nodes; E6, four lymph nodes; E7.
largest lymph node.

(F) LEFT AXILLARY LEVEL 3 LYMPH NODE- A 3. 0 x 2 5 x 0. 8 cm portion of yellow tibroadipose tissue which yields two
possible lymph nodes both measuring 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes are submitted entirely In F.
