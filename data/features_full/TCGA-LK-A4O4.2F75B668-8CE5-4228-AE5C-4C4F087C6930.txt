Summary Statement ‘

The left upper loﬁe wedge biopsies and left lower lobeotomy demonstrate a difiuse malignant mesotheiioma,

predominantly epithelloid type, involving the visceral parietal pleura and lung parenchyma with involvement of a level 1 1
lymph node. Pathology stage: T2N1Mx.

COMMENT:

The left lung specimens demonstrate a diffuse malignant mesothelloma, predominantly epitheiiold type showing
papillary, hyaline and solid tumor growth associated with vascular invasion and focal extensive necrosis. The

mesotheiioma is unequivocally predominantly of an epitheiloid type although very focal zones of spindle growth are
identiﬁed.

While the pleura show hyaline pleural plaques, the underlying lung parenchyma shows tobacco induce lung injury,
predominantly respiratory bronchloiltls and emphysematous change. No evidence of diffuse ﬁbrosis as one would

expect In asbestosis Is seen. and iron stain failed to demonstrate signiﬁcant numbers of asbestos type ferruginous
bodies.
