F. Received fresh labeled "Subtotal glossectomy with left level 1 neck dissection, stitch left base of tongue" is a
composite resection of portion of tongue, along with portion of salivary gland and Level 1 lymph nodes. The tongue is

an ulcerated area measuring approximately 4 x 3 cm. The ulcerated area continues with a tan-white irregular ﬁrm
mass and the mass appears to be present at the inked deeper surface of the tongue. For orientation purposes, the
specimen inked as follows: superior surface inked black, inferior surface inked blue, left lateral surface inked green,
right lateral surface inked orange and anterior surface inked yellow. Upon serial sectioning, there is an oval, well
deﬁned tan-white ﬁrm mass occupying 90% of the tongue and underlying ﬂoor of the mouth measuring approximately
5.2 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm. The mass is approximately at the left lateral margin. 1.0 cm away from the anterior margin,
appears to be present at
the inked inferior resection margin. It is present approximately 0.2 cm away from the superior margin and 0.2 cm
away from the right lateral margin. The mass grossly does not involve the adjacent salivary gland. The salivary
gland is tan-yellow to white, lobulated soft with no gross lesions. Serial sectioning of the Level 1 adipose tissue
shows multiple possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 cm to 1.3 cm. A representative section of the tumor
