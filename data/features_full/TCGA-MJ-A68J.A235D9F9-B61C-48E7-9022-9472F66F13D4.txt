Microscopic Description

Sections reveal a neoplasm composed of spindle cells, some that are quite
atypical with intranuclear inclusions. Many areas are quite myxoid. There
are inﬂammatory cells present including lymphocytes, histiocytes, and
eosinophils. The lesion is present at inked tissue edges. This case has

also been reviewed at the dermatopathology consensus conference.

This case was reviewed by the staff pathologist listed below.
