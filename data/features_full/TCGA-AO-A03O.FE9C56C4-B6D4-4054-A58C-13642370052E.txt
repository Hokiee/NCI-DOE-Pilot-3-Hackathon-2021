2) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled "Sentinel
node #2, level 1, rt. axilla". It consists of of single lymph node
measuring 2.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. Entirely frozen.

Summary of Sections:
FSCA and B - frozen section control A and B

3) The specimen is received fresh, labeled, "Rt. breast (stitch marks
level one lymph nodes)". It consists of a right mastectomy consisting of
tan skin, breast tissue and axillary tail designated as level one. The skin
measures 27.0 x 16.0 cm. The nipple is everted. No visible scars are
present on the skin surface. No skeletal muscle tissue is present at the
deep margin, which is inked. The breast tissue is sectioned to reveal an
indurated, irregular gray-white tumor, situated in the upper outer quadrant,
4.0 cm from the deep margin and measuring 3.5 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm. The rest of
the breast tissue is fibrofatty. The axillary tail is sectioned to reveal
multiple lymph nodes ranging from 0.8 up to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension.
The largest node is bisected. Tumor and normal tissue taken for TPS.
Representative sections are submitted.
