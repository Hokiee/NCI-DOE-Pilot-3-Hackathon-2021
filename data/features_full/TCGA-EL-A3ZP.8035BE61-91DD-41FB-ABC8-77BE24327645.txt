lymph node, bisected.
(C) RIGHT NECK DISSECTION. LEVEL II B - A fragment of tan-red, soft tissue measuring 2.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. Lymph nodes
are separated from fat and submitted.

SECTION CODE: C1, C2, multiple lymph nodes.
(D) RIGHT NECK DISSECTION, LEVEL lII - A fragment of tan-red, soft tissue measuring 4.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. Lymph nodes
are separated from fat and submitted.

SECTION CODE: DI, one lymph node. bisected; D2, one lymph node, bisected; D3, three lymph nodes; D4, multiple
smaller lymph nodes.
(E) RIGHT NECK DISSECTION, LEVEL IV - A fragment of tan-red, soft tissue measuring 1.0 x 1.0 x 2.0 cm. Lymph nodes
are separated from fat and submitted.

SECTION CODE: E1-E3, multiple lymph nodes.
(F) RIGHT ANTERIOR NECK - A fragment of tan-red, soft tissue measuring 4.0 x 2.0 x 0.8 cm.

SECTION CODE: F 1, F2, lymph nodes.
(G) RULE OUT PARATHYROID — A piece of tan-pink soft tissue (0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm, 0.008 grams), submitted entirely in
FSG1 for frozen section diagnosis. Touch prep was performed.

'FS/DX: ONE LYMPH NODE, INVOLVED BY METASTATIC PAPILLARY THYROID CARCINOMA.
(H) RULE OUT INFERIOR PARATHYROID - A tan-yellow pieCe of soft tissue (1.2 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm, 0.3 grams), submitted
entirely in FSHI for frozen section diagnosis. Touch prep was also performed.

*FS/DX: FATTY TISSUE, BLOOD VESSELS, AND SKELETAL MUSCLE; NO TUMOR PRESENT. -
(I) RIGHT PARATRACHEAL LYMPH NODES - One fragment of tan-red, soft tissue, measuring 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. One lymph
node is separated and submitted after bivalving.

SECTION CODE: I, one lymph node.
(J) RIGHT SUPERIOR PARATHYROID - A well-circumscribed, white-tan soft tissue, 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm and 0.001 gram.
entirely submitted in J. a
(K) LEFT PARATRACHEAL LYMPH NODES- Fibroadipose tissue. 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm. Four lymph nodes are identiﬁed,
ranging from 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm to 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm, entirely submitted in K
(L) TOTAL THYROID - The specimen consists of a thyroid (7.5 x 5.0 x 2.5 cm). The right lobe of the thyroid is distorted by a
grossly palpable nodule located in the mid anterior portion of the right lobe.

There is a 2.6 x 2.1 x 1.2 cm poorly circumscribed tumor, which grossly involves the anterior capsule and is located
approximately 0.3 cm from the posterior margin. The left lobe and the isthmus are grossly unremarkable.

SECTION CODE: L1-L11, right lobe from the superior aspect towards the anterior aspect (L3, L5, L7, L9 are the
( ) portion of the right lobe; L4, L6, L8 and L10 are the ( ) portion of the right lobe); L12, L13, isthmus, submitted
entirely; L14-L16, representative sections of the left lobe, submitted from superior towards inferior aspect.
(M) RIGHT UPPER MEDIASTINAL LYMPH NODES - Fibroadipose tissue, 2.0 x 2.0 x 0.8 cm in aggregate. Eight lymph
nodes are identified, ranging from 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 to 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm.

SECTION CODE: M1, two lymph nodes; M2, three lymph nodes; M3, three lymph nodes.
