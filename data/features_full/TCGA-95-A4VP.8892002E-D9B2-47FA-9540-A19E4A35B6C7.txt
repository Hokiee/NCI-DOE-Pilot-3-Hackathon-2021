- LYMPHANGITIC INVASION IDENTIFIED.

- BRONCHIAL AND VASCULAR RESECTION MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.

- FOUR OF EIGHT PERIBRONCHIAL LYMPH NODES POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA (4l8).
- SEE STAGING SUMMARY AND COMMENT.

F. LYMPH NODES. LEFT 7. EXCISION:

Comment

The tumor is diffusely positive for TTF-i, and focally positive for synaptophysin, confirming the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.

Within the hyperplastic mesothelial lesions, immunohistochemical stains for TTF-i are negative.
