Final Pathologic Diagnosis:
A. Right axillary sentinel lymph node #1, count = 3500, dissection: Metastatic
adenocarcinoma in one of two lymph nodes (1 /2).

B. Right axillary sentinel lymph node #2, count = 500, dissection: No tumor in two
lymph nodes (0/2).

C. Right breast, partial mastectomy:

1. Invasive micropapillary carcinoma, 2.1 cm, associated with microcalciﬁcations; see
comment.

2. Atypical lobular hyperplasia.

3. Fibroadenoma.

4. Microcalciﬁcations in benign ducts.

 

D. Sentinel lymph node #8, count = 350, dissection: No tumor in two lymph nodes
(0/ 2).
Note:
Breast Tumor Synoptic Comment
— Laterality: Right.
- invasive tumor type: Invasive micropapiilary carcinoma.
- Invasive tumor size: 2.1 cm maximum diameter. The tumor is present in slices 4. 5, 9, and 10; however
the tumor has been banked from slices 6, 7, and 8. Therefore, the tumor extends through seven
consecutive slices, each with a width of approximately 0.3 cm, for a total maximum diameter of 2.1 cm.
- Invasive tumor grade (modiﬁed Bloom-Richardson): 2

Nuclear grade: 3, 3 points.

Mitotic count: < 10 mitotic ﬁgures/10 HPF, 1 point.

Tubule/ papilla formation: Deﬁnite tubule formation in <10%, 3 points.

~ Additional comments: We reviewed the original frozen section slides and concur with the frozen section
diagnosis rendered. The metastatic tumor in Part A was only present in the additionally submitted
sections of the lymph node (slide A2]. Level sections on A2-A4 conﬁrms the diagnosis. Select slides from
part C were shown at the , ” the faculty in attendance concurred
with the above diagnosis of micropapillary type of invasive carcinoma. Dr. ‘ has reviewed A2
and concurs with the diagnosis.

An immunohistochemical test for estrogen and progesterone receptors was performed on block 09.
The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is 3+ nuclear staining in >95% of tumor cells.
The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is 3+ nuclear staining in >95% of tumor cells.
Result of HERQ/neu test: This carcinoma is negative for HERZ/neu oncoprotein over-expression.

An immunohistochemical assay was performed on block C9 using the CBll monoclonal antibody to
HERz/neu oncoprotein. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a scale of 0-3.

Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 0 or 1 are considered negative for over-expression of HERQ/neu oncoprotein.

Those with a staining intensity score of 2 are considered indetenninate. We and others have observed that many carcinomas with
staining intensity scores of 2 do not show gene ampliﬁcation. All carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 2 are therefore
submitted for FISH testing. The results of the FISH test are issued directly from the molecular cytogenetics laboratory.

Carcinomas with staining intensity scores of 3 are considered positive for over-expression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Tumors in this
category show an excellent correlation between the results of immunohistochemical and FISH testing, and almost always show gene
amplification.

Gross Description "
The specimen is received in four parts, each labeled with the patient‘s name and medical record number.

Part A is received fresh and labeled , it consists of one pink—yellow,
soft, fatty tissue that measures 3.1 x 2.5 x 0.8 cm. The Specimen is strained and two candidate lymph
nodes are found, the smallest is inked blue and submitted with a representative section of the largest
submitted for frozen diagnosis # 1, thereafter submitted in cassette A1. The remnant of the largest lymph
node is transected and entirely submitted in cassettes A2—A3, and the remnant of the yellow fatty tissue is
submitted in cassette A4.

Part B, additionally labeled _ _ :onsists of a single fragment of yellow,
ﬁbrofatty tissue measuring 2 x 1.8 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette Bl.

Part C, additionally labeled . 7 consists of a right breast specimen oriented
with a short superior and a long stitch lateral. The specimen measures 3.2 cm from anterior to posterior,
5 cm from medial to lateral and 6.5 cm from superior to inferior. The resection margins are inked as
follows for microscopic evaluation: anterior superior in blue, anterior inferior in green and posterior in
black. The Specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into tWelve slices. There is gray—white,
ﬁbrous tissue in the superior half of the specimen in slices 3-11, measuring 2.4 x 2 x 1.5 cm. White
ﬁbrous tissue extends from this area to the anterior inferior aspect in slices 5-8. The gray—white ﬁbrous
tissue appears extend to the inked margin in the posterior superior aspect of slices 3 and 4, and appears
to be 0.5 cm from the anterior superior inked margins in slices 5 and 9. Representative sections are
submitted as follows:

Cassette Cl: Representative medial margin, slice 1, bread-loafed.
Cassette C2: Representative section of slice 3.

Cassettes C3-C5: Slice 4.

Cassette C6: Representative section of slice 5.

Cassette C7: Representative section of slice 6.

Cassette 08: Representative section of slice 8.

Cassette C9: Representative section of slice 9.

Cassettes 010-01 1: Representative sections of slice 10.

Cassette C12: Representative section of slice 11.

Cassette C13: Representative lateral margin, slice 12, breaddoafed.
Part D, additionally labeled consists of a single, yellow, ﬁbrofatty tissue fragment

measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette D1.
