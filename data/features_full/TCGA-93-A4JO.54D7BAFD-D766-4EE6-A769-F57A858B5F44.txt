The specimens are received in live remain-ﬁlled containers. each IW first container is labeled
"level Vll lymph node.“ It contests two fragments ofyellow libroedipose tissue meeeu 2.8 x 1.3 at 1.0 cm and 3.5 x
2.7 x 1.1 cm. multiple putative lymph nodes are identiﬁed within the yenaw libroedlpose tissue. Labeled A1 to A4 -
multiple putative lymph nodes Jar 0.

The second container is labeled ’leiiel X lymph node.‘ it contains a single putative lymph node measuring 0.9 x 0.9 x
0.6 cm. Labeled B1. Jar 0.

The third omtalner is labeled ”level XI lymph node." it contains two Fragments of lan-graytlssue measuring 1.1 x 1.0 x
0.3 om and 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm. Labeled C1. Jar 0.

The fourth container is labeled “lymph node level Xll.‘ it contains a single putative lymph node measuring 0.8 x 0.7 x
0.3 cm. Labeled Di. JarO.

The filth container is labeled "right lower lobe lung.’ It contains a 10.5 x 10.0 x 9.7 crri lobe of lung. It has been
previously sectioned to shows 1.5 x 1.1 x 1.4 cm ﬁrm Mite lesion. There is also a separate,1.3 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm ﬁrm
lesion superior to the larger mess. There is no pleura puckering over either mass. The bronchial margin appear:
normal. Multiple vmcular structures are identiﬁed at the resection margin. They are grossly unremarkable. A low
putative peribronchlel lymph nodes are identiﬁed. Sections of the uninvolved lung show spongy ten lung parenchyma
with no otherlocal lesions. Additionally in the container. a goon cassette labeled 'F 51 .‘ lhet holds multiple fragments
of bronchial tissue measuring 1.5 111.2 x 0.2 cm in aggregate. Labeled E1 to E3 - larger mess; E4 and ES - smaller
more superior mass; E6 - uninvolved lung; 57 - vascular margin: 58 - bronchus; EQ - F61; E10 and E11 - putative
lymph nodes.

The sixth container is labeled 'level lVR.‘ it contains a 3.7 x 2.2 x 1,7 cm pics of yellow libroadipose tissue. Two
putative lymph nodes are dissected from the ilbroadlpooe tissue. measuring up to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.
Labeled F1 and F2. Jar 1.
