Right eye enucleation

Macroscopy

The eye ball measures 23 by 23 by 23 mm with a posterior segment of optic nerve of 10 mm
.At the section, the tumor measures 14 mm main line. Samples have been made for cryo

preservation, cytogenetic studies and for the preclinical investigation laboratory. The
specimen has been then included entirely.

Microscopy

The tumor seen macroscopically corresponds to a choroidal melanoma entirely made of
fusiform cells. Tumor cells are tangled in short bundles. Some of them contain melanin
pigment. Nuclei of the tumor cells are fusiform, ovoid with sometimes marked anisocaryosis.
The mitotic index is low with 4 mitosis out of 10 high 400 magniﬁcation ﬁelds. The tumor is
developed close to the ciliary processes ( slide C) and infiltrates the very superﬁcial internal
layers of the sclera. The optic foramen, the optic nerve and its cut end are free of tumor. The
meningeal sheaths as well as the anterior chamber are free.

Conclusion

Choroidal melanoma of the right eye

Fusiform cell type predominant

Size of the tumor: 14 mm

Infiltration of the internal superﬁcial layers of the sclera

Optic nerve free of the tumor on all its length, including the posterior end

Anterior chamber and meningeal sheaths free
