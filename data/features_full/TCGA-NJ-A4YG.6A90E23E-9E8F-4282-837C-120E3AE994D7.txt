malignancy.

C. (Lung, left upper lobe; lobectomy): Infiltrating moderately differentiated
adenocarcinoma measuring 1.9 cm, with extension to the visceral pleura.
Bronchial and vascular margins free of tumor. Five perihilar lymph nodes
negative for malignancy. No convincing lymphovascular invasion seen. Stage

pTZNOMX.

D. (Lymph node, level 5; biopsy): Fragments of lymph node, negative for

malignancy.

E. (Lymph node, level 6; biopsy): Fragments of lymph node, negative for
malignancy.
F. (Lymph node, level 10R; biopsy): Fragments of lymph node, negative for

malignancy.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION
C. LEFT UPPER LOBE- FROZEN BRONCHIAL MARGIN: Adenocarcinoma. Bronchial

margin is negative for malignancy. (Frozen section C91, C92, touch prep and

smear)

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. The specimen is labeled level 10 lymph node. Received fresh is a 0.5 x
0.4 x 0.3 cm segment of black fibrofatty tissue. The specimen is entirely

submitted in cassette A1.

B. The specimen is labeled level 11 lymph node. Received fresh are multiple
fragments of blackish-pink tissue, altogether measuring 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm.

The specimen is wrapped and entirely submitted in cassette Bl.

C. The specimen is labeled left upper lobe. Received fresh for frozen

section, is a 220 gram, 18.0 x 9.0 x 3.0 cm lobectomy specimen with a 4.0 cm
stapled margin. A 1.9 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm tan, firm mass is seen in the central
portion of the lobe with retraction of the pleural surface. A representative
section of the mass is submitted for frozen section, and the remnant is placed
in cassette C92. The bronchial margin is submitted for frozen section and

the remnant is placed in cassette C91. The remainder of the lung is serially
sectioned and shows patchy pale areas, but no lesions or masses. Sections are
submitted as follow: C1 vascular margins, C2 perihilar lymph nodes, C3

tumor and adjacent lung, C4 tumor, C5 uninvolved lung, C6 stapled margin.

D. The specimen is labeled level 5 lymph node. Received fresh is a fragment
of fibrofatty tissue, measuring 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is entirely

Submitted in cassette D1.

E. The specimen is labeled level 6 lymph node. Received fresh are multiple
fragments of fibrofatty tissue, altogether measuring 0.8 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. The

specimen is entirely submitted in cassette E1. '

F. The specimen is labeled level 10R lymph node. Received fresh is a 0.6 x
0.5 x 0.3 cm fragment of ﬁbrofatty tissue. The specimen is bisected and

submitted in cassette F1.
