Diagnosis/ diagnoses

Resected section of colon (transverse colon) with a colon carcinoma characterized
histologically as a moderately differentiated, partially mucinous colorectal
adenocarcinoma, located at the base of a tubulovillous adenoma with severe epithelial
dysplasia (synonymous: profound intraepithelial neoplasia), extending a max of 5 cm to a
resection margin and measuring 2 cm in diameter at the widest point. Invasive spreading of
the tumor to the submucosa level.

Located 4 cm from the same resection margin there is a microscopically small section or
remains of an adenoma of the colon mucosa, tubular in form and with slight epithelial
dysplasia (synonym: mild intraepithelial neoplasia). In addition, in the centre of the
preparation there is a microscopically small tubular adenoma of the colon mucosa or
remains of an adenoma with moderate epithelial dysplasia (synonym: mild intraepithelial
neoplasia).

Oral and aboral resection margins are tumor-free as is the greater omentum.
18 mesocolic lymph nodes are tumor-free with uncharacteristic reactive lesions.

Therefore the tumor stage is pTl pNO (0/18) L0 V0 R0; G2
