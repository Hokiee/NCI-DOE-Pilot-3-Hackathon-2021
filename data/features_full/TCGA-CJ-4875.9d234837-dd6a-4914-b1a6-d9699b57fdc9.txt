DIAGNOSIS
(A) RIGHT KIDNEY:

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (8.0 CM MAXIMUM DIMENSION), CONVENTIONAL TYPE

(80% CLEAR CELLS,

20% EOSINOPHlLIC CELLS), FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3, INVASIVE

INTO THICK-WALLED
BLOOD VESSELS [N RENAL SINUS. (SEE COMMENT)
Margins of resection free of tumor.

(B) RIGHT ADRENAL GLAND:
METASTATIC RENAL CELL CARCINOMA IN ADRENAL GLAND.

COMMENT
The renal cell carcinoma in the right kidney does not invade into the

perinephric adipose tissue or the renal vein. Tumor is present within
large thick—walled blood vessels within the renal sinus, however, renal
sinus adipose tissue is not involved by tumor.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) RIGHT KIDNEY-A radical nephrectomy specimen (12.0 x 6.5 x 6.0 cm)
with attached segment of ureter (1.0 cm in length and 0.6 cm in
diameter}.

Located in the center of the kidney is a well circumscribed mass
(8.0 x 7.0 x 7.0 cm), surrounded by renal calyxlpelvis. The mass
replaces four-fifths of the renal parenchyma. The tumor bulges into the
renal sinus fat and perlrenal fat. On cut surface the tumor is yellow
with necrotic and hemorrhagic areas. The renal mass is 0.8 cm from the
closest perirenal surface margin.

The uninVOIVed renal parenchyma is unremarkable. No lymph node is
identified in the renal hilum.

NK CODE: The perirenal surface margin is inked blue.

SECTION CODE: A1, ureter, renal artery and renal vein margin;
A2—A3, tumor in renal sinus; A4, tumor and perirenal fat margin; A5-A10,
representative sections of tumor; A11, A12, tumor pushing into
perinephric fat, contiguous section; A13, tumor and normal renal
parenchyma; A14, normal renal parenchyma. A section of the tumor is
submitted for possible electron microecopy studies.

(B) RIGHT ADRENAL GLAND - A fragment of yellow fatty tisSue (10.0 x 5.0
x 2.0 cm), which contains an adrenal gland (5.5 x 2.5 x1.0 cm). A
well-circumscribed yellow, friable mass (3.0 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm) with areas

of hemorrhage is located in the center of the adrenal gland.
Representative sections of the mass and normal adrenal gland are

submitted in B1-B4.

CLlNICAL HISTORY
Right renal mass.
