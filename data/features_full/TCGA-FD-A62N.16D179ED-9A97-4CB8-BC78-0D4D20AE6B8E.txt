Interpretation performed by the Attending Pathologist and reviewed with the

Clinical History:
Patient is a year-old male with urothelial carcinoma undergoing radical
cystectomy and pro statectomy.

Specimens Received:

A: Right pelvic lymph node

B: Left pelvic lymph node

C: Bladder, prostate, bilateral vas deferens
D: Right distal ureter

Gross Description:
The specimens are received in four containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.

A. The ﬁrst container is additionally identiﬁed as, "right pelvic lymph

node". Received fresh and placed in formalin are multiple yellow-tan
ﬁbroadipose tissue fragments forming an aggregate which measures 7 x 4.6 x 1.8
cm. The specimen is dissected to reveal 16 lymph node candidates ranging from
0.3—7.0 cm in greatest dimension. They are submitted as Al-A9.

Block summary:

Al: 7 lymph node candidates

A2: 4 lymph node candidates

A3: 4 lymph node candidates

A4—A9: 1 lymph node candidate, serially sectioned

B. The second container is additionally identiﬁed as, "left pelvic lymph

node". Received fresh and placed in formalin are multiple yellow-tan, soft
fibroadipose tissue fragments forming in aggregate measuring 7 x 3 X 0.6 cm. The
specimen is dissected to reveal 7 lymph node candidates measuring 0.5-7 cm in
greatest dimension. They are submitted as B1-B8.

Block summary:

B1: 5 lymph node candidates

B2-B3: 1 lymph node candidate, serially sectioned
B4-B8: l lymph node candidate, serially sectioned

C. The third container is additionally identiﬁed as, "bladder, prostate,

bilateral vas deferens". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 351.5 g, 18
x 9.5 x 4.5 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen consisting of a 8.5 x 8.5 x 4.3 cm
bladder with attached mesenteric fat and a 4.3 x 3.5 x 2.8 cm prostate. The

anterior aspect of the prostate is focally disrupted. The right seminal vesicles
measure 1.8 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm and right vas deferens measures 1.5 x 0.4 cm. The
left seminal vesicles measures 1.7 x 1.4 x 0.7 cm and left vas deferens measures
1.5 x 0.5 cm. The right ureteral stump measures 2 x 0.5 cm, the left measures
1.5 x 0.4 cm, and each demonstrates an intact, patent lumen.

The right half of the prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left half is
inked black. The bladder and prostate are opened anteriorly along the urethra.
The outer surface of the prostate is red—brown and shaggy. The prostate is
sectioned into 6 slices and demonstrates rubbery, pink-tan, pen-urethral
nodularity with no discrete masses or indurations. Approximately 60% of the
prostate is submitted.

The opened bladder reveals a 4 x 3.2 cm rough, yellow—brown, friable ulceration
located in the right lateral, the right anterior, and the right posterior wall.

The deep margin adjacent to the ulceration is inked black. On cut section, the

4 x 3.2 x 1.5 cm white-tan, ill-deﬁned ﬁrm area of induration is underneath

and admixed with the ulceration, extends into and through the muscularis propria
into the perivesical fat and is 0.3 cm from the deep margin. The surrounding
bladder mucosa is edematous, wrinkled, pink-tan with a uniform 0.1-0.2 cm wall
thickness.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

C1: Distal prostatic urethral margin

C2: Right and left ureter resection margins

C3: Apex of prostate

C4-C6: Representative right lobe of prostate from apex to base

C7-C9: Representative left lobe of prostate submitted from apex to base
C10: Uninvolved bladder mucosa posterior wall

C1 1 Uninvolved bladder mucosa dome

C12: Uninvolved bladder mucosa anterior wall

C13: Uninvolved bladder mucosa trigone

C14: Uninvolved bladder mucosa left lateral wall

C15: Uninvolved bladder mucosa right lateral wall

C16-C22: Bladder mass/Ulceration (C19-C20: in tandem, C21: closest to deep
margin)

C23-C24: Additional ureter

D. The fourth container is additionally identiﬁed as, "right distal ureter".
Received fresh in place in formalin

is an unoriented, 1.1 cm long pink—tan and is white-tan, ureter with a pinpoint
diameter. There is a suture marking one end, which is inked blue and the
opposite end is inked black. The central portion of the ureter is not inked and
the specimen is trisected and entirely submitted as D1.
