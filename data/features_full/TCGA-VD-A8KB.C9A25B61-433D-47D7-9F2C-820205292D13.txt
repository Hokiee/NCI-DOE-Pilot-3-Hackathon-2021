MACROECOPIC DESCRIPTION

A local resection specimen measuring 16 x 15 x 12mm
consisting of a black pigmented tumour and a thin layer of
sclera. In a separate syringe there is 0.1m1 of blood
coloured subretinal fluid. Frozen for research.

MICROSCOPY
Histological sections demonstrate a local resection specimen

of a choroidal melanoma with attached adjacent normal
choroid and sclera.

l
. A. -.---_.-..-m....._. .— ......._.-,.. ....... __.__

The tumour is partially pigmented and consists predominantly
of spindle cells but with small foci of epithelioid cells.
The epithelioid component represents approx. 15% of the
total tumour cell population. The melanoma cells are
positive for MelanA, HSP—Z? (score 2) and partially positive
for CD10.

The number of mitoses is moderately high, approx. 7/40 high

power fields. The microvalculature of the melanoma is

prominent, but closed loops are not present in the tissue

planes evaluated. "Vascular seas" can also be observed:

there is, however, no obvious tumour infiltration. The -
lymphocytic infiltrate within tumour is minimal. . I

There is tumour extension into the sclera and close to the
scleral resection margin at the base of the tumour. The
lateral resection margins are free of tumour.

DIAGNOSIS :
Trans~scleral resection of a choroidal melanoma of mixed
cell type. f
COMMENT §

Molecular genetic examination of DNA extracted from the

tumour cells will be performed using multiplex—ligation

dependent probe amplification (MLPA), looking at chromosomes .Jl‘fntiﬂﬂ
l, 3, 6 and 8. Should the DNA concentration be insufficient

for MLPA, microsatellite analysis will be undertaken.

A supplementary report will follow as soon as these
investigations are complete.

In the meantime, molecular genetic analysis of tumour DNA
extracted from the fresh uveal melanoma tissue was performed
using the technique termed multiplex ligation- dependent
probe amplification (MLPA) . These investigations were
performed in the

The kit P027 from which examines for gains or
losses in 31 loci on chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and a, was used.
The DNA concentration was measured using . and the
quality assessed using multiplex-Pea prior to the MLPA
reaction.

The DNA concentration was high and of good quality on . =
assessment. The MLPA reaction was run at least twice on 5
differing occasions, resulting in similar results. ‘

The results of the sequence analysis of the MLPA products is . V
printed on a separate report.

In summary. sequence analysis demonstrated: normal
chromosome 1, essentially normal chromosome 3. gains in
chromosome 6p and borderline gains in chromosome 8g.

These molecular data require correlation with the clinical ‘I
and morphological data for metastatic risk assessment.
