Addendum Diagnosis
A. Liver, Segment 6, Partial Hepatectomy:

of hepatitis B.
- Focal non~necrotizing granuloma, special stains negative for
infectious organisms.

8. Right Diaphragm, Excision:
— Skeletal muscle and fibroadipose tissue with adherent fibrinous
debris and reactive mesothelial hyperplaeia.
- Rare detached cauterized fragments of hepatocellular carcinoma,
present within adherent blood clot.
— No tissue invasion by tumor identified.
C. "Adrenal Gland", Right Excision.
- Intravenous embolus of hepatocellular carcinoma, involving a large
vein within adipose tissue.
- No adrenal gland identified.
— Please see comment.

Addendum Discussion

An addendum is issued to report the results of special stains for microorganisms, done to
evaluate a non-necrotizing granuloma (block A10).

ziehl-Neelsen and Grocott'e stains are negative for acid-fast bacilli and fungi,
respectively. However, negative stains do not rule out the possibility of an infectious
etiology.

There are no other changes to the original report. Please refer to the comment section
of the original report for additional details.

Gross Description

Received are specimen containers A to C “‘ requ‘sitions and specimen containers are
labelled with the patient's name, .W he cassettes and identifiers are
labelled with the Surgical Number .

A. The specimen is received fresh and is subseque tly placed into formalin, designated
as "A - liver segment 6". The specimen consists o. a 131.8 gram, 10.0 x 5.6 x 5.9 cm
portion of liver. The capsular surface is smooth and predominantly tan with a focal
hemorrhagic area. The resection margin is painted blue. Sectioning reveals a 5.0 x 4.5
x 4.5 on well demarcated multinodular mass which replaces most of the resected liver.
The nodules are variably yellow green to tan with foci of hemorrhage and necrosis. The
mass comes to within 1.0 cm to the parenchymal resection margin. The remaining liver
parenchyma is brown, tan, slightly firm, and nodular. Sections are submitted as follows:

A1-4. mass in relation to parenchymal resection margin with A1 demonstrating area
of necrosis

A5-7. lesion in relation to the capsule, AS<6 demonstrating areas of hemorrhage
aa-io. representative sections from remaining liver parenchyma

B. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin, designated
as "B - right diaphragm and tumor". The specimen consists of a 4.5 x 3.3 x 0.9 cm

irregular portion of grey-tan to dark brown tissue. One surface is grey-tan and smooth.
The opposite surface is dark brown and roughened. Sectioning reveals a central area that
is light brown and homogeneous. Six representative sections are submitted in 31-33. The
remaining specimen is submitted in toto following initial histologic examination in B4-
BE.

C. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin, designated
as "C - right adrenal". The specimen consists of multiple portions of fibrofatty tissue
measuring in aggregate 5.0 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm. The cut surface shows predominantly yellow
adipose tissue with areas of semi firm tan to hemorrhagic friable tissue. A definitive
adrenal gland is not identified. Sections are submitted as follows:

C1. slightly firm ten to hemorrhagic tissue submitted in toto

C2-3. remainder of tissue submitted in toto

Pathologist Comment

The hepatocellular carcinoma shows a classical trabecular / sinusoidal growth pattern
with a few foci of acinar growth. The tumor is morphologically heterogeneous, ranging
from moderately differentiated to poorly differentiated with anaplastic cytology. While
the main tumor mass is excised with a 7 mm margin, there is extensive lymphovascular
invasion beyond the tumor capsule, and intralymphatic tumor is present within 2.4 mm of
the parenchymal resection margin. Cauterized fragments of tumor are present in blood
clot adherent to the diaphragm, but these may represent intraoperative artifact, and no
true invasion of the diaphragm is identified. Finally, the specimen designated "adrenal“
shows adipose tissue with a large intravenous tumor embolus. No adrenal gland is

identified. Per discussion with Dr. this tissue was taken from the fat plane
between the liver and the adrenal. and therefore this may represent local extension of
tumor.

Finally, the background liver shows cirrhosis (consistent with the known history of
hepatitis B) as well as a single well-formed non—necrotizing granuloma. Special stains
for infectious organisms are pending, and will be reported as an addendum.

In case ancillary studies are desired, tumor block information is'listed below:

Best tumor block: A6

Best normal block: A8
