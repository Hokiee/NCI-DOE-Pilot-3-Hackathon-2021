DIAGNOSIS :

1) UTERUS, CERVIX, BILATERAL OVARIES AND FALLOPIAN TUBES; TOTAL
ABDOMINAL HYSTERECTOH'Y AND BILATERAL SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOM'Y:

- ADENOCARCINOMA OF ENDOMETRIUM. ENDOMETRIOID TYPE, NOS, WITH FOCAL
SQUAMOUS DIFFERENTIATION.

- TH_E TUMOR PRESENTS AS A 4. 0 CM POLYPOID LESION IN THE ENDOKETRIAL
CAVITY, (PIGO GRADE}; (<- 6% SOLID GROWTH), NUCLEAR GRADE 2- 3.

- THE TUMOR INVADES TO <- HALF OF MYOMETRIUM.

- THE MAXIMAL THICKNESS OF HYGHETRIAL INVASION IS 1.0 MM.

- THE THICKNESS OF THE HYOMETRIUH IN THE AREA OF MAXIHAL TUMOR INVASION
IS 1.3. 0 MM.

- THE TUMOR INVOLVES ADENOMYOSIS.

- ENDOCERVICAL INVOLVEMENT IS PRESENT IN THE MUCOSA.

- NO VASCULAR INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

- THE ENDOHETRIUM SHOWS THE FOLLOWING ABNORMALITY: COMPLEX HYPERPLASIA
WITH ATYPIA.

- THE MYOMETRIUH SHOWS THE FOLLOWING ABNORMALITY: ADENOMYOSIS.

- THE RIGHT AND LEFT OVARIES SHOW ENDOSALPINGIOSIS.

- ALL OTHER ADNEXAE ARE UNREMARKABLE.
