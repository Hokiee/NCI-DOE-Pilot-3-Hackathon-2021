A. HYPERPLASTIC TONSIL.

NO TUMOR SEEN.

HPV in situ hybridization is ordered and result will be reported in an
addendum. According to the history, the greatest portion of this tumor

was
banked by Dr. - per — prior to receiving the

specimen in

The

specimen is entirely submitted for processing in a cassette labeled 1A.
Part 2 is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, initials xxx
and

"left tonsil". Received is a 3.1 X 2.2 X 1.5 cm tonsil covered by tan—

possible tonsillar crypts. No definitive tumor is noted. Specimen is
entirely

mitted in cassettes labeled 3A—3B.
