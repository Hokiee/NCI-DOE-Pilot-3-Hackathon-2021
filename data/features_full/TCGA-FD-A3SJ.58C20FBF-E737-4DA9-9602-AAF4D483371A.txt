FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS
Cystoprostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection,

"Bladder, prostate, vas deferens" (part C):
- Invasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma, see parameters below.
- Benign prostate and seminal vesicles.
"Right pelvic lymph nodes" (part A):
- Three of nine lymph nodes are positive for metastatic carcinoma (the
largest implant almost completely replaces ‘a 0.8 cm node).
"Left pelvic lymph nodes" (part B):
- Seven lymph nodes, no evidence of tumor (0/7).

Urothelial Carcinoma Pathologic Parameters

1. Tumor type: Flat urothelial carcinoma

2. Grade of tumor: High-grade

3. Depth of invasion: Tumor shows invasion to the outer half of the muscularis
propria

4. Tumor distribution: Large solitary lesion involving the posterior wall,
right lateral wall and left lateral wall as lesion measuring 5 x 3 cm grossly
5. Ureteral margins: Negative for tumor

6. Distal urethral margin: Negative for tumor

7. Soft tissue margin: Negative for tumor

8. Lymph nodes: Positive for tumor (see above parts A and B)

9. pTNM: pTZb, N2, MX

Effective this Checklist utilizes the edition TNM staging
system for Bladder of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the
International Union Against Cancer (UICC).

Clinical History'
The patient is a -year-old male with bladder cancer undergoing radical
cystectomy, bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection, ileal conduit.

Specimens Received:

A: Right pelvic lymph node

B: Left pelvic lymph node .

C: Bladder, prostate, vas deferens; cystoprostatectomy

Gross Description:
The specimens are received in three containers each labeled with the patient’s
name and medical record number.

A. The ﬁrst container is additionally identiﬁed as, "right pelvic lymph

node". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 6.5 x 5.0 x 1.8 cm aggregate
of lobulated yellow ﬁbrofatty tissue. The specimen is dissected for lymph
nodes to reveal 9 apparent lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 to 6.1 x 1.1
x 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. All apparent lymph nodes are submitted as
follows:

A1 -A2: 5 lymph node candidates
A3: One lymph node, bisected

A4: One lymph node, bisected

A5: One lymph node, bisected
A6-A7: One lymph node, sectioned

B. The second container is additionally identiﬁed as, "left pelvic lymph

node”. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 6.7 x 4.5 x 2.0 cm aggregate
of lobulated yellow ﬁbrofatty tissue. The specimen is dissected for lymph
nodes to reveal 8 apparent lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 x 0.2 x 0.1 to 2.7 x 1.5
x 0.8 cm in greatest dimension. All apparent lymph nodes are submitted as
follows:

Bl: 3 lymph node candidates

B2: One lymph node, bisected

B3: One lymph node, bisected

B4: One lymph node, bisected

BS: One lymph node, bisected
B6-B7: One lymph node, sectioned

C. The third container is additionally identiﬁed as, "bladder, prostate, vas
deferens". Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 396.8 gm, 15.0 x 12.0 x
4.5 cm cystoprostatectomy specimen with attached mesenteric fat. The bladder
measures 9.5 x 8.0 x 4.0 cm. The bilateral ureteral oriﬁces are identiﬁed and
probe patent. The right ureteral stump measures 4.5 x 0.4 cm and the left 4.5 x
0.5 cm, and both demonstrate patent lumina. The prostate measures 4.5 x 4.0 x
3.5 cm. The right half of the prostate and bladder is inked blue and the left

half is inked black. The prostate is opened anteriorly along the urethra and
continued superiorly through the bladder in a Y-shaped incision. The prostate is
serially sectioned from apex to base to reveal unremarkable, bulging yellow-tan
parenchyma without indurations; there is periurethral nodularity. The bladder
demonstrates an area of ulceration with underlying induration on the right
posterolateral wall that measures 5.0 x 3.0 cm. The mucosal surface overlying
this induration has a flattened, granular appearance. Serial sectioning reveals

tumor invasion to within 0.2 cm of the inked margin, and grossly apparent
invasion into the muscularis propria. Adjacent to this area of ulceration and
induration, toward the left posterolateral wall, there is a poorly deﬁned area

of mucosa with a granular appearance without prominent papillary excrescences;
the tissue underlying this granular mucosa is somewhat indurated. The remainder
of the mucosa is tan—brown, edematous, and glistening with a uniform 2.5 cm wall
thickness. The external surface of the bladder is red-tan and glistening with no
grossly identiﬁable lymph nodes. Representative sections are submitted as
follows:

C 1: Distal urethral margin

C2: Prostatic apical margin

C3: Right ureteral margin

C4: Left ureteral margin

C5: Right ureteral oriﬁce

C6: Left ureteral oriﬁce

C7~C12: Multiple tumor sections, including deepest invasion in C12
C13: Representative section from adjacent, granular mucosa
C14-C22: Representative sections of prostate from apex to base
C23: Seminal vessels and vasa deferentia

C24: Uninvolved dome

C25: Uninvolved anterior wall

C26: Uninvolved posterior wall

C27: Uninvolved right wall

C28: Uninvolved left wall

Gross photograph was taken of a representative section of the ulcerated,
indurated region.
