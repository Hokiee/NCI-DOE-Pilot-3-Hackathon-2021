here is a 3.7 x 3.0 cm mass that extends
possibly through the pleura, crosses the fissure
into the right upper lobe and is located
approximately 0.5 cm from this stapled margin

margins 3.0 and 5.0 cm adjacent to the
bronchial margin on the right lower lobe. The
remaining parenchyma is unremarkable.
