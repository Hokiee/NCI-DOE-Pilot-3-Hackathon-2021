PROCEDURE: SPHS VERIFIED BY:
Patient with pheochromocytonm. Operative Procedure/Tissue Submitted: Left
adrenalectomy . possible left nephrectomy, distal pancreatectomy and
splenectomy.
PROCEDURE: SPGD VERIFIED BY:

1. ”Left adrenal gland and periadrenal tissue. Short stitch lateral. Short
stitch superior. Two long stitch anterior.” Received in formalin in a large
container is a 240 gram, 11.4 x 6.6 x 5.3 cm resection specimen oriented with
long stitch representing lateral, and two short stitches representing
superior, and long stitches representing anterior. There is a 6.9 x 6.6 x 3.5
cm fully encapsulated mass with a 3.0 x 2.7 x 2.6 cm attached nodule at the
superior pole of the mass and a 7.9 cm long x 1.6 cm wide soft tissue pedicle
at the superior end of the specimen. Specimen is inked black. This specimen
is serially sectioned revealing that the superior end of the specimen contains
unremarkable adrenal glands. The smaller nodule which consists of a pale tan
solid cut surfaces appears to be emanating from the medulla of the native
adrenal gland. The larger nodule contains heterogeneous cut surfaces with
mottled yellow dark brown at the periphery and cystic degeneration towards the
center. The two nodules abut each other and appear to be separated by a

iJ-K. Representative sections of capsule from smaller adrenal mass.

2. ”Periaortic tissue.” Received in formalin in a small container is a 3.1 x
2.1 x 0.5 cm fragment of soft tissue. This specimen is serially sectioned
revealing pale tan, solid cut surfaces extending to approximately 50% of the
edge.

2A & iB. Entirely submitted.

VERIFIED BY:

1. Left adrenal gland, adrenalectomy: Pheochromocytoma, consisting of two
adjacent masses (6.9 cm and 3.0 cm). No lymphovascular invasion identified.
See comnent.

2. Soft tissue, periaortic, excision: Ganlion and nerve. No tumor or lwwv
nodes identified.

COMMENT:

This adrenal resection contains two masses that appear to be adjacent and
confined to the gland. Histologically, the nodules are both
pheochromocytomas, but have subtly different morphologies. Given the patient’s
young age and the recent diagnosis of medullary thyroid carcinoma, a syndromic
form is likely. Given these considerations, two discrete tumors is favored.
