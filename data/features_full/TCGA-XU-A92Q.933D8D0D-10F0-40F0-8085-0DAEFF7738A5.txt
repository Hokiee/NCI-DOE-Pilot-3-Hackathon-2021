COMMENT

The left sided type A thymoma is composed of pure spindle tumor cells.
The histological appearance of this tumor is identical to that seen in a
previous needle core biopsy

The right-sided type AB thymoma shows mostly lymphocyte rich areas that
contain larger cells with abundant cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei and
inconspicuous nucleoli. More importantly these lymphocyte rich areas are
intersected by bands of more spindle—appearing cells with oval nuclei and
bland nuclei. There are also small islands of pure spindle type—A like
tumor‘nodules.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

1. The specimen is labeled with the patient's name and as "thymus gland
stitch on right upper pole". It consists of a thymus gland with suture
at upper pole and having an overall dimension of 23.5 SI x 13.5 ML x 3.3
AP

cm. It is painted with silver nitrate. On the mid right full a
firm tan well circumscribed lobular nodule measures 3.5 x 5.2 x 2.5 cm
and a second nodule also well-circumscribed and tan and homogeneous
measures 4 x s-x 3.1 cm. The remaining tissue appears grossly
unremarkable. 4 pieces of 2 tumor and 4 pieces of thymus taken for tissue
bank. Representative sections submitted.
lA-1F tumor from the right lobe
1G—1J normal section from the right lobe
1K midsection
1L—10 tumor left lobe
1P—1T normal section to left lobe

2. The specimen container, labeled with the patient's name and as Ileft
periphrenic node“, contains a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 5 x
2.5 x 1.2 cm, received in 10% NBP. This contains 2 lymph node measuring
from 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.1 to 0.4 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm.
