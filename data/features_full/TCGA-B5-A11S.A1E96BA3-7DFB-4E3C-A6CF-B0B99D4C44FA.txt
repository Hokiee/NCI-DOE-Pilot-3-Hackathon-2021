The right fallopian tube (5.3 x 0.5 cm) has a tan-purple surface. The
fallopian tube is sectioned, and no gross abnormalities are identified. The
right ovary (2.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm) is tan—brown and is grossly unremarkable.

o The left fallopian tube (5.5 x 0.5 cm) is tan-purple and grossly
unremarkable. The left ovary is also unremarkable.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Dl- posterior endomyometrium with large polypoid lesion
D2— posterior endomyometrium with large polypoid lesion with respect to normal
endometrium

D3-4- anterior endomyometrium with large polypoid lesion

D5— additional endomyometrium lesion suggestive of adenomyosis

D6- posterior cervix and endocervical canal

D7— posterior lower uterine segment

DB- anterior cervix and endocervical canal

D9- anterior lower uterine segment

Dlo— additional smaller polypoid endometrial lesion

D11- right ovary and fallopian tube

D12— left ovary and fallopian tube

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: Hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and bilateral lymph

node sampling
PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 6th Edition): ple pNO pMX

. NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. LYMPH NODES, PARA—AORTIC, RIGHT (BIOPSY):

TWO LYMPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (0/2).

B. LYMPH NODES, PELVIC, RIGHT (BIOPSY):

‘THIRTEEN LYMPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (0/13).

C. LYMPH NODES, PELVIC, LEFT (BIOPSY):

FIFTEEN LYMPH NODES NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (0/15).

D. "UTERUS AND BILATERAL OVARIES AND FALLOPIAN TUBES" (HYSTERECTOMY AND
BILATERAL SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY):

UTERUS: 190 GRAMS
. ENDOMETRIUM:
TUMOR SITE: DIFFUSE
HISTOLOGIC TYPE: ENDOMETRIOID ADENOCARCINOMA.
