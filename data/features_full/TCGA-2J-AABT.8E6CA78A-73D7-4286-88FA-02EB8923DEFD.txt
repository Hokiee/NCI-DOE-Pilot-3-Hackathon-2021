Surgery date: Surgical Pathology (mammatohwbw #5:)
REVISED REPORT (Addendum/Procedure included) Siam/3

DIAGNOSIS:
A. Lymph node, hepatic artery, biopsy: A single (1) lymph node is
negative for tumor.

B. Common hepatic duct, margin, excision: Negative for tumor.
C. Pancreatic neck, margin, excision: Negative for tumor.

D. Head of pancreas, duodenum, common bile duct, portion jejunum,
stent, Whipple resection: Invasive moderately differentiated ductal
adenocarcinoma is identiﬁed forming a solid 4.5 x 4.0 x 2.6 cm
mass, situated predominantly within the pancreas. The tumor extends
beyond pancreas to involve peripancreatic soft tissue, ampulla of
Vater, and the duodenal wall. Tumor necrosis is absent. All

surgical resection margins, including the uncinate, pancreatic neck,
bile duct, and soft tissue margins, are negative for tumor (minimum
tumor-free margin, 0.1 cm, portal vein groove). The adjacent
non-neoplastic pancreatic parenchyma shows chronic pancreatitis. A
single (1 of 20) regional lymph node is positive for metastatic

ductal adenocarcinoma.

AJCC stage (with available surgical material): pT3Nl (7th edition).

This ﬁnal pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic
examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the
specimen(s). A revised report will be issued to document the ﬁnal
interpretation after review of the Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)
permanent sections.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. Received fresh labeled "hepatic artery lymph node" is a 3.9 x 1.7
x 0.7 cm lymph node. Lymph node submitted. Grossed by

B. Received fresh labeled "common hepatic duct margin“ is a 1.6 x
1.4 x 0.7 cm portion of tan-red tubular tissue with orientation.
All submitted. Grossed by

C. Received fresh labeled "pancreatic neck margin" is a 3.2 x 1.3 x
0.9 cm portion of pancreatic tissue with orientation. All
submitted. Grossed by

D. Received fresh labeled "head pancreas, duodenum, common bile
duct, portion of jejunum, stent" is a Whipple specimen consisting of
29.5 cm in length portion of duodenum, 5.4 x 4.4 x 3.0 cm portion of
pancreas. The pancreatic uncinate margin is inked yellow and
shaved, the portal vein groove is inked black and submitted
perpendicularly. There is a 4.5 x 4.0 x 2.6 cm diffusely
inﬁltrative mass within the pancreas, 0.1 cm from the portal vein
groove margin. The mass extends and ulcerates (1.5 x 0.9 cm) the
duodenal mucosa. The ulcer is 3.4 cm from the proximal margin. The
mass extends to but does not involve the common bile duct. A stent
is present within the common bile duct. Peripancreatic lymph nodes
and periduodenal lymph nodes are identiﬁed. Representative
sections are submitted. Grossed by
