Microscopic Description and Comment:
{Not Entered}

 

History:

The patient is a man with prostate adenocarcinoma. Operative
procedure: Radical retropubic prostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node
excision.

SpecimenIs) Received:

A: PROSTATE

B: PROSTATE

C: LYMPH NODE, LEFT PELVIC

Gross Description
Received are three formalin—filled containers, each labeled '

The first container is labeled "prostate." It holds a 56 gram radical
prostatectomy specimen consisting of: a prostate measuring 3.5 cm from inferior
to superior, 3.5 cm from anterior to posterior, and 4.7 cm from left to right;
an attached right seminal vesicle measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm; an attached left
seminal vesicle measuring 2.0 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm; an attached right vas deferens
measuring 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm; and an attached left vas deferens measuring 2.2 x
0.5 x 0.4 cm. The specimen has been previously inked black and a section has
been taken from each prostatic lobe, measuring 2.6 x 0.2 x 0.8 cm and 2.5 x 0.4
x 0.8 cm on right and left, respectively. On section, the parenchyma of the
prostate is tan—pink and grossly unremarkable. The walls of the seminal vesicles
are tan and are lined by tan—brown epithelium surrounding lumina with moderate
amounts of mucoid material. Labeled A1 — bladder neck shaved margin; A2, A3 -
left apical radial margin; A4, A5 — right apical radial margin; A6, A7 — left
apex; A8, A9 - left base; A10, A11 - right apex; A12, A13 - right base; A14 —
left seminal vesicle; A15 — right seminal vesicle. Jar 2.

The second container is labeled "right pelvic lymph node." It holds a fragment
of fibrofatty tissue measuring 5.0 x 2.3 x 1.2 cm. On section, the specimen
shows tan, purple—tan and yellow fat—infiltrated lymphoid tissue. Labeled B1,
B2. Jar 1.

The third container is labeled "left pelvic lymph node." It holds a fragment of
fibrofatty tissue measuring 4.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm. On section, the specimen shows
purple—tan and yellow fat infiltrated lymphoid tissue. Labeled C. Jar 1.
