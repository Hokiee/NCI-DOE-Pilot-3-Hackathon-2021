Surg Path

CLINICAL HISTORY:
Abnormal pelvic swelling.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Omentum (AF11", received fresh. A 20 x 18 x 8 cm portion of firm, matted
yellow—fibrofatty tissue with an embedded unoriented 15 cm length of bowel
upon sectioning. The bowel mucosa is velvety—tan and grossly unremarkable.
The firm fat has a solid white—tan cut surface with areas of cystic
formation. There are also area of soft white friable material (AFl Frozen
section; remnant in A1, additional blocks A2~5 demonstrating bowel wall and

papillations}.

8. "Left tube and ovary", received fresh. A 26.5 gm, aggregate of tissue
composed of a 3.7 x 0.5 cm segment of fallopian tube adjacent to a 2.9 x 1.8 x
1.5 cm ovary with abundant attached fibrofatty tissue. The ovarian surface is
slightly erythematous and focally granular but with no nodules or masses
identified. Sectioning reveals a grossly unremarkable cut surface. The
majority of the ovary is submitted as 31—2 in addition to sections of

fallopian tube.

C. ”Right tube and ovary", received fresh. A 26.6 gm, aggregate of tissue
composed of a 5.5 x 1 cm segment of fallopian tube focally adherent upon a 2.7
x 1.8 x 1.4 cm ovary with slightly erythematous and focally granular

surface. The fallopian tube lumen is focally distended near the fimbriated
end and contains blood clots and soft friable material. Sectioning through
the ovary reveals a grossly unremarkable cut surface. Representative from the
dilated segment of fallopian tube submitted as C1 and from the ovary as C2.

D. "Uterus and cervix", received fresh. A 103.2 gm, 8.5 x 5.8 x 2.8 cm uterus
is received. The seroea is smooth, red—tan. The ectocervix is white—pink and
glistening with a central patent 3 cm os extending into a trabecular yellow
endocervical canal with a 1.2 cm polyp on the posterior wall (D2). The
endometrium is velvety—tan, 0.1 cm in thickness overlying a 1.2 cm myometrium
containing an ill—defined cystic whorled nodularity most prominent in the

fundus (D5).

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Dle anterior cervix

D2— pesterior cervix polyp
D3— anterior endomyometrium
D4- posterior endomyometrium
05» fundic nodularity

E. "Small bowel mesentery", received fresh. A 2.7 x 1.7 x 0.6 cm fragment of
firm, nodular yellow—tan fibrofatty tissue is sectioned and entirely submitted

as E1.

F. "Segment of small bowel", received fresh. An unoriented 14 cm length of
small bowel with an average diameter of 2.5 cm is received with attached
indurated and focally hemorrhagic fat. The mesentery is received stapled and
there is a nodular firm, 13 x 5 x 1 cm area of firm, friable tumor mass
abutting the small bowel wall. The small bowel mucosa is velvety—tan grossly
unremarkable with no lesions identified. Representative sections of the small
bowel in relationship to mesenteric tumor mass submitted as F1—2.

 

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:

 

A. nomentum”: AFl— papillary carcinoma— - TWA-294766

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: HYSTERECTOMY a BILATERAL SALPINGOHOOPHORECTOMY, OMENTECTOMY,

PARTIAL SMALL BOWEL RESECTION

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 6th Edition):
pT3c pNX le (if either ovary or fallopian tube primary)

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Registry as required for
acereditation by th . Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon’s operative report.

 
 

DIAGNOSIS:
UNCERTAIN PRIMARY LOCATION

C. "RIGHT OVARY":
TYPE: SEROUS ADENOCARCINOMA

FIGO GRADE: 2
TUMOR SIZE: LARGELY SURFACE, 1.0 CM IN AREA, PENETRATE < 1 MM INTO WALL

SEROSA: TUMOR IS PRESENT

C. "RIGHT FALLOPIAN":
TYPE: SEROUS ADENOCARCINOMA

FIGO GRADE: 2
TUMOR SIZE: LUMEN FILLED WITH TUMOR 1.1 CM IN DIAMETER

SPECIMENS WITH METASTATIC/IMPLANTED TUMOR

A. OMENTUM

A. SMALL BOWEL WALL WITH CLOSE EXTENSION TO MUCOSA
B. MINUTE FOCUS ON SURFACE OF LEFT OVARY

E. SMALL BOWEL MESENTERY

F. SMALL BOWEL WALL WITH CLOSE EXTENSION TO MUCOSA

SPECIMENS FREE OF TUMOR
D. UTERUS, 193.2 GRAMS
ENDOMETRIUM: ATROPHIC
MYOMETRIUM: ADENOMYOSIS;
LEIOMYOMAS UP TO 5 MM IN MAXIMUM DIAMETER

CERVIX: NO PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS.
SEROSA: NO TUMOR PRESENT

NOTE: The location of the primary source is uncertain. Most of the tumor is
peritoneal. A major focus is in the fallopian tube. The surface of the ovary
is the least likely, but by the definition set by the

his is a distinct poseibility.

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above dia nosis es
