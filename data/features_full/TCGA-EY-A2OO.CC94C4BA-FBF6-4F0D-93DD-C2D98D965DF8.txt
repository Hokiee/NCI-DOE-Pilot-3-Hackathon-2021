Comment: Current pathologic stage using new criteria. ple to
pTla and FIGO stage grouping IE to IA.

Previous Signout Date:

Diagnosis:

A: Uterus and cervix, radical hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo—oophorectomy:

Location of tumor: Endometrium

Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma, mixed endometrioid (90%) and
serous (10%) (A3, A4)

Histologic grade (FIGO): 3 (architectural grade 2-3, nuclear
grade 3)

Extent of invasion: into the myometrium

Myometrial invasion: Superficial myometrial invasion is present
Depth: 1 mm Wall thickness: 7 mm Percent: 14% (A3)

Serosal involvement: not identified

Lower uterine segment involvement: not identified
Cervical involvement: not identified

Adnexal involvement (see below): not identified

Other sites: N/A

Cervical/vaginal margin and distance: widely negative
Lymphovascular Space Invasion: present (A6)

Regional lymph nodes (see other specimens):

Total number involved: 0

Total number examined: 24

Other Pathologic findings:

 

 

— Myometrium shows leiomyomas with hyalinization and adenomyosis
— Uninvolved endometrium shows atrophic endometrium
— Cervix shows chronic cervicitis

Hormone receptor status: Tumor is estrogen receptor (ER)
negative (1+, <1%) and progesterone receptor (PR) negative (0),
by immunohistochemistry, with appropriately staining positive
and negative internal and external controls

AJCC Pathologic stage: pTlA pNO pr

FIGO Stage grouping: IA (based on updated 2008 FIGO staging
criteria)

These stages are based on information available at the time of
this report, and are subject to change pending additional
information and clinical review

Ovary, right, oophorectomy:

— Endometriosis

— Serous inclusion glands

- Negative for atypia and malignancy

Ovary, left, oophorectomy:

— Endometriosis

— Serous inclusion glands

- Negative for atypia and malignancy

Fallopian tube, right, salpingectomy:
— Negative for malignancy

Fallopian tube, left, salpingectomy:
— Negative for malignancy

B: Lymph node, right peri—aortic, removal
— No evidence of malignancy in two lymph nodes (0/2)

0

Lymph node, left peri—aortic, removal
No evidence of malignancy in one lymph node (0/1)

I

U

Lymph node, right pelvic, removal
- No evidence of malignancy in eleven lymph nodes (O/ll)

E: Lymph node, left pelvic, removal
— No evidence of malignancy in ten lymph nodes (0/10)

Clinical History:
-year-old female with endometrial cancer.
