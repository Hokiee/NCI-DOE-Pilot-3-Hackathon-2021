Clinical History:
Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid; 3 CM left sided tumor

—Papillary thyroid carcinoma
-Tumor size: Multinodular, approximately 4 cm
in greatest dimension
~Tumor extent: Carcinoma invades the capsule, with focal
extra—capsular extension
—Margins: Carcinoma is focally less than 0.05 cm from inked margin

COMMENTS:
Sections of the multinodular tumor show papillary thyroid carcinoma,
predominantly the follicular variant. The frozen section diagnosis is

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The siecimen is received in one container labeled with the patient's name.

A. The specimen is designated, "total thyroid" and consists of an
unoriented 44 gram total thyroid that measures 6.0 x 5.5 x 3.0 cm. The
external surface is multilobulated, smooth, and glistening. Cut sections
of the gland reveal that one lobe is largely replaced by a 4 x 3 x 3 cm
pale pink-tan, firm, multinodular tumor. The other lobe shows a 3.0 x 1.5
x 1.5 cm portion of granular beefy relatively normal thyroid parenchyma. No
lymph nodes or parathyroid glands are identified grossly. One section of
the thyroid has been submitted for frozen section examination. Frozen
section tissue is resubmitted as received in cassette AFl. RS 9
