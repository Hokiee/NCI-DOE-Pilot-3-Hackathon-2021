, D. RIGHT LEVEL 4 LYMPH NODE
Is a tan-pink aggregate of lymphoid tissue 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted entirely
for frozen section in FSDl.

ELUNG, RIGHT UPPER LOBE,LOBECTOMY'
Received fresh and labeled with the patient nam right upper lobe”, is a
lZl-gram lobectomy specimen measuring 14.5 x 10.7 x 2.3 cm. T ere is a defect on the pleural

surface exposing a mass measuring 3.0 x 2.5:“ .5 cm. The mass is hemorrhagic and necrotic. It
extends to within 0.3 cm of the pleural margin and 1.2 cm from the bronchial margin. A shave
section is taken of the bronchial margin for frozen section. The bronchi are opened and they
have a smooth tan appearance. The lung is sectioned and'the parenchyma has a variegated pink
and anthracotic appearance as well as areas of congestion. Possible anthracotic lymph nodes are
identiﬁed. Portions of mass were submitted for tissue procurement. Representative sections are
submitted as follows: ‘

FSEI: Shave section of bronchial margin ‘

E2-E5: Sections of mass including relationship to normal appearing parenchyma and
pleural margin ‘

E6: Additional portions of uninvolved "parenchyma

E7: Possible lymph nodes -

  

DIAGNOSIS:
A. 4R RIGHT LYMPH NODE
- ANTHRACOSIS OF ONE LYMPH NODE — NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/1)

B. LEVEL 7 LYMPH NODE:

D. RIGHT LEVEL 4 LYMPH NODE:
- ONE LYMPH NODE - NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/1)

E. LUNG, RIGHT UPPER LOBE, LOBECTOMY SPECIMEN:
- NON SMALL CELL CARCINOMA (CONSISTENT WITH MODERATE TO
POORLY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA) WITH AREAS OF
