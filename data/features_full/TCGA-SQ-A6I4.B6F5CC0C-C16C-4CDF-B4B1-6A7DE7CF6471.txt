A} RIGHT ADRENAL GLAND, ADRENALECTOMY:
1. Pheochromocytoma
a. Tumor size 9.5 cm, 60 gm
a. Surgical margins are negative for tumor
c. No lymphatic invasion present
2. Residual adrenal gland with no diagnostic abnormality

COMMENT :
Malignancy in pheochromocytomas has been reported in 7 ~ 14% of cases,
although malignancy in such tumors of adrenal origin may be closer to
2.4 - 2.8%. No histologic features of have been identified that
definitively identify malignancy. The best evidence of malignancy is the
presence of metastases in sites where non-neoplastic chromaffin tissue
is not normally found. Please contact the
if you have questions regarding

 

The tumor.histology and immunoprofile (see microscopic) support the

diagnosis . 16236-3

A) SOURCE: Right adrenal gland

Received fresh labeled "rt adrenal gland" and consists of a 60 g, 10 x 7 x
3.3 cm adrenal gland with a moderate amount of attached fat. The specimen
is entirely inked blue and the lateral aspect is overlaid with yellow, the
medial aspect overlaid with green, superior is black, inferior is red.

The tissue is serially sectioned: In the inferior—medial aspect of the
specimen is a there a 3.9 x 3.3 x 3.0 cm well circumscribed mass. The mass
has a tan glistening rubbery cut surface with multiple hemorrhagic foci. It
appears well circumscribed and extends to within 0.1 cm from the movable
margins along the medial and inferior aspect of the specimen. It is unclear
whether the lesion appears to arise from the cortical surface.

The remaining adrenal gland has orange cortical surface and brown medulla.
The fat is tan—yellow and lobulated, no additional masses are noted.

Tissue is sampled for possible ancillary studies.
