I} KIDNEY, RIGHT, NEPHRECTOMY:
- RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CLEAR CELL TYPE, NUCLEAR GRADE II/IV.
THE PATTERN OF GROWTH IS ACINAR. THE TUMOR GREATEST DIAMETER
IS 7.0 CM. THE TUMOR IS CONFINED TO WITHIN GEROTA'S FASCIA.
NO INVASION OF THE RENAL VEIN IS IDENTIFIED. ALL SURGICAL
MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR. ONE BENIGN REGIONAL LYMPH NODE IS

ALSO IDENTIFIED.

2) LYMPH NODES, PARACAVAL, EXCISION:
— MULTIPLE BENIGN LYMPH NODES.

1} The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Right Kidney". It consists of
an 840 gram kidney with perinephric fat. The surgical margins
(ureter, artery and vein) appear uninvolved by pathologic process
on a gross basis. Sectioning reveals a 13 x 5.5 x 5.5 cm kidney.
In the SUperior pole of the kidney appears a circumscribed
nodule._ Further sectioning demonstrates that this nodule shows
hemorrhagic and necrotic degeneration with golden—colored viable
tumor. This nodule measures 6 x 4.5 x 5 cm. The tumor
approaches, but does not appear to breach the Gerota's fascia of
the superior pole of the kidney. The tumor does not appear to
involve the perinephric fat. The tumor appears 1.5 cm from the
hilum of the kidney. At the inferior portion of the tumor nodule

 

 

Gross Description:

there appear tumor satellites that are still contiguous with the
main tumor. This tumor satellite appears as much as 2 cm below
the main tumor. This gives the maximum dimension of the tumor
measurement at 7 cm. Representative portions of tumor and normal
kidney parenchyma are given to TPS. Representative portions of
the tumor and normal parenchyma of the kidney are submitted along
with a perinephritic fat margin and the hilar margins. No
adrenal gland is identified with this specimen.

2} The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Para—Caval
Lymph Node". It consists of multiple fragments of fibroadipose
tissue measuring 2.8 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm. Multiple lymph nodes are
identified. The largest lymph node is bisected. Submitted
entirely in three cassettes.
