ragged thymic gland that has dimensions of 12.5 x 10.5 x 3.5 cm. The specimen
is remarkable for an encapsulated pink-tan. ﬂeshy and focally fibrous mass that
has dimensions of 4.9 x 4.0 x 2.9 cm. There is a small focus of hemorrhage and
degeneration with dimensions of 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm. This mass is conﬁned to
within a capsule with the surrounding tissue being freely mobile over it.
