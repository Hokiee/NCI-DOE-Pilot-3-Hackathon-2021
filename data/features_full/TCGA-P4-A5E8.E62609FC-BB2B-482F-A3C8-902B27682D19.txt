COMMENT
The papillary renal cell carcinoma is composed of papillae lined by tall columnar cells. Most tumor cells have eosinophilic
cytoplasm. and some cells have clear cytoplasm. These morphologic features are consistent with type 2 papillary renal cell

carcinoma. The tumor appears to be conﬁned to the kidney and does not show invasion into the renal sinus adipose tissue.
perinephric fat or the renal vein.

The para-aortic lymph nodes (specimen B) involved by metastatic renal cell carcinoma are matted together, hence the exact

number of lymph nodes cannot be assessed. In addition to tumor in the lymph nodes there are small foci of tumor within vascular-
lymphatic spaces in the perinodal adipose tissue.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT KIDNEY WITH REGIONAL LYMPH NODE, VACCINE PROTOCOL - A radical nephrectomy specimen (21.0 x 15.0 x 8.5
cm) including the left kidney (12.5 x 11.0 x 7.3 cm). a segment of renal artery, the renal vein and ureter (1.4 cm in length and 0.5
cm average diameter) and the adrenal gland (5.5 x 2.0 x 1.4 cm).

There is a 10.0 x 8.5 x 8.5 cm well circumscribed tumor in the lower/mid pole of the kidney. The tumor is tan—gray and friable
with focal areas of hemorrhage and necrosis throughout. The tumor is well circumscribed and does not grossly invade Into
perinephric adipose tissue, renal sinus. or renal vein. The tumor does not extend to Gerota's fascia. Three enlarged lymph nodes
(0.6 to 2.9 cm in greatest dimension) are identiﬁed in the hilum of the kidney. These are grossly involved by tumor.

The adjacent kidney parenchyma is unremarkable. The pelvicalyceal system is smooth and devoid of any lesions. Serial cross
sections of the left adrenal gland show unremarkable cortex and medulla.

Tumor has been submitted for the vaccine protocol. Portions of the tumor have also been submitted for possible electron
microscopy. Photographs were obtained.

INK CODE: Blue - Gerota's fascia.

SECTION CODE: A1, renal vein, renal artery, and ureter margins; A2, adrenal gland, representative sections; A3, tumor with
nearest soft tissue margin; A4-A6, tumor and adjacent uninvolved kidney; A7, A8, tumor and renal sinus; A9-A12, representative
sections of tumor; A13, one hilar lymph node, representative section; A14, one hilar lymph node, representative section; A15, one
hilar lymph node bisected.

(B) PARA-AORTIC LYMPH NODE ~ Three irregular fragments of soft tissue (8.0 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm in aggregate). On cut surface it

appears to be a matted aggregate of variegated white-yellow—red tumor. No residual lymph node tissue is grossly identiﬁed.
Representative sections
submitted in 31-35.
