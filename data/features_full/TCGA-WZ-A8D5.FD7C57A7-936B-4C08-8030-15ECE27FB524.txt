1. Seminoma, pure

2. Tumor extends into epididymis, base of the spermatic cord, and
peri—testicular adipose tissue

3. Surgical margins are negative for tumor

4. Lymphatic/vascular invasion by tumor is present

5. Please see testis cancer staging parameters below

CLINICAL INFORMATION
Left testicular tumor

SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPTION

A) SOURCE: Testicle and tumor, left

The specimen is received labeled "L testicle and tumor." It consists of a
198 gm, 13 x 7 x 4.8 cm radical orchiectomy including enlarged indurated
testis (10.5 x 6.5 x 4.6 cm), attached stump of Spermatic cord (2.5 x 1.3 x
1.1 cm). The Spermatic cord margin is inked yellow and the external
surfaces are inked black. Cut surfaces disclose a solid mottled gray-tan
tumor mass effacing the testis, with extension through rete testis, into
the epididymis at the base of the cord. In addition, the tumor extends
through the tunica agbuginea into peritesticular soft tissue at the head of
the testis. The tumor mass measures 10 x 6 x 4.5 cm, is mottled with
yellow—brown areas of softened possible necrosis and hemorrhage, comprising

approximately 40—50% of the tumor volume. No normal testis or epididymis is
identified.

Photographs of the specimen are taken. Tissue is aliquoted for possible
additional ancillary studies:

A representative section of tumor (two pieces) is submitted on one block
for frozen microscopy.

INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION WITH FROZEN SECTION: "Seminoma

presentl iossible mixed germ cell tumor based on gross." is rendered by.

Representative sections are submitted in 18 cassettes as follows:

1. Frozen section residue

2. Spermatic cord margin (inked yellow)

3. Spermatic cord, 1 cm from cassette 2

4—5. Tumor possibly effacing epididymis and head of testis/base of cord

6-18. Testicular tumor, spanning 10 cm (cassettes 7, 8, 11, 13 and 17
each include black-inked external tissue edge

The microscopic appearance substantiates the diagnosis. Immunohistochemical
staining for CD30 is performed on block A16 and supports the diagnosis.
Support for the interpretation of this case may have included the use of

immunohistochemist and or in situ hybridization tests that were performed
