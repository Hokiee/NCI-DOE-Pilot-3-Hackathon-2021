GROS S EXAMINAT ION :

A. "Uterus and cervix (AF1)", unfixed, transferred to formalin. A 59.0 gram,
10.0 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm uterine fundus and cervix. The uterine serosa is smooth
and glistening with a moderate amount of adhesions. The ectocervix measures
3.4 cm in diameter with a cervical es of 1.4 cm. The exocervix is smooth and
glistening, is pearly white and is mildly hemorrhagic. The endocervical
measures 2.7 cm and is composed of a tan, velvety trabecular mucosa. The
uterine fundus measures 4.5 cm and 4.5 cm from cornu to cornu. The overlying
endometrial mucosa is tan and velvety. A 3.0 x 2.7 cm exophytic tan mass lies
on the anterior half of the uterine cavity, eccentrically towards the right
cornu. The full thickness of the uterine wall extends 1.4 cm with the
endometrium accounting for 0.1 cm. The thickness of the mass is 1.0 cm, which
arises above the endometrial surface 0.5 cm. Representative samples of this
exophytic mass are in blocks A1—A2. Representative samples of uninvolved
endocervical canal and uterine fundus, anteriorly are submitted in blocks
A3—A4. Representative samples of endocervical canal and wall of uterine
fundus, posteriorly are submitted in blocks A5—A6. AFl remnants are placed in
block A7. .

B. "Umbilical hernia sac with omentum", unfixed, transferred to formalin. A
composite of fibrofatty tissue and hernia sac, which in aggregate meaSures
10.4 x 9.0 x 3.7 cm. The largest fragment contains a smooth, glistening, 5.5 x
' 4.3 x 3.7 cm hernia sac containing fibrofatty tissue. Representative samples
. ‘ of hernia sac and fibrofatty tissue are submitted in blocks Bl—BZ.

C. "Left tube and ovary", unfixed, transferred to formalin. A 1.7 x 1.2 x 0.9
cm ovary attached to a 7.6 cm length fallopian tube via meso-ovarian,
meso-salpinx. A 2.0 x 1.1 cm piece of fibrofatty tissue is attached. The
overall specimen weighs 7.7 grams. The ovary is mildly nodular and tan-yellow
with no gross lesions evident. The cut surface of the ovary is grossly
unremarkable. Representative samples of ovary and fallopian tube are submitted
in block .. -

D. "Right tube and ovary", unfixed, transferred to formalin. An 8.8 gram
specimen that measures 3.9 x 3.7 x 1.0 cm and contains ovary, attached
fallopian tube and scant amount of fibrofatty tissue. The ovary measures 2.5 x
1.2 x 0.7 cm, is mildly granular and tan—yellow. The fallopian tube measures
7.0 cm and 0.7 cm in diameter, negative for dilation. On cut sections, the
ovary appears grossly unremarkable. On cut sections, the fallopian tube also
appears grossly unremarkable. Representative samples of ovary and fallopian
tube are submitted in block '.

E. "External iliac node right", unfixed, transferred to formalin. A 8.0 cm x
7.0 cm specimen of fibrofatty tissue. Multiple apparent l h nodes are
identified, the largest of which are placed in blocksgand were bisected.
Four apparent lymph nodes are placed in block E3. Five additional lymph node
candidates are placed in block E4.

F. "Right obturator", unfixed, transferred to formalin. A 3.0 x 5.0 cm piece
of fibrofatty tissue. Multiple apparent lymph nodes are identified in
fibrofatty tissue. A 3.9 x 2.4 cm apparent lymph node is identified and was
bisected and submitted in blocks

N, The second collection of lymph node matted together and measures 2.5 cm in
length, are submitted in block and is bisected. Additional lymph node

candidates are placed in blocks-

G. "Left external iliac", unfixed, transferred to formalin. A 4.0 x 3.5 cm
aggregate of fibrofatty tissue is identified. Multiple apparent lymph nodes
are identified within the fibrofatty tissue. The largest of which extends 2.4
cm and was placed in blocks Gl—G2. This appears to represent of mass of lymph
nodes. Additional apparent lymph nodes are placed in blocks 63—64.

H. "Left obturator", unfixed, transferred to formalin. A 3.0 x 1.7 cm specimen
of fibrofatty tissue. A mass of lymph nodes composing approximately 95% of the
tissue submitted was identified. This was bisected and placed in block H1. Two
apparent lymph nodes are placed in block H2.
