GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES

Surg Date

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "left pelvic lymph node" are pieces of yellow-
tan soft tissue, containing lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm to 2.0 x 1.7 x 0.6 cm; lymph
nodes are submitted entirely:

A1: 5 lymph nodes

A2: 1 bisected lymph node

B. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES

Received fresh labeled with patient's identiﬁcation and "right pelvic lymph node" are pieces of yellow-tan
soft tissue in aggregate, 4.6 x 3.3 x 1.1 cm containing 2 lymph nodes, 1.5 x 1.2 x 1 cm in 0.8 x 1.2 x 0.6
cm. The lymph nodes are bisected and submitted entirely:

81-32: 1 bisected lymph node in each cassette

C. PROSTATE

Received fresh labeled with patient’s identiﬁcation and “prostate" is a 72 g resected prostate gland
measuring 5.4 cm from right lateral to left lateral, 3.8 cm from anterior to posterior, and 3.4 cm from
apex to base. The capsule is smooth, red, and intact. Ink code: Apex-red, base-blue. anterior-orange,
posterior-black, right lateral-green, left lateral-yellow. After removal of apex and base, the prostate
weighs 42 g and has a nodular tan parenchyma. The right seminal vesicle is 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm, the left
is 2.5 x 1.7 x 0.5 cm. and a detached piece is 2.1 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm; they consist of cystic tan tissue. The
right vas deferens is 2.6 x 0.5 cm and the left is 3.2 x 0.4 cm; they consist of tubular tan tissue. Tissue is
procured (18 9); submitted entirely:

C1 -02: right apex

C3-C4: left apex

C5: level I, right anterior

C6: level I, right posterior

C7: level I, left anterior

C8: level I, left posterior

C9: level II, right anterior capsule

C10: level II. right posterior capsule

C11: level II, left anterior capsule

C12: level II, left posterior capsule

013: level III, right anterior

014: level III. right posterior

C15: level III, left anterior

C16: level III, left posterior

C17: level IV, right capsule

C18: level IV, left capsule

C19—C21: perpendicular sections of right lateral base

C22—C25: perpendicular sections left lateral base

026-C27: perpendicular sections of right mid base

C28-029: perpendicular sections of left mid base

C30: perpendicular sections of right posterior base

C31: perpendicular sections of left posterior base

C32: perpendicular section of right mid base urethral oriﬁce margin

033: perpendicular section of left mid base urethral oriﬁce margin

C34: right seminal vesicle and vas deferens

CS5: left seminal vesicle and vas deferens

C36: detached seminal vesicle
