fibroadipose tissue fragment. Specimen is composed of a salivary gland (4.0 x 2.8 x
1.5 cm) and attached fibroadipose tissue. No masses or lesions are grossly present in
the salivary gland parenchyma. Five possible lymph nodes are identified, ranging from
0.2 to 1.3 cm in largest diameter. Specimen submitted as follows:

Cassette #1: Two possible lymph nodes in toto
Cassette #2: Three possible lymph nodes in toto
Cassette #3: Representative section of the salivary gland

0.8 to 0.2 cm in largest diameter. Specimen submitted as follows:

Cassette #1: Five poesible lymph nodes in toto

H. Received in formalin and labeled "Teeth #‘s 29,30,31" are three teeth ranging from 2.0
cm to 1&5 cm in largest diameter. In the same container, there is also a bone or
tooth fragment measuring 0.6'x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. For gross description only.

I. Received in formalin labeled "Right subtotal glossectomy with right marginal
mandibulectomy" is a composite resection including tongue (7.0 x 4.5 x-3.0 cm), floor
of mouth (7.5 x 6.0 x 2.0 cm), and fragment of mandibular bone (3.0 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm).
The-specimen is tagged with a double stitch at the.anterior aspect. The mucosa
(medial margin) is inked red, and soft tissue margin is inked black. There is an
ulcerated, ill—defined, white infiltrating lesion, occupying approximately 80% of the
specimen and extending grossly to the soft tissue margin, and measuring 6.0 x 4.0 x
3.0 cm. It does not reach the mandibular bone grossly. Sections are submitted as

follows:
Cassette #1: The tumor with relationship to the margins
cassettes #2—6: Composite section of the tumor
Cassette #7: Another representatiVe section.of the tumor
Cassette #8: Tumor with relationship to possible lymph node
Cassette #9: The bone margin
