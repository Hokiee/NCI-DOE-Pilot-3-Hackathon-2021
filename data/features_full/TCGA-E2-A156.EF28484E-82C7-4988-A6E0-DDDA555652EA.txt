Part D, Left breast, excisional biopsy, gross examination: Tumor approximately 0.3-cm from the posterior margin
Diagnoses called at t and B) and . (D) by Dr.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #1. LEFT AXle

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated

"sentinel lymph node number one left axilla" is

a fragment of red-tan possible lymphoid tissue measuring 1 x 0.5 x 0.3-cm. Touch preparation is performed. The

entire specimen is submitted. A1.
8. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE #2. LEFT AXILLA

Received fresh labeled with the patient identiﬁcation and designated "sentinel lymph node number two left axilla" is

fragment of red-tan possible lymphoid tissue measuring 1.3 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. Touch preparation is performed. The

entire specimen is submitted, B1.
C. NON-SENTINEL LYMPH NODE LEFT AXILLA

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "Non-sentinel lymph node left axilla" is a
fragment of adipose tissue. 2.5 x 2.4 x 0.5 cm, consisting of one possible lymph node measuring 1 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.

The lymph node is submitted, C1.
D. WIDE EXCISION LEFT BREAST MASS

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated ”wide excision left breas " is a previously
inked, oriented, 89—9. 9 x 8.4 x 2.5 cm lumpectomy specimen. The single clip designates superior. double-lateral,
triple-anterior. ink code: Anterior-yellow. posterior-black, superior-blue. inferior-orange. medial- green. lateral-red.
The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 7 slices revealing an irregular friable soft tan mass, 3 x
2.4 x 0.9 cm. located 0.3-cm from the nearest posterior margin (Slices 3-5). A previous hemorrhagic biopsy cavity is
identiﬁed 0.6-cm from the mass (lateral), measuring 1.4 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm. A portion of the specimen is submitted for

tissue procurement. Representatively submitted:

D1-Dz: Representative perpendicular sections, medial margin

03: Slice 2. posterior
D4: Slice 2. superior

DS-D11: Slice 3. entirely submitted, D8 and D10 demonstrating tumor

DtG-D19: Slice 5. 016-018 demonstrating biopsy cavity
020—021: Slice 6. superior. remainder of biopsy cavity

D22—D25: Perpendicular sections lateral margin, entirely submitted

E. ADDITIONAL NEW MARGIN SUPERIOR LATERAL

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "additional new margin superior lateral"
is a previously inked. 6—9. 5.2 x 3 x 0.8 cm fragment of ﬁbroadipose tissue. Ink code: Superior-blue. lateral-red.
Sectioning shows no obvious gross abnormalities. The entire specimen is submitted, E1-E2 (superior), E3-E4

(lateral).
F. SKIN AT ANTERIOR MARGIN

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "skin at anterior margin" is a slender
fragment of unoriented light beige skin measuring 2.1 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm. the entire specimen is submitted, F1.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #1, left AXILLA, EXCISION:

- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1).

B. LYMPH NODE, SENTINEL #2, left AXILLA, EXCISION:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (011).

C. LYMPH NODE, non-SENTINEL, left AXILLA, EXCISION:
- ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTASES (0/1).

D. BREAST, LEFT, WIDE LOCAL EXCISION: .
- INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 2. MEASURING LQ-CM

- MEDIATE CLEAR E, DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, SOLID AND CRIBRIFORM TYPE WITH
CENTRAL NECROSIS AND MICROCALCIFICATIONS WITH A COMPONENT OF INTRACYSTIC PAPILLARY
CARCINOMA

- SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS NEGATIVE FOR INVASIVE TUMOR

RESECTION MARGIN

- BIOPSY SITE CHANGES WITH FIBROSIS AND GRANULATION TISSUE

6. breast, left, additional superior lateral margin, excision:
- ﬁbroadipose tissue, NO TUMOR SEEN

f. skin, anterior margin, excision:
- SKIN tissue, NO TUMOR SEEN.

NOTE: Ductal carcinoma is identiﬁed in 5 consecutive slices. The tumor is composed of 3 components, invasive, in
situ and intracystic. The gross measurement of the tumor is a 3-cm. The largest conﬂuent invasive tumor measures
1.8-cm.

A microscopic focus of low-grade DCIS is identiﬁed at the inferior surgical resection margin.
