***The above synoptic report complies, in slightly modified form, with the
guidelines of the College of American Pathologists Protocols and the AJCC

Cytogenetics Report: Status: Signed Out

Cytogenetics Case Number:

- ' Page 2 0f 5

Page 3 of 5

Karyotype:
No Dividing Cells

Interpretation:
This is a soft tissue mass from the right eye of a patient sent
for cytogenetic. There were no dividing cells in this sample; therefore

cytogenetic diagnosis was not possible. FISH analyses on this sample were
positive for gains the chromosome 3 centromere and of CMYC.

***Electronically Signed Out By***
M.D.

Addendum Status: Signed Out

The FISH result in the synoptic report was given as monosomy 3, but has

been reported (see FISH report) as gains in chromosome 3, an unusual
finding.

-~*SPECIMEN(S) RECEIVED:-~-

Neuropath, Eye, enucleation/evisceration

——-GROSS DESCRIPTION:---

The specimen is received in one properly labeled container with the
patient' 3 name and accession number.

A. The specimen is designated "right eye" and consists of an
intact globe that is 24.0 mm from anterior to posterior, 24.0 mm in
vertical dimension and 23.0 mm in height. The cornea is 11.0 mm in vertical
dimension and 12.0 mm in horizontal dimension. Upon sectioning, there is a
gray—black, rubbery mass that occupies three—fourths of the globe. The
optic nerve stump is 0.4 cm in length x 0.5 cm in-diameter.
