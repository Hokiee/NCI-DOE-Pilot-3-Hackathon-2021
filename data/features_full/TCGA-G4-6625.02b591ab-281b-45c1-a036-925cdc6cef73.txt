GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. SIGMOID COLON
Received fresh is a 20.0cm. segment of colon with both margins received stapled closed measuring
4.5cm. in diameter and 5.0cm. in diameter. The attached portion of pericolic fat measures
20.0x6.5x2.5cm. Upon opening, the mucosa shows a 3.5x3.2x0.6cm. pink tan ulcerated exophytic
polypoid mass located 6.8cm. from the wide margin and 11.0cm. from the narrower margin. Remaining
colonic mucosa is pink tan and smooth with a single diverticulum located 2.5cm. from the narrow
margin. The tumor is noted to extend into the fat but not to the peritoneal surface. The radial margin of
resection is free of any lesion. The peritoneal surface of the tumor and the margins are marked by
black ink. No discrete nodule lesion is identified in the pericolic fat. Multiple small lymph nodes are
identified ranging in size from < 0.1 cm to 1.0cm. Representative tissue is submitted in nineteen
cassettes as follows:

A1: 4.5cm. shaved margin

A2: 5.0cm. shaved margin

A3: mass with deep margin

A4: mass

A5: mass with lymph nodes and fatty tissue

A6: one lymph node and deep fatty tissue contiguous with A5

A7-A8: mass

A9: diverticulum

A10: radial margin

A11: uninvolved colonic mucosa

A12: five peritumoral lymph nodes

A13; four peritumoral lymph nodes

A14: two possible peritumoral lymph nodes

A15: two possible peritumoral lymph nodes

A16: five lymph nodes at narrow margin

A17: four possible lymph nodes at narrow margin

A18: two lymph nodes at wide margin

A19: one lymph node bisected at wide margin
B. PROXIMAL DONUT
Received without fixative is a ring shaped 1.5x1.5x0.7cm. fragment of smooth, stapled colonic mucosa
with slight, focal pink red discoloration. The stapled part is removed and representative tissue is
submitted in one cassette.
C. DISTAL DONUT
Received without fixative is a 1.5x1.5x1.0cm. ring shaped fragment of colonic mucosa with multiple
staples. The mucosa is tan, smooth with no discrete lesion. The stapled part is removed and the
remaining fragment of tissue is submitted in one cassette.
