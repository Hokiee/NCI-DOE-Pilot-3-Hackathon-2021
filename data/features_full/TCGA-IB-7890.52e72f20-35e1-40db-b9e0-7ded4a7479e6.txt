GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A: The specimen consists of pancreaﬁic tail (5.0 cm in length x 4.5 x 2.2
cm), spleen {9.9 x 8.8 X 5.5 cm), and attached portion of fatty tissue (19.5 x
10.5 x 3.8 cm). The entire specimen is painted with silver nitrate. The
proximal pancreatic resection margin is painted blue.

On cut section of the pancreas, there is white, firm, fibrotie ﬁumor measuring
2.8 x 2.5 X 1.5 cm in width. The tumor is located 1.3 cm from the surgical

GROSE DESCRIPTION:

pancreatic resection margin, 1.1 cm from the superior resection margin, 1.1 cm
from the inferior soft tissue resection margin. and 0.6 cm from the the
posterior soft tissue resection margin. The tumor is abutting but not
involving the splenic vein. The tumor does not extend into the splenic hilum
soft tissue. The splenic tiesue is unremarkable. Upon the attached omental
fat. there is a 0.6 cm attached splenule. The remaining fatty tissue is
grossly unremarkable.

The specimen is submitted as follows:

Al and A2 , painted blue resection margin.
A3 w vascular margins.

A4 — tumor and closest superior margin.

A5 ~ tumor and closest posterior margin.
A6 ~ tumor and closest inferior margin.

A7 through A9 — representative sections of tumor.
A10 — representative section of spleen.
A11 ~ splenule bisected.

A12 — thrombosed vessel in splenic hilum.
A13 — normal appearing pancreas.

A14 - potential lymph node {hilar spleen).
A15 a four putative lymph nodes.

A16~19, additional lymph nodes

B: The specimen consists of a cholecystectomy specimen (9.1 cm in length and
up to 4,5 cm in diameter). The entire specimen is painted with silver
nitrate. The outer surface of the gallbladder is smooth and unremarkable. The
lumen contains enumerable numbers of yellow cholesterol stones with
hemorrhagic centers ranging in size between 1.0 cm and 0.1 cm. The
gallbladder wall is thin (measuring 0.1 cm in greatest thickness), and
attenuated.

Representative sections of the gallbladder wall and resection margin are
submitted in cassette B.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
Sections of pancreas demonstrate a pancreatic intraductal neoplasia of low
grade dysplasia (panIN 1) that extends to resection margin.
