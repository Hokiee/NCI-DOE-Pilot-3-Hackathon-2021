Clinical Diagnosis 5 History:

neoplasm.

Specimens submitted:

1: SP: Retroperitonoel dissection with 11:. colon, 1t. kidney
2: SP: Lt. paces min

3: SP: Left common iliac lymph node

DIAGNOS I S I

1) SOFT TISSUE, RETROPERITONEAL DISSECTION WITH LEFT COLON. LEFT KIDNEY
AND SEGMENT OF

DUODENUMJ RESECTION:

- DEDIFFERENTIATED LIFOSARCOMA WITH DIVERGENT DIFFERENTIATION (HIGH
GRADE LEIOMYOSARCOMA) .

~ TWO TUMOR POCI. 6.0 CM AND 3.0 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION RESPECTIVELY.

- TUMOR EXTENDS FOCALLY T0 INKED MARGIN.

- TUMOR INVOLVES THE PIRINEPHEIC ADIPOSE TISSUE. OMENTAL TISSUE AND
SUESEROSA OP

DUODENUM’.

- COLONIC DIVERTICULOSIS.

- UNREMARRABLE KIDNEY PARENCHYMA.

- THE IWOHISTOCHENICAL STUDY SHOWS THAT THE DIVERGENT DIFFERENTIATED
COMPONENT IS POSITIVE FOR DESMIN, CMA AND SHA, AND NEGATIVE FOR C-KIT. THE
HISTOLOGIC AND IMMUNOPHENOTYPE OF THIS TUMOR SUPPORT A SMOOTH MUSCLE
DIFFERENTIATION FOR THIS COMPONENT.

Gross Dnsnrinrinn:

1) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Retroperitoneal Dissection
with left Colon. Left Kidney“. It consists of a segment of colon measuring
55.0 cm in length and 7.0 cm in greatest diameter with a small amount of
mesenteric tissue and pericolonic adipose tissue attached. No orientation
is given. Adherent to the mesenteric and pericolonic adipose tissue are two
nodular tumor masses with a focally lobulated surface, measuring 6.0 x 5.5 x
4.0 cm and 3.0 x 3.0 x 1.5 cm, respectively. The larger and smaller nodular
tumor masses are connected by a piece of fibrotic mesenteric tissue. Both
tumor nodules are partially covered by a fibrotic. mesenteric tissue with
focal areas covered only by a thin membranous fibrous tissue. The surface
of the two tumor nodules is entirely inked black. The larger tumor nodule
is also adherent to a segment of duodenum, which measures 11.0 cm in length
and 4.0 cm in diameter. Grossly, the larger tumor mass is adherent to the
serosal surface, but not invading into the subserosa of the duodenal
segment. The duodenal mucosa is extensively congested with no discrete
tumor mass identified. also received in the container is a kidney measuring
10.5 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm, which has a segment of unremarkable ureter measuring
9.0 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. Upon opening, the renal parenchyms
appears unremarkable with the cortical thickness measuring up to 0.4 cm.
The smaller tumor mass is adherent to the perinephric adipose tissue and
focally abuts, but not invading into the renal capsule. Upon opening the
large bowel, it contains a large amount of tan-brown liquid material. The
colonic mucosa is markedly flattened with multiple diverticula and no
evidence of a discrete tumor mass identified. A lymph node search is
performed in the pericolonic adipose tissue and multiple lymph nodes are
identified, measuring up to 1.3 cm in greatest dimension. A portion of
tumor mass is submitted for TPB, ‘
Gross photograph taken. Representative sections are submitted.

2) The specimen is received fresh, labeled I'I..eft Psoas Mas'. It
consists of a soft tissue mass, measuring 6.5 x 5.0 x 4.0 cm. which has a
multi-lobulated surface and is covered by fibrous tissue and focally
skeletal muscle. No orientation is given. The skeletal muscl- ‘-
designated as a resection margin as per conversation with . The
fragment of skeletal muscle is inked black, and the remaining soft tissue
surface is inked yellow. The specimen is sequentially sectioned to reveal a
tan-white. fleshy cut surface with focal cystic change, central fibrosis and
bone formation. The tumor mass appears to be entirely encapsulated by a
thin, membranous. fibrous tissue and the skeletal margin grossly appears to
be free of tumor. A portion of tumor is submitted for T93 and

Gross photograph taken. Representative sections are submitted.

3) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled “Left common iliac
lymph node '. It consists of a single piece of fibroadipose tissue
measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. The specimen is bisected and submitted
entirely.
