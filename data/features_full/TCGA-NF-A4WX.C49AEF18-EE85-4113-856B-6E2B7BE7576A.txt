DIAGNOSIS: _ ' . .
A. soft tissue, left paracolic gutter nodule, exc1510n: Metastatic églc);QJF7/IJ?
carcinosarcoma.

B. Uterus, left and right fallopian tubes and ovaries, hysterectomy
and bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy: Mali nant mixed Mullerian
tumor, with 80% glandular, 20% stromal dif erentiation, is
identified forming a lobulated polypoid mass (3.7 x 3.4 x 2.4 cm).
The tumor does not involve cervix. No invasion into the myometrium.

Lymphovascular space invasion is identified. The tumor involves
the anterior uterine serosa (0.3 cm nodule) and the left fallopian
tube serosa (0.2 cm nodule). There is endometriosis on the right
ovarian surface and in the uterine cul de sac. There are multiple
(5 subserosal, ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 7.0 cm in greatest
dimension; 10 submucosal, ranging in size from 0.1 cm to 2.4 cm in
greatest dimension; 6 intramural, ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 2.0
cm in greatest dimension) leiomyomata in the myometrium. The cervix
is without diagnostic abnormality. The left ovary and right
fallopian tube are unremarkable.

C. Lymph nodes, left and right pelvic, excision: Multiple (24)
lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

D. omentum, omentectomy: Omentum and multiple (2) benign lymph
nodes are negative for tumor.

E. Lymph nodes, right para—aortic, excision: Multiple (4) lymph
nodes are negative or tumor.

F. Gonadal vessel, right, excision: Negative for tumor.

G. Lymph nodes, left para—aortic, excision: Multiple (7) lymph
nodes are negative for tumor.

H. Gonadal vessel, left, excision: Negative for tumor.

I. Mesentery, sigmoid, excision: Metastatic carcinosarcoma forming
a 1.3 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm friable tan mass.

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic
examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the
specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are
reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes
identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a
revised report.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled "left paracolic gutter tumor nodule" is a
1.8 x 1.3 x 0.4 cm portion of tan—red cauterized adipose tissue. No
discrete mass is identified. All submitted.

B. Received fresh labeled "uterus, left and ri ht fallopian tube
and ovary" is a 195.0 gram uterus with bilatera? fallopian tubes and
ovaries. The anterior uterine serosa has hemorrhagic adhesions and
the cul—de—sac has focal fibrous adhesions. There is a 3.7 x 3.4 x
2.4 cm lobulated polypOid mass attached to the left posterior wall

of the endometrial cavity without invasion, grossly. The myometrial
thickness is 1.2 cm. There are multiple (5 subserosal, rangin in
size from 0.3 cm to 7.0 cm in greatest dimension; 10 submucosal,
ranging in size from 0.1 cm to 2.4 cm in greatest dimension; 6
intramural, ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 2.0 cm in greatest
dimension) leiomyomata in the myometrium. There is an attached 2.8
x 1.6 x 1.4 cm right ovary with hemorrhagic adhesions on its outer
surface and a cystic and solid cut surface with a 7.4 x 0.4 cm right
fallopian tube, which is unremarkable. There is a detached 2.2 x
1.4 x 1.1 cm left ovary with a smooth outer surface and a solid cut
surface with a 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm nodule, and a 7.2 x 0.4 cm left
fallopian tube with hemorrhagic adhesions. Representative sections
are submitted.

C. Received fresh labeled "left and right pelvic lymph nodes“ is a
6.7 x 6.2 x 1.8 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue.
Multiple (28) lymph nodes are identified. Al ymph nodes

submitted.

D. Received fresh labeled "omentum" is a 36.3 x 24.4 x 1.7 cm
portion of omentum. There are areas of hemorrhage, but no masses
are identified grossly. Multi le (2) lymph nodes are identified.
Representative sections are su mitted.

E. Received fresh labeled “right para-aortic lymph nodes" is a 4.4
x 3.0 x 1.4 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. Multiple
(S) lymph nodes are identified. All lymp nodes submitted.

F. Received fresh labeled "right gonadal vessels" is a 10.3 cm in
len th by 0.4 cm in diameter portion of unremarkable blood vessel
wit attached adipose tissue. Representative sections submitted.

G. Received fresh labeled "left para-aortic lymph nodes" is a 3.2 x
2.2 x 1.3 cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. Multiple
(7) lymph nodes are identified. All lymp nodes submitted.

H. Received fresh labeled "gonadal vessel" is an 11.2 cm in length
by 0.3 cm in diameter portion of unremarkable blood vessel with
attached adipose tissue. Representative sections submitted.

I. Received fresh labeled "sigmoid mesentery biopsy" is a 2.7 x 1.5
x 0.8 cm portion of adipose tissue with a 1.3 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm friabl
tan mass. All submitted.

3. Received fresh labeled "appendix"is a 5.4 x 0.3 cm appendix with
smooth serosa. There is no gross perforation. Representative
sections are submitted.
