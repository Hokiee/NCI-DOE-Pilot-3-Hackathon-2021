- HIGH GRADE INVASIVE UROTHELIAL CARCINOMA. NO EVIDENCE OF
TUMOR MULTICENTRICITY IS IDENTIFIED. NO IN SITU CARCINOMA
IS IDENTIFIED THE TUMOR INVADES INTO THE PERIVESICAL SOFT
TISSUES (pT3b). LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IS PRESENT IN THE

RIGHT POSTERIOR, RIGHT ANTERIOR AND LEFT ANTERIOR. NO
PERINEURAL INVASION IS IDENTIFIED. MULTICENTRIC FOCI OF
INVASIVE CARCINOMA ARE PRESENT. THE TUMOR IS CONFINED TO
THE PROSTATE. THE SEMINAL VESICLES ARE FREE OF TUMOR. ALL
SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR. THE REMAINING PROSTATE
SHOWS THE FOLLOWING ABNORMALITYlIES): PROSTATIC

Gross Description:

1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled
"Right Distal Ureter". It consists of a 0.3 x 0.2 cm tubular
piece of tan-pink soft tissue. The specimen is entirely frozen
and subsequently submitted for permanent sections.

Summary of Sections:
FSC — frozen section control

2) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled
"Left Distal Ureter". It consists of a 0.3 x 0.2 cm tubular
piece of tan—pink soft tissue. The specimen is entirely frozen
and subsequently submitted for permanent sections.

Summary of Sections:
FSC — frozen section control

3) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Bladder and
Prostate". It consists of a 24 x 14 x 5.8 cm cystoprostatectomy
specimen with attached overlying adipose tissue. The left half
of the prostate is inked blue and the right half is inked green.
In the left half of the bladder there is a palpable tumor mass
which appears to occupy the left lateral and anterior wall. The
overlying adipose in this area is inked black. There is
approximately 3 cm in length of ureter on the left and 4.5 cm of
ureter on the right. Both ureters are probe patent. The
specimen is opened along the anterior wall to reveal a 7.5 X 6.8
X 3.3 cm, fungating, ulcerated tumor mass occupying the central
and lateral left posterior bladder wall as well as the anterior
bladder wall. The tumor is left lateral and anterior and is
adjacent to, but not occluding, the left ureteral orifice within
the bladder. The uninvolved bladder mucosa is hemorrhagic and
rugose. The trigone is not grossly involved by tumor. Serial
sectioning of the tumor reveals the cut surfaces are yellow-white
and necrotic. The tumor invades the muscularis mucosa, however,

it does not appear to extend through it into the overlying soft
tissue. Representative sections of tumor and bladder mucosa are
submitted. The entire prostate is submitted from anterior to
posterior and designated A through H respectively. The specimen
is photographed and portions of tumor are submitted to TPS.

6) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left pelvic
lymph nodes“. It consists of multiple irregular pieces of
yellowish tan fibroadipose tissue measuring 5.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm in
aggregate which contains several lymph nodes. The specimen is
submitted entirely.

Summary of Sections:

7) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Right pelvic
lymph nodes". It consists of multiple irregular pieces of
yellowish tan fibroadipose tissue measuring 5.0 x 5.0 x 1.0 cm in

8) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Right distal
ureter". It consists of a portion of ureter which is surrounded
by reddish tan fibroadipose tissue measuring 1.0 cm in length and
up to 0.4 cm in diameter. At one end of the specimen is oriented
by a suture. The specimen is submitted entirely.
