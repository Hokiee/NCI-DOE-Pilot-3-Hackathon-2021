PREVIOUS DIAGNOSIS INQUIRY

 

 

OPER DATE: REG DOC:
VERIFIED BY:

year-old with long history of Barrett's esophagus, chronic GERD and large
hiatal hernia. Surveillance endoscopy - ulcerative esophagitis with rare
atypia with possible myelodysplasia.

VERIFIED BY:

1. "Thoracic esophagus.” Specimen consists of a 2.1 cm long segment of distal
esophagus that is 3.2 cm in internal circumference. There is a 5.2 cm in
length x 6.3 x 1.3 cm portion of adherent cardiac stomach. The adventitia is
pink’tan with the serosa being a smooth pink-tan. The mucosa of the esophagus
is a gray-white. The specimen has been previously incised. The esophageal
gastric junction is ill-defined in focal areas with areas of gray-white mucosa
Located within the gastric mucosa. The gastric mucosa is predominantly rug-ted
tan and is also remarkable for focal areas of pink-tan possible erosions.
These erosion: range from 0.2 x 0.2 cm to 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The nests of the
gray-white tissue range up to 0.3 cm each. These areas are located 2.3 cm away
from the distal margin which is the closest margin.

1A-D. Esophageal gastric junction.

12. White nests of tissue.

1F-G. Gastric erosions.

iﬂ-I. Largest erosion.

2. ”Cervical esophageal margin.” Specimen consists of a portion of pink-tan
tissue, 3.2 cm in length x 2.2 cm in diameter. The mucosa is gray-tan end is
folded. one margin has been stapled and the opposite margin is opened. The
stapled margin is inked.
