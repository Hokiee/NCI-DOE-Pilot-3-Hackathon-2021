GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. TUMOR BED LEFT PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "tumor bed, left partial
nephrectomy" is a fragment of tan fibrous tissue measuring 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted for
frozen section, FSA.
B. LEFT PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "left partial nephrectomy" is an
intact, unoriented, partial nephrectomy specimen, 6.5 x 6 x 5.3 cm, with detached fragment of adipose
tissue, 13.2 x 4.5 x 2 cm, collectively weighing 104 g. The parenchymal margin inked black, remainder
of kidney specimen inked blue. The kidney is sectioned to show an encapsulated, golden tan, lobulated,
soft friable mass measuring 6.2 x 6 x 5.3 cm, approaching the parenchymal margin at distance of 0.3

cm. The fragment of adipose tissue is sectioned to show unremarkable cut surface. Gross photographs
are taken. A portion of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement, representatively submitted:
B1 -B5: Representative sections, mass and parenchymal margin

B6-B9: Representative sections, mass

B10: Representative sections, detached fragment adipose tissue

CLINICAL HISTORY:
None given

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left renal mass
