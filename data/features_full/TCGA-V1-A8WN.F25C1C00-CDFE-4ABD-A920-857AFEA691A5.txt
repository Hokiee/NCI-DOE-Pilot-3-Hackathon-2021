FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS

A. Soft tissue, pen-prostatic fat, biopsy: Benign ﬁbroadlpose tissue, no prostatic
epithelium or carcinoma.

B. Right anterior apex margin, biopsy: Benign prostatic tissue, no carcinoma present.

C. Right posterior apex margin, biopsy: Fibromuscular tissue, no prostatic epithelium
or carcinoma.

D. Prostate gland, bilateral seminal vesicles, radical prostatectomy:
- Prostate gland: Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3+4=7, conﬁned to
prostate, excised; see comment.

- Right and left seminal vesicles: No tumor identified.

Pro-op Diagnosis:

Gross Description ,
The specimen is received in four parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record
number. Parts A-C are received in formalin. Part D is received fresh.

Part A, additionally labeled "periprostatlc fat," consists of one irregular fragment of rubbery, deep‘yellow
to red, lobulated soft tissue (3.9 x 1.8 x 0.3 cm). No lymph nodes are identiﬁed. The specimen is
entirely submitted in cassettes A1 and A2. '

Part B, additionally labeled “right anterior apex margin (perm)," consists of one unoriented, irregular
fragment of rubbery, deep-brown soft tissue (0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm), entirely submitted in cassette Bl.

Part C, additionally labeled “right posterior apex margin (perm)," consists of one unorlented, irregular
fragment of rubbery, deep-brown soft tissue (0.4 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm), entirely submitted in cassette CI.

Part D, additionally labeled "prostate and seminal vesicles," consists of a prostate with attached seminal
vesicles (37 gm; 3 cm from apex to base x 3.5 cm in width x 3 cm from anterior to posterior). The
seminal vesicle/yes deferens bundles (right 4.5 x 2.5 x 1 cm; left 4 x 2 x 0.5 cm) have tan-pink,
lobulated cut surfaces.

GROSS ABNORMALITIES: No lesion is identiﬁed. The parenchyma is tan-pink and spongy with few
rubbery, well-circumscribed, tan perlurethral nodules (0.2«0.4 cm in greatest dimension). The anterior
ﬁbrous stroma is open. The remaining capsule Is ripped and sutured closed.

ORIENTED BY: Anatomic landmarks (seminal vesicles, urethra).

INKING: Anterior right green, anterior left blue, posterior black.

POTENTIAL STUDIES: Snap frozen.

TOTAL NUMBER OF SLICES: (Not Including apex and base margin slices): 5.

AVERAGE SLICE THICKNESS: 0.4 cm (for slices 1—4).

For properly consented patients, sections of the prostate not required by Pathology for diagnosis, and
not submitted as described above, have been submitted to the for processing

and can also be made available.

Diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations. Final diagnosis made by attending pathologist following review of all
pathology slides. The attending pathologist has reviewed all diciations, including prosector work. and preliminary Interpretations
peiformed by any resident involved in the case and performed all necessary edits before signing the final report.
