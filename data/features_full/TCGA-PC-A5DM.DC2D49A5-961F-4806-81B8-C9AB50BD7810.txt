Gross Description: Received fresh in a container labeled with patient's
name and medical record number labeled "left thigh tumor". It consists of
a roughly ovoid soft to rubbery mass measuring 26 x 14 x 12 cm. There is
a stitch marking distal as per surgeon. At the deep aspect there is some
overlying fascia and, there is a 1.5 x 1.5 cm ragged defect exposing of
what appears to be tumor. This area is adiacent to some retractive fascia
and is not a true defect as per - Distally, there is skeletal
muscle measuring up to 5.3 cm that is normal appearing. Sections disclose
a 15 x 12.5 x 8.5 cm tumor. The more superﬁcial aspect of the tumor is
thinly capsulated with no defects or masses. Sections disclose
predominately a soft yellow necrotic tumor and some hemorrhage more
proximally. Towards the periphery and more distally there is a pink
viable tumor noted. Fresh tissue is prepared for

Representative sections are submitted in 1A-lI as follows: 1A proximal, lB
distal, lC-lD deep, 1E-1F superﬁcial, lG-lI additional sections of the
tumor-no margins.

Summary of Sections: Representative sections are submitted in lA-lI.

Final Diagnosis:

1) Left thigh tumor:

-Pleomorphic, high grade, spindle and giant cell leiomyosarcoma (15 cm).

-Tumor is present less than 1 mm from the superﬁcial margin and within

1mm from the deep margin, see note.

Note: The 1 mm deep margin is dense collagenous tissue consistent with
fascia. Immunohistochemical studies performed on the morphologically
similar previous biopsy specimen by the referring laboratory

reveal that the tumor is strongly and diffusely positive for smooth muscle
actin and Vimentin and focally positive for muscle speciﬁc actin
supporting the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma.

DIAGNOSIS: Leiomyosarcoma

KARYOTYPE: Highly complex abnormal male karyotype with double minutes.
RESULTS: The tumor specimen was placed in culture and harvested aﬁer
seven and twelve days. All eleven metaphases examined from the seven-day
culture were abnormal and exhibited tremendous heterogeneity and
complexity. Chromosome numbers ranged from 42 to 201 , and every
chromosome pair had a rearrangement. There were several clonal
abnormalities that could not be deﬁnitively described as well as double
minutes present in each cell. All ten cells from the twelve-day culture

were apparently normal and presumably represent an outgrth of normal
cells from the tumor sample. A preliminary report was given to
