PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:

SPECIMEN LABELED "RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY“:

MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA (~50% mucinous component), MODERATELY
DIFFERENTIATED (3.0 cm in greatest dimension} ,
Tumor is located in the cecum/ascending colon, forms a polypoid mass, is
ulcerative and has an infiltrating border.
Tumor invades through muscularis propria and into pericolonic adipose
tissue.
Proximal, distal and radial resection margins are negative for tumor.
Invasive tumor is 9.9 cm from proximal resection margin, 9.5 cm from
distal resection margin, and 7.2 cm from radial resection margin.
Lymphovascular invasion is not identified.
Venous invasion is not identified.
Perineural invasion is not identified.
Peritumcral lymphoid response (including Crohn's—like infiltrate) is
mild.
Residual adenoma is absent.
REGIONAL LYMPH NODE (POSITIVE/TOTAL): Zero (0) / thirty (30).
One (1) separate adenoma.
Mural pigment consistent with tattoo site.
Associated diseases include diverticulosis.
Appendix and terminal ileum with no significant pathologic change

AJCC Classification T3 N0 MX.
NOTE: Levels examined on block A5.

CLINICAL DATA:

History: None given.

Operation: None given.

Operative Findings: None given.
Clinical Diagnosis: Colon cancer.

TISSUE SUBMITTED:
A/l. Hemicolectomy.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name, unit

number, and "#1. Right hemicolectomy", and consists of a portion of terminal
ileum (2.2 x 2.8 cm}, and attached cecum and ascending colon (20.3 cm in length
x 4.5 cm in diameter), and attached appendix (5.0 x 0.8 cm), a 3.2 cm proximal
resection margin, and a 2.8 cm distal staple resection margin. An ulcerated
mass (3.0 x 2.2 x 0.5 cm) is present in the cecum/ascending colon, 6.5 cm
distal to the ileocecal valve, 9.9 cm from the proximal stapled resection
margin, and 9.5 cm from the distal staple resection margin. Approximately 15
other mucosal ridges (polyps) are present in the ascending colon, measuring 0.2
to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension, and they may actually represent hyperplastic
folds of mucosa. Representative sections of normal mucosa and tumor are
submitted for tissue bank. Radial margin is 7.2 cm from the mass. Occasional
diverticula are present, with impact of fecaliths. An area of submucosal
tattoo pigment is identified 1.8 cm proximal to the mass.

Micro A2: Distal resection margin with diverticulum (en e), 2 frags, -

CASE NUMBER: —

By his/her signature below, the senior physician certifies that he/she
personally conducted a microscopic examination ("gross only" exam if so stated)
of the described speciments) and rendered or confirmed the diagnosis(es)

related thereto.

Addendum:

Upon re—review of this case, there is a focus of possible invasion into a
venule outside of muscularis propria. In that focus, a tumor cell nest is
surrounded by discontinuous smooth muscle cells, which probably represent
residual venular wall.

Addendum #2:

This primary tumor is still classified as T3. The focus mentioned in the
previous addendum is suspicious for extramural venous invasion.
