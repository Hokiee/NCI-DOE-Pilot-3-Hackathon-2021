ICOMMENT: There is very extensive multifocal/multicentric disease, with random
sections distant from the main tumor mass showing foci of infiltrating lobular
carcinoma involving all four quadrants of the breast.

I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the above
specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).

ADDENDUM 1:

Tissue was sent to the for assay of the estrogen
and progesterone receptors. The estrogen receptor activity was judged to be
positive with an estimated FMOL value of 30. The progesterone receptor
activity was judged as positive with an estimated FMOL of value of 101.
