Gross Description:
Received in a single container labeled- " wedge
resection left upper lobe. The specimen consists of a wedge
resection of the lung measuring 9 x 6 x 1. 5 cm. The pleural surface
is yellow to red tan and slightly anthracotic. 0n sectioning reveals
a circumscribed white tan firm nodule measuring 2 cm in greatest
dimension that is 0.1 cm from_the pleural surface and extends 1 cm
from the resection margin. A representative section was examined at
the time of surgery. Received with the specimen are cassettes
labeled Representative sections are submitted as
follows: A frozen section, B shaved resection margin, C through F
additional sections from nodule.

Microscopic Description:
The slides labeled” are examined. See diagnosis.
Final Diagnosis
Lung, left upper lobe (wedge biopsy):
Adenocarcinoma:
" moderately differentiated
~ measuring 2.0 cm in greatest diameter
a -extending up to but not through pleura
— tumor identified within endothelial lined lymphovascular space
- areas of fibrosis
- lymph nodes: No lymph nodes resected (see comment) PBS 9
SPC~A
CPT: 88307, 88331
Comments
The frozen section diagnOsis is confirmed.
In some areas dense fibrosis is present associated with the tumor.
Although the adenocarcinoma grows along alveolar spaces, the areas of
fibrosis remove this from the differential diagnosis of a
bronchoalveolar carcinoma. The tumor focally extends up to the
pleural surface but does not extend into the pleural surface.
This test has been finalized at themCampus.
