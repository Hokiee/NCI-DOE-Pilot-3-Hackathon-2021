Gross Description:

The specimens are received in three containers each 1abe1ed with the patient's
name and medica1 record number.

A. The first container is additiona11y identified as, "1eft pe1vic 1ymph node".
Received fresh and 1aced in forma1in is a 5.3 x 3.2 x 2.2 cm aggregate of
1obu1ated ye11ow fi rofatty tissue. The specimen is dissected or ymph nodes
to revea1 9 apparent 1ymph nodes ranging from 0.4—2.1 cm in greatest dimenSion.
A11 apparent ymph nodes are submitted as fo11ows:

A1-A3: One 1ymph node candidate, bisected in each casette
A4-A5: Three 1ymph node candidates in each casette

B. The second container is additiona11y identified as, "right pe1vic 1ymph
node". Received fresh and p1aced in forma1in is a 3.5 x 2.3 x 1.3 cm a gregate
of 1obu1ated ye11ow fibrofatty tissue. The specimen is dissected for ymp
nodes to revea1 10 apparent 1ymph nodes ran ing from 0.3—3.3 cm in greatest
dimension. A11 apparent 1ymp nodes are su mitted as fo11ows:

81, 32: One 1ymph node candidate, bisected in each casette
33, B4: Three 1ym h node candidates in each casette
BS: Two 1ymp node candidates in each casette

C. The third container is additiona11y identified as, "b1adder, bi1atera1 vas
deferens". Received fresh and p1aced in forma1in is a 38 x 21 x 12.2 cm
cystoprostatectomy specimen with attached mesenteric fat. The b1adder measures
8.5 x 6.1 x 5.8 cm. The right uretera1 stump measures 3 cm and the 1eft 3 cm,
and both demonstrate patent 1umina. The prostate g1and measures 6.8 x 4.5 x 3.4
cm. The right semina1 vesic1e measures 7.2 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm and the right vas
deferens measures 7.0 cm in 1ength and 0.6 cm in diameter. The 1eft semina1
vesic1e measures 7.5 x 1.3 x 1.3 cm and the 1eft vas deferens measures 7.2 cm in
1ength and 0.6 cm in diameter. The right ha1f of the prostate is inked b1ue and
the 1eft ha1f is inked b1ack. The b1adder is inked b1ack. The prostate is opened
anterior1y a1ong the urethra and continued superior1y through the b1adder in a
Y—shaped incision. The prostate is seria11y sectioned from apex to base to _
revea a 1.1 x 1.0 cm area of rubbery, white, firm nodu1e a1ong the right Side
of the prostate which is 1.0 cm from the inked surface. The b1adder demonstrates
a 3.2 x 2.3 cm u1ceration invo1ving right 1atera1 wa11 extending to the anterior
wa11. Seria1 sectioning of the u1cer area revea1s 3.2 x 2.3 x 1.3 cm rubbery,
white mass invasion into the muscu1aris propria to a depth of 1.3 cm, extending
to 0.4 cm of the inked surface. The remainder of the mucosa is tan-brown,
edematous, and g1istening with 1.1-1.8 cm wa11 thickness. The bi1atera1 uretera1

orifices are identified and probe patent. Representative sections are submitted
as fo11ows:

C1: Right uretera1 margin

C2: Le t uretera1 margin

C3: Dista1 urethra1 margin

C4, C5: Prostatic apex

C6: Representative prostate through verumontanum

C7, C8: Representative sections of prostate nodu1e on the right side
C9, C10: Representative sections of norma1 prostate tissue on the 1eft side
C11: Semina1 vesic1es and vasa deferentia

C12—C14: Mu1tip1e tumor sections, c1osest to the inked margin

C15: Uninvo1ved 1eft wa11

C16: Uninvo1ved posterior wa11

C17: Uninvo1ved dome
