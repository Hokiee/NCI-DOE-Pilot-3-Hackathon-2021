SPECIMEN

A. Left axillary sentinel node
B. Left breast long stitch anterior short superior

 

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Left breast cancer.
HISTORY: year old white female with left breast cancer.
POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: Same as above.

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS
A — Lymph node negative for metastatic disease.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. The specimen is received fresh for frozen section
labeled “left axillary sentinel node". It consists of a
portion of adipose tissue measuring 3.2 x 2.1 x 1 cm. On section
there is an apparent fatty lymph node measuring 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.
Some of the fat is trimmed away. The node is bisected and all
submitted in one block for frozen section.
B. Received fresh for tissue procurement labeled "left
breast" is a diffusely cauterized and fragmented, 7.1 cm.
(superior to inferior) x 5.7 cm. (medial to lateral) x 4.1 cm.
(anterior to posterior) soft, lobulated tan gold—white portion of
fibroadipose tissue with two sutures as stated previously. Prior
to
inking the specimen is incised and tissue is recovered for tissue
procurement. The specimen is subsequently inked as follows:
Anterior blue, posterior black, medial green and lateral orange.
The
specimen is sectioned from superior to inferior. There is a poorly
circumscribed, 4.0 cm. (superior to inferior) x 3.7 cm. (medial to
lateral) x 2.0 cm. (anterior to posterior) rubbery tan white tumor
mass with a few central cylindrical firm tan white structures. The
lesion focally extends to within 0.15 cm. of the inked anterior
surface and 0.3 cm. of the inked posterior margin. The lesion also
focally appears to approach lateral inked margin (see block 3).
The

GROSS DESCRIPTION
remaining cut surface consists predominantly of glistening
lobulated
golden yellow adipose tissue with a scant amount of interspersed
delicate tan white fibrosis tissue. Representative sections are
submitted in a sequential manner from superior to inferior in ten
blocks as labeled. RS-lO

BLOCKS SUMMARY: 1 - perpendicular sections entire superior margin
cap; 2 through 9 - sequential sections; 10 — representative
perpendicular sections inferior margin cap.

 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

A. This single lymph node is examined in its entirety at
multiple levels and is negative for metastatic disease,
O/l.

B. This excision is status post prior biopsy.
Surrounding
the biopsy site there is a high grade invasive ductal
carcinoma associated with high grade ductal carcinoma in situ.
Please see the template below.

Invasive Carcinoma:
Histologic type: Infiltrating ductal carcinoma
Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated
Overall grade: Elston SBR grade 3
Architectural score: 3
Nuclear score: 3
Mitotic score: 3

Greatest dimension (pT): The tumor measures 4 cm. in greatest

dimension, pT2.

Specimen margins: Invasive tumor extends to the anterior margin
4% of resection and to within 1.7 mm. of the lateral margin of

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
resection.
Vessel invasion: Lymphatic invasion present.
Calcification: Negative.

Ductal carcinoma in situ:

Histologic pattern: Solid. Cancerization of lobules is noted.

Nuclear grade: 3.

Central necrosis: Minimal.

% DCIS of total tumor (if mixed): 25%

Extensive intraductal component (present/absent): Present.

Specimen margins: High grade DCIS extends to the anterior margin

of resection, to within 0.4 mm. of the lateral margin of
resection. There is also a focus of cribriform ductal
carcinoma present to within 0.4 mm. of the inferior margin of
resection.

Calcification: Negative.

Description of non—tumorous breast: A few cysts are noted with
ductal hyperplasia.

Prognostic markers: These have been previously performed.

DIAGNOSIS

A. Left axillary sentinel node, biopsy — Single lymph node

negative
for metastatic disease, 0/1.

E. Left breast, excision - Breast tissue, status post prior biopsy
with residual infiltrating ductal carcinoma, Elston SBR grade III.
Lymphatic invasion is noted and extension to margin of
resection is present. High grade ductal carcinoma in situ is

also present and also extends to margin of resection.
