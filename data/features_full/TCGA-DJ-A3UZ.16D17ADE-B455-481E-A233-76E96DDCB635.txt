Gross Description:

1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled "tissue near left upper pole." and consists of a tan pink soft tissue
measuring 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section.

Summary of sections:
FSC-frozen section control

2) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section, labeled "left paratracheai tissue," and consists of a tan soft tissue measuring
0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section.

Summary of sections:
FSC-frozen section control

3) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "total thyroidectomy, stitch marks left lobe", and consists of a thyroid weighing 22 g. The
right lobe measures 4.5 x 3 x 2 cm. the left lobe measures 4.5 x 3 x 2 cm and the isthmus measures 3 x 1 x 1 cm. The external
surface is covered by a thin fibrous capsule. The posterior surface of the specimen is inked black. and the anterior is inked blue.
Sectioning reveals two separate nodules measuring 0.8 cm and 0.3 cm in diameter. The nodules are located in the right lower pole,
they display white/tan cut surfaces. and l are not encapsulated. Sections through the remaining tissue reveal another nodule in
middle portion of left lobe measuring 0.5 cm in diameter and is not encapsulated. The remaining thyroid parenchyma is red brown
