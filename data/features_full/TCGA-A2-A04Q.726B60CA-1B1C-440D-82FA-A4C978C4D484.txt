methods. A positive test is defined as easily discernable nuclear
staining in more than 5% of the tumor cells.

The specimen was evaluated for HER-Z/Neu (c—ersz) overexpression by
immunohistochemical methods (DAKO Hercep Test). Staining is interpreted
on a scale of 0 to 3+ with positivity defined as 2+ or greater. Specimens
with a weakly positive (2+) Hercep Test are further evaluated by
fluorescence in situ hybridization (Patthsion FISH assay) to detect
presence or absence of Her-2/neu gene amplification.

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY:
{None Given}

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. SENTINEL Received in formalin, labeled with the patient’s name,

and designated "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE NUMBER ONE" is a specimen consisting
of a 2.0 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm lymph node. A small portion was submitted for the
CBCP protocol. 1C1NS.

B. RIGHT BREAST TISSUE Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name,
and designated "RIGHT BREAST TISSUE" is a specimen consisting of a 245.0
gram simple mastectomy, 18.0 cm x 13.5 cm x 3.0 cm in dimension. There is
a 15.0 cm x 4.0 cm ellipse of nipple—bearing skin. The deep margin is
inked in black. On sectioning, a 1.8 cm tumor is identified in the
mid-center ortion of the breast. The tumor abuts, but does not grossly

admixed fat. Sections of tumor, grossly normal fibrous breast tissue, and
skin harvested for the CBCP protocol; mirror images for Histology are as
follows:

Slide Key: B1: Tumor(CBCP); B2: Fibrous tissue, 1.0 cm medial to tumor
(CBCP); BB: Fibrous tissue, 2.0 cm medial to tumor(CBCP); B4: Fibrous
tissue, 5.0 cm medial to tumor(CBCP); BS: Skin, near medial tip (CBCP);

C. NON SENTINEL LYMPH Received fresh, labeled with the patient’s name,

cm x 0.8 cm x 0.5 cm tan lymph node with a scant amount of attached
yellow, lobular adipose tissue. 1CF

D. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE Received fresh, labeled with the patient’s

fragment with two staples and an unoriented suture. CA.
