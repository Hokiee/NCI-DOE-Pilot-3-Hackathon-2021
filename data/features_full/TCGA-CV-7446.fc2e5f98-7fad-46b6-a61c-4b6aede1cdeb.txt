GROSSDESCNPUON
(A) LEFT PARTIAL GLOSSECTOMY AND PHARYNGECTOMY — Tongue (5.0 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm),
attached portion of pharyngeal mucosa and soft tissue (1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm).

An irregular ulcero—nodular lesion is present centrally on the tongue
surface and measures 2.0 x 1.5 cm on the surface and 1.2 cm in depth. It is
located 1.0 cm from the anterior (stitched) resection margin and 0.5 cm from
the deep soft, tissue margin. Cut surfaces are gray—white and gritty.

Tissue for flow cytometry and Tumor Bank are given.

INKING CODE: Blac —lateral; yellow—medial; green—posterior (pharyngeal).

SECTION CODE: A1—A4, frozen section medial; A5—A7, frozen section
lateral; A8, A9, frozen secion posterior (pharyngeal); A10, frozen section,
deep (base); A11, perpendicular mar in anterior (frozen section); A12,
representative section of tumor. %

*FS/DX: INVASIVE SQUAMOUS CEL OMA, ALL MARGINS FREE OF TUMOR.
(B) LEFT CHEEK — Skin fragment (2.5 X 1.5 cm on the surface and 1.0 cm in
thickness), a ruptured and partially cut through cyst is present (1.3 cm in
greatest dimension) containing keratinous debris.

INKING CODE: Surgical margins—black. -

SECTION CODE: Bl, frozen section; 82, representative section of the cyst.

* S/DX: EPIDERMAL INCLUSION CYST.

FT MODIFIED NECK DISSECTION, TOTAL THYROIDECTOMY SUPERIOR MEDIASTINAL

DISSECTION, PARTIAL RESECTION, CLAVICLE, FIRST RIB — The specimen (10 X 8
x 4 cm) consists of a skin ellipse (10 x 6 cm), thyroid gland (6.5 x 3.5 x 2
cm), sternal bone (7 x 2.5 x 1.3 cm), sterno—claviculalr joints with attached
portions of clavicular bone (each 2.5 cm in length, 1.5 cm in diameter), and
portionof first rib.

Serial sections show a soft tissue mass with irregular borders and
gray-white cut surface infiltrating through soft tissue and located 4 and 7 cm

rom the superior soft tissue resection margin. It extends to the sternal

bﬁne but does not infiltrate it. The tumor is located 2 cm from the overlying
s in.

Two lymph nodes measuring between 1.5 cm and .5 cm in greatest dimension
are identified and all are involved by tumor.

Bone is submitted for decal cification. -

INK CODE: black, resection margin.

SECTION CODE: C1, tumor; C2, tumor with superior soft tissue margin; C3,
tumor with adjacent soft tissue, red margin lesion; C4 and C5, thyroid; C6,
skin; C7, inferior en face soft tissue margin; C8—C10, lymph nodes superior
and to the left (C9, bisected); C11, nodular structures on the right superior.

D CYST 0F MANDIBLE — An irre ular membranous — ' tissue with smooth
surface (1.5 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm) al submitted as D.

(E) TOOTH (GROSS ONLY) — Multile irregular gray—w ite ragments of
measuring 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. Gross examination only.
