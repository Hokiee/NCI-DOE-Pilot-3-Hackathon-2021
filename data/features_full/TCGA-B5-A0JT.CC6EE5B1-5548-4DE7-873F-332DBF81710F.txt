GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Uterus, tubes, cervix and ovaries (AF1)". Received fresh is a 52 gram,
6.7 x 5.6 x 2.7 cm uterus with attached bilateral adnexa. The opened
endometrial cavity (5 x 4.7 cm) is totally effaced by an exophytic friable
white-tan mass (5 x 4.7 x 3 cm). Sectioning discloses it invades 0.2 cm into
a 1.7 cm thick myometrium. By the cornu, it is only 0.6 cm from the nearest
serosa (area for frozen section). The remaining tumor is strictly
superficial. There is questionable extension into the anterior lower uterine
segment, but it is grossly 2.2 cm from the internal os. Sectioning through
this area demonstrates a 0.2 cm invasion into the underlying stroma. The
remainder of_the myometrium is brown-tan with no additional abnormalities

- grossly noted. The exocervix and serosa are grossly unremarkable. A
representative section of the mass at the cernu has been previously frozen as

AFl, the frozen section remnant of which is submitted in block A1. Additional
sections are submitted as follows:

A2- anterior cervix ,
'A3— anterior lower uterine segment/upper endocervical canal
A4- posterior cervix

A5- posterior lower uterine segment/upper endocerviCal canal
A6—7 anterior endomyometrial mass at cornu

AB- posterior endomyometrial mass at cornu

A9— anterior endcmyometrium with mass

A10— posterior endometrium with mass (

The left adnexa is composed of a 7 cm long, 0.5 cm in diameter fimbriated
fallopian tube with attached mesentery and an attached 5.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm soft
yellow ovary. The surface of the ovary is smooth, glistening and the specimen
is opened to demonstrate a lumen containing a minimal amount of thickened
brown—tan material. The unilocular cyst demonstrates a focally granular
brown-tan lining with no papillary excrescences. There is an average wall
thickness of 0.2 cm. Representative section is submitted in block A11.

The right adnexa is composed of a 4.5 cm long, 0.5 cm in diameter fimbriated
fallopian tube with attached mesentery and an attached 2 x 1.3 x 1.3 cm
cerebriform white—tan ovary. Sectioning of the adnexa demonstrates a grossly

unremarkable cut surface. .Representative sections are submitted in block
A12. ' '

B. "Left pelvic node", received fresh and placed in formalin is a 12 x 8 x 4
cm aggregate of yellow-tan fibrofatty tissue which is dissected for adherent

lymph node candidates. Ten lymph node candidates are identified from 0.3 to H
2.4 cm in greatest dimension are submitted as follows:

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 6th Edition): ple pNo pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for ,
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past patholOgy information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.
