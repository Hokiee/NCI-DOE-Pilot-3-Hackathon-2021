FINAL DIAGNOSIS; Causation DaIe:

PART 1: LYMPH NODES, RIGHT PELVIC, EXCISION —
NO EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASIA IN FIVE LYMPH NODES (015).

PART 2: LYMPH NODES, LEFT PELVIC, EXCISION -
NO EVIDENCE OF NEOPLASIA IN TWELVE LYMPH NODES (OH 2).

PART 3: PROSTATE AND BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES, RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY -

A. PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, ACINAR TYPE, GLEASON SCORE 3 + 4 = 7, WITH A TERTIARY GLEASON GRADE
5 COMPONENT.
B. THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT SIDES 0F PROSTATE AND HAS A GREATEST NODULAR
DIAMETER OF 2.1 CM,
C. THE CARCINOMA INVOLVES APPROXIMATELY 20% OF THE EXAMINED PROSTATE BY VOLUME.
D. TUMOR SHOWS EXTRA-PROSTATIC EXTENSION AT THE RIGHT AND LEFT BASE (BLOCKS 3A, 3X, 3UU AND 3W).
E. BILATERAL SEMINAL VESICLES ARE INVOLVED BY CARCINOMA,
F. ALL EXAMINED SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF CARCINOMA.
G. EXTENSIVE PERINEURAL INVASION IS PRESENT.
H. NO ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION ES IDENTIFIED.
i. MULTIFOCAL HIGH GRADE PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA IS PRESENT.
