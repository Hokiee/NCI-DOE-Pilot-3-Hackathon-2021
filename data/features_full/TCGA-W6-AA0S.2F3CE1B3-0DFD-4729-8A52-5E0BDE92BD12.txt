COMMENT: l
Liver Tumor, Including Intrahepatio Bile Duct, Synoptic Comment

— Tumor type: CholangiocarcinomaL

n

,— Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated.
— Tumor size (maximum diameter of largest lesion): 3.3 cm.
- Tumor necrosis: Less than 30%.
- Multifocality (more than one tumor separated by nontumorous liver
parenchyma): Absent.
— Vascular invasion: None.
— Hepatic capsule: Tumor abuts capsule.
— Local extension of tumor: Malignant glands are present in the wall of
the left main bile duct, but not in the surrounding adipose soft tissue.

— Hepatic surgical margins: Negative; tumor is 1.5 cm from margin.

— Bile duct margin (for cholanqiocarcinoma): Positive on slide Cl. See
additional comments below.

— Non—neoplastic liver: Mass effect (portal—based inflammation, scant
lobular hepatocyte necrosis, enlargement of some intrahepatic bile
ducts, and periductal fibrosis; small portal tracts show mild ductular
proliferation).

~ Lymph node status:

— Negative for tumor; total number of nodes examined: 3.

— AJCC Stage:4 pTlNO.

In part A (left main bile duct) atypical glands are seen invading
periductal nerve tissue. Level sections and immunohistochemistry for
keratin cocktail and 8100 were performed and evaluated on block Al to
further assess the atypical glands. The keratin cocktail shows diffuse
strong.nuclear staining in the atypical glands. The 8100 highlights the
nerves but does not stain the atypical cells involving the nerve tissue.
This supports a diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma.

In Part C (left hepatic resection) the hepatic parenchymal resection
margin is negative. Tumor is present in the left main bile duct margin.
However, surgidal correlation is required for final margin status as
additional tissue is submitted in Part D and the new common bile duct
margin in the additional tissue is negative.

In Part C, sections of the hepatic mass show moderately differentiated
cholangiocarcinoma invading hepatic parenohyma and nerve tissde. One
area of the adenocarcinoma is better differentiated and has dilated,
angulated ducts closely resembling a large von Meyenburg complex.
Immunohistochemical stains for p53, MIB-l, UPC—4, and glypican—3.were
performed on block C3 and compared in both areas. Both areas show weak
scattered nuclear p53 staining, no loss of DPC-4, and negative
Glypican-3. The moderately—differentiated area shows MIB—l staining in
30% of tumor nuclei and focally up to 50%, while the lower grade area
shows less than 5% MIB-l nuclear staining. The morphologic appearance
and immunoprofile are most consistent with both areas being part of the
same lesion. It is possible that the higher-grade area of the tumor
arose from this more well—differentiated component at some point in
time.

For part D, level sections were performed and evaluated on blocks D2 and
D5 (the extrahepatic bile duct). The levels do not show any high~grade
dysplasia or carcinoma.

Dr. has reviewed parts A and D including additional
immunostains and levels and agrees with the above diagnosis for these
parts. Dr. has reviewed C3 and the MIB-l immunostain and

concurs with its interpretation.

Cepy to,Physician(s)'

The patient is a K—year-old woman with a history of hepatic
adenocarcinoma (outside slides reviewed at in consultation,

.on biopSy of the left liver lobe. She undergoes a left hepatic
resection.

Gross Description
The case is received in six parts, labeled with the patient's name and
medical record number.

Part A is received fresh and additionally labeled "left main bile duct,"
and consists of a single, donut—Shaped fragment of white—tan soft tissue
(0.8 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm) with a 0.3 cm lumen and one inked surface. Per
discussion with the surgeon, the inked surface is the most
proximal aspect, and the non—inked surrace is the true margin and most
distal surface. The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section
diagnosis 1 (inked surface side up), and subsequently submitted in
cassette A1. 5

Part B is received fresh and additionally labeled "right bile duct, up
is distal," and conSists of an oriented, tubular segment of red—pink
soft tissue (0.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm in length). The specimen is submitted
for frozen sectiOn evaluation F82 (cutting toward true margin), with the
frozen section remnant submitted in full in cassette Bl.

Part C is received fresh and additionally labeled "extended left
hepatic resection, caudate plus tumor, blue = bile duct, black = portal
vein," and consists of a partial hepatectomy (434 gm; 18.5 cm from right
to left x 5.3ch from anterior to posterior x 12.8 cm from superior to
inferior; caudate lobe 6.2 x 3.7 x 3.1 cm).

GROSS ABNORMALITIES: A white, circumscribed, firm mass with pushing
borders (3.3 x 3.1 x 4.5 cm) is present in the central portion of the
A

specimen and abuts the capsule on the visceral/posterior side. The mass
invades into the left main bile duct, extends to the bile duct margin
grossly, and is located 1.5 cm from the inked hepatic resection margin.
The mass also surrounds intraparenchymal blood vessels but does not
grossly invade into them. The intimal surfaces of these vessels and of
the portal vein are smooth and white. The uninvolved right liver lobe
is homogeneously redebrown and spongy-firm. The left lobe is attenuated
with dilated vessels. No gallbladder is present and no lymph nodes are
identified.

ORIENTED BY: Surgeon's suture: Blue suture = left main bile duct,
black suture = portal vein.

Also, per discussion with Dr. : The specimen contains caudate
lobe and segment 8.
INKING:

— Liver capsule overlying mass: Blue. ,
- Hepatic resection margin: Black.

POTENTIAL STUDIES: Fresh tumor and uninvolved hepatic parenchyma are
submitted to the tissue bank.

CASSETTES: Representative sections are submitted as follows:

C1: Left main bile duct margin and neighboring portal
vein, en face.
C2: Mass and left main bile duct.
C3: Mass, portal vein and resection margin.
C4—C5: Mass and overlying capsule.
C6: Mass and large intraparenchymal vessels.
C7: Uninvolved hepatic left lobe.
C8—C9: Uninvolved hepatic right lobe.
ClO: Soft tissue near bile duct margin.

Part D is received fresh and additionally labeled "extrahepatic bile
duct," and consists of an oriented, branching, tubular structure (4 cm
in length x 1 cm in maximum diameter). The specimen is oriented by the
surgeon with mﬂltiple stitches as follows: The cystic duct is tagged
with a double stitch, the right bile duct is tagged with a single black
stitch, and the left bile duct is tagged with a blue stitch. The common
bile duct is inked by the surgeon. Frozen section evaluation is
'requested for the common bile duct margin. The common bile duct
contains a double—lumen structure (0.3 cm and 0.5 cm in diameter)...The
cystic duct is 0.4 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter, the left bile duct
is 0.3 cm in length x 0.2 cm in diameter, and the right bile duct is 0.5
cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter} Extending from the hepatic duet,
adjacent to the right bile duct, is a fragment of soft tissue measuring
0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.- No masses or lesions are noted.

INKING:

7 Area adjacent to common bile duct surgical margin: Yellow, after the
frozen section has been removed.

— Cystic duct resection margin: Blue.

— Left bile duct resection margin: Black.

— Right bile duct resection margin: Green.

The surgeon designated common bile duct margin is.submitted for frozen
section evaluation F83 (designated extrahepatic bile duct biopsy).

CASSETTES: The specimen is entirely submitted as follows:

Dl: Frozen section remnant (F83).
D2: Right bile duct margin (inked) and adjacent slice.
D3: cemmon bile duct adjacent to F53 and remaining common

bile duct.

D4: Cystic duct (inked) and adjacent cystic duct.
D5: Left bile duct (inked).

D6: Hepatic duct at level of cystic duct.

D7: Remainder of hepatic duct.

D8: Attached soft tissue.

Part E is received fresh and additionally labeled "gallbladder," and
consists of a gallbladder (6.2 x 3 X 2.6 cm). The serosal surface is
tan-green, smooth and glistening. The surface opposed to the liver is
ragged and green-brown. The cystic duct is patent to the probe with a
diameter of 0.3 cm. Two firm, ovoid, red lymph node candidates (0.8 x
0.5 x 0.4 cm and 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm) are identified near the cystic
duct. The gallbladder contains viscous green bile and its mucosa is
green and reticulated with numerous scattered punctate yellow spots (up
to 0.1 cm). No stones are identified. The gallbladder wall thickness
averages 0.1—0.2 cm. The cystic duct and surface opposed to the liver
are inked blue. Representative cassettes are submitted as follows:
E1: Cystic duct margin and two intact lymph nodes.

E2: 'Sections of body and fundus.

Part F is received fresh and additionally labeled "RT hepatic artery
lymph node," and consists of two unoriented, irregular, tan-white tissue
fragments with metal clips (1.9 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm and 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm}.
The specimen is submitted intact in cassette F1.
