***Electronically Signed Out By***

No TE: Some immunohistochemlcel antlbodles are analyte speciﬁc reagents (ASRs) validated by our laboratory (Her 2, Parvo) H, pylori, HBcore). These ASRs are cllnl‘cally
useful lndlcators that do not require FDA approval. These clones are used: IDS=ER. PgR 636=PR. A485=HER2, H-11=EGFR, CCH2/DDGQ=CMV, F39.4.1=AR and HPV by
ISH. All immunohlslachemicet stains are used with formalin or molecular ﬁxed. parafﬁn embedded tissue. Detection is by LSAB. The results are read by a pathologist as positive
or negative.

Addendum Diagnosis
A. LEFT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION LUMPECTOMY:

lmmunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin ﬁxed tissue with the following results for [invasive
carolnoma/DCIS/metastatic carcinoma] (block xx):

Estrogen receptor

 

 

 

 

 

IDs POSITIVE ( > 90%)
Progesterone receptor
PgR 636 POSITIVE (1 -10 %)
HERsZIneu (c—erb—BZ) NEGATIVE O

B. HOT SPOT #1, AXILLA I, CT-xx:

lmmunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin ﬁxed tissue with the following results for metastatic
carcinoma (block B):

Keratin: NEGATIVE (see note).
Note: A single cell that appears to be keratin positive Is present in the subcapsular space. However, the nuclear size
and morphology of this cell is different than the primary tumor cells. Selected slides were reviewed with Dr. XX and
concurs with the diagnosis.
C. HOT SPOT #1. AXILLA | CT -xx:

lmmunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin ﬁxed tissue with the following results for metastatic
carcinoma (C):

Keratin: NEGATIVE.

Interpretation Guidelines: For hormone receptor immunohistochemical analysis, the percent of immunoreactive
nuclei in the invasive or in-situ carcinoma is assessed manually by light microscopic examination and reported as
follows:

Positive: greater than or equal to 1 percent of nuclei immunoreactive
Negative: less thani percent of nuclei immunoreactive

Non~neoplastic mammary epithelial cells are immunoreactive for estrogen and progesterone receptors (internal
control).

For HER2/neu immunohistochemical analysis, the cell membrane staining is assessed manually by light microscopic
examination. Cytoplasmic immunoreactivity alone is scored as a negative result.

Reference #1: XX
Reference #2: XX

 

Clinical Histom:

Infiltrating lobular cancer in left breast. Please evaluate margins of lumpectomy. If sentinel nodes are negative, do

Gross Description:

A. Received fresh and labeled "Left breast lumpectomy” is a yellow-tan irregular—shaped lumpectomy,
measuring 5.0 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm and weighing 35.0 grams. The specimen is inked as follows: superior margin
inked blue, inferior margin inked green, medial margin inked red, lateral margin inked orange,
anterior/superﬁcial margin inked yellow and deep margin inked black. Sections reveal an ill-deﬁned area with
ﬁrm to hard consistency, 2.0 x 2.0 x1.5 cm. This area is located toward the medial to posterior resection
margin at 0.2 to 0.3 cm from the deep resection margin (nearest). 0.3 cm from the inferior resection margin.
3.0 cm from lateral resection margin, 2.0 cm from the superior resection margin, 1.0 cm from the superficial
resection margin. The remainder of the specimen is homogeneous, yellow-tan, grossly unremarkable
adipose tissue. No other suspicious lesions are present. The specimen is submitted in nine cassettes, as
follows:

Cassette #1-3: Tissue with clip in toto

 

Cassette #4: Perpendicular section superior margin
Cassette #5: Perpendicular section inferior margin
Cassette #6: Perpendicular section medial margin
Cassette #7: Perpendicular section lateral margin
Cassette #8: Perpendicular section superficial margin
Cassette #9: Perpendicular section deep margin
B Received in formalin and labeled "Hot spot #1, axilla l, ct xx” is a yellow-tan irregular-shaped soft tissue

fragment, 3.5 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm. Sections reveal one lymph node, 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. The lymph node is bisected and
submitted in toto in one cassette. '

C Received in formalin and labeled ”Hot spot #1. axilla l, ct xx" is a yellow-tan irregular-shaped soft tissue

fragment, 2.8 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. Sections reveal one lymph node, 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. the lymph node is bisected and
submitted in toto in one cassette.
