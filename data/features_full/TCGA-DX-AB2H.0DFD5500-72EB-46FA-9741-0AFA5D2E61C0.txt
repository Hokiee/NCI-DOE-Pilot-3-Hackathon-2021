SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

 

Clinical Diagnosis E History:
Recurrent retroperitoneal liposarcoma.

Specimens Submitted:

1: Radical resection of recurrent liposarccma with tail of pancreas, spleen,
left colon, greater curve of stomach

2: Proximal jejunum

DIAGNOSIS:

l. Radical resection of recurrent liposarcoma with tail of pancreas,
spleen. left colon. greater curve of stomach:

A. Small and large bowel tumor:
’- Recurrent dedifferentiated liposarcoma with focal areas of

well-differentiated/sclerosing liposarcoma and extensive necrosis (see
note).

- Tumor size: 15.1 x 3.3 x 6.5 cm.

— The dedifferentiated component of the tumor involves the small bowel
segment transmurally with an intreluminal component measuring 5.5 x 5.1 x
3.9 cm. The well~di££erentiated sclerosing liposarcoma component is adherent
to serosal segment of both the small and large bowel segments.

- Necrosis and cyst formation comprise approximately 30% of the tumor,
gross estimate.

— Large bowel with reactive/ischemic changes, atrophic pancreatic
parenchyme. unremarkable spleen parenchyma.

B. Stomach wedge tumor:

- Well-di££erentiated/sc1erosing liposarcoms adherent to serosal aspect
of stomach segment (see note)

- Tumor size: 8.5 x 5.4 X 3.9 cm.

— Areas of dedifferentiation are not identified.

Note: The tumor associated with small and large bowel is composed

predominantly (70%) of dedifierentiated liposarcoma component and exhibits
an undifferentiated round and plump spindle cell morphology with scattered
areas showing a hemangiopericytome-like pattern. The dedifferentiated areas
show extensive areas of necrosis. The component associated with the gastric

wedge is entirely composed of well-differentiated/sclerosing type
liposercoma.

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

------------------------------------------------------------ Page 2 of 4
2. Proximal jejunum; excision:

- Segment of small bowel with unremarkable mucosa. serosal fibrous
adhesions and multifocal serositis.
- No tumor is identified.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL). AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

*** Report Electronically Signed Out ***

Gross Description:

1) Received fresh in a container labeled as "Radical resection of recurrent
liposarcoma with tail of pancreas. spleen. left colon. greater curvature of
stomach'I are multiple excision specimens. A. The main specimen is composed
of a mass with a small bowel segment and a large bowel segment entangled in
multiple fibrous adhesions, measures overall 29.5 x 14.9 x 9.1 cm. The main
mass is a 15.1 x 8.3 x 6.5 cm tan-yellow, lobulated tumor with an outer
pseudocapsule and smooth external surface. Upon opening the tumor reveals
tan-grey multicystic cut surfaces with multiple areas of necrosis. The
cystic/necrotic areas comprise approximately 30% of the tumor. The
presumptive anterior aspect of the mass is inked black and the
posterior/deep is inked blue. The small bowel segment measures 45.1 cm. in
length and upon opening, up to 7.1 cm. in circumference. Two margins are
identified which are arbitrarily designated as A and B. The mucosa is
tan-red and bears a 5.5 x 5.1 x 3.9 cm. tan-grey fungating mass with
multifocal areas of necrosis that is located 6.8 cm. from margin “A". This
mass is contiguous with the above described main tumor. The attached segment
of large bowel measures 50 cm. in length and upon opening up to 11.2 cm. in
circumference. The mucosa is dusky, red-tan and hemorrhagic. The margins are
arbitrarily designated A and E. The tumor is not identified involving the
large bowel. A small fragment of presumptive pancreatic tissue is identified
in relationship with the small bowel segment and measures 2.1 x 2.0 x 1.9
cm. and is identified not involved by tumor.

3. In addition to the main specimen there is an 8.5 x 5.4 X 3.9 cm. separate
fragment of lobulated tumor that is adherent to a small segment of stomach
is identified. The specimen shows a smooth outer surface and upon sectioning
shows fatty appearing yellow-white cut surfaces and a small fragment of
gastric mucosa. Also, two tan-pink wedge segments of stomach measuring 5.1 x
3.6 x 2.5 cm and 4.5 x 3.1 x 2.5 cm. are identified which upon opening show
unremarkable mucosa with preserved rugae. A 6.9 x 6.1 x 3.5 cm. 65 gram
splenectomy specimen with smooth dark—red external surfaces is also
identified. Upon sectioning, homogonous dark-red cut surfaces are seen.
Representative sections are submitted. Tissue for TPS and gross photos are
taken.

2) The specimen is received fresh, labeled uProximal jejunum“, and consists
of a 7.2 cm in length x 4.0 cm in circumference unoriented and kinked
segment of small bowel. The margins are stapled and inked (black and blue,
respectively). The serosa is adherent between the two margins. A focal
amount of peri-mesenteric fat is present. The mucosa is grossly
unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted.
