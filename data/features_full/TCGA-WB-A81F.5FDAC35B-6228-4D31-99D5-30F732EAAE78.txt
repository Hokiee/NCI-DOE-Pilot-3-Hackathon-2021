Macroscopic. there is a 7.4 cm yellowish tumor which is sharply separated from the
surrounding tissue.

Histologically, the tumor is composed with zellballen, partly also with a trabecular
architecture. Nuclei are enlarged and the broad cytoplasm is weakly eosinophil. Focally, cells
are pigmented. Fokal areas of bleeding are present. No enhanced numbers of mitosis, no
atypic mitotic ﬁgures, no necrotic areas. The capsule is inﬁltrated, without destruction.
Additionally, in central aswell as in peripheral parts of the tumor. invasion into vessels is
noted. The surrounding soft tissue is free of tumor invasion.

There is marked staining for synaptophysin and less intense staining for chromogranin.
Single sustentacular cells stain weakly positive for $100. The proliferationindex (Ki67) is less
than 5%.

Final diagnosis: pheochromocytoma
