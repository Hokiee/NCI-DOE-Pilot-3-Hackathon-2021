Gross Description

A. The specimen is reeeived fresh mooted "distat pancreas and spleen, sﬁtch=retropentoneai
margin, frozen section=unstapled Fine“. The specimen consists of a distal portion of pancreas (5.5 x
4.8 x 3.5 cm) with attached spieen (9.6 x 6 x 3.5 cm, weight £73 9]. The portion at distal pancreas is
enlarged and distorted by the tumor, which measures up to 4 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm. The tumor is naughty
ovoid, wen-deﬁned, and is bulging but does not appear to extend “trough the peritoneum of the
anterior aspect of tine pancreas- The tumor is 't .0 cm tram the stapled, proximal; resection margin. The
portion of porenchyma located proximal to the tumor is grossiy unremarkable. The cut Mace of the
tumor is variegated, pink-tan to red, focally hemorrhagic. Tangentiat section at the stapled resecﬁon
margin is submitted entirety form settion as FSA’E and ESAE. Several potential iymph nodes are
grosaiy identified within adipose tissue adiaoent to lhe tail of pancreas. Prior to sectioring, the
specimen is inked as follows:

Anterior aspect of the pancreas . Green

The capsuie oi the spieen is red-purple, smooth and giiatening. On sectioning. the spleen reveals a
