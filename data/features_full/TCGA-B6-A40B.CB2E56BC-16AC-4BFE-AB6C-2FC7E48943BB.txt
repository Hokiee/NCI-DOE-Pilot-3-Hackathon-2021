A” "Sentinel node # 1 hot and blue", received fresh and placed in formalin. A
1.8 x 1.4 x 0.8 cm lymph node candidate with attached adipose tissue is
sectioned and submitted in toto in A1. A cytokeratin stain is prospectively

requested.

CLINI CAL HISTORY:
Left ca breast.

B. "Sentinel node # 2 hot and blue", received fresh and placed in formalin. A
1.4 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm lymph node candidate with attached adipose tissue is
sectioned and submitted in B1. A cytokeratin stain is prospectively
requested.

C. "Sentinel node # 3 hot not blue", received fresh and placed in formalin. A
1.3 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm lymph node candidate with attached adipose tissue is
sectioned and submitted in C1. A cytokeratin stain is prospectively

requested.

D. "Left breast partial mastectomy skin anterior, short superior, long
lateral", received fresh and placed in formalin. A partial mastectomy
specimen with the following measurements: medial-lateral 7.5 cm, anterior
posterior 6 cm, superior—inferior 2.5 cm. The overlying skin measures 4.2 x
1.8 cm, and the specimen is inked as follows: superior—red, inferior—yellow,
anterior—blue, posterior-black. The specimen is serially sectioned from
medial to lateral, revealing a firm, ill—defined mass measuring roughly 1 x
0.7 x 0.7 cm. The mass is 0.7 cm from the anterior margin, 1.2 cm from the
superior margin, 2.3 cm from inferior margin, 1.6 cm from the posterior
margin, 3 cm from the medial margin, and 4 cm from the lateral margin. The
remainder of the specimen is composed of yellow fibroadipose tissue with thin
delicate bands of breast tissue, no other lesions are identified.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

EATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: LEFT PARTIAL MASTECTOMY AND SENTINEL LYMPH NODE DISSECTION.

‘" ' "“‘—"rr ‘ '""—"""-_""’ , L

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC Edition): ple pN0(sn)(i—) pMM

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. "SENTINEL NODE #1" (EXCISION):

ONE LYMPH NODE WITH NO EVIDENCE OF METASTATIC CARCINOMA (0/1).
AN IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAIN FOR CYTOKERATIN IS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR CELLS.

B. "SENTINEL NODE #2" (EXCISION):

ONE LYMPH NODE WITH NO EVIDENCE OF METASTATIC CARCINOMA (0/1).
AN IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAIN FOR CYTOKERATIN IS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR CELLS.

C. "SENTINEL NODE #3" (EXCISION):

ONE LYMPH NODE WITH NO EVIDENCE OF METASTATIC CARCINOMA (0/1).
AN IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STAIN FOR CYTOKERATIN IS NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR CELLS.

D. "LEFT BREAST" (PARTIAL MASTECTOMY):

INVASIVE ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE BREAST.
HISTOLOGIC TYPE: LOBULAR.
NOTTINGHAM COMBINED HISTOLOGIC GRADE: 2 OF 3.
TUBULE FORMATION SCORE: 3
NUCLEAR PLEOMORPHISM SCORE: 2
MITOTIC RATE SCORE: 2
GROSS TUMOR SIZE: 1 X 0.7 X 0.7 CM.
SIZE OF INVASIVE COMPONENT: 1 CM.
LYMPHATIC/VASCULAR INVASION: ABSENT.
MULTIFOCAL TUMOR: ABSENT.

IN-SITU CARCINOMA: PRESENT.
TYPE OF IN—SITU CARCINOMA: DUCTAL, SOLID TYPE.
NUCLEAR GRADE 0F IN—SITU CARCINOMA: 2 OF 3.
NECROSIS: ABSENT.
DCIS EXTENDING OUTSIDE INVASIVE TUMOR MASS: PRESENT, AT EDGE OF TUMOR.

STATUS OF NON-NEOPLASTIC BREAST TISSUE: BIOPSY SITE CHANGES, FIBROCYSTIC
CHANGE.
SKIN STATUS: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.
SIZE OF BIOPSY: 7.5 X 6 X 2.5 CM.
MICROCALCIFICATIONS: PRESENT IN ASSOCIATION WITH CARCINOMA AND BENIGN
BREAST TISSUE.
SURGICAL MARGIN STATUS: NEGATIVE. INVASIVE CARCINOMA PRESENT 0.9 CM FROM
THE ANTERIOR MARGIN.

ESTROGEN/PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR, CELL CYCLE, EGFR AND HERZ/NEU ANALYSIS:
NOT PERFORMED (SEE PREVIOUS BIOPSY REPORT

COMMENT: The ductal component from the needle core biopsy is not
obvious in the resection specimen. The tumor contains areas of classic
lobular carcinoma as well as more solid areas that are comprised of small
nests of tumor cells which are interpreted as an acinar/solid component.
