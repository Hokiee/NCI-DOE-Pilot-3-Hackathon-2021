These stages are based on information available at the time of
this report, and are subject to change pending additional
information and clinical review.

Ovary, right, oophorectomy:
— Poorly differentiated serous adenocarcinoma, tumor size up to
4.3 cm

Ovary, left, oophorectomy:
— Focal metastatic serous adenocarcinoma

Fallopian tube, right, salpingectomy:
— Intraluminal serous adenocarcinoma present without mural
involvement

Fallopian tube, left, salpingectomy:
— No specific pathologic abnormality

COMMENT:

A representative block of the endometrial tumor (C8) is
submitted for immunohistochemical evaluation, given the presence
of tumor in both the endometrium and ovaries. The tumor shows
only scant scattered weak positive staining for WTl and is
positive for E-cadherin. The predominant tumor in the
endometrium and the absence of strong positive staining for WTl
supports classification as a tumor of primary endometrial
origin.

Intraoperative Consult Diagnosis:

A frozen section was requested.

FSAl: Peritoneum, right gutter, biopsy

— Positive for high grade serous adenocarcinoma

Clinical History:
-year-old female with endometrial cancer; outside not reviewed

here yet (case was positive for serous adenocarcinoma of
the endometrium).

Gross Description:
Received are three appropriately labeled containers.

Container A is additionally labeled "peritoneum, right gutter"
and consists of a 4.5 x 2.1 x 0.2 cm red-tan soft tissue

fragment. Within the soft tissue is a 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm white-
tan firm nodule that was frozen as FSAl, the remainder of the
specimen is submitted in A2, "

Container B is additionally labeled "omentum." It consists of a
9.7 x 4.9 x 3.8 cm segment of omentum that contains
approximately 10 firm, smooth, white, illedefined nodules
ranging from 0.5 cm in greatest dimension up to 3.7 x 1.7 x 1.0
cm in greatest dimension. These nodules are represented in
blocks Bl and B2.

Container C is additionally labeled "uterus, cervix, bilateral
tubes and ovaries."

Adnexa: bilateral present

Weight: 170 grams and includes the detached cervix

Shape: pyriform

Dimensions:

height: 8.2 cm

anterior to posterior width: 6.0 cm

breadth at fundus: 7.0 cm

Serosa: intact, pink/tan, smooth and glistening with focal
red/brown adhesions along the posterior lateral aspect
Cervix: received detached

ectocervix: purple/white, smooth with erythema surrounding a 0.5
cm in diameter cervical os

endocervix: smooth and erythematous

length of endocervical canal: 3.1 cm

Endomyometrium:

length of endometrial cavity: 6.3 cm

width of endometrial cavity at fundus: 4.9 cm

tumor findings:

dimensions: 6.8 x 6.4 x 1.5 cm with an additional aggregate of
tumor within the accompanying container (6.5 x 3.7 x 3.5 cm)
appearance: tan/gray, fungating, soft and friable

location and extent: anterior and posterior cavities, 2.1 cm
from the anterior and posterior lower uterine
segment/endocervical canal interface; the mass extends all the
way through a 2.5 cm thick myometrium up to the serosa but not
through it

myometrial invasion: to the serosa

thickness of myometrial wall at deepest gross invasion: 2.5 cm
other findings or comments: There are two homogeneous white
whorled, well circumscribed intramural nodules (0.5 cm in
greatest dimension and 0.8 cm in greatest dimension).

Adnexa:

Right ovary:

dimensions: 4.3 x 3.2 x 2.9 cm

external surface: smooth, pink/tan and bulging

cut surface: approximately 90% of the cut surface consists of a
multiloculated cyst with a wall thickness ranging from 0.1 cm
up to 0.4 cm; the cyst is partially filled with a yellow
transparent gelatinous fluid; the inner wall is smooth and has

a 1.7 x 1.7 x 0.7 cm soft, white friable excrescence; within the
thicker aspect of the wall is a 1.3 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm ill—defined
soft smooth gray/white nodule that bulges the capsule, but does
not extend through it; the capsule overlying the nodule is inked
green; the uninvolved parenchyma is red/brown, hemorrhagic with
a corpus albicans

Right fallopian tube:

dimensions: 5.4 cm long x 0.5 cm diameter

other findings: the fallopian tube is unremarkable

Left ovary:

dimensions: 2.3 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm

external surface: tan/yellow, cerebriform

cut surface: two simple cysts (0.5 cm in greatest dimension, up
to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension); each filled with a

translucent yellow-tinged gelatinous material; within the
smaller cysts and extending into the parenchyma is a 0.5 x 0.5 x
0.3 cm ill—defined smooth firm white papillary excrescence; this
excrescence bulges the capsule but does

not extend through it; on the surface of the capsule is a 0.7 x

0.7 x 0.5 cm well circumscribed smooth rubbery gray/white nodule
Left fallopian tube:

dimensions: 4.8 cm long x 0.5 cm in diameter
other findings: fallopian tube is unremarkable
Lymph nodes: none

Other comments: none

Digital photograph taken: not taken

Tissue submitted for special investigations: no
