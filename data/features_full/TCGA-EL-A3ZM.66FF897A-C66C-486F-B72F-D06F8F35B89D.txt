GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) RIGHT FACIAL LYMPH NODE - Received is a 1.9 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm portion of yellow-tan ﬁbrofatty adipose tissue.
Specimen is dissected revealing a 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm possible lymph node. Possible lymph node is trisected and submitted
entirely in cassette A
(B) TUMOR, CAROTID SHEATH - Two fragments of pink soft tissue (0.8 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm and 0.5 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm) are received
and entirely submitted for frozen section B.

*FS/DX: PAPILLARY THYROID CARCINOMA.
(C) POST TRACHEAL WALL MASS - Received is a rubbery to somewhat ﬁrm, unoriented fragment of muscular tissue
admixed with scanty amount of adipose tissue measuring 2.8 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. Cut surface of the tissue is mahogany brown,
glistening. Entirely submitted.

SECTION CODE: C1-CS, entire tissue.
(D) TOTAL THYROIDECTOMY AND RIGHT NECK DISSECTION CONTENTS - An en bloc resection including thyroid (left
lobe 6.1 x 3.2 x 2.7 cm, isthmus 3.2 x 2.7 x 2.2 cm), anterior full thickness strap muscles, and anterior adipose tissue (9.4 x
6.6 x 3.5 cm including right thyroid). A possible left lower parathyroid (0.5 cm in diameter) is located at the left lateral
posterior inferior aspect of the thyroid. A portion of ossified cartilage (1.4 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm) is located at the posterior aspect of
the right lobe.

Received: Case type: Surgical Case

 

A ﬁrm, tan mass (5.7 x 4.1 x 3.9 cm) is located within the right lobe and isthmus and extends into perithyroidal adipose
tissue and skeletal muscle anteriorly and posteriorly. The posterior aspect of the specimen is rough and ﬁbrotic with gross
involvement of tumor. The superior portion of tumor is surrounded by a dark brown hemorrhagic edge inﬁltrating into adipose
tissue. The anterior soft tissue margin is widely free of tumor.

A cystic colloid-ﬁlled nodule (6.1 x 3.2 x 2.7 cm) is located in the middle and lower poles of the left lobe.

The remaining uninvolved thyroid parenchyma is beefy red and unremarkable. Twenty-three possible lymph nodes
are identiﬁed within the right neck dissection and anterior adipose tissue. Tumor and normal tissue are submitted to the

INK CODE: Black - right posterior tissue edge for orientation.

SECTION CODE: D1, left lobe, representative unremarkable; DZ, left inferior and middle lobe nodule and possible
parathyroid gland; 03, left inferior and middle lobe nodule; D4, isthmus with tumor, D5, 06, tumor with isthmus into anterior
soft tissue; D7-D14, superior portion of tumor with muscle and fat involving posterior tissue edge; D15, superior portion of
right lobe tumor with muscle and ﬁbroadipose tissue into posterior tissue edge and one possible lymph node; 016, right lobe
tumor with fragment of ossiﬁed cartilage, decal; D17-D26, one possible lymph node per cassette, bisected, right neck
dissection; 027-034, one possible lymph node per cassette, serially sectioned, right neck dissection; D35, four possible
lymph nodes, anterior soft tissue; 036, one possible lymph node, bisected, anterior soft tissue.

CLINICAL HISTORY

Papillary thyroid cancer.
