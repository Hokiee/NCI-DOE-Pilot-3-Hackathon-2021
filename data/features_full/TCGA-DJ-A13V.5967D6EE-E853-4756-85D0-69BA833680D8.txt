Gross Description:

 

1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section consultation, labeled "prelaryngeal lymph node r/o carcinoma" and consists of
a lymph node measuring 1.7 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph node is bisected and entirely submitted for frozen section.

2) The specimen is received in formalin labeled “right peritracheal node" and consists of two firm pink tan lymph nodes ranging
from 0.5 cm up to 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. All identiﬁed lymph nodes are submitted.

Summary of sections:

LN-iymph nodes w

3) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "total thyroid gland and central compartment lymph node" and consists of a thyroid
weighing 22 g. The right lobe measures 3.8 x 2.3 x 1.5 cm, the left lobe measures 4.2 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm and the isthmus has a
pyramidal shape and measures 1.4 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. There are multiple pink tan lymph nodes with surrounding fat attached to the

inferior central aspect of the isthmus, ranging from 0.5 cm up to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. All identiﬁed lymph nodes are
submitted. The external surface ls covered by a thin ﬁbrous capsule, with an additional adhered portion of skeletal muscle along
the left lower pole measuring 1.8 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm. The posterior surface of the specimen ls inked black. and the anterior is inked
blue. The specimen is sectioned to reveal a 2.9 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm yellow white papillary nodule located in the left mid to lower pole. A
central portion of the nodule is submitted for TPS. the nodule to capsule and parenchyma interface is block out and entirely
submitted. Sections through the remaining tissue reveal a red brown homogeneous grossly unremarkable parenchyma. The
remaining uninvolved thyroid tissue is submitted. Representative sections are submitted.

4) The specimen is received in formalin labeled "left paratracheal lymph node” and consists of three firm lymph nodes with
attached fatty fibrous tissue ranging from 0.5 cm up to 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. All identified lymph nodes are submitted.

Summary of sections:
LN-lymph node
BLN-bisected lymph nodes

5) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "thymus" and consists of a smooth tan-white soft tissue resection measuring 11.8
x 2.5 x 0.7 cm, weighing 109. The specimen is inked black and sectioned to reveal a homogenous yellow tan cut surface.
