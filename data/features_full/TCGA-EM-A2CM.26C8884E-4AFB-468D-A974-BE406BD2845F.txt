Gross Description

1. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as "left subtotal thyroid including upper
mediastinal component" consists of a left hemithyroidectomy specimen with mediastinal fat. The
specimen weighs 201 g. The lobe measures 9.6 cm SI x 7.2 cm ML x 3.9 cm AP and the isthmus
measures 1.5 Sl x 1.5 cm ML x 0.4 cm AP. The mediastinal fat measures 4.4 x 4 x 0.6 cm. The
external surfaces have fibrous adhesions. No parathyroid glands or lymph nodes are identiﬁed
grossly. The external surface is painted with silver nitrate. The entire lobe is replaced by a well-
delineated nodule that exhibits fibrous septation, focal hemorrhage and a few cysts, the largest
measuring 2.0 cm. The remainder of the thyroid tissue is grossly unremarkable. Sections of
nodule are stored frozen. Representative sections are submitted.
