4). The specimen is received fresh and placed in formalin, labeled "Total thyroidectomy, stitch marks left lobe of thyroid " and
consists of a thyroid weighing 15 9 after ﬁxation. The right lobe measures 4 x 2.5 x 0.8 cm , the left lobe measures 4 x 2.5 x 1.2
cm and the isthmus measures 2 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. The external surface is covered by a thin fibrous capsule. The posterior surface of
the specimen is inked black. and the anterior is inked blue. Sectioning the left lobe reveals a 1 x 1 x 0.9 cm white-tan nodule.
Sections through the remaining tissue is unremarkable. The remaining thyroid parenchyma is red tan and beefy. Representative
sections of the specimen was submitted for and a photograph has been taken. The remaining tissue is serially sectioned
and entirely submitted.
