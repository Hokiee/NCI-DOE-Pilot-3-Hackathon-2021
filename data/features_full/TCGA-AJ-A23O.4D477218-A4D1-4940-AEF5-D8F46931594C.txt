Gross Description:

Four parts

Container labeled ‘-1 - left pelvic lymph nodes" are
6.0 x 4.8 x 2.6 cm of tan yellow fibroadipose tissue fragments which
on palpation and sectioning reveal several poorly defined tan yellow
to brown nodules up to 3.0 cm in greatest dimension. 0n sectioning
the largest nodule is a grossly fat cut surface. The individual
nodules are bisected and submitted labeled "A through C" while whole
smaller nodules are submitted labeled "D."

Container labeled "—2 - right pelvic lymph nodes" are
5.0 x 4.0 x 1.7 cm of tan yellow fibroadipose tissue fragments which
on palpation and sectioning reveal several poorly defined tan yellow
to brown nodules up to 3.3 cm. 0n sectioning the largest nodule has
a fleshy and fatty cut surface. The individual nodules are bisected
and submitted labeled "A and D" while whole smaller nodules are
submitted labeled "C."

Container labeled “—3 — uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes
and ovaries" is a previously anteriorly opened moderately distorted
uterus with attached cervix and bilateral adnexa. The uterus and
cervix together weigh 65 grams and on reconstruction measure
approximately 8.0 x 5.5 x 4.0 cm. The cervix has a wrinkled gray
tan ectoeervical mucosa. The as is patent. The uterine canal
sounds to a depth of approximately 6.7 cm. The endocervical canal
is lined by trabeculated gray tan mucosa. The uterine serosa is
smooth and tan brown. The myometrium is up to 1.6 cm and is tan

brown and fibrotic. The majority of the endometrial canal is
occupied by friable granular gray tan to brown papilliferous lesion
occupying an area overall 4.6 x 3.5 cm which includes both the
anterior and posterior aspects as well as both lateral aspects in
the fundus. 0n sectioning this has a gritty gray tan fibrotic cut
surface grossly extending into the myometrium to within 0.3 cm of
the anterior serosa. In this area the lesion measures 1.8 cm in
thickness. The lesion extends grossly to within 0.3 cm of the
posterior serosa as well. This is seen within 0.4 cm of the fundic
serosa and within 0.2 cm of the right lateral aspect. The small
amount of parametrial soft tissue on each side shows no nodularity
or gross lesions.

The left fallopian tube is 4.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The right fallopian
tube is 5.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. Each has a smooth tan brown serosa with
a tan wall and a pinpoint lumen. The left ovary is 2.0 x 1.2 x 0.8
cm and has a lobular gray tan outer surface with a mottled gray tan
fibrotic cut surface. The right ovary is 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm and has
a lobular gray tan to brown outer surface with a mottled gray tan
fibrotic cut surface having a few thin walled clear fluid filled
cystic structures with smooth inner linings measuring up to 0.3 cm.
Also received in the same container are two tissue cassettes each
labeled ‘ " ." Representative sections are submitted labeled
as follows: A - anterior cervix; B - posterior cervix; C — lower
uterine segment and shaved posterior serosa; D and E - anterior
endomyometrium; F and G - posterior endomyometrium; R and I - left
lateral endomyometrium; J and K - right lateral endomyometrium; L
and M - fundic endomyometrium; N - left parametrium; O - right
parametrium; P — left adnexa; Q - right adnexa.

Container labeled '_ 4 - right aortic node" is a 3.6 x
1.5 x 1.0 cm aggregate of tan yellow fibroadipose tissue fragments
which on palpation and sectioning reveal a few poorly defined tan
yellow nodular regions up to 0.8 cm. The nodular tissue is
submitted in a single cassette.
