1. Labeied ”anterior right neck dissection, inc1uding jugu1ar digastric and
submaxiiiary

giands and end of parotid, doub1e stitch at jugu1ar vein": The specimen consists
resection specimen inciuding tan brown tumor. The specimen measures approximate1y
10.0 x
h4.0 x 3.0 cm in maxima1 dimensions. The tumor has a pa1e brown appearance. It
as a

centra1 defect consistent with prior tumor remova] for specimen studies. The
remaining

tumor measures approximater 3.0 cm in diameter. Near the edge of the tumor, there
is a

doubie stitch marking jugu1ar vein. The tumor is present at one end of the
specimen, with

tge opposite end containing 1obu1ated tan brown apparent saiivary g1and tissue.
No es

adjagent to the jugu1ar vein are separate1y defected. The sa1ivary g1and tissue is
gross

norma Sections are embedded as foliows: 1A—D — tumor, 1E and F — nodes
adjacent to

subciavian vein, lG — soft tissue adjacent to subciavian vein, 16— I sa1ivary g1and
tissue,

no es.

%. Labeied "posterior triang1e dissection": The specimen consists of a fiat piece
0

fatty tissue bearing 1ymph nodes. It measures approximate1y 15.0 x 6.0 x 1.8 cm. A
st1tc

is present at one end marking jugu1ar subciavian junction. Lymph nodes are
defected from

the tissue and no gross tumor is identified. Tissue at the jugu1ar subciavian
junction is

lgmbeddﬁd as 3A and B. Other 1ymph nodes are embedded as 3C — 7 1ymph nodes, 3D —
ymp

nodes, 3E — 15 1ymph nodes, 3F — 14 1ymph nodes.

g'k Labe1ed "right upper jugu1ar node F5": The specimen consists of an ovoid gray
p1n

apparent lymph node measuring 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. It is bisected, showing no
gross y

evident tumor. A11 taken for frozen section diagnosis.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION (F5): - No maiignant ce115 identified.

Microscopic sections are prepared and interpreted.

MICROSCOPIC

Histo1ogic sections of the tumor nodu1e show predominant1y necrotic ma1ignancy with
on a

sma11 focus of poor1y differentiated ma1ignant ce11s (s1ide 1C) consistent with
metastatic

me1anoma. A1though no 1ymph node tissue is identified in the main nodu1e, the
appearance

is consistent with an effaced 1ymph node, overrun with tumor with tumor extending
into so t

tissue. A11 remaining 1ymph nodes are negative for ma1ignancy. A microfocus of
(granu1omatous inf1ammation is noted in one of the poster1or triang1e 1ymph node

Specia1 stains for microorganisms (inc1uding AFB for acid fast baci11i and GMS for
funga1/yeast organisms are pending).

DIAGNOSIS

1. LABELED l'ANTERIOR RIGHT NECK DISSECTION, INCLUDING JUGULODIGASTRIC TISSUE,
SUBMAXILLARY GLAND AND END OF PAROTID".

METASTATIC MELANOMA NODULE. LARGELY NECROTICl APPROXIMATELY 3.0 CM IN
DIAMETER,

CONSISTENT WITH A REPLACED LYMPH NODE.
ALL REMAINING LYMPH NODES ARE NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (ONE POSITIVE OF

TOTAL).
- SALIVARY GLAND TISSUE SHOWS NO APPARENT ABNORMALITY.

SIXTEEN

2. LABELED "RIGHT UPPER JUGULAR LYMPH NODE".
- SINGLE BENIGN LYMPH NODE.

3. LABELED "POSTERIOR TRIANGLE DISSECTION".
— ALL LYMPH NODES ARE NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY (45).

- ONE LYMPH NODE CONTAINS A FEW NON NECROTIZING GRANULOMAS; AFB AND GMS
STAINS ARE

PENDING.
ADDENDUM
** ADDENDUM No.1 **

The GMS and AFB stains on the 1eft posterior triang1e 1ymph node containing non
necrotizing

gganu1omas have been performed. These stains are negative for acid fast baci11i
an

:unga1/yeast organisms. Further c1inica1 corre1ation is recommended to determine
t e

significance of this finding.
