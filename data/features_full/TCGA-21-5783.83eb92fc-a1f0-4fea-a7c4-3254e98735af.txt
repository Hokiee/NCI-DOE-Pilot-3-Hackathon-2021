Source of Tissue: 4. Labeled "left lung (left upper lobe)".

Frozen Section Diagnosis: 4FS HISTOLOGICALLY NEGATIVE MARGIN, BUT
GROS SLY ONLY BY 34W, PER '

Gross Description: The specimen is received fresh and consists of a 235
gram left upper lobe measuring 18 x 11 x 6.50m. The bronchial margin is
procured for frozen section consultation and submitted in 4FSA.

 

The bronchial tree is opened to reveal lesional tissue approximately 0.2
0.30m from the margin (4C). Elsewhere, vascular margins are unremarkable
and the hilum contains a few black, anthracotic nodes. Sections show

multiple potential peribronchial nodes with metastatic (4D—4E). _

Laterally, there is a large area of pleural puckering up to 3cm and

sections show a large 7 x 6 x 5cm tumor comprising approximately 40% of
the left upper lobe. Centrally, the tumor has some black discoloration is
necrotic, however, towards the periphery there is more grossly viable
tumor.

Sections through the remaining parenchyma show pink, spongy lung tissue
with black, anthracotic pigmentation. No other suspicious lesions or
masses are found.

Designation of Sections: 4FSA bronchial margin, 4A vascular margin, 4B
hilar nodes, 4C section approximately 5cm from bronchial margin, 4D—4E
additional section hilum, possible peiibronchial lymph nodes, 4F-4G
tumor, 4H tumor in relationship to left pleura, 41 uninvolved lung

tissue.

Summary of Sections: Representative section 4FSA, 4A 41.

Final Diagnosis:
1. Portion of 6th rib, excision:
- Bone marrow elements. No tumor seen.

2. Lymph nodes, level 9, excision:
~ No tumor seen in one lymph node (0/1).

3. Lymph node, level 11, excision:
— No tumor seen in one lymph node (0/ 1).

 

4. Left lung, upper lobe, lobectomy:

- Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (7 cm), with
neuroendocrine features, see note.

- Negative bronchial and vascular margins.

- Negative pleura.
— No tumor seen in six hilar lymph nodes.

 

5. Lymph nodes, level 5, excision:
- No tumor seen in two lymph nodes (0/2).

6. Lymph node, level 7, excision:
— N0 tumor seen in one lymph node (0/1).

Note: Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumor is negative for
chromogranin and synaptophysin and focally positive for CD56.
