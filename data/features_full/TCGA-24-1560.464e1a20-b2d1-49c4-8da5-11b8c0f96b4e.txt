Gross Description

Received are fourteen containers labeled with the patient‘s name and number. The ﬁrst is further labeled “#1 left
adnexa." It contains a tan-pink tissue fragment with papillary growth pattern. The tissue has maximum dimensions of
15.5 x 14 x 3.2 cm. One surface is lined by smooth serosa and a fragment of fallopian tube with a length of 4 cm and
an external diameter of 1 cm is also identiﬁed. in addition a previously opened cyst is present. This contains three
papiilary excrescences on the internal surface with maximum dimensions of 5.2 x 4.5 x 0.7, 3.0 x 2.7 x 0.8 and 1.7 x 1.5
x 0.6 cm. Also within the container are two white cassettes labeled FSiA and F81 B. Labelled A - FSiA; A2-FS‘i B; A3
— A10 - sections of tumor; A11- section of fallopian tube.

The second container is labeled "#2 uterus, cervix, right tube and ovary," it contains a hysterectomy specimen with
attached right fallopian tube and ovary. The uterine corpus measures 6.0 cm superoinferioriy, 5.3 cm side to side and 7
cm anteroposteriorly. The cervix has a length of 3.0 cm in external diameter of 2.7 cm. The external 05 has a diameter
of 0.2 cm. The uterus is bivalved in the coronal plane. The endocervix has a length of 3 cm and maximum diameter of
0.7 cm. The endometrial cavity has a length of 3.5 cm and maximum width of 3 cm. The endometrium is grossiy
unremarkable apart from a posterior endometrial polyp with a maximum dimension of 1.7 cm. Anterior and posterior
intramural Ieiomyomas are identified. The anterior leiomyoma has a maximum dimension of 2.5 cm. The posterior
. leiomyoma has a maximum dimension of 1.7 cm. Both have white—pink, ﬁrm, whoried cut surface appearances. The
right fallopian tube has a length of 7.5 cm and an external diameter of 0.8 cm. The right ovary has maximum
dimensions of 1.9 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm. Attached to the surface of the ovary is a tan, ﬁrm nodule, grossly suggestive of tumor
with maximum dimension of 1.5 cm. Labeled Bi - anterior endo-ectocervix; 82 - posterior endo-ectocervix; 83 -
anterior endo-myometrium; B4 - posterior endo-myometrium; B5 - endometrial polyp; 86 - anterior leiomyoma; B? -
posterior intramural leiomyoma; BS - right ovary including tumor; 89 - right fallopian tube. -

The third container is labeled "#3 left eivic sidewall.” it contains a singie tan-brown tissue fragment with a maximum
dimension of 0.5 cm labeled Ci.

The fourth container is iabeied "#4 right pelvic sidewall." it contains a 2.5 x 2 x 0.5 cm fragment of soft tissue. One
surface is pink—grey and glistening. The other surface is tan and papiiiary, grossly suggestive of tumor. —

The ﬁfth container is inhaled "cul-de-sac." it contains a fragment of tan-brown papillary tissue measuring 2.7 x 1 x 0.7
cm in maximum dimension. innumerable friable tan tissue fragments are pre ' ' he container. These have an
estimated volume of 2 cc. Sectioned from the larger tissue fragment labeled W

The sixth container is labeled “left external lilac lymph node.“ it contains a fragment of ﬁbroadipose and lymphoid
tissue with maximum dimensions of 5 x 3 x 0.5 cm. The tissue is dissected show the presence of four lymph nodes
ranging from 1.3 to 1.7 cm in maximum dimension. d

The seventh container is labeled "#7 left obturator lymph node." it contains a 4 x 2.5 x 1 cm fragment of ﬁbroadipose
