ureter". It consists of a portion of ureter measuring 0.4 cm in length and 0.6 cm
in diameter. The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette for permanent
section.

F/S". It consists of a portion of ureter measuring 0.4 cm in length and 0.6 cm in
diameter. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in cassette DFS.

E: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labeled “Uterus, cervix,
ovaries, bladder". It consists of urinary bladder, uterus. cervix, and bilateral
ovaries and fallopian tubes measuring overall 33 x 16 x 4 cm. The attached
peritoneum measures 33 x 12 x 0.1 cm, which is smooth and glistening. The
perivesical resection margin is inked black. The urinary bladder is opened
anteriorly to reveal fungating papillary lesion in the upper posterior urinary
bladder wall. The mass measures 5.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm. The remaining mucosa of the
urinary bladder is red—tan in color. The right ureter measures 8 cm in length and

Both ureters are grossly unremarkable. Bilaterally, the
ureterovesical junction is 2.5 cm inferior to the tumor. The uterus measures 8.5 x
5 x 3.5 cm and is covered by an unremarkable serosa. The cervix measures 2.5 cm in
length and 2.5 cm in diameter. The external cervix is smooth and glistening. The
uterus is opened to reveal unremarkable endocervical cavity and endocervical canal.
The endocervical canal measures 3 cm in length and 0.5 cm in circumference. The
endometrial cavity measures 3.5 x 3 cm. The endometrium measures 0.1 cm and the
myometrium measures 1 to 1.5 cm in thickness. The right fallopian tube measures
8.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter. The right ovary measures 3 x 2 x 1 cm.

ovary measures 3 x 1.8 x 0.7 cm. The bilateral adnexa are grossly unremarkable. A
piece of vaginal mucosa is also identified measuring 8 x 7 x 0.1 cm and is

uninvolved by tumor grossly. Representative sections are submitted in a total of
34 cassettes.
