Microscopic

Sections demonstrate a moderately hypercellular glial neoplasm, the cells of which have
round nuclei, often with perinuclear halos. A minority population of small fibrillary
astrocytes is also seen. There is little atypia and no mitotic figures are seen. There is no
microvascular proliferation or necrosis. The tumor diffusely infiltrates both gray and
white matter.

Addendum

Scattered MIB-l reactive cells are present with a labeling index of 2.2%. This is
indicative of a modestly proliferative neoplasm and is consistent with the low grade
histologic features.

Diagnosis

Low grade oligoastrocytoma. Oligodendroglioma predominant
