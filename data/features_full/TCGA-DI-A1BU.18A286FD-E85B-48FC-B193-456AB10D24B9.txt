GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) UTERUS, CERVIX, BILATERAL FALLOPIAN TUBES AND OVARIES - A 13.5 x 8.5 x 6.0 cm uterus with a 4.4 x 4.0 cm
cervix that has a smooth tan—white external surface. Attached is a left tube, 8.5 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm with a tubal ligation site within the
central portion. Left ovary measures 2.6 x 1.3 x 1.2 cm and grossly unremarkable. Right fallopian tube measures 10.8 x 0.7 x 0.6
cm also with a central ligation site. The right ovary is 3.3 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm and has a 0.6 cm surface cyst. There are also multiple
small paratubal cysts. The uterine serosal surface is pink, smooth tan and glistening.

The specimen is bivalved along the 3 and 9 o'clock positions to reveal a large exophytic, hemorrhagic tumor (12.5 x 8.3
x 2.4 cm) filling the uterine cavity. The tumor extends into the external cervical canal and comes to within 1.5 cm of the
endo-ectocervix junction. The uterine wall adjacent to the most invasive portion of tumor is 2.8 cm in thickness.

In the anterior lateral wall is a 1.2 cm well circumscribed myometrial nodule grossly consistent with leiomyoma.
Sectioning through the bilateral tubes and ovaries demonstrates a 0.6 cm cystic lesion within the left ovary. Sectioning through
the left fallopian tube demonstrates hemorrhagic material within the lumen but no gross lesions present. Sectioning through the
right ovary demonstrates the previously mentioned surface cyst 0.6 cm in greatest dimension filled with clear fluid. Sectioning
through the right fallopian tube is grossly unremarkable.

INK CODE: Blue - anterior uterus; black - posterior uterus.

SECTION CODE: A1-A3, posterior cervix with tumor, one slice per cassette; A4, A5, anterior cervix with tumor; A6, A7.

wall with 18/19 full thickness; cassette 23 also myometrial nodule; A24, left tube, ovary and paratubal cyst; A25, right tube and

(B) LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES - Adipose tissue, 4.0 x 4.0 x 1.7 cm in aggregate. Multiple lymph nodes are identified ranging
from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm to 2.2 x 1.8 x 0.7 cm.

SECTION CODE: C1, four possible lymph nodes; CZ, four lymph nodes; C3, three lymph nodes: C4. one lymph node
ttisected; C5, C6, one lymph node serially sectioned; C7. C8, one lymph node serially sectioned. ‘
(D) PORTION OF OMENTUM - Received is a 57.0 x 15.5 x up to 2.0 cm sheet of finely lobulated adipose tissue. The specimen
is serially sectioned to reveal cut surfaces composed of unremarkable yellow lobulated adipose tissue. A definite mass is not
grossly identified.

SECTION CODE: D1-D7, representative sections.
(E) RIGHT GONADAL VESSEL - One portion of vascular structure, 6.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm and a round fibroadipose tissue. The
Specimen is serially sectioned. Cut surface reveal unremarkable vessel and soft tissue. Representative sections submitted in E.

(I-) PARAAORTIC LYMPH NODES - Multiple adipose tissues, 4.0 x 4.0 x 1.8 cm in aggregate. Six lymph nodes are identified
ranging from 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm to 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm.

SECTION CODE: F1, two lymph nodes; F2, two lymph nodes; F3, one lymph node serially sectioned; F4-F6, one lymph
node serially sectioned. '
