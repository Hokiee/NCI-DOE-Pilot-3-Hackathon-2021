GROSS DESCRIPTION
1. LabeIed "Ieft sentineI node inferior puImonary Iigament, Iower Iobe": The

spec1 men

consists of a 1.5 x 0.7 x O. 6 cm bIack gray Iymph node. Lymph node bisected and
entirer

submitted as lFSA. HMS-45 and 5—100 are ordered.

INTRAOPERATIVE _ CONSULTATION (FROZEN ' SECTION) :
— SentineI Iymph node negative.

2. [Labeged "Ieft supreuraI noduIe upper Iobe adjacent to superior puImonary
vein' T e

specimen consists of two irreguIar portions of red tan soft tissue measuring 0.5
and 0.8

cm. Entirer submitted as ZFSA.

INTRAOPERATIVE _ CONSULTATION (FROZEN SECTION) :
— HyaIine noduIe, aIveoIar coIIapse. _ .
— Focus of atypicaI ceIIs, favor h1$t1ocytes, benign.

3. LabeIed "second noduIe anterior segment of Ieft Iower Iobe": The specimen
consists of

a 2.5 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm irreguIar portion of red tan Iung tissue. A 0.6 cm yeIIow tan
weII

circumscribed firm noduIe is present. Specimen is bisected and entirer submitted
as 3FSA.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION (FRQZEN SECTION):

HM ,-

and 5—100 ordered.

5. LabeIed "Ieft Tower Iobe": The specimen consists of a 16.0 x 11.0 x 4.0 cm
Iower Iobe

of Ieft Iung. VisceraI pIeura is tan pink gray purpIe with a 6.0 x 2.5 cm
rectanguIar

defect. A 3.0 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm deepIy que stained tan gray somewhat friabIe mass is
exposed

fat defect site. A moderate amount of the mass has been previoust harvested. Mass
oca y

abuts visceraI pIeura but does not appear to invoIve pIeura. Mass is approximater
5.0 cm

from bronchiaI resection margin. Surrounding Iung parenchyma anng diaphragmatic
aspect 1s

somewhat goIden yeIIow tan. Remaining uninvoIved Iung parenchyma is red tan
unremarkab_e.

SeveraI h1Iar Iymph nodes are present ranging from 0.3 to 1.3 cm. Representativer
sectioned as 5A — bronch1aI and vascuIar resection margins, 5B — hiIar Iymph nodes,
5C -

two hiIar Iymph nodes, each bisected; 5D—5F — representative sections of mass, 56
— ung
1parenchyma anng diaphragmatic surface adjacent to mass, 5H — distant uninvoIved
ung

parenchyma.

6. LabeIed "Iymph node adjacent to puImonary artery": The specimen consists of a
1 0 x

0.7 x 0.2 cm bIack Iymph node. Lymph node entirer submitted as 6A.

7. LabeIed "7th Ieft rib": The specimen consists of a 1.7 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm
irreguIar

portion of red tan gray rib. No discrete Iesions identified. Representativer
sectioned

foIIowing decaIcification as 7A.

Microscopic sections are prepared and interpreted.

COMMENT

The smaII Iymphocytic I m hoid a gregate noted in bone is non—paratrabecuIar and is
considered within normaI Iimits or a patient of this age. CIinicaI correIation
recommended, incIuding CBC with differentiaI to echude peripheraI bIood
Iymphocytosis.

DIAGNOSIS

l. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE, LEFT INFERIOR PULMONARY LIGAMENT, LOWER LOBE, BIOPSY:

— LYMPH NODE WITH FOCAL ANTHRACOSIS, OTHERWISE NO SIGNIFICANT ABNORMALITY.
- NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.

- 5—100 AND HMB-45 STAINS BY IMMUNOPEROXIDASE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR CELLS.

2. LEFT SUBPLEURAL NODULE, UPPER LOBE ADJACENT TO SUPERIOR PULMONARY VEIN,
BIOPSY:

- SMALL PLEURAL/SUBPLEURAL SCAR.

— NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.

3. SECOND NODULE, ANTERIOR SEGMENT OF LEFT LOWER LOBE, EXCISION:
Page 2

- METASTATIC MELANOMA, 0.8 CM PARENCHYMAL TUMOR DEPOSIT.
- APPROXIMATELY 25% TUMOR NECROSIS, NO SIGNIFICANT LYMPHOCYTIC REACTION.

4. SENTINEL LYMPH NODE, POSTERIOR MEDIASTINAL, BIOPSY:
- LYMPH NODE WITH FOCAL ANTHRACOSIS, OTHERWISE NO SIGNIFICANT ABNORMALITY.

- NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.
- 5-100 AND HMB-45 STAINS BY IMMUNOPEROXIDASE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR CELLS.

5. LUNG, LEFT LOWER LOBE, LOBECTOMY:
