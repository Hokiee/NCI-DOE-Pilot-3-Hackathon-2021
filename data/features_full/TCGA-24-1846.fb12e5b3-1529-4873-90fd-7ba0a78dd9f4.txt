"F51."lhe cassette contains tyre pieces oi yellow— -white tissue measuring 2. 4 x 1.1 x o. 3 cm and 1 x t x 0.3 cm

Labeled A1 (F81. The remainin tissue is comprised of mullinodular, light yellow. firm material consistentwith omental
caking by tumor.

The second container is labeled “right external lilac lymph node.‘ ltholds a piece at firm, tan-brown lymph node
measuring 2.5 x i .2 x 0.5 cm with attached yellow fibrotatty its white discoloration within the
tan-brown lymph node. The putative implant measures 1.8 MW

The third container is labeled “modified posterior exenteratlon.‘ it hotds rectosfgmoid colon, cul-de~sac mass. and
uterus with bilateral tubes and ovaries. en bloc. The specimen weighs 950 grams and the soft tissue margins are inked
black. The rectum measures 15 cm in length. The uterus measures 9 cm from tundus to cs, 4 cm lrorn anterior to
posterior and 5 cm from cornu to cornu. The external 05 is oval and patent. The exocervix is smooth, white and shiny.
The endometrlum and endocerle show smooth, tan-brown surface with no gross tumor. The myometrlum measures a
maximum of 19 mm In thickness and is also unremarkable. except tor the posterior distortion by the cul—de-sac tumor.
The specimen also shows a 7.5 x 6.5 x 6 cm cystic and solid mass with tan-yellow, fleshy cut surfaces that lies
between the rectosigmold and posterior cervix and lower uterine segment in the posterior cul—de-sac. A cystic area
measuring 2.5 x 2.7 x 2.8 cm is tdentilied immediately deep to the rectoslgmoid, 5.5 cm from the distal margin. The
colon is opened to show tan-brown mucosa with no gross abnormality with tumor involving the serosa and muscularis
wall. The posterior cervix and lower uterine segment are indented by a solid portion oi the tumor, but gross invasion
into the substance of the uterus is not identified. there is an anterior implant of firm, whitegrey tumor abutting the
anterior serosal surface of the lower uterine segment measuring 1 cm in diameter and 7' cm in length. The ovaries are
involved in matted tumor aggregating to 4.5 cm on the right and 3.8 cm on the left. The left ovary and tube contain a
cyst measuring 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm. Sections of the cyst show clear, colorless fluid and a cyst wall measuring <0.1 cm in
diameter. The left ovary measures 2.5 x 1.5 x 2 cm and the cut surlace is lirm, white-yeltow, similar to the cut surface
of the tumor implants involving the adnexa and posterior cui—de-sac.‘lhe fallopian tubes are essentially obliterated by
the tumor masses. Gross photograph taken. Labeled 01, proximal rectum margin; (32, distal rectum margin; CS, radial

The fourth container is labeled “bladder peritoneum.” it holds a piece of glistening. tan-pink peritoneum studded with
numerous tumor implants. ”the section measures 15 x 3 x 1 cm. The tumor implants are nearly confluent but generally

range from 0.510 1.5 cm in greatest dimension.—

The fifth container is labeled "appendix." It holds an intact appendix measuring 5 x 0.8 cm. At the tip of the appendix
and 1.5 cm from the tip of the appendix there are nodules measuring 0. 4 and 0.5 cm. The appendix shows an intact

lumen Wind El, tip of appendix section with nodule. and proximal cross
section;

The sixth container is labeled 'gastrocolic omentum.‘ it holds a piece of yellow-tan, flbrofatty omentum measuring 25 x
14 cm. in addition, there are several fragments or yellow-tan. librofatty tissue containing tumor implants measuring 1 to
1.5 cm in greatest dimension. There is a caking Of the gastrocolic omentum measuring 10 x 4 x 3 cm at one edge.
Labeled F1 to F3, tumor implant. -

The seventh container is labeled_‘ it holds a piece of apparent intestine measuring 1.5 x 1 x 0.9 cm. stapled
on one end. The staples are removed. The specimen is opened to show a divenicuium with yellow-tan mucosa. No
tumor is identified. Labeled Gt

The eighth container is labeled "anastomotic donut.“ it holds two pieces of tan-brown, unremarkable intestinal mucosa
invested with staptes.

H. SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

HfSTOPATHOLOGtC TYPE
The histologic diagnosis is serous adenocarcinoma

 

TUMOR LOCATION
The locations of the primary tumor(s) are the right and ieit ovary (synchronous primary tumors)

HISTOLOGIC GRADE
The histologic grade is poorly differentiated (GS)

TUMOR JNVASION
Tumor does invade the adjacent fallopian tube/peritubat soft tissue

TUMOR lNVOLVEMENT
Metastatic involvement of the omentum is present

TUMOR SIZE
The maximum dimension of tumor implants outside the true pelvis is greater than or equal to 2 cm

PRIMARY TUMOR (l)
Based on the above information, the primary tumor is classified as macroscopic peritoneal metastasis beyond pelvis
