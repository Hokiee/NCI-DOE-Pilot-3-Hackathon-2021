Diagnosis:
Subgaleal Mass
-Large Cell Lymphoma, B-Cell Type of probable follicular center cell origin. 4“) 4,23113

 

Discussion:

The neoplastic cells are immunoreactive for CD45 and CD20. Scattered C03 positive T-
ceIls are present as well as scattered CD68 positive monocytes/macrophage lineage
cells. The tumor cells are diffusely immunoreactive for vimentin. They are negative for
cytokeratin, CD 99, desmin, synaptophysin, 5-100 and CD34. Overall, the findings
confirm a diagnosis of a B-cell lymphoma.

Microscopic Description:

Sections demonstrate sheets of large, non-cohesive cells. Whereas the nuclei are
enlarged, there is only modest cytoplasm. The nuclei range from open to
hyperchromatic and rounded to angulated to cleaved and lobulated. Scattered mitotic
figures are seen. There are no specifics differentiating features.
