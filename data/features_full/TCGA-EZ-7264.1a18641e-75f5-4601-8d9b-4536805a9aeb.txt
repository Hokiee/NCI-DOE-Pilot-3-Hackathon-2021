cm in aggregate). A portion of the specimen is smeared for
intraoperative consultation and the remainder is in block A1.

Container B is additionally labeled "right frontal tumor." It

submitted).

Light Microscopy:
Light microscopic examination is performed by -

The rapid intraoperative diagnosis is confirmed. Sections show
an infiltrating low—grade glioma with prominent perinuclear
halos, focal microcystic change, and delicate vasculature.
Nuclei are relatively round and show only modest nuclear
atypia. Mitotic figures are present but infrequent. The glioma
infiltrates both gray and white matter.
