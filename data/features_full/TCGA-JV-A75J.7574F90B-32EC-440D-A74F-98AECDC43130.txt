Gross Description

Specimen Material: A. Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries. B.
Pelvic tumor, C. Omentum, D. Small bowel implant, E. Appendix, F. Left
pelvic lymph node, G. Pelvic implant. Total abdominal hysterectomy,
exploratory laparotomy, bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy, appendectomy,
omentectomy, tumor debulking, left pelvic lymph node dissection, right

uretolysis.
The case is received in seven parts labeled with the patient's name ,
. medical record number and given accession number , and it is

accompanied by a requisition form labeled with the same name and accession
number.

Part A: Received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled "UTERUS,
CERVIX, BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES" is a 2.12 kilogram mass 18.0 x 18.0 x
12.0 cm which is attached to the posterior fundus of a 7.0 x 7.0 x 5.0
uterus with an attached cervix measuring 1.5 x 2.5 cm, the cervical os
measuring 0.5 cm, along with attached bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries,
the left fallopian tube measuring 6.0 x 0.5 cm, the left ovary measuring 2.7
x 1.5 x 0.4 cm, the right fallopian tube measuring 6.0 x 0.4 cm, the right
ovary measuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm.

The uterine serosa is tan-pink, smooth. In the region of posterior fundus
around the right cornua is a large necrotic and bulging mass with disrupted
surface. On sectioning, the mass is variegated, tan—yellow to pink—red
fleshy to firm areas, with abundant hemorrhage and necrosis. The
endometrium measures 0.2 cm in thickness, the myometrium measures 2.0 cm in
thickness. There are multiple tan—white, firm, whorled, intramural nodules
ranging in size from 2.0 cm to 1.0 cm in their greatest dimension. Bilateral
fallopian tubes and ovaries are unremarkable.

Representative sections are submitted as follows:

FSAI: section of the mass

A2: anterior cervix

A3: full thickness section including endometrium and myometrium
A4: posterior cervix

A5: full thickness section including endometrium and myometrium

Part B. Received in formalin labeled "B PELVIC" is a 10 x 8 x 3 cm
tan-yellow, rubbery, necrotic and disrupted tissue fragment. Representative
sections are submitted in cassettes Bl-BS

Part C. Received in formalin labeled "OMENTUM" is a 25 x 12 x 1 cm omentum.
The surface is yellow and hemorrhagic, lobulated. No discreet masses are
identified. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes C1—C5.

Part D. Received in formalin labeled "SMALL BOWEL" is a 2.0 x 1.8 x 0.6 cm
tan—white irregular and unoriented piece of tissue. The specimen is
serially sectioned and submitted entirely in cassettes D1 and DZ.

Part E. Received in formalin labeled "APPENDIX" is a 7 cm in length and 0.7
cm in diameter appendix with moderate attached mesoappendix. The serosa is
pink and hemorrhagic, no exudate or transmural defects are identified. The
proximal margin is inked blue. The wall measures 0.5 cm thick, no fecaliths
are identified. The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted entirely
in-five cassettes.

Part F. Received in formalin labeled "LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE" is a 3.5 x
2.0 x 0.5 cm tan-yellow to pink fibroadipose tissue. Two lymph nodes are
identified ranging in size from 0.5 to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. The
largest lymph node is serially sectioned into four parts and submitted
entirely in cassette F1. The second lymph node is submitted in toto in
cassette F2.

Part G. Received in formalin labeled "PELVIC IMPLANT" is a 3.0 x 1.5 x 0.6

cm tan—pink irregular rubbery piece of tissue which is serially sectioned
