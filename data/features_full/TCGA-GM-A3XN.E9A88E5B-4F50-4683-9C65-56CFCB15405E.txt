The invasive lobular carcinoma demonstrates tubule formation in occasional small foci comprising much less than 1 % of the
entire tumor. Few Signet ring cells are noted in both the in situ and invasive tumor.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) FOR IMMEDIATE INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION AND X-RAY IMAGING LABELED LEFT SEGMENTAL
I\ILI’ELSIECETOMY, SHORT STITCH SUPERIOR, LONG STITCH LATERAL, PURPLE IS DEEP - AWssue with needle
localization wires measuring 10.0 x 6.0 x 5.0 cm. Surgical margins are inked. The specimen is radiographed before and after
slicing and the radiograph is reviewed by the radiologist. The specimen is sectioned from lateral to medial aspect into seven
slices. Slice 3 contains an ill-defined, firm tan lesion #1 containing radiological clip. It measures 1.1 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm. It is more than
1.0 cm from all the margins. Cut surface of slices 4 and 5 contains a second ill-defined indurated tan lesion with clip measuring
2.0 x 1.2 x 1.1 cm. It is 0.4 cm from the closest anterior surgical margin. Cut surface of slice 5 and 6 shows an ill-deﬁned lesion 3
with clip measuring 1.9 x 1.6 x 1.3 cm. In slice 5, lesion 3 and 2 are grossly connected to each other. Lesion 3 is 0.5 cm away
from the medial surgical margin, 0.2cm from deep margin and more than 1.0 cm from the rest of the margins. Located in fatty
tissue at the inferior aspect of slices 1 and 2 are two possible lymph nodes ranging from 1.1 up to 1.3 cm in greatest dimension
which are indicated by the surgeon to represent the sentinel lymph nodes. Lymph nodes identified in slice 1 is sent for protocol
Representative sections are submitted. A portion of the tumor is given to tumor bank.
INK CODE: Superior - blue; inferior - green; anterior - yellow; posterior - black; lateral and medial -red.
