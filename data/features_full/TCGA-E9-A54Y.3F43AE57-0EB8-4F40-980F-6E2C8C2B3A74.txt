Gross Description: There is a breast with tumor of irregular shape up to 3 cm in its largest dimension. At
the distance of 1.5 cm from the lst tumor node there is the 2nd node up to 1 cm in size. In the axillary
fatty tissue there are lymph nodes with lipomatosis (suspicion of metastases).

Microscopic Description: lnfiltrating lobular carcinoma of the breast, 6-3, with multicentric type of
growth. There are single Signet-ring cells. Ten examined lymph nodes demonstrated metastases.

IHC-stainings: ER - positive reaction 98% 3+; PR - positive reaction 50% 3+; Her—2/neu - negative reaction
1+; Ki-67 - 6%.

Diagnosis Details: Tumor Features: indeterminate, Tumor Extent: T2 tumor size more than 2cm not
more than 5 cm, Venous invasion: Not speciﬁed, Margins: Absent, Treatment Effect:

Comments: Original records read pT1N2MO. But tumor size is up to 3 cm in largest dimension, which
corresponds to T2.
