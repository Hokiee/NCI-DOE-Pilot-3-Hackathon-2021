MICROSCOPIC REPORT

The (L) axillary dissection shows metastatic malignant melanoma, involving 1 (one) of 23 nodes.

Growth gotta: The large involved node is virtually replaced (>99%) by solid tumour, which expands the
node capsule.

Focal ly in block 1H, the capsule is invaded and breached over a 1.5mm dia area with tumour cells gong just
into fat (slides 1H] -3) - (microscopic extranodal extension).

Most of the tumour is viable, though some early necrosis is seen in places.

Tumour histology: The melanoma has an epithelioid cytomorphology, with large nucleoli and mild nuclear
pleomorphism '
