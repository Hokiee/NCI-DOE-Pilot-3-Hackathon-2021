A. UTERINE TUMOR

Labeled 1, designated “uterine tumor”, and received in formalin is a 4.0 x 3.4 x 1.5 cm
aggregate of multiple portions of pink-tan soft plus friable tissue ranging from 0.7 to 3.4 cm in greatest
dimension.

Cut section of the tumor reveals reddish-brown hemorrhage as well as focal areas of whitish tumor
ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension.

Representative sections submitted.

B. UTERUS. CERVIX. BILATERAL TUBES AND OVARIES

Labeled ., designated “uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries", and received fresh in
the Intraoperative Consultation Room and subsequently ﬁxed in formalin is a 167.5 gram total
hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. The uterus is 11.0 x 6.1 x 5.0 cm. The left ovary is
2.0 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm. The left fallopian tube is 6.7 cm in length with a diameter up to 0.4 cm. A pinpoint
lumen is identiﬁed. The right ovary is 2.2 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm. The right fallopian tube is 5.0 cm in length with
a diameter up to 0.3 cm. A pinpoint lumen is identiﬁed. The endometrial cavity is 4.0 x 4.5 x 2.0 cm. The
uterine wall ranges from 1.0 to 2.1 cm in thickness. The endocervical canal is 3.0 cm in length with a
circumference of 2.5 cm. The external cervical os is 1.5 cm in diameter. The endometrial lining is up to
0.1 cm in thickness. Also received separately in the container is a 6.0 x 4.8 x 3.8 cm reddish-brown blood
clot.

There is a 7.1 x 7.7 x 3.0 cm polypoid mass in the posterior and anterior uterine corpus. The mass is
whitish tan and friable. The tumor extends from the uterine fundus and down to the lower uterine
segment. The cervix appears free of tumor. The tumor appears to invade into the myometrium at its
deepest point in the posterior uterine corpus approximately 0.5 cm.

Approximately two fibroids are identiﬁed in the posterior wall measuring 1.0 and 2.0 cm in greatest
dimension. No necrosis hemorrhage or calciﬁcations are identiﬁed within the ﬁbroids. The ovaries and
fallopian tubes are grossly unremarkable. Gross photographs obtained.
