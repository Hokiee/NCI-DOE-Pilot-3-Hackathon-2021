of the colon with characteristic tumor cell groups, mostly in a tubular arrangement, and a marked
tendency to spread to the fatty connective tissue, as well as moderate to low-grade lymph nodes
(G2 to 3, pT3, L1, V1)

The material also shows seven conglomerate metastases of the carcinoma described with
extensive necrosis (7 of 18) and — with regard to the resection margins — free resection margins,
here of the cryptic epithelium type with goblet cells, regular submucosa and muscularis

and in II a regular anastomosis ring, here with regular cryptic epithelium, lined with goblet cells,
isolated lymph follicles and regular submucosa and muscularis.
