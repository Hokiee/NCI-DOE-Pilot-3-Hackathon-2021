FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Diagnosis:

A. — F. RIGHT BREAST AND AXILLARY LYMPH MODES, MASTECTOMY, SENTINEL
LYMPH NODE BIOPSIES, AND AXILLARY LYMPH NODE DISSECTION:
- Muitifocal invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grades 2-3. See comment.
- Largest tumor nodule: 1.5 cm in diameter (6 o'clock aspect).
- Two smaller nodules: 0.6 and 0.8 cm (7-8 o'clock aspect).
- Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), high nuclear grade, solid type.
- DCIS comprises less than 10% of biopsy tissue volume, and is associated
with all three invasive tumor nodules.
- Mastectomy margins are free of tumor.
- Carcinoma is 3 cm from the inferior margin and is at least 6 cm from
all other margins.
- Metastatic carcinoma in three of ﬁfteen lymph nodes {3115).
- Largest metastatic focus: 0.9 cm in diameter.
~ Extranodal extension present.

— Positive lymph nodes are sentinel lymph nodes #2, #3, and #4

PATHOLOGIC TUMOR STAGiNG SYNOPSIS:
Type and grade (invasive): Invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 2-3.
Type and grade (in situ): DCiS, high-nuclear grade. WLGD 0’ 3
Primary tumor: pT1c(m).
Regional lymph nodes: pNtc. U?! W4 I701 Hog: ’M% H 05
Distant metastasis: Not applicable. 503,5
Stage: “A.
Lymphovascular invasion: indeterminate.
Mar in status: Ne ative.

COMMENT: The three foci of invasive carcinoma have simiiar histologic features,
aithcugh the tumor grade is somewhat variabie in the largest tumor nodule, where
there is a variable rate of mitosis, and nuclear pleomorphism ranging from
intermediate to highgrade. The smaller tumor nodules contain high-grade malignant
