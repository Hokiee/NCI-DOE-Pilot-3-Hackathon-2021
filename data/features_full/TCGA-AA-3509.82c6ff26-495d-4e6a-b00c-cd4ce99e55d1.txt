*** Diagnosis / Diagnoses: ***

1.: Small specimen with submesothelial fibrosis excised from the peritoneum.

2.: Resectate from a portion of the colon (sigmoid) with an ulcerated colon carcinoma, of
the histological type of a moderately differentiated colon carcinoma, that extends no
closer than 3 cm to the resection margin and occupies a circular portion of the intestinal
wall over an length of 5 cm. Invasive spread of the tumor within all layers of the
intestinal wall as far as the neighboring mesocolic fatty tissue.

Oral and aboral resection margin tumor-free.

27 mesocolic lymph nodes tumor-free, with uncharacteristic reactive changes.

The tumor stage is thus pT3 pNO (1/27), L0, V0, R0; G2
