Clinical History
Prostate cancer

Specimen

#1 Prostate

#2 Right pelvic lymph nodes
#3 Left pelvic lymph nodes

Gross Examination

#1 Received fresh and labeled prostate, is a 35 gram, 4.0 cm (right to left)
X 3.7 cm (apex to base) X 3.5 cm (anterior to posterior) prostate with attached
right and left seminal vesicles (2.5 X 1.2 x 0.8 cm, 3.0 x 2.0 x 0.8 cm,
respectively). There are portions of attached right and left vasa deferentia
(each 0.5 cm long). Also present within the specimen container there is a 2.5 x
1.5 x up to 0.7 cm aggregate of three irregular fragments of tubular rubbery,
grey tan tissue. The right half of the prostate is inked black and the left
half is inked blue. The prostate is serially sectioned from apex to base to
demonstrate a 1.5 cm ill-defined focal firm area of pale tan discoloration
within the mid aspect of the left posterior prostate, coming to within 0.1 cm of
the blue inked outer surface. The parenchyma otherwise consists of tan, rubbery
glistening parenchyma with a moderate amount of periurethral nodularity. There
are no additional abnormalities identified.

A total of thirty-four sections are submitted in fifteen cassettes "A — 0".
‘Block summary: "A", right apex longitudinally sectioned; "B", left apex
longitudinally sectioned; "C", right bladder neck longitudinally sectioned; "D",
left bladder neck longitudinally sectioned; "E-G", right posterior prostate,
from apex to base respectively; "H—J", left posterior prostate, from apex to
base respectively; "K", right lateral prostate; "L", left lateral prostate; "M",
anterior prostate; "N", right seminal vesicle and prostate, including right vas;
"0", left seminal vesicle and prostate, including left vas. Following explicit
written consent of the patient, tissue is taken for the Cancer Genome Atlas
Project.

#2 Labeled right pelvic lymph node, is a 3.2 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm portion of tan
yellow fibroadipose tissue. Within the tissue there is a 0.8 cm lymph node
candidate. The candidate is bisected and submitted as two sections in one
cassette.

#3 Labeled left pelvic lymph node, is a 4.0 X 2.5 X 1.0 cm aggregate of
multiple irregular fragments of tan yellow fibroadipose tissue. Within the
tissue there are two lymph node candidates, 0.4 and 2.5 cm in greatest
dimension. The candidates are submitted as five sections in three: "A-C".
Block summary: "A", one candidate; "B,C", larger candidate, sectioned.
