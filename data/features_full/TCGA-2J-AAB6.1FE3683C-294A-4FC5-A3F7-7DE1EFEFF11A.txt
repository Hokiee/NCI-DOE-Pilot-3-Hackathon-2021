REVISED REPORT (Addendum/Procedure included) QM wwmwmdéwfug

A. Lymph nodes, common hepatic artery, biopsy: Multiple (2)

DIAGNOSIS: § 412: WWW [:3 C .2 5. I

lymph nodes are negative for tumor.

B. Soft tissue, celiac axis stump, biopsy: Fragment of nerve
trunk and adjacent soft tissue. No evidence of malignancy.

C. Celiac artery, margin, biopsy: Fragment of arterial wall.
Negative for tumor.

D. Pancreatic neck, margin, biopsy: Negative for tumor.

E. Pancreatic body/tail, spleen, and celiac axis, partial
pancreatectomy and splenectomy: Invasive moderately differentiated
ductal adenocarcinoma is identiﬁed forming a solid mass (50 cm)
located in the pancreatic body. The tumor extends beyond pancreas
involves peripancreatic soft tissue. Angiolymphatic invasion is
absent. Perineural invasion is absent. Tumor necrosis is absent.

All surgical resection margins are negative for tumor (minimum tumor
free margin, 2.5 cm, pancreatic neck margin). The adjacent
non-neoplastic pancreatic parenchyma contains PanIN (18). Multiple
(16) regional lymph nodes are negative for metastatic tumor.

With available surgical material [AJ CC pT3 N0] (7th edition, 2010).

This ﬁnal pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic
examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of the
specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are
reviewed to conﬁrm these ﬁndings. Any substantive changes

identiﬁed on permanent section review will be reﬂected in a
revised report.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled "common hepatic artery lymph nodes" is
a 1.3 x 1.3 x 0.5 cm portion of tan—red ﬁbroadipose tissue. A 0.8

x 0.4 x 0.3 cm lymph node is present. All submitted. Grossed by

B. Received fresh labeled "celiac axis stump tissue" is a 0.8 x
0.3 X 0.3 cm fragment of red-tan soft tissue. All submitted.
Grossed by

C. Received fresh labeled "celiac artery margin, margin up" is a
1.0 X 0.5 x 0.3 cm fragment of tan, ring-shaped soft tissue. All
submitted. Grossed by

D. Received fresh labeled "pancreatic neck margin, margin up" is
a 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm portion of bloody pancreatic tissue. All
submitted. Grossed by

E. Received fresh labeled "distal pancreas, spleen, and celiac
axis" is a distal pancreatectomy specimen consisting of 17.0 x 9.0 x
4.0 cm portion ofpancreas and a 295 gram, 13.0 x 9.0 x 4.0 cm
spleen. A 5.0 X 3.5 x 3.0 cm mass is present within the pancreas
2.5 cm from the proximal pancreatic margin. The mass does not
appear to be conﬁned to the pancreas, grossly, and appears to
extend into peripancreatic soft tissue. Peripancreatic lymph nodes
and splenic hilar lymph nodes are identiﬁed. The spleen is grossly
unremarkable. Representative sections submitted. Grossed by
