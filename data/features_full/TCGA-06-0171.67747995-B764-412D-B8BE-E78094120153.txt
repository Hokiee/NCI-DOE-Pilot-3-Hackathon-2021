SPECIMEN: Recurrent right frontal brain tumor. ﬂL',
FIXATIVE: Formalin. ' 2/4;
GENERAL: A 5.5 x 4 x 1.5 cm. aggregate of gray-tan soft brain

tissue admixed with sanguinous clot. No discrete

nodules are identified. ~
SECTION: 1—5 - submitted in toto.

COMMENT: The bulk of the specimen is brain parenchyma with
rarefaction, prominent glial reactive changes, extensive areas of
coagulation necrosis, and widespread vasculopathy. In addition, there
are a couple of small zones in which cellularity and nuclear atypia are
prominent and suggestive of neoplasm. However, a reactive change with
post-radiation atypia may not be completely excluded. ‘

SPECIAL STAIN REPORT: Immunoperoxidase methods for GPA? and MIB-l were
performed on sections from blocks 3 and 4.

The GFAP demonstrates that the great majority of astrocytes, although
atypical, have a reactive phenotype. There is mitotic activity that by
its distribution is most likely in lymphocytic/phagocytic cells.
Although isolated tumor cells cannot be ruled out, the process overall
does not appear neoplastic.
