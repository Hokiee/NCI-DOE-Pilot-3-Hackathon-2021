MICBQS? OPEC:
A. and 8. Specimens A and B will be de cribed togethar ag they Shaw Bimilaz
findings. Sectiong shew brain tissue, and Include bath nermal grey and white
matter. There axe Iaxge areas involving both grey and whita matter of
hypercailularity that cuntain 39113 possessing moderate sizéd, r9unded,

rregulav nuclai with moderately coarsm Chromatin.M1ny of thesa cells show
mytaplagmic cenraeticn and a "fried egg" appearance. There axe also ocaasional
cells whth large, hygerchromati: and Irregular nuclei that are often "naked" in
apﬁearaN£e. No ﬁestasis a: mitotic figures are evident. Same 0E the tumaur cells
