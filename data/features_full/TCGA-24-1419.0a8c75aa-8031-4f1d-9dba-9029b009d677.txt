SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Microscopic Description and Comment:

Sections of the right and left ovaries show predominantly endometriold adenocarcinoma (FlGO grade 3) with focal high
grade serous carcinoma . Tumor is present on the ovarian surface and within the peritubal soft tissue. A portion of
normal right fallopian tube is identified. lmmunostains for P53, P16, and WTf were performed on sections of the right
ovarian and left ovarian tumors. These endometrioid areas showed patchy staining for P16. An lmmunostaln for P53
showed diffuse nuclear staining. An immunostain for WTt showad diffuse nuclear staining. This immunoprofile

History:

The patient is a_with a pelvic mass, asciles, and bilateral hydronephrosis. Operative procedure:
Examined under anesthesia. exploratory laparotomy, bilateral salplngo-oophorectomy, tumor debulf-ting and
omentectomy.

Gross Description;

The specimens are received in five containers of formalin, each labeled” The first container is labeled
"tumor.“ ltcontalns a while tissue cassette labeled 'FSi'that holds a 0. x . x . cm art-white soft tissue mass.

Labeled A1 (F81). Jar 0.

The second container is labeled ”right tube and ovary.” it contains an 11.5 x 6 x 2 cm piece of soft tissue, including a 2
x l x 0.9 cm ovary. The ovary has a smooth, glistening, white surface. The cut surlace is tan-white, nodular. and
friable. A putative fallopian tube is identified measuring 7 x 0.5 cm. it is sectioned to show a pinpoint lumen measuring
0.1 cm in diameter and a completely occluded lumen more proximally. The remaining tissue consists of friable papillary
tan soft tissue adherent to the peritoneal sudace. Within the soft tissue are multlple tirm white nodules ranging from 1 x
t x 0.5 to 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. Labeled Bl to 85 - ovary. entirely submitted; 86 - putative fallopian tube; B7 - tumor. Jar
2.

The third container is labeled 'lefl adnexa.“ It contains three fragments of soft tissue. The first measures 9.5 x 3.5 x 2.5
cm and contains a 4.5 x 2.9 x 2.6 cm multlcyslic ovary with a blue-white glistening surface, with a small amount of
attached soft tissue and no identifiable attached tailoplan tube. Sections show ovarian cysts filled with bretvn serous
fluid. There is a i x 0.8 x 1 cm flrm white nodule adjacent to the ovarian surlace. In addition there are numerous small
friable papillary excrescences in the cyst. that measure up to 2 cm in diameter. The adjacent soft tissue is sectioned to
show a 4 x 0.8 cm putative fallopian tube with hydrosalpinx, and a 1.2 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm white nodule. No normal fallopian
tube is identiﬁed. The next largest fragment of soft tissue measures 6.5 x 4 x 2 cm, with a blue-gray, smooth suriace
with tan-white friable papillary adherent masses measuring up to 3.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm. The friable papillary lesions are
sectioned to show llrm underlying tan-white soft tissue. The smallest fragment of tissue measures 4.2 x 2 x 1 cm, and
consists of unremarkable tan-yellow tfbrolatty tissue. Sections show no focal lesions. Labeled Cf to C4 - ovary; C5 -
putative fallopian tube; 06 and CT - tumor; C8 to 010 - additional sections of soft tissue with putative fallopian tube. Jar
2.

The lourth container Is labeled “bladder peritoneum." it contains a 6 x 4.5 x 1.4 cm fragment of tan—yellow solt tissue.
The outer sudace is covered by tan-white nodular soft tissue. The nodules ranges from < 0.1 cm in diameter to up to 2

x 1 x 0.5 cm. The cut surface shows a firm white nodular mass abutting the yellow glistening fatty tissue. Labeled D1
and D2. Jar f.

The fifth container ls labeled “omentum.” it contains multiple iragments of tan~white fibrofatty tissue ranging from 32 x
16 x 2 cm to 3 x l x 3.5 cm. The fatty tissue contains Innumerable firm white nodules ranging from 0.1 cm in diameter
to areas of confluent firm white tissue measuring 11 x 5 x 3.2 cm. Labeled E1 and E2. Jar rt.

SYNOPTIC REPORTING FORM FOR MALtGNANT OVARIAN NEOPLASMS

HISTOPATHOLOGIC TYPE

The histologic diagnosis is high grade endometriold carcinoma with local high grade serous carcinoma
TUMOR LOCATION (PRlMARY)

Right and left ovaries

HISTOLOGIC GRADE
The histologic grade is poorly differentiated (G3) or high grade

TUMOR INVASION
Tumor is identified on the ovarian surfacets)

TUMOR iNVOLVEMENT
Tumor Involvement of the pelvic peritoneum/soft tissue is present
Metastatic involvement of the omentum is present

TUMOR SIZE
The maximum dimension of tumor implants outside the true pelvis is greater than or equal to 2 cm

PRIMARY TUMOR (T)
Based on the above information. the primary tumor is classified as macroscopic peritoneal metastasis beyond pelvis

more than 2 cm in greatest dimension or regional lymph node metastasis (T3c/llIC)

REGIONAL LYMPH NODES (N)
The regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed (NX)

DlSTANT METASTASiS (M)
The status of distant tumor site cannot be assessed (MK)

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT - ..

No fallopian tube was identified on gross examination or on microscopic examination of the Initial sections of the ten
adnexa. Therefore. additional sections of the left adnexa were submitted (CB-030) to identify the left fallopian tube. Left
fallopian tube was Identified with no evidence of malignancy but the carcinoma involves the perilubal soft tissue.
