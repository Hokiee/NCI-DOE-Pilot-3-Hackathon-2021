Source Of Tissue: 1. Labeled #1, "section of sigmoid colon with associated
mesentery and mesenteric tumor"

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled "section of sigmoid colon with associated
mesentery and mesenteric tumor" is a 9.0 cm in length fragment of bowel having a tan-
pink serosa with a minimal amount of attached adipose tissue. There is a stitch present
marking the proximal aspect. On Opening the bowel averages 4.5 cm in
circumference with the wall averaging 0.5 cm in thickness. The mucosa is

tan, glistening with the usual folds. No mucosal lesions are grossly

identiﬁed. Within the attached mesenteric fat there is a 6.0 x 4.5 x 4.0

cm mass having a tan to pink-red smooth outer surface. The circumferential

margin is inked black. It is sectioned to reveal light-tan ﬁrm nodular

cut surfaces. There are no palpable lymph nodes in the attached adipose

tissue. Representative sections are submitted in ten blocks.

Designation of Sections: lA- proximal bowel margin, lB- distal bowel
margin, lC- random sections bowel, lD-lH- mesenteric mass, ll-lJ-

Source of Tissue: 2. Labeled #2, "fatty tumor of left buttock"

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled "fatty tumor of left buttock" is a 10.0 x 6.5 x
2.5 cm yellow-tan partially encapsulated fragment of adipose tissue. It is covered in part
by a 5.5 x 1.5 cm light-tan skin ellipse. The margins are inked in black, it is

sectioned to reveal yellow-tan glistening lobulated cut surfaces.

Representative sections are submitted in six blocks.

Source of Tissue: 3. Labeled #3, "right tube and ovary"

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled "right tube and ovary" is a 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm
tan ﬁrm ovary. It is covered in part by a 3.5 x 0.5 cm gray-pink fragment of fallopian
tube having a pin-point lumen and one ﬁmbriated end. There are several clear

ﬂuid ﬁlled paratubal cysts, 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. The ovary is

sectioned to reveal tan ﬁrm unremarkable cut surfaces. Representative

sections are submitted in two blocks.

Source Of Tissue: 4. Labeled #4, "left tube and ovary"

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled "left tube and ovary" is a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm
tan ﬁrm ovary. It is covered in part by a 3.0 x 0.5 cm tan-pink fragment of fallopian tube
having a pin-point lumen and one ﬁmbriated end. The ovary is sectioned to reveal

tan ﬁrm unremarkable cut surfaces. Representative sections are submitted

in two blocks.

Source Of Tissue: 5. Labeled #5, "uterus"

Gross Description: Received fresh labeled "uterus" is a 60 gram uterus with attached
cervix. The uterine body is 5.0 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm in greatest dimension being covered by a
tan-pink serosa. The attached cervix is 4.0 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm having a red-purple hyperemic
exocervix with a 0.4 cm patulous 0s. The specimen is bivalved to reveal a

tan glistening endocervix with a minimal amount of mucus. The myometrium

is tan, ﬁrm, 1.5 cm in greatest thickness. It contains a 1.5 cm in

greatest dimension intramural leiomyoma having white-tan whorled bulging

cut surfaces. The uterine cavity is lined by a tan glistening endometrium,
0.3 cm in greatest thickness. Representative sections are submitted in
six blocks.

Designation of Sections: 5A- anterior cervix, SB- posterior cervix, 5C—5D-
anterior endometrium/myometrium, 5E-5F- posterior endometrium/myometrium

Final Diagnosis:

1. Portion of sigmoid colon with associated mesentery and mesenteric
tumor:

- Leiomyosarcoma of mesentery, 6.0 cm grossly, grade II.

- Lymphovascular invasion is not identiﬁed.

- Tumor is present at inked circumferential margin.

- Sigmoid colon and proximal and distal colonic resection margins, no
tumor seen.

- One mesenteric lymph node, no tumor seen (0/1).

pT2bNOMx

Note: Pleomorphic tumor cells are seen in some areas. Mitotic rate is up
to 40 mitoses/ IOHPF focally. No necrosis is identiﬁed.

2. Left buttock tumor, excision:- Consistent with lipoma.

- Overlying skin with no signiﬁcant pathological changes.

3. Right fallopian tube and ovary, salpingo-oophorectomy:

- Fallopian tube with paratubal cysts.

- Ovary with no signiﬁcant pathological changes.

4. Left fallopian tube and ovary, salpingo—oophorectomy:- Ovary with a
benign simple cyst.

- Fallopian tube with no signiﬁcant pathological changes.

5. Uterus, total hysterectomy:- Inactive endometrium.

~ Leiomyoma with hyalinization, 1.5 cm grossly.

— Endometrial stromal nodules, 3 mm and 2 mm microscopically.

- Cervix with squamous metaplasia.

DIAGNOSIS: Sarcoma

KARYOTYPE: Normal female karyotype:

RESULTS: The sarcoma sample was harvested after seventeen days in
culture. The chromosomes from nineteen metaphases were counted and
analyzed, and three of these metaphases were karyotyped by G-banding. The
modal chromosome number was 46, and the cells appeared to have a normal
karyotype. The normal results may reﬂect an overgrth of normal
interstitial ti sane rather than tumor. A preliminary report was given to
