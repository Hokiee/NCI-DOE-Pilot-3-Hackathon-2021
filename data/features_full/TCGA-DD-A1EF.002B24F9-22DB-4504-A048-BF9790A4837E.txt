TISSUE DESCRIPTION:

A1 A. Right Lobe, Liver Routine Biopsy: 2 pieces,
ranging from 2.0 cm in length x 0.1 cm in diameter to 2.2 cm in
length x 0.1 cm in diameter

DIAGNOSIS:
Liver, right lobe, needle biopsy: Mildly active (grade 1 of 3)
steatohepatitis with mild portal and periportal fibrosis (stage
1—2 of 4) (see comment).

DIAGNOSIS COMMENT:

The liver needle biopsy is adequate with more than 15 portal
tracts. Each portal tract contains intact hepatic artery, bile
duct, and portal vein branches. Mild focal lymphocytic
infiltrate is also present in some of the portal tracts. No
interface hepatitis is present. Mild portal and periportal
fibrosis is present on the trichrome and reticulin stains. Liver
parenchyma shows mild to moderate macrovesicular steatosis,
focal hepatocellular ballooning, and mild lymphocytic aggregate.
No hemosiderosis is present on the iron stain. No cytoplasmic
globules are present on the PAS—d stain.

REVISED REPORT (Addendum/Procedure included)
TISSUE DESCRIPTION:
A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8 A9 A10 B1
Portion of left lateral liver (6.2 x 3.8 x 3.5 cm), tissue from
superior margin of liver (1.8 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm).

DIAGNOSIS: -
Liver, left lateral, resection: Grade 3 (of 4) hepatocelfular
carcinoma, forming a single 5.5 x 3.3 x 3.3 cm multinodular
mass. The hepatic capsule is free of tumor. The surgical
margins are free of tumor, the clearance being 0.3 cm
microscopically. Extramural vascular invasion is not
identified. The tumor is partially encapsulated, infiltration
of parenchyma being of the pushing type. The non-neoplastic
liver will be assessed on permanent sections and an addendum
will be issued. Liver, superior margin, re-excision: Negative
for tumor.

ADDENDUM:

Review of the permanent sections of adjacent nonneoplastic liver
demonstrates a mild simple steatosis as manifested by

macrovesicular steatosis present in the zone 3 region.
Scattered clusters of neutrophils are identified and are
consistent with surgical hepatitis. The portal areas
demonstrate a mixed chronic inflammatory cell infiltration that
is relatively nonspecific. The interlobular bile ducts and
intact and show no significant cellular injury. A mild degree
of ductular proliferation is identified and is most likely due
to mass affect of the adjacent hepatocellular carcinoma.
Significant fibrosis is not identified. Please refer to the
accompanying liver biopsy (medical liver biopsy, , for
specific morphologic findings.

Review of the permanent sections of the tumor and adjacent
nonneoplastic liver demonstrate focal venous invasion by the
hepatocellular carcinoma.
