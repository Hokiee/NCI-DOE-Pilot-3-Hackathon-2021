Intraoperative Consultation:
An intraoperative nonsmicroscopic consultation was obtained and interpreted as:

"Called to pickup for frozen section 'right ovary,’ consisting of a 360 gram, 12
x 10 x 7 cm ovary with shiny, smooth lobulated external surface with a 7.5 x 4.5
cm irregular and granular area of apparent rupture with tan soft tumor
projecting through. The ovary is bisected to show a cystic mass with >?5% of

the lumen filled with tan, fleshy, soft tumor. Two areas are sampled as F81.
Tumor taken for tumor bank. Rest for permanents," by I.

F31: Ovary, right, oophorectomy

Histo
The patient is a * with ovarian mass and with widespread
metastatic disease an m1 y e evated CEA. Operative procedure: Exploratory
laparotomy with total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy
and abdominal tumor debulking and omentectomy.

Gross Description
The specimens are received in five formalinufilled containers, each labeled

The first container is labeled "right ovaryr FSl/X." It
contains a previously bisected 360 gram tanwyellow ovarian mass. The mass
measures 12 x 10 x 7 cm. The serosal surface shows numerous bosselations.
Focally, the capsule is ruptured and at this site the tumor is seen projecting
to the exterior. Also identified on the ovarian surface is a possible fallopian
tube measuring 4.5 cm in length and has a luminal diameter of 0.3 cm. The
fallopian tube grossly appears uninvolved. Further sectioning of the ovarian
mass shows a tanwyellow firm tumor mass which is solid in most part, but focally
shows cystic change and the inner surface of the cyst wall shows papillary
tan—white projections. Labeled A1 — possible right fallopian tube; A2 to All —
sections through the right ovarian tumor. - ~~~~~ .
The second container is labeled "left adnexa." It contains portions of
fallopian tube and with attached tan—yellow ovarian mass. The fallopian tube
measures 3.0 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm, and the attached ovarian mass measures 6.0 x 6.5 x
4.0 cm. The mass weighs 60.5 grams. Sections through the fallopian tube show
portions of the serosal surface involved by the tumor, however, the mucosa
appears uninvolved. Part of the ovarian surface appears ragged, while part of
the ovarian surface is smooth and shows multiple tan—yellow papillary
excrescences on the surface. Based on the gross examination, it is not possible
to discern the primary site of the tumor (left ovary vs right ovary). Further
sectioning of the ovary reveals multiple nodular tan—yellow solid and papillary
tumors with focal areas of necrosis. Labeled Bl u sections through the
fallopian tube with the tumor at the serosal aspect; B2 to B8 — random sections
through the ovarian tumor.—
The third container is labeled "bladder." It contains three tanHyellow to
tan—pink fat and soft tissue fragments ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 cm in greatest

dimensions and 5.0 x 5.0 x 2.0 cm in aggregate. Sections show multiple
tan-white to tan—pink nodules consistent with the primary tumor in the ovaries.
Labeled Cl to Cir!

The fourth contai labeled "abdominal tumor and omentum." It contains
multiple tan—yellow to tanﬁpink fatty tissue fragments consistent with portions
of omentum. The fragments range from 4.0 to 10.0 cm in greatest dimensions, and
15.0 x 13.0 x 6.0 cm in aggregate. The largest fragment shows multiple
tan—white nodules that are matted together to form the omental cake. Sections
of the mass show tanwwhite nodular tumor nmsses dissecting into the omental
stroma. Labeled 01 to D4.

The fifth container is labeled "uterus." It contains a uterus and cervix
weighing 165 grams, and measuring 10.0 x 8.0 x 7.0 Cm. The uterus is bivalved
when received. The serosal surface is tan—pink and shows multiple tan—yellow
nodules with consistency and cut surface similar to the lesions noted in both
the ovaries, and is grossly consistent for serosal implants. The serosal
implants range from 0.6 to 4.0 cm in greatest dimensions. The uterus is further
sectioned to show a 2.5 cm unremarkable endocervical canal. The endometrial
cavity measures 3.5 x 2.2 cm. A fundal, calcified intramural leiomyoma is
identified and measures 3.8 cm in greatest dimensions. The endometrial cavity
is unremarkable, and does not show any involvement by the ovarian tumor.
Labeled El ~ posterior cervix with endocervical canal; E2 - posterior lower
uterine segment; E3 — possible posterior endometrium; E4 - myometrium with
adjoining serosal tumor implant; E5 ~ anterior cervix with endocervical canal;
E6 ~ possible anterior lower uterine segment: E7 — possible anterior
endometrium; EB and E9 - sections through the serosal implant invading into the

outer one—third of the miomeiri‘Iii-l iiill— section through the leiomyoma. Jar 2.

SYNOPTIC REPORTING FORM FOR MALIGNANT OVARIAN NEOPLASMS
1. The HISTOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS is:
Serous adenocarcinoma with endometrial areas.
2. The LOCATION(S} OF THE PRIMARY TUMOR(S) iS/are:
Right and left ovaries (synchronous primary tumors}.
3. HISTOLOGIC GRADE (G):
G3—4 {Poorly differentiated or undifferentiated}
4. Tumor IS NOT identified on the ovarian surface(s).
5. Metastatic involvement of the omentum is PRESENT.
6. The maximum dimension of tumor implants outside the true pelvis is:
> 2 cm
7. Regional lymph node metastases CANNOT BE EVALUATED.
8. The total number of regional lymph nodes examined is 0.
10. DETAILED STAGING INFORMATION.

Based on the above information, the PRIMARY TUMOR is
classified as:

TNM Scheme FIGO Scheme Definition
T3c IIIC Macroscopic
peritoneal metastasis beyond
