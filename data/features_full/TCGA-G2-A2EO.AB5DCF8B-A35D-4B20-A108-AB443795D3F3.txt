GROSS DESCRIPTION

   

(A) LEFT VAS — A white-tan portion of vas deferens measuring 5 cm in length x 0.3 cm
in diameter. A lumen is present on the cut surfaces. Specimen is representatively
submitted in A.
(B) LEFT URETER ~ A segment of ureter 0.8 cm long and 0.1 cm in diameter with
surrounding ﬁbroadipose tissue. The resection margin is inked by the surgeon and entire
specimen is submitted for frozen in block B (ink side down, en face).

*FS/DX: BENIGN URETER.
(C) RIGHT VAS — A segment white-tan vas deferens measuring 5.5 cm in length x 0.3
cm in diameter. A pinpoint lumen is visible in the cut surfaces. Specimen is
representatively submitted in C. ‘
(D) RIGHT URETER—~ A segment of ureter (l .0 x 0.7 cm). The margin, designated by
the surgeon with ink, is reinked blue and submitted en face for frozen section in D.

*FS/DX: BENIGN URETER.
(E) BLADDER, PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES — A cystoprostatectomy
measuring overall (14 x 7.5 x 7 cm). The specimen is opened longitudinally through the
superior wall to reveal a fungating tumor (9 x 7 x 2.5 cm) involvingthe near entire
anterior bladder wall and dome. The tumor appears to invade the muscular wall of the
bladder but does not extend into the perivesical adipose tissue.

The remaining bladder mucosa shows hemorrhage, especially in the trigone, and
is other unremarkable.

INK CODE: Black — outer surface of anterior wall.

SECTION CODE: El-E48, bladder with tumor; E49—E57, prostate; E58, E59,
urethra, en face.
(F) RIGHT COMMON ILIAC LYMPH NODES — A single red tan piece of tissue
measuring 2.4 x 1.5 x 1 cm. Three potential lymph nodes are palpated, ranging in size
from 0.4 to 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. No tumor is seen grossly. Specimen is entirely
submitted.

SECTION CODE: Fl, three potential lymph nodes; F2, remainder of specimen.

(G) RIGHT EXTERNAL ILIAC LYMPH NODE — Multiple red tan pieces of adipose
tissue measuring 4.9 x 4 x 1 cm in aggregate. Five possible lymph nodes are found,
ranging in size from 0.5 to 3.7 cm in greatest dimension. No tumor is seen grossly.
Specimen is entirely submitted.

SECTION CODE: Gl, three potential lymph nodes; G2, G3, single lymph node;
G4, G5, single lymph node.
(H) RIGHT OBTURATOR LYMPH NODE — Multiple red tan pieces of adipose tissue
measuring 5 x 2.5 x 2 cm in aggregate. Seven potential lymph nodes are found, ranging
in size from 0.4 to 2.6 cm in greatest dimensions. No tumor is seen grossly.

SECTION CODE: H1, four potential lymph nodes; H2, one potential lymph
node; H3, one potential lymph node; H4, H5, single lymph node, sectioned;
(1) LEFT COMMON ILIAC —~ Received is a 3.5 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm portion of fibroadipose
tissue, which yields multiple possible lymph nodes, ranging from 0.6 cm to 1.5 x 0.8 x
0.6 cm. The lymph nodes are submitted entirely.

SECTION CODE: 11, three lymph nodes; 12, two lymph nodes.

 

 

(J) LEFT EXTERNAL ILIAC — Received is a 5.0 x 4.2 x 1.0 cm portion of ﬁbroadipose
tissue which yields two possible lymph nodes, measuring 2.0 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm and 3.0 x 1.5
x 0.5 cm. Both lymph nodes are submitted entirely.

SECTION CODE: J1, one lymph node; J2, J3, one lymph node, serially
sectioned.
(K) LEFT OBTURATOR - Multiple ﬁbroadipose tissue fragments (6.5 x 4.0 x 1.0 cm).

Eleven possible lymph nodes, ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension are
identiﬁed and are submitted in toto.

SECTION CODE: Kl, four lymph nodes; K2, three lymph nodes; K3, one lymph
node, bisected; K4, one lymph node, bisected; K5, one lymph node, bisected; K6, one
lymph node, bisected.

(L) LEFT URETER FINAL MARGIN — A segment of ureter (1.7 x 0.6 cm). The true
margin. designated by the surgeon with ink, is reinked blue and submitted en face in L.

(M) RIGHT URETER FINAL MARGIN — A segment of ureter (0.8 x 0.8 cm). The
margin, designated by the surgeon with ink, is reinked blue and submitted en face in M.
