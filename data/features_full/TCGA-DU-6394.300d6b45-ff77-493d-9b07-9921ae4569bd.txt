RIGHT FRONTAL LOBE: PROLIFERATIVE

INDEX (MIB ~1) 15 -

 

Operation/Specimen: Right frontal lobe.
Clinical History and Pre-Op Dx: None provided.

GROSS PATHOLOGY: Specimen A, labeled "frontal lobe tumor", is a 3 x 2
x 1.5 cm. gray—brown tissue. A portion of the specimen has been
examined by frozen section and is submitted in cassette 1, remaining
tissue in cassettes 2&3. Frozen section diagnosis: Glioma.

Specimen B, labeled "right frontal lobectomy", is a portion of brain
tissue 4.5 x 3 x 2 cm. multiple sections through the specimen show
no grossly identifiable tumor tissue. Representative sections are
submitted in cassettes 4—9.

MICROSCOPIC: There is a high cellular oligodendroglioma with
scattered

calcification. The tumor diffusely infiltrates the cortex where
prominent neuronal satellitosis and subpial extensions are noted. The
tumor shows moderate subepitheliai nuclear pleomorphism and frequent
mitoses. Endothelial hyperplasia is mild and tumor necrosis is not
seen. Immunohistochemical stain for Ki67 with monoclonal antibody

MIB-
1 reveal that the tumor has a proliferative index of 15—20%.
