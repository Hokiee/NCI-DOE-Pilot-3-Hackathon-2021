Gross Description

Specimen 1. received fresh labeled with the patient's name and "uterus. cervix. bilateral tubes,
bilateral ovaries," is a 109 gram, 12.4 x 9.5 x 4.8 cm specimen including a uterus that was opened for
frozen section measuring 5.2 x 5. 0 x 4.8 cm. right fallopian tube measuring 7.2 x 0.8 cm in diameter.
right ovary measuring 2.0 x 0.9 x 0.9 cm, leﬂ fallopian tube measuring 6.5 x 0.6 cm and left ovary
measuring 2.2 x 1.4 x 0.8 cm. The exocervix (3.6 x 2.2 cm) is covered by a smooth. glistening, white
mucosa. The endocervical canal (3.5 cm in length) has a tan mucosa with multiple (less than 0.1 cm)
white. firm nodules. The endometrial cavity (5.4 cm from cornu-to-cornu. 4.7 cm in length) is carpeted
with a mass of pink-gray tissue on both the anterior and posterior walls, the mass measures up to 1
cm in thickness. It appears to invade the underlying myometrium to a depth of approximately 0.4 cm.
The mass appears to extend to the lower uterine segment. The myomelrium meaSures 1.5 cm in
maximum thickness. The serosa is shiny and glistening without adhesions. The fallopian tubes are
patent and have fimbriated ends. Both tubes appear to have multiple small, ﬁrm cystic structures
adhered to them. Both ovaries have a smooth. white outer surface and multiple corpora albicantia.
The specimen is inked as follows: Black = posterior. blue = anterior. Representative sections are
taken and submitted as follows:

1A ~ cervix, anterior from 12 to 3
18 - cervix, anterior from 9 to 12
1C - posterior cervix. 3 to 6

10 - posterior cen/ix, 6 to 9

Specimen 2, received fresh and labeled 'omentum,‘ consists of a 12.4 x 9.1 x 1.1 cm segment of
yellow-pink. ﬁbroadipose tissue. Sectioning reveals unremarkable yellow adipose tissue.
Representative sections are submitted in four cassettes, labeled 2A - 20.

Specimen 3. received fresh and labeled "right pelvic lymph node,“ are multiple yellow tissue fragments
measuring in aggregate 3.4 x 2.1 x 0.5 cm. Three possible lymph nodes are identiﬁed and submitted

as follows:
3A — one lymph node, bisected
33 - two lymph nodes

Specimen 4, received fresh and labeled “left pelvic lymph node,“ is two pieces of yellow-pink tissue
measuring in aggregate 2.6 x 1.9 x 0.6 cm. The entire specimen is submitted as follows:

4A - one lymph node, bisocted

4B - remaining soft tissue

Microscopic Exam
All sections are examined. Histologic ﬁndings are summarized in Pathologic Diagnosis.

The attending pathologist whose signature appears on this report has reviewed the diagnostic slides
and has edited the gross and/or microscopic portion of the report in rendering the final microscopic
diagnosis. The pathologist has reviewed the diagnostic slides for quality purposes. These slides meet
the required laboratory standards for rendering the final microscopic diagnosis.

This service has been performed in part by a resident/fellow under the direction of a teaching
physician.
