(A) 2 CM, WIDE LOCAL EXCISION MELANOMA, RIGHT UPPER ARM (LONG STITCH-LATERAL,
SHORT STITCH-SUPERIOR) - An 11.5 x 6.0 cm ellipse Of skin and excised to a depth of 1.6 cm).

On the skin surface there is a 6.0x 5.0 x 4.0 cm, polypoid mass. The surface of the mass is
covered gray-tan necrotic material. Grossly, the mass is 1.0 cm from the lateral resection margin, 1.8 cm
from medial resection margin, 3.0 cm from the superior tip, and 4.5 cm from the inferior tip. The cut
surface of the mass shows extensive necrosis with focal areas of black-tan tissue. Grossly, the tumor
invaded the superﬁcial dermis is 0.6 cm from the deep resection margin. No satellite nodules are
identified. The rest of the skin surface is grossly unremarkable.

INK CODE: Blue-medial resection margin; yellow-lateral resection margin; black-deep resection
margin.

SECTION CODE: A1, superior tip; A2, Inferior tip; A3, representative sections from skin superior
to the mass; A4, representative section from the skin inferior to the mass; A5, tumor with closest medial
resection margin and deep resection margin; A6, tumor with closest lateral resection margin and deep
resection margin; A7, A8, tumor with closest deep resection margin; A9-A14, representative sections from
the tumor.

(B) ADDITIONAL MEDIAL MARGIN, SHORT STITCH SUPERIOR, LONG STITCH TRUE MEDIAL
MARGIN ) - A 11.0 x 1.3 cm ellipse of skin excised to a depth of 0.8 cm. The skin is grossly
unremarkable. The true medial margin is inked in blue.

SECTION CODE: B1, superior tip; 32, inferior tip; 83-86, the entire new medial margin, en face,
from superior to inferior.

(C) ADDITIONAL LATERAL MARGIN (LONG STITCH TRUE LATERAL MARGIN, SHORT STITCH
SUPERIOR) - A 11.5 x 1.5 cm ellipse Of skin and excised tO a depth of 0.9 cm. The specimen is grossly
unremarkable. The true lateral margin is inked with blue.

SECTION CODE: C1, superior tip; C2, inferior tip; C3-C7, the entire new lateral margin en face
from superior to inferior. ‘

(D) LEVELS 1, 2 AND 3 AXILLARY CONTENTS, SUTURE APEX - An oriented irregular fragment of
adipose tissue measuring 13.0 x 13.0 x 2.0 cm. The specimen is oriented as suture at apex. The
specimen is serially sectioned and 19 lymph nodes are identified ranging from (0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 to 5.0 x 3.0
x 3.0 cm). The cut surface Of the largest lymph node is slightly firm, dark brown.

SECTION CODE: D1, five lymph nodes; DZ, three lymph nodes; 03, two lymph nodes; 04, one
lymph node bisected; DS, one lymph node bisected; 06, D7, one lymph node bisected; D8, 09, one
lymph node bisected; D10, one lymph node serially sectioned; D11, D12, one lymph node serially
sectioned; D13, D14, one lymph node serially sectioned; D15, one lymph node - apex area marked by the
stitch; D16-D22, largest lymph node serially sectioned.

(E) ADDITIONAL LEVEL 2 - An irregular fragment of adipose tissue measuring 4.0 x 2.0 x 0.4 cm. Three
lymph nodes are identified ranging in size from 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm to 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm.

SECTION CODE: E, three lymph nodes.
