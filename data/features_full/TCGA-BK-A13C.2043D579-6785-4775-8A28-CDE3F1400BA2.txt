SPECIMEN
A. Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries
B. Right pelvic lymph node
C. Left pelvic lymph node
D. Periaortic lymph node

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE~OP DIAGNOSIS: Endometrial cancer.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
A. Received is a container labeled with the patient's
name
medical record number and uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes
and ovaries. The specimen consists of uterus with attached ovaries
and fallopian tubes. The uterus measures 10.5 cm the cervical tip
to the fundus, 7. 5 cm in breath and 5.5 cm in width. The uterus is
bivalved and on sectioning there is a tan cerebriform)firm tumor
involving both anterior and posterior in the'myometrial wall. The
depth of invasion appears to be less than 50% of the myometrial
wall. The lower uterine segment and endocervix are involved by
tumor. The endocervical mucosa is tan smooth and glistening. The
right and left ovaries average 1.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm. Accompany
fallopian tubes average depth and centimeters in length and 0.5 cm
0 in diameter. Representative sections after fixation.

B. Received fresh labeled "right pelvic lymph node" is a

x 4.8 x 1.8 cm aggregate of soft, lobulated, golden yellow .
adipose tissue. A few soft to slightly rubbery tan—pink—gold
tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 3 cm in
greatest
dimension are recovered. The lymphoid tissues are entirely
submitted in five blocks as labeled. RS—5.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Five whole lymph nodes, 2—5 — one bisected
lymph
node per cassette.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
C. Received fresh labeled "left pelvic lymph node" is a 5
x 5 x 2.8 cm aggregate of soft, lobulated, golden yellow
adipose tissue. Several soft to slightly rubbery tan—pink—gold
tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 2.5 cm in
greatest dimension are recovered. The.lymphoid tissues are
entirely
submitted in nine blocks as labeled. RS-9.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 and 2 — Three whole lymph nodes per cassette, 3—5'
- one bisected lymph node per cassette, 6 and 7; 8 and 9 - one

@ bisected node per pair of cassettes (one~half node per cassette —
two nodes in toto represented).

D. Received fresh labeled "periaortic lymph node" is a 4

3.5 x 1.5 cm aggregate of soft, lobulated, golden yellow
adipose tissue. A few soft to slightly rubbery tan—pink-gold
tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 3 cm in

greatest
dimension are recovered. The lymphoid tissues are entirely
submitted in four blocks as labeled. RS—4.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Five whole lymph node, 2-4 - one bisected lymph
node per cassette.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
A. The following template applies to the hysterectomy.

Histologic type: Endometrioid adenocarcinoma
Histologic grade: (2“ ‘Thw“wmm"'”
Myometrial invasion:

0.4 cm depth of invasion

2.4 cm depth of myometrial thickness

17% of myometrial wall

 

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Cervix: Not involved
Primary tumor: TNM lb (FIGO): IB
Margins of resection: Not involved
Vascular invasion: Not identified
Regional lymph nodes (pN): Negative as described below pNO
Distant metastasis (pM): Could not be evaluated by this specimen
(pMX)
Other findings: There is extensive adenomyosis within the
myometrium. The ovaries and fallopian tubes are uninvolved by
carcinoma.

B. The right pelvic lymph nodes demonstrate no evidence
of
metastasis in 14 lymph nodes.
C. The left pelvic lymph nodes demonstrate no evidence of
metastasis in 11 lymph nodes.
D. The periaortic lymph nodes demonstrate no evidence of
metastasis in 5 lymph nodes.

. DIAGNOSIS

A. Uterus, cevix, resection:
No pathologic diagnosis.
Uterus, endomyometrium, hysterectomy:
Endometrioid adenocarcinoma, grade 2, depth of invasion 17%
through myometrial wall. ‘
Ovaries, right and left, resection:
No pathologic diagnosis.
Fallopian tubes, right and left, resection:
No pathologic diagnosis.
B. Right pelvic pelvic lymph nodes, resection: No evidence of
metastasis to 14 lymph nodes (0/14).
C. Pelvic pelvic lymph nodes, resection: No evidence of
metastasis -

DIAGNOSIS

to 11 lymph nodes (O/ll).

D. Periaortic lymph nodes, resection: No evidence of metastasis

to ’ ‘
5 lymph nodes (0/5).
