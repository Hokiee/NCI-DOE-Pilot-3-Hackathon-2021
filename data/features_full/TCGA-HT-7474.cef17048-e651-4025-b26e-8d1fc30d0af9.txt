ADDENDUM DISCUSSION:
The calculated MIB-l labeling index is 2.3% consistent with a low grade
glioma.

ADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS:

1, 2. BRAIN TUMOR, BIOPSY AND RESECTION:
OLIGOASTROCYTOMA (WHO GRADE 11).
- MIB-l LABELING INDEX = 2.3%

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
1, 2. Microscopic examination reveals an infiltrative glioma. The tumor is
composed of a predominant population of cells with oligodendroglial features,
including mildly to moderately pleomorphic round nuclei with perinuclear
halos. Scattered intermixed microgemistocytic forms are also identified. A
second lesser population of cells, most prevalent on the frozen section
material, shows astrocytic features. The astrocytic component consists of
small cells with regular oval nuclei and prominent fibrillary processes, as
observed on the smear material. Overall, the tumor appears moderately
hypercellular and diffusely infiltrates the adjacent brain parenchyma. Neithe
microvascular proliferation nor necrosis are identified. Only a rare mitotic
figure is seen at up to 1 mitoses per 10 high power fields. The histologic
features are consistent with an infiltrating oligoastrocytoma.
