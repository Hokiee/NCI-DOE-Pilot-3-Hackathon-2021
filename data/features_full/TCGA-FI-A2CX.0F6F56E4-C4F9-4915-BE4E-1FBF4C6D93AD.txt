M crosco is es ' lion and Co :

Histologic sections show a very poorly differentiated carcinoma. A small amount of glandular differentiation is present.
The majority OI the tumor is composed of sheets of neoplastic cells with prominent nucleoi. pleomorphism and a high
mitotic rate. An unusual feature is the presence of numerous. osteoctasl-lilre giant cells that have much blender
nuclear morphology than the tumor. NO Iymphvascular space Invasion is identiﬁed. The tumor invades to a depth of 5
mm where the total wall thickness is 15 mm. The lower uterine segment Is free of carcinoma. Thirteen regional lymph
nodes are free of carcinoma.

listens
The patient is an year Old with endometriel carcinoma grade 3. Operative procedure: Leperoecopic assisted
vaginal hysterectomy. pelvic and pert-aortic lymph node dissection.
