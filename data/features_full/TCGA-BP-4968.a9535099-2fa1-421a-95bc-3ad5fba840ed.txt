Gross Description:

1). The specimen is received fresh for frozen diagnosis labeled "right kidney" and consists of a kidney with attached ureter. renat
treeseis and perinephnc lat weighing 395 g in total. The kidney measures 10.5 x 6.4 x 5.5 cm. The attached ureter measures 8.0
cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. The attached renal vein measures 1.0 cm in length and 0.8 cm in diameter. The renal
vessels and ureter margins are grossly unremarkable. An adrenal gland is not identiﬁed. The kidney is inked black and bivalved to
reveal a yellow and hemorrhagic. circumscribed mass which appears to extend into the perinephric fat measuring 5.5 x 2.5 x 2.2
cm. Sections through the remainder of the kidney reveal a pink brown parenchyma. with a well-deﬁned corticomeduilary junction.
The cortex measures 1.0 cm and the calyces appear normal. No lymph nodes are identiﬁed in the perinophric fat. Representative
sections are submitted for TPS and for permanent sections.

Summary of sections:

2). The specimen is received in formalin labeled "portion of right 11th rib". it consists of a segment oi bone with attached soft
tissue measuring 4.8 x 1.3 x 1.1 cm. The specimen is grossly unremarkable. A representative section is submitted.

3). The Specimen is received in formalin tabeied “perinephric fat“. it consists of yetlow fat measuring 3.2 x 3.1 x 0.9 cm.
Representative sections are submitted.

Summary sections:

4). The specimen is received in formalin labeled "hilar lymph nodes". it consists of multiple fragments of pale and tan soft tissue
with attached metallic and piasticclips measuring 2.1 x 1.7 x 0.8 cm in aggregate. The clips are rammed. and the tissue is

entirely submitted.
