A

QWWPPW

 

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (9.7 CM), CONVENTIONAL (CLEAR CELL) TYPE, FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3 OF 4.
(see comment)

TUMOR DOES NOT EXTEND BEYOND GEROTA’S FASCIA.

ALL EXAMINED SURGICAL RESECTION MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR.

NO EVIDENCE OF ANGIOLYMPHATIC INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

NON-NEOPLASTIC KIDNEY SHOWS FOCAL INTERSTITIAL CHRONIC INFLAMMATION.

TNM PATHOLOGIC STAGE = p T2 NX NIX.

TNM HISELOGIC GRADE = G3.

COMMENT:

Although large areas of carcinoma are composed of tumor cells with Fuhrman's nuclear grade 1 and 2, grade 3 areas with
adjacent tumor necrosis are clearly identified.
