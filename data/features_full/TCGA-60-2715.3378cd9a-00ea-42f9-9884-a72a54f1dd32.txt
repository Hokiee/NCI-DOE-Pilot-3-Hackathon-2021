onoss‘ DESCRIPTION:
A. LUNG, LEFT UPPER LOBE WEDGE RESECTION
Received fresh labeled with the patients nam left upper lobe wedge resection”
is a wedge of mottled pink~black~tan lung tissue weighing 28.7 gm. It measures 8.0 x 5.0 X 3.0
cm with the stapled surgical margin inked blue. In the mid portion of the specimen, situated 0.5
cm from the stapled margin, is a area of pucken'ng. This area is inkedCut sections shows There
is a partly anthracotic hemorrhagic ﬁrm mass measuring 1.5 x1 .0): 1.0 The remainder of the lung
parenchyma shows congestion. Multiple sections are submitted in cassettes labelled as
follows:

FSAl: frozen section of mass

A2-A4: remainder of mass including pleural and surgical margins

B. LUNG, LEFT UPPER LOBECTOMY:
Received fresh and labeled with the patients name“ “left upper lobe” is a lobectomy
specimen weighing l 14 gm and measuring 18.5 x 13 x25 cm. The pleural surface is
unremarkable. A shaved sectioned is taken of the bronchial margin. The bronchi are opened and
they are smooth and tan in coloration. The serial cut sections show congestion with no other
identiﬁable tumor focus. Sections are submitted as follows:

FSBl: frozen shaved section of bronchial margin

B2~B4: random sectionsof parenchyma

B5: possible lymph nodes ‘
C. LEVEL 10
Received in formalin and labeled with the patients namew“ c. level 10” 1s a lymph
node measuring 2.0 X 0.9 x 0.5 cm. It IS bisected and the cut surface has- :a variegated pink and
black coloration. Submitted entirely in block Cl.
D. LEVEL 5
Received in formalin and labeled with the patients nameM‘ﬂ. level 5” is a lymph
node measuring 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. Bisected, the cut surface has an anthracotic coloration. '
Submitted entirely in block Dl. '

DIAGNOSIS:
A. LUNG, LEFT UPPER LOBE, WEDGE RESECTION:
— MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA.
- SIZE OFTUMOR—l. 5 X 1.0 CM.
— CONGESTION AND FOCAL EMPHYSEMATOUS CHANGE.
See note
B. LUNG LEFT UPPER LOBECTOMY:
— CONGESTION, FOCAL EMPHYSEMATOUS CHANGE.
- FIVE PERIBRONCHIAL LYMPH NODES —NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/5).
- BRONCHIAL MARGINS OF RESECTION ~ NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
- NEGATIVE FOR RESIDUAL CARCINOMA.

C. LEVEL 10 LYMPH NODE — THREE LYMPH NODBS — NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/3).

D. LEVEL 5 LYMPH NODE:
— ONE LYMPH NODE F- NEGATIVE FOR'TUMOR (0/1).

Note: Patient had previous history of diagnosis of f squamous cell carcinoma of glottic larynx on
-. Immunostain for T’I‘Fl (A3) is negative. It is difﬁcult to say for sure if current lung lesion
is a primary or a metastatic tumor. See also pathology report“.
