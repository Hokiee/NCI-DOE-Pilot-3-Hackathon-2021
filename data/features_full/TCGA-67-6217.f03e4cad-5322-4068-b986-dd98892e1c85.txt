E. The specimen is submitted fresh but not from frozen section as ”left
upper lobe" and is a 114 granlof (formalin fixed), 18 x'll x 2N3 cm lung
lobectomy specimen received with.a stapled bronchial margin measuring 3

cm in diameter and'mnltiple adjacent stapled vasculature margin measuring
0.5 to 2.3 cm in greatest dimension along with two stapled parenchymal
margins measuring 1.7 and 2.6 cm in diameter. The pleural surface is pink
to purple red with focal areas of anthracotic pigmentation along with an
indurated, firm well circumscribed puckered.area. The pleural surface
overlying this area is inked blue. The stapled parenchymal margins are
removed and the underlying parenchyma.is inked black. Sectioning of the
firm puckered area reveal a 2.5 x 2 x 1.4 cm well circumscribed gray to
white firntness which grossly appears to abut the overlying blue inked
pleural surface measuring 0.4 cm from the closest parenchymal resection
margin (black ink) and 0.9 cm from the bronchial margin at the hilum.
remaining parenchyma is tan pink to red.spongy and homogenous showing
focal areas of emphysematous changes. NO other discreet masses or
nodularities are grossly identified. At the hilum are multiple gray black
hilar lymph nodes measuring 0.5 to 1 cm in greatest dimension, each of
which is submitted entirely. Representative sections of the specimen are
submitted, rmltiple (8) as follows:

Staging

Staging is a way of describing a cancer, such as where it is located, if or where it has spread, and if it
is affecting the functions of other organs in the body. Doctors use diagnostic tests to determine the
cancer's stage, so staging may not be complete until all the tests are ﬁnished. Knowing the stage helps
the doctorto decide what kind of treatment is best and can help predict a patient's prognosis (chance
of recovery). There are different stage descriptions for different types of cancers.

There is no standard system for staging thymoma; however, the most commonly used system is called
the Masaoka system. This system was developed in - and it classiﬁes thymoma into the following

stages:

Stage I: The cancer is limited to the thymus and the capsule that surrounds it.

Stage II: The cancer has spread into fat surrounding the thymus or into the lining of the lung next to
the tumor, called the mediastinal pleura.

Stage III: The cancer has spread to other organs that are near the thymus, such as the lung, blood
vessels, and the sac around the heart, called the pericardium.

Stage IVA: The cancer has spread more extensively into the lining of the lung or the sac around the
heart.

Stage IVB: The cancer has spread to organs further away from the thymus, or has spread through the
vessels carrying blood or lymph.

Classiﬁcation

In addition to its stage, thymoma can be classiﬁed into different categories, developed by the -

— {-), based on what the tumor cells look like under a microscope:

 

— Page4of5

Type A thymoma. This is also called spindle cell thymoma or medullar thymoma. The chance of
recovery for people with ty e A th morna is good, with ad survival rate (percentage of
people who survive at least after the cancer is detected, excluding those who die from other

diseases) nea

TypeAB thymoma. Also called mixed thymoma, type AB thymoma is similar to type A thymoma;

however, type AB thymoma has lymphoc tes in the tumor. The chance of recovery for people with
type AB thymoma is also good, with a h survival rate of approximately-“An.

Type B1 thymoma. This is also known as lymphocyte-rich thymoma, lymphocytic thymoma,
predominantly cortical thymoma, and organoid thymoma. This type of thymoma has very many
lymphocytes in the tumor, but the cells of the thymus appear normal. The chance of recovery for
people with type B1 th moma is also good, with a 20~year relative survival rate (percentage of people
who survive at least years after the cancer is detected, excluding those who die from other

diseases) of approximatel

Type B2 thymoma. Type B2 thymoma also has many lymphocytes, like type Bl thymoma; however,
the thymus cells do not appear normal. Type B2 thymoma is also known as cortical thymoma and
polygonal cell th moma. The l—year relative survival rate for people with type B2 thymoma is

approximatcl

Type B3 thymoma. Type B3 thymoma is also known as epithelial thymoma, atypical thymoma,

squamoid thymoma, and well—differentiated thymic carcinoma. This e of thymoma has few
limﬁhocytes, and the thymus cells look abnormal. Th survival rate is approximately

Thymic carcinoma. Thymic carcinoma, previously called type C thymoma, is very rare and more
aggressive. Thymic carcinoma cells do not look like normal thymus cells, but like cancers in other
organs of the body. This type of tumor is often advanced when diagnosed. It is classiﬁed into two
categories: low grade, which has a better chance of recovery, and high grade, which is more likely to
grow and spread quickly. Low-grade thymic carcinoma includes basaloid, mucoepidermoid, and well-
differentiated squamous cell types. High~grade thymic carcinoma includes anaplasticfundifferentiated,
clear cell, poorly differentiated squamous cell, sarcomatoid, and small cell/neuroendocrine t es. The
five~year relative survival rate of people with thymic carcinoma id
rate of people with thymic carcinoma is .%.

Cancer survival statistics should be interpreted with caution. These estimates are based on data from
thousands of cases of this type of cancer in the United States, but the actual risk for a particular
individual may differ. It is not possible to tell a person how long he or she will live with thymoma.
