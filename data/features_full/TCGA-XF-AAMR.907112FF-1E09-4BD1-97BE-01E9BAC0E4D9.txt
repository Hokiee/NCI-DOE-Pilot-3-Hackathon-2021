D: The specimen is received fresh from the 0.R. and labelled "Apical urethral
marginvF/S“. It consists of a 1 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm soft brown—tan tissue fragment.
The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section in cassette DFS.

E: The specimen is received fresh from the O.R. and labelled "Bladder and
prostate". It consists of a prostatectomy specimen with an overall measurement of
34 x 13 x 4.2 cm. The peritoneum measures 28 x 16 x 3 cm. The bladder itself
measures 9 x 9 x 2 cm. The peritoneum is not involved by tumor. Attached to the
bladder is a segment of right ureter that measures 4 cm in length and 2.5 cm in
circumference and a left ureter measuring 3 cm in length and 1 cm in circumference.
The prostate measures 4.7 x 4 x 3.5 cm. The right seminal vesicle measures 2.5 x
1.5 x 0.5 cm and the left seminal vesicle measures 3.5 x 2 x 1 cm. The outer
surface of the specimen is inked black. Opening the specimen anteriorly reveals a
prostatic urethra that measures 3.7 cm in length and 3.6 cm in circumference. The
verumontanum measures 1 x 1.2 x 0.3 cm. The right posterior bladder mucosa, at the
area of the right ureterovesical junction, shows 4 x 4 cm gray~tan ulcerated lesion
with necrotic surface. Sectioning of the ulcerated lesion shows a mass that
invades through the entire wall thickness of the urinary bladder and extends into
the perivesical fat. At the request of the surgeon, an intraoperative pathologic
consultation is performed in order to aid in the care of this patient.
Representative sections are submitted in 26 cassettes.

node that measures up to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension is identified. The specimen
is entirely submitted in two cassettes.

H: The specimen is received in formalin and labelled "Right common iliac L.N.“.

nodes ranging in size from 0.6 to 2.7 cm are identified. The specimen is entirely
submitted in two cassettes.

I: The specimen is received in formalin and labelled “Left common iliac L.N.“.

It consists of a 2 x 2 x 1 cm.aggregate of multiple soft brown-tan fibrofatty
tissue fragments. Three lymph nodes are identified ranging in size from 0.2 to 1.2
cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is entirely submitted in three cassettes.

It consists of a 2 x 2 x 1 cm aggregate of multiple soft yellow-tan fibrofatty
tissue fragments. Six lymph nodes are identified ranging in size from 0.2 to 0.8

tissue fragments. Two lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.4 to 0.6 cm are
identified. The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette.

Q: The specimen is received in formalin and labelled "Pre sacral L.N.". It
consists of a 4 x 2 x 0.5 cm soft brown-tan fibrofatty tissue fragment. Four lymph

nodes are identified ranging in size from 0.3 to 0.6 cm in greatest diameter. The
specimen is entirely submitted in four cassettes.
