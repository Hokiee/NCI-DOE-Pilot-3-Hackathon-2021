GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. RIGHT AXILLARY L.N. DISECTION LEVELS 1,2,3

Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and designated "right axillary lymph
node dissection levels I, ll, lll" is a portion of fibroadipose tissue measuring 16 x 8.4 x 2 cm.
Multiple possible lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm up to 2.5 x 2 x 1.4
cm. One half of the largest lymph node is submitted for tissue procurement. Cassettes are
submitted as follows:

A1: 6 possible lymph nodes
A2: 5 possible lymph nodes
A3: 5 possible lymph nodes
A4: 4 possible lymph nodes
A5: 4 possible lymph nodes
A6: 2 possible lymph nodes
A7: 2 possible lymph nodes
A8: One bisected lymph node
A9: One bisected lymph node
A10: One bisected lymph node
All: One bisected lymph node
A12: One bisected lymph node
A13: One bisected lymph node

A14-A15: Remainder of largest lymph node, entirely submitted

8. WIDE EXCISION RIGHT CHEST WALL MELANOMA

Received fresh with the patient's identification and designated "wide excision right chest wall
melanoma" is a tan-white skin ellipse measuring 7.2 x 3.1 x 1.6 cm. The specimen is oriented
with a stitch at the lateral margin. Examination of the skin surface reveals a tan-pink, irregular,
flat lesion measuring 2.5 x 1.6 cm. Gross picture is taken. The specimen is inked green from
medial to lateral and orange from lateral to medial. The Specimen is serially sectioned from
medial to lateral and submitted in 12 cassettes after submitting a portion of the specimen for
tissue procurement.
