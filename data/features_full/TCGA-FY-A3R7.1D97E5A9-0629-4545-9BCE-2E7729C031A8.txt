Gross Description

A. Received fresh labeled "right lobe of thyroid" is a thyroid
lobe weighing 7 g and measuring 4.5 x 2.4 x 1.5 cm. The specimen
is oriented by two stitches, designated by the requisition form
as "single stitch isthmus, double stitch superior pole." The
entire thyroid lobe is inked blue, and the isthmus is inked
orange (the isthmus is 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm).

Sectioning demonstrates an ill—defined mass with firm, gray areas
and soft, pink areas, measuring 2.0 cm in greatest dimension.

The mass abuts the inked surface of the thyroid. The mass is
located in the inferior portion adjacent to the isthmus.

There are no additional lesions or suspicious areas identified.
The remainder of the specimen consists of dark red normal thyroid
parenchyma.

The specimen is entirely submitted from inferior to superior in

cassettes Al through A8.

B. Received in formalin labeled "left thyroid lobe” is a thyroid
lobe weighing 4 g and measuring 4.0 x 2.0 x 1.4 cm, with a
portion of isthmus measuring 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is
oriented by two sutures, designated by the requisition form and
container label as "single stitch isthmus, double stitch
superior pole."

The thyroid lobe is inked black and the isthmus is inked yellow.
Sectioning demonstrates mostly unremarkable red parenchyma with a
few foci of ill—defined firm, gray—white tissue in the midportion
to inferior third of the specimen, measuring up to 0.6 cm in
greatest dimension.

The specimen is entirely submitted from superior to inferior in
cassettes Bl through BB. The ill—defined gray—white tissue is in
cassettes BB and B4.

C. Received in formalin labeled "right paratracheal nodes level
6" is a portion of fibroadipose tissue containing lymph nodes
measuring 4 x 2 x 0.7 cm in aggregate. The specimen is dissected

for lymph nodes, and there are three lymph nodes identified
ranging from 0.6 to 1.1 cm in greatest dimension.

Cassette summary: Cl two lymph nodes, bisected (one uninked, one
inked blue); C2 one lymph node, bisected; C3 and C4 remaining
fibroadipose tissue, entirely submitted.
