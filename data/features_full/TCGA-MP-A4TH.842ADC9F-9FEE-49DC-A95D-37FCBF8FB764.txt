This final pathology report is based on the_gross macroscopic
examination and the frozen section histologic eva uation of the
specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are
reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes
identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a
revised report.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled "left lower lobe of the lun " is an 8.2 x
2.3 x 1.7 cm lung wedge resection. There is a 2.0 x .5 x 1.2 cm
ill—defined solid mass located 0.5 cm from the stapled mar in. The
mass does not umbilicate the visceral pleura. Representat ve

sections are submitted. Grossed by

B. Received fresh labeled "left upper lobe of lun " is a 4.5 x 1.5 x
1.3 cm lung wed e resection. There is a 1.5 x 1. x 1.5 cm
well-circumscri ed solid mass located 0.3 cm from the stapled
margin. The mass umbilicates the visceral pleura which is inked and
submitgeg perpendicularly. Representative sections are submitted.
