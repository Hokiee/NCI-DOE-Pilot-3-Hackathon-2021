J: S ctions of the ladder show a deeply invasive poorly differentiated urothelial
carcinoma (lell). The tumor extends almost but not completely through the
museularis propria of the bladder wall (J3) where it approaches without involving
the perivesical soft tissue. No associated in situ carcinoma (flat lesion) is seen
around the invaSive tumor or in additional random sections 0! the bladder. All
resection margins are free of both urothelial dysplasia and invasive carcinoma.
