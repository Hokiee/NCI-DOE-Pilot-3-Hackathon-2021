Gross: The specimens are received in six formalin~filled containers labeled with the
patient's name. The first container is additionally labeled "FS' and contains a single
irregularly— shaped fragment of nodular tan~white soft tissue measuring 2.8 x 2.0 x 0.2 cm

in greatest dimension. —

The second container is additionally labeled “X ~ left tube and ovary“ and contains a
previously serially sectioned ovary which, upon reconstruction, conforms to the above stated
dimensions. The ovarian surface is gray—white, lobulated and there is gross evidence of
tumor on the surface of the ovary. 0n cut surface, tumor is tan and multilobulated with
intervening fibrous strands. Densely adherent to the ovarian tumor is a 5,0 cm long x 0.1 cm
densely hemorrhagic and fibrous structure which is gross;y consistent with fallopian tube.
Labeled XA through XG — sections of ovarian tumor; Xh — 5E2tion of possible fallopian tube.

The third container is additionally labeled “omentum” ani contains a 25 x 19 x 4 cm
irregularlywshaped fragment of firm, nodular tan—white tL'sue, grossly consistent with
omentum. The tissue is diffusely and extensively involves by pink—tan tumor. Labeled Al and

The fourth container is additionally labeled "right ovary" and contains numerous pink-white,
friable tumor fragments measuring 10 x 7 x 4 cm. The largest fragment measures 7 x 5 x 5 cm
and

appears to represent an ovary involved by tumor. The serosal surface is irregularly nodular
suggesting tumor involvement. No fallOpian tube can be grossly identified on the surface
of the specimeni The largest fragment is serially sectioned to show lobulated, partially
necrotic tan—white tumor, diffusely involving the entire fragment. Despite extensive
sectioning, a fallopian tube is not identified. Labeled B1 through BE. Jar 2.

The fifth container is additionally labeled ”para—aortic lymph node“ and contains a

single irregularly—shaped fragment of fibroadi ose tissue measuring 1.3 x 0.8 X 0.4 cm in
aggregate. It is submitted in toto. : '

The sixth container is additionally labeled “right iliac lymph node' and contains a lymph
node measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm in maximum dimension. It is submitted in toto. Labeled D.
Jar 0.

Comment: Sections of both the left and right ovaries show a poorly differentiated
adenocarcinoma, most consistent with papillary serous adenocarcinoma. The surfaces of both
ovaries are involved. There is also diffuse omental involvement by tumor. Both the right
iliac and para—aortic lymph nodes show involvement by metastatic adenocarcinoma. Sections
of the adnexal structure attached to the left ovary which were submitted as possible
right fallopian tube showed diffuse involvement by adenocarcinoma. Whether this represents

replacement of the fallopian tube epithelium by tumor, or simply tumor present 0
ovarian surface in the absence of the left fallopian tube, cannot be determined.

The pathologic stage assigned here should be regarded as
provisional, and may change after integration of clinical
data not provided with this specimen.
History: The patient is a — with a left ovarian mass. Operative procedure:
Left salpingo—oophorectomy and omentectomy.

An intraoperative non—microscopic consultation was obtained and interpreted as: “Called

to 0.R. to pickup left ovary and tube consisting of 8.5 x 7 x 4.0 cm adnexa which is
tan—yellow, multilobulated and nodular with irregular surface. The cut surface shows
intervening soft, fibrous strands. Section frozen as FS is small cystic area containing
clear, serous fluid. The fallopian tube is 5.0 cm long and 1.0 cm in maximum diameter. It is
serially sectioned to show that it is grossly unremarkable,“
