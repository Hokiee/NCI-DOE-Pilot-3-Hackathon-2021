Clinical History:

The patient is a —year—old man with clinical T4a N3 M0 left

Received are six appropriately labeled containers.

Container A is additionally labeled "left radical neck and skin"

lobulated mass with approximately 10% central necrosis. The mass
grossly abuts the 4.7 cm long x 0.7 cm in diameter internal
jugular vein and is adherent to the 3.9 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm

muscle, 0.7 cm from the mass is a 3.5 x 3.0 x 0.1 cm brown skin
with a central 0.7 cm in depth tract. The tract is surrounded by
orange/yellow discoloration. Inferior to the sternocleidomastoid

muscle is a 5.5 x 4.7 x 1.0 cm soft tissue segment with
multiple lymph node candidates. The mass is consistent with
level 2 and the remainder of the specimen would be divided into
levels 3 and 4 and dissected for lymph node candidates, of which
multiple are identified up to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension.

Inking: Mass is inked green.

Specimen fixation: Formalin

Type of specimen: Left composite glossectomy, pharyngectomy, and
palate resection

Size of specimen: 6.6 cm (medial/lateral) x 5.9 cm
(anterior/posterior) x 1.9 cm (depth)

Laterality: Left

Orientation of specimen: There is a short suture medial tongue,
long suture anterior floor of mouth, and the sutures will be
designated as follows: long suture/anterior floor of mouth 12

o‘clock, short suture medial tongue 3 o'clock, 12 to 3 o'clock
margin/yellow, 3 to 6 o‘clock margin/blue, 6 to 9 o‘clock
margin/red, 9 to 12 o'clock margin/green, and deep margin/black.

Tumor size: Tumor size is 4.7 x 3.2 x 1.0 cm (depth)

Tumor description: Irregular shaped, centrally ulcerated, firm
gray/white mass with well—defined lobulated borders. The tumor
is endophytic.
