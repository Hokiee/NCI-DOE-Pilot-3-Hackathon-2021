Gross Descriptlgn;

A. Received fresh is a segment of tan yellow ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 4.5 x 3 x 1 cm. Examination of the speCImen
includes multiple lymph nodes. Cassettes are submitted as follows:
18.2 One lymph node. bisected per cassette submitted for frozen
3 Four possible lymph nodes.

8. Received fresh Is a segment of tan yellow ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm. The specimen i bisected and
submitted in one cassette for frozen.

C. Received fresh is a segment of tan yellow ﬁbroadipose tissue measuring 6 x 4 x 1 cm. Examination of the sppcimen
reveals four possible lymph nodes. Cassettes are submitted as follows:
1&2 Largest lymph node bisected. submitted in toto in two cassattes for frozen

3 One lymph node in toto submitted for frozen
4&5 Two possible lymph nodes submitted in toto

0. Received in formalin is a segment of tan yellow fibroadipose tissue measuring 5.5 x 4 x 1 cm. No lymph nodJs are
identiﬁed. Representative sections of fibroadipose tissue submitted in one cassette.

17 x 9 cm. The nipple-areolar complex measures 5.5 cm and it appears unremarkable. The specimen Is ori nted with one
stitch-superior. two stitches-medial. Resection margins are inked black. On serial section. there is a tan-whi
deﬁned lesion with inﬁltrative borders present at the lower outer quadrant. at approximately 5 o'clock positi n. This lesion

 

 

measures 1.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm. It is located 0.2 cm from the medial margin (closest), 2.5 cm deep margin. 3 cm om inferior
margin, 8 cm from superior margin. 15 cm from lateral margin and 6 cm from nipple. A metal clip is identiﬁ within the
lesion. No other lesions are grossly identiﬁed. No lymph nodes are present within the main specimen. Cass ties are

submitted as follows:

present. The nipple areolar complex is unremarkable. On serial sections, no lesions or suspicious areas are grossly

identiﬁed. The breast parenchyma has a fat to
stroma ratio of 70:30. Representative sections are submitted as follows:
