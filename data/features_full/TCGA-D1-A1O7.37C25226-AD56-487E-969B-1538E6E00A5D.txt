DIAGNOSIS:

Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and

bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: FIGO grade 1 (of 3)
endometrial

adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, is identified forming a
mass (2.8

x 1.5 x 0.9 cm), involving the fundus. The tumor invades
0.1 cm

into the myometrium (total wall thickness 2.0 cm). The
tumor does

not involve the endocervix. Lymphovascular space invasion
is not

identified. The margins are negative for tumor. There
are multiple

(2 subserosal, each 0.1 cm in greatest dimension; 5
intramural,

ranging in size from 0.4 cm to 0.7 cm in greatest
dimension)

leiomyomata in the myometrium. The bilateral ovaries and
fallopian

tubes are not involved. The fallopian tubes show mild
hydrosalpinx

(right, 2.8 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm; left, 2.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm).

With available surgical material [AJCC pTla] (7th edition,
2010).

This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic

examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation
of the

specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent
sections are

reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive
changes

identified on permanent section review will be reflected
in a

revised report.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled "uterus, left and right
fallopian tubes

and ovaries" is a 95.0 gram uterus with attached bilateral
fallopian

tubes and ovaries. The uterine serosa is smooth. There
is a 2.8 x

1.5 x 0.9 cm polypoid mass in the fundus of the
endometrial cavity

grossly invading 0.1 cm — 0.2 cm. The myometrial
thickness is 2.0

cm. There are multiple (2 subserosal, each 0.1 cm in
greatest

dimension; 5 intramural, ranging in size from 0.4 cm to
0.7 cm in

greatest dimension) leiomyomata in the myometrium. There
is a 1.7 x

1.4 x 1.1 cm right ovary with a nodular outer surface and
a solid

cut surface with a 7.3 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm right fallopian tube

which has
hydrosalpinx (2.8 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm). There is a 1.6 x 1.1 x a
0.9 cm
left ovary with a nodular outer surface and a solid cut
surface with
an 8.3 x 1.2 X 1.2 cm left fallopian tube which has
