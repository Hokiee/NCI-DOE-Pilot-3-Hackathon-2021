Staff Pathologist

Comment

Immunohistochemistry is performed and the tumor is diffusely positive with
AEl/AE3. Immunohistochemical stains performed on the biopsy

showed diffuse staining for p53 and p16, and no staining for ER, in keeping
with the above diagnosis.

Pertinent Clinical Information
A -year—old with endometrial carcinoma/post menopausal bleeding.

Gross Description

Specimen Material: A. Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries. B.
Right pelvic lymph node. C. Right periaortic lymph node. D. Left pelvic
lymph node. E. Dense paracaval tissue. F. Left paraaortic lymph node. G.
Left external iliac lymph node.

The case is received in seven parts labeled with the patient's name
, medical record number and given accession number
and it is accompanied by a requisition form labeled with the same
name and accession number.

Part A. Received in formalin labeled "UTERUS, CERVIX, BILATERAL TUBES AND
OVARIES," is a 242 gram uterus (10 x 9 x 7 cm), cervix (2.5 x 2.5 cm), right
adnexa (4 x 2.5 x 0.4 cm), and left adnexa (4 x 2 x 0.4 cm).

The external surface of the uterus is tan-pink smooth and glistening. The
uterus is bivalved to reveal a tan-pink endometrial cavity (6 x 4 x 1 cm)
that is distorted by a calcified submucosal leiomyoma (6.0 x 6.0 x 4.0 cm).
The endometrium displays a tan—yellow, exophytic tumor which is present on
the anterior (3 x 2 x 2 cm) and posterior surface (4 x 3 x 2 cm) with no
gross extension to the cervix. The tumor invades greater than 50% of the
myometrial thickness and comes to within 0.3 cm of the serosa on the
posterior aSpect. The uninvolved myometrium is tan—pink and trabeculated
with a thickness ranging from 1.8 to 2.0 cm. Within the myometrium of the
posterior lower uterine segment, there is another calcified leiomyoma
measuring 1.5 cm as well as additional intramural leiomyomas less than 1 cm.
Tumor is submitted for tissue banking.

The right adnexa is comprised of an unremarkable ovary (2.5 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm)
and fallopian tube (4 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter) with multiple small
paratubal cysts.

The left adnexa is comprised of an unremarkable ovary (2 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm) and
fallopian tube (4 cm in length x 0.4 cm in diameter) with a single 1cm
paratubal cyst.

Part B. Received in formalin labeled “RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE," and
consists of a 6 x 5.7 x 1.9 cm aggregate of tan—yellow fibrofatty tissue
which is palpated to reveal five possible lymph nodes ranging from 1 to 2 cm
in greatest dimension. The larger lymph nodes are bisected to reveal a
tan—pink to tan—white and hemorrhagic variegated cut surface. The lymph
nodes are submitted in their entirety as follows:

B1 B4 one lymph node bisected in each

BS one whole lymph node

Part C. Received in formalin labeled "PERIAORTIC'LYMPH NODES, RIGHT,“ and
consists of a 4 x 2.6 x 1.7 cm aggregate of fibrofatty tissue which is
palpated to reveal a 4.5 x l x 0.6 cm tan—pink possible lymph node which is
serially sectioned to reveal a tan—white smooth cut surface. The lymph node

is submitted in its entirety in cassette C1—C3.

Part D. Received in formalin labeled "PELVIC LYMPH NODE LEFT," and consists
of a 5.7 x 5.5 x 1.7 cm aggregate of tan-yellow fibrofatty tissue which is
palpated to reveal four possible lymph nodes that range from 0.9 to 4.2 cm
in greatest dimension. The larger lymph nodes are serially sectioned to
reveal a tan—pink to red smooth cut surface. Five possible lymph nodes are
identified in the fibrofatty tissues. The lymph nodes are submitted in their
entirety as follows:

D1 one lymph node, trisected

D2 one lymph node, bisected

D3 4 one lymph node, serially sectioned

D5 two possible whole lymph nodes

Part E. Received in formalin labeled "DENSE PARACAVAL TISSUE," and consists
of a 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm tan—pink irregular soft tissue which is submitted in
its entirety in cassette E.

Part F. Received in formalin labeled "LEFT PARAAORTIC LYMPH NODE," and
consists of a 2.7 x 2.1 x 0.7 cm aggregate of tan—yellow fibrofatty tissue
which is palpated to reveal one possible lymph node that measures 0.7 cm in
greatest dimension. The specimen is submitted in tis entirety as follows:

Part G. Received in formalin labeled "LEFT EXTERNAL ILIAC LYMPH NODE," and
consists of a 1.8 x 1 x 0.8 cm ovoid portion of tan—pink soft tissue
consistent with lymphoid tissue. .The specimen is bisected to reveal a
tan-white to red, smooth cut surface. The specimen is submitted in its
entirety in cassette Gl.
