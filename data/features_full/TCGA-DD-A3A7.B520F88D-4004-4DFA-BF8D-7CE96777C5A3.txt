DlAGNOSlS:

Liver, Segments 1, ll, Ill and IV, resection: Grade 3 (0M) hepatocellular carcinoma,
usual type, forming a single 18.5 x 18 x 11 cm mass. The tumor is located in
Segments I, ll, Ill and IV. The tumor invades into but not through hepatic capsule.
The tumor closely approaches the surgical margin (less than 1 mm) which
microscopically is uninvolved. Vascular invasion is identiﬁed, involving hepatic
veins microscopically. The tumor is not encapsulated. The

approximate percent of tumor necrosis is 30%. The non neoplastic liver will be
assessed on permanent sections and an addendum will be issued.

Lymph node, left portal, excision: A single benign lymph node is identiﬁed.

Gallbladder, cholecystectomy: Chronic cholecystitis and cholelithiasis, a single
pigment

stone (0.4 cm). An adenomyoma (1.0 cm) is identiﬁed. Multiple (3) cystic duct
lymph nodes

are negative for tumor.

ADDENDUM:

The normal liver shows a mild nonspecific chronic inﬂammatory inﬁltrate in the
portal tracts

but is otherwise unremarkable. Special stains show minimal amounts of hepatic
iron of
doubtful clinical signiﬁcance. A PAS-D is unremarkable. (Seen with Doctor ,
