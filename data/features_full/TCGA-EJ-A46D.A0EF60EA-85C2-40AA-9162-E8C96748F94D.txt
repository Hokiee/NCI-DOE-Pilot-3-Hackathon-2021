PART 1: PROSTATE. RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY —
A. INVASIVE, POORLY DIFFERENTIATED PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA. GLEASON SCORE 3 + 5 = 8.
B. GLEASON PATTERN 5 ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 5% OF THE TOTAL TUMOR VOLUME. IN
ADDITION GLEASON PATTERN 4 IS ALSO SEEN AND ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 25% OF THE
TOTAL TUMOR VOLUME.
THE TUMOR INVOLVES BOTH THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT LOBES OF THE PROSTATE AND CONSTITUTES
APPROXIMATELY 5% OF THE TOTAL PROSTATE VOLUME EVALUATED.
THE TUMOR MEASURES 1.5 CM IN GREATEST NODULAR DIMENSION.
THE TUMOR IS CONFINED WITHIN THE CAPSULE OF THE PROSTATE.
