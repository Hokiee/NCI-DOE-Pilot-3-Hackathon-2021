COMMENT

In specimen D, two foci of invasive tumor are present invoTVing the floor of
the mouth. These foci of invasive tumor are 5.0 cm and 4.0 cm in greatest
dimension. Tumor focaTTy extends to the fToor of mouth and left posterior
pharyngeal waTI mucosaT/soft tissue margins; however, additionaT tissue from
these areas has been submitted as specimens G and H which do not contain
tumor. Thus, the finaT margins of resection are free of tumor.

The portion of bone is pending decaTCification- The results wiTl foTTow in a
supp emental report.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
(A) LEFT MENTAL NERVE (STITCH = TRUE MARGIN) — The specimen consists of a
strand of pink—tan soft tissue {0.8 cm in Tength and 0.2 cm in greatest
diameter) with a stitch marking the true surgical margin. Black ink is
applied to the true surgi gin and the entire specimen is submitted en
face for frozen section.

*FS/DX: SEGMENT OF NERVE, NO TUMOR PRESENT. SE
(B) RIGHT MENTAL NERVE (RULE OUT PERINEURAL INVA , TCH OLD MARGIN) —

Single segment of nerve (0.7 cm in length and 0.1 cm in diameter). The true

margin is marked with bTack in he specimen is submitted entirely in B
for frozen section diagnosis.

*FS/DX: SEGMENT OF NERVE, TUMOR PRESENT. F
(C) TEETH — Five teeth ranging in size from 2.1 o . cm in greatest

dimension. Four of the teeth are n den caries and evidence of
repair. The speCimen is returned to .
(D A portio

LEFT SEGMENTAL MANDIBULECTOMY — ndible (from Teft ramus
to right mid mandible), 18.0 X 7.0 x 4.0 cm, attached level I right neck
dissection (5.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm), and attached fToor of mouth and left
pharyngeaT waTT (7.0 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm).

In the center of the floor of mouth is a white gTistening tumor (4.0 x 3.0
x 2.5 cm). It grossTy extends to within 0.5 cm of the deep margin and CTOSeTy

approaches the mucosal margin. There is aseparate satellite mass in the left
arynneal tissue (5. 0 x 3. 0 x 2. 0 cm) that grossly extends to the left

latera pharyngeal mucosal margins. In the eft right level I neck
dissection, two possible lymph nodes are palpated (2. O x 2. O x 1.0 cm and 1.0
X 1.0 x 0.5 cm), both of w ich appear to be involved by metastatic tumor. The
satellite nodule in the left pharyngeal tissue extends into the surrounding
muscle and tendon.

INK CODE: Blue - deep margin of tumor.

SECTION CODE: (D1—D17 for frozen; D1— D16 en face). D1, anterior alveolar
ridge right side; D2, mid alveolar ridge; D3, left side alveolar ridge; D4—D7,
left pharyn eal margin; D8- D9, posterior left pharyngeal margin; D10— D13,
posterior floor of mouth; D14— D16, right floor of mouth; D17 perpendicular
deep margin; D18— D22, main tumor mass; D23— D26, satellite tumor mass; D27,

D28, larger lymph node from right level 1; D29, D30, smaller lymph node from
right side neck level 1; D31, possible gland. The specimen is sent to
bone lab and sectioning of mandible.

(E) CONTENTS, LEFT MAXILLARY INTERIM — One piece of tan, mucoid mucosal
tissue (1 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm) submitted entirely in cassette E.
(F) ADDITIONAL DEEP MARGIN, STITCH TRUE DEEP MARGIN - One p1€Ce 0
fibromuscular connective tissue (4 x 3 x 0.3 cm) with a stitch at one edge of
the specimen. No masses are palpated within the soft tissue.

INK CODE: Blue=true marg1n.

SECTION CODE. F1— F3, entire margin en face.
(G) NEW MAXILLARY MARGIN (INKED TRUE MARGIN, STITCH SUPERIOR) - The spec1men
consists of a piece of mucosal tissue (4. O x 1.0 x 0.5 cm). There is a stitch
at one end.

INK CODE: Blue — true margin; yellow - supeior edge of each piece.
