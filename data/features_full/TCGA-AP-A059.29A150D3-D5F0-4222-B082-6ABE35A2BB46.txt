DIAGNOSIS: W
1) UTERUS CERVIX, FALLOPIAN TUBES AND OVARIES, RIGHT AND LEFT; 6/}4/1‘
TOTAL HYSTERECTOMY BILATERAL SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOKY:

- ADENOCARCINOMA OF ENDOMETRIUM, ENDOMETRIOID TYPE, FIGO GRADE III (>
50% SOLID GROWTH), NUCLEAR GRADE 2 TO NUCLEAR GRADE 3 (SEE NOTE).

ri - THE TUMOR INVADES TO <= HALF OF MYOMETRIUM.
f? - THE MAXIMAL THICKNESS OF MYOMETRIAL INVASION IS 3 MM.
- THE THICKNESS OF THE MYOMETRIUM IN THE AREA OF MAXIMAL TUMOR INVASION
IS 25 MM.

- NO ENDOCERVICAL INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

- NO DEFINITE VASCULAR INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

- THE “DOMETRIU'M SHOWS THE FOLLOWING ABNORMALITY: COMPLEX HYPERPLASIA
WITH ATYPIA.

- THE MYOEETRIUM’ SHOWS THE FOLLOWING ABNORMALITIES: ADENOMYOSIS,
LEIOMYOMA( S) .

- ALL ADNEXA ARE UNREMARKABLE.

NOTE: PARTS OF THE TUMOR ARE UNDIFFERENTIATED AND RESEMBLE SO-CALLED
LYMPHOEPITHELIOMA LIKE CARCINO . WE WILL PERFORM IMMUNOSTAINS FOR DNA
MISMATC'H REPAIR PROTEINS BECAUSE EXTENSIVE LYMPHOCYTE INFILTRATION AND
UNDIPPERENTIATED MORPHOLOGY HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN PATIENTS WITH
MICROSATELLITE INSTABILITY-HIGH ENDOMETRIAL CANCERS THAT ARISE IN THE
SETTING OF PROMOTER HYPERMETHYLATION.

2) LYMPH NODE, LEFT EXTERNAL ILIAC, EXCISION:
- ONE BENIGN LYMPH NODE (0/1).

3) LYMPH NODES. LEFT HYPOGASTRIC, EXCISION:
- TWO BENIGN LYMPH NODES (0/2).

4) LYMPH NODES, LEFT OBTURATOR, EXCISION:
- THREE BENIGN LYMPH NODES (0/3).

5) LY'MPH NOD35, RIGHT EXTERNAL ILIAC. Excxsxon:
- FOUR BENIGN mea NODES (0/4) .

6) LYMPH NODES, RIGHT OBTURATOR, EXCISION:
- THREE BENIGN LYMPH NODES (0/3).

7) LYMPH NODE. LEFT PARA-AORTIC, EXCISION:
- ONE BENIGN LYMPH NODE (0/1).

8) LYMPH NODES, RIGHT PARA—AORTIC, EXCISION:
- FIVE BENIGN LYMPH NODES (0/5).

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL). AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
