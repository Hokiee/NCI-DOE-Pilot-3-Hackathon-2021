DIAGNOSIS
(A) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND:

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (5.0 CM MAXIMUM DIMENSION), CONVENTIONAL TYPE
(20%CLEAR CELLS, 80%

EOSINOPHILIC CELLS), FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 3, CONFINED TO THE
KIDNEY. (SEE COMMENT)
Renal adenoma (0.1 cm maximum dimension)

Renal cortical cyst.

Margins of resection, free of tumor.

Adrenal gland, no tumor present.

COMMENT

The renal cell carcinoma in the left kidney is composed mainly of
eosinophilic cells. Tumor does not invade into the perinephric adipose
tissue, renal sinus or the renal vein.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND - A radical nephrectomy specimen
(24.0 x 13.0 x 8.0 cm) including the left kidney (11.5 x 5.5 x 4.5 cm),

a segment of renal artery, the renal vein and ureter (1 .0 cm in length

and 0.3 cm in average diameter) and adrenal gland (5.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm).

There is a 5.0 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm well-circumscribed tumor in the mid
portion of the kidney. The tumor is red-yellow with extensive areas of
hemorrhage and necrosis, which are present predominantly in the center
of the tumor. The tumor is conﬁned to the kidney and grossly does not
appear to invade into the perinephric adipose tissue. The tumor is
close to but does not invade renal sinus or the renal vein.

A multiloculated cyst (2.0 cm in diameter), filled with clear fluid
is present in the upper pole of the kidney. The pelvicalyceal system is
smooth and devoid of any lesions.

No lymph nodes are grossly identiﬁed in the hilum of the kidney.
Serial cross-sections of the left adrenal gland shows unremarkable
cortex and medulla.

A portion of the tumor have been submitted for possible electron
microscopy.

SECTION CODE: A1, ureter, renal artery and vein margin; A2-A9,
tumor with perinephric fat/kidney/renal sinus/closest soft tissue
margin; A10-A12, representative sections of the cyst in the upper pole;
A13, A14, representative sections of normal kidney parenchyma; A15,
representative sections of adrenal gland. -

CLINICAL HISTORY

Left renal mass.
