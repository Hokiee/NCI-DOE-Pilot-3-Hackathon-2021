C. LEFT BREAST WIDE LOCAL EXClSlON NEEDLE LOCALIZATION:

Received in fresh state is a specimen labeled with patient's name and identiﬁcation number as above
and specimen labeled as "wide local excision left breast needle localization". The specimen consists of
a resected portion of predominantly fatty breast tissue weighing 122 grams and measures 12.0 x 7.5 x
3.0 cm. Attached portion of skin along the anterior aspect measures 5.0 x 2.2 cm. and skin surface
grossly shows no identiﬁable ulceration. . There is a needle localization wire in place and included
radiogram of the specimen indicating the area of density. The margins of the specimen are oriented with
sutures, one suture and one clip-anterior, two sutures and two clips-lateral, three clips and three
sutures-superior. The margins of the specimen are color coded as follows: red-superior, orange-
inferior, blue-anterior, green-lateral. yellow-medial and black-posterior. On serial cut sections, along the

specimen shows a predominantly fatty breast tissue with occasional narrow strands of ﬁbrous stroma
There is no other identiﬁable tumor focus. Multiple sections are submitted in cassettes labelled as
follows:

C1 through C10: full section of the tumor with margins

C16: includes sections from the inferior/lateral margin
017-018: one en block section

The lymph node is submitted entirely in cassette D1.

E. SUPERIOR MRGIN:

Received labeled with patient name and designated as "superior margin" consists of a 4.7 x 3.0 x 1.0
cm. and weighing 15 grams segment of breast parenchyma. It is oriented with one suture marking true
superior margin. The margin is inked. It is serially sectioned and the cross surface shows multiple focal

white areas alternating with yellow breast parenchyma. No discrete is identiﬁed. The specimen is
submitted entirely in 8 cassettes:

E1-E8: sequentially submitted.
F. SENTlNEL NODE #4
Received fresh is a piece of fatty tissue measuring 3 x 2 x 0.5 cm. One lymph node is identiﬁed
measuring 1.2 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. A touch prep is performed and touch prep diagnosis is given. The lymph
node is submitted entirely in cassette F1.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. SENTlNEL NODE #1, LEFT AXILLA:
- ONE LYMPH NODE —- NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/1).
E. SENTlNEL NODE #2. LEFT AXILLA:
- ONE LYMPH NODE — NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/1).
C. LEFT BREAST, NEEDLE LOCALIZATION WIDE LOCAL EXCISION:
- INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, SBR GRADE 2.
- SIZE OF TUMOR: 1.5 x 1.5 x1.0 CM.
— INVOLUTIONAL CHANGE WITH FOCAL CYSTIC APOCRINE CHANGE -
-MARGINS OF RESECTION -NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
D. SENTlNEL LYMPH NODE #3, LEFT AXILLA:
- ONE LYMPH NODE - NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (Ol1).
E.. SUPERIOR MARGIN, LEFT BREAST:
- PREDOMINANTLY FATTY BREAST TISSUE - NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.
F. SENTlNEL LYMPH NODE #4:
- ONE LYMPH NODE - NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR (0/1).

SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST, ER/PR RESULTS
Specimens Involved
Specimens: C: WLE LEFT BREAST NEEDLE LOCALIZATION

Specimen: Surgical Excision
Block Number:

 

ER: Positive Allred Score: 8 = Proportion Score 5 + Intensity Score 3
PR: Positive Allred Score: 6 = Proportion Score 4 + Intensity Score 2

 

COMMENT:

The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the
proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of
cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60°/o of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak
intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring
range from 0 to 8.

ER/PR positive is deﬁned as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is deﬁned as an Allred score
of less than or equal to 2.

METHODOLOGY:

Tissue was ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours.
lmmunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 105, 1:100) and PR (PGR
136, 1:100) provided by ’ following the manufacturer 5 instructions. This
assay was not modiﬁed. interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published
results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal
review of staining performance.

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left Breast Cancer.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION:

TPA/T PB: No carcinoma identiﬁed. Diagnosis called to Dr. at ‘- ,Part A), Part B), by
Dr.

TPD: Sentinel lymph node number 3 no carcinoma identiﬁed called by Dr. related Dr. at

TPF: Lymph node left axillary sentinel excision: No carcinoma identiﬁed called by Dr. to Or. at

provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-
house known HER2 ampliﬁed control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well
preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identiﬁed for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2
immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided
by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance.

This assay has been validated according to the 2007 joint recommendations and guidelines from
ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. Department takes full
responsibility for this test's performance.
