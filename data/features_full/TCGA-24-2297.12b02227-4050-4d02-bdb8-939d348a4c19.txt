Gross Description;

The specimens are received in twelve Containers of formalin, each
labelled with the patient's name. The first container is
additionally labelled “omentum.” It contains two irregular sheets
of well—vascularized fibrofatty tissue. The first measures 8 x 6
x 2.5 cm and exhibits a shiny, gray—tan, unilocular cyst measuring
2.5 cm in greatest dimension. The cyst wall is focally solid.
this area being consistent with metastatic tumor. The second
piece of tissue measures 23 x ll x 1.5 cm in greatest dimension
and exhibits a Single focus consistent with metastatic tumor. This
focus is glistening. tan and solid and neasures l x 6.5 x 0.4 cm.
Labelled A, a cyst wall with solid area consistent with tumor; B,
probable tubal nodule in larger piece of tissue.

The second container is additionally labelled “left tube/ovary,”
and contains an adnexal structure measuring 6.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm in
greatest dimension. The fallopian tube measures 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.9
cm and exhibits a tan convoluted. shiny surface. Arising from one
pole of the ovary is an irregular lobulated mass measuring 4 x 2.3
x 2.1 cm in greatest dimension. This wees is covered by a shiny
purple-tan membrane and on cut section, reveals solid lobules of
tan villiform tissue. The fallOpian tube measures 5 cm in length
x 0.5 Cm in average diameter. Multiple unilocular paratubal
cysts, ranging in size from 0.2 cm to 1 cm, are present at the
distal end of the tube. The largest cyst exhibits a roughened and
wrinkled lining. Tube—Ovarian adhesions are present. Labelled
L01, ovary with tumor arising from it: L02, tumor mass;

fallopian tube with largest noted paratubal cyst.

The third container is additionally labelled 'F51,' and contains

an irregular yellow glistenin Era nt of tissue measuring 1 x

The fourth container is additionally labelled ”right adnexal tumor
mass,‘ and contains a wrinkled, thickened sheet of tissue which
measures 14 x 7.5 x 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. One surface is
light tan and exhibits cerebroform foldsr adherent fibrous strands
and focal light tan papillary excrescences. The opposite surface
is purple—gray and ragged with adherent bits of fibrofatty tissue.
Cut section reveals the sheet of tissue to be composed of layered.
shiny white and glistening tan fibrooonnective tissue. A focal
area is expanded to 1.3 cm in maximal thickness and exhibits
lobules of tan. solid villiform tumor. This region measures 2.5 x
~2 cm. Two irregular, rubbery fragments of purple—gray

fibroconnective tissue are also received. These measure 3.5 x 1.3

x 0.4 cm and 5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. Neither identifiable ovary
or fallopian tube is identified. expanded area wit

The fifth container is additionally labelled “right cul~de—sac
biopsy.” Three irregular fragments of yellow and tan tissue,
which together measure 2.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm in greatest dimension.

the tissue is variably white, shiny and rubbery and soft and fatty

and D.

The sixth container is additionally labelled "small bowel
proximal," and contains a 7.5 cm in length x 2.5 cm in diameter
segment of small bowel with attached mesenteric tissue, measuring
7 x 2 cm. A ten, shiny tumor nodule measuring 1.5 x 1.5 cm in
area is present 2 cm from one end of the specimen. The tumor
nodule surrounds and invades the bowel wall transmurally. The
remaining bowel is unremarkable with the serosa being smooth. tan
and shiny and the mucoea being tan, glistening and plicated. The
specimen is unoriented. Labelled E, bowel with tumor; F, margin
of resect'ﬂrest tumor; G, margin of resection farthest from.

 

tumor.

The seventh container is additionally labelled “small bowel." and
contains a 19 cm in length x 2 cm in diameter segment of small
bowel with attached mesentery. measuring 19 x 2.5 cm. The serosal
surface is smooth. shiny and tan and exhibits four tumor nodules
arising at the mesenteric aSpect of the bowel. These range in
size from 1.9 x 2 cm to 1.2 x 0.3 cm. The largest nodule exhibits
transmural invasion with ulceration of the small bowel mucosa .
being identified. The remaining nodules appear to invade
maximally to the submucosa. The margins of excision measure 2 cm
and 1 cm from tumor mass. The uninvolved bowel exhibits
unreserkable tan. glistening. plicated mucosa. Labelled H, tumor
nodule with probable transmural invasion: I. resection margin
measurinﬂfrom tumor: J, resection margin measuring 1 cm from
tumor.

The eighth container is additionally labelled "nesenteric tumor
mass," and contains an irregular shaggy mass of pink—tan tissue
measuring 2.5 x 2 x 1 cm. Cut section reveals solid areas of
white-tan tumor surrounding central areas of necrosis. Labelled
K. Jar 1.

The ninth container is labelled "portion transverse colon" and
contains a 15 cm in length x 5 cm in circumference segment of
large bowel and attached pericolonic fat. At one end. the
pericolonic fat is firm and roughened and exhibits, what appear to
be, blackened cautery works. This area measures 7 x 4 cm. The
bowel wall in this region is thickened and firm. Cut section
reveals a poorly defined white—tan tumor mass which replaces the
muscularis propria and invades the subnmcosa. The nmcosa
overlying this region is largely unremarkable, being red—tan,
glistening and folded. However, one focus of ulceration measuring
0.2 cm in diameter is present in the mucosa overlying the
described tumor. The described tumor mass appears to extend into
the lamina propria underlying the ulcerated region. The described
tumor mass appears to extend to within <0.3 cm of one resection
margin. It extends to within 7 cm of the opposite resection
margin. Further lesions are not apparent. Occasional lymph nodes
are found. One lymph node appears grossly involved with tumor.
Labelled L, section through apparent mucosal ulceration; M, full
thickness sections of bowel with tumor; N. lymph nodes; 0.

creased, semicircular piece of tan. hairless skin with underlying
Subcutaneous tissue. The specimen measures 1.6 x 0.9 cm in area x
0.2 cm in depth. NO gross lesions are appreciated. Labelled R.
