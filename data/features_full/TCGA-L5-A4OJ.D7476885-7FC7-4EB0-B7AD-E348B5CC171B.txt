1. ”Distal esophagus and proximal stomach.“ Received in formalin in a large /u/
container is a previously opened 10.6 cm segment of distal esophagus and 9/1),
proximal stoinach. Both margins are stapled. The attached perigastric fat is /V/
focally hemorrhagic. The. adVentitia and serosa ere unremarkable. The

adventitis is inked green in the proximal segment and the distal esophagus is

inked black. No ink is applied to the gastric across. The segment is 6.9 cm

esophagus and 2.6 cm gastric. The esophagogastric junction is diffusely

granular and red-tan. The granular nucosa extends up to 3 cm above the £6

junction. The proximal esophageal moose has two firm lesions. The smaller is

1.2 x 0. 8 cm. Its cut surface is gray-tan, homogenous and the maxim

thickness is a. 9 cm. This nodular mass extends into the submcosa and focally

involves the muswlar Hall No penetration to the adventitie is readily seen.

This nodular mass is 2.2 cm from the proximal margin. The larger mass is 1.9 K

1.6 x 1.1 cm, red-brown and within 0.6 cm of the proximal margin. Its cut

surface is pink-tan, centrally hyperemic and glistening. ?enetration to the

emcee“ is seen uith no extension to the muscular Hall or adventitie. The

gastric mucosa is unremarkable, and there is no evidence of the granular

nuccse at the EB junction penetrating into the underlying soft tissue. Lynph

node candidates from the perigastric fat are retrieved up to 0. 9 cm.

TA'B. Smaller mass and granular esophageal mimosa.

1C-D. Larger mass with granular mucosa.

2. ”Cervical esophageal margin.“ Received in formalin in a small container is
a 0.5 cm segment of esophagus that is stapled at one margin ard open at the
opposing margin. The adventitia and unease are unremarkable.

2A. Cervical esophageal margin.
