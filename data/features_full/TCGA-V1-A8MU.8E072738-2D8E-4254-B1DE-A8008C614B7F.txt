COMMENT:

The left posterior apical margin specimen submitted for frozen section (part B) contains a focus of
glandular epithelium with complex architecture, but without an lnfiltrative appearance.
Immunohistochemical stains for p63 and HMWK were obtained on this specimen and the focus in
question is negative for basal cells. These results support our interpretation that this focus represents
prostatlc adenocarcinoma.

In addition, cauterized glands highly suspicious for adenocarcinoma are present at the inked, cauterized
apical margin of the main specimen (slides J1 and J2). lmmunohistochemlcal stains for p63 and HMWK
were obtained on block 12 in order to evaluate these glands. The glands in question are negative for
basal cells, supporting the interpretation of these foci as adenocarcinoma and our interpretation that
this represents tumor at the inked, cauterized margin. Of note, the separately submitted anterior apical
margin (part G) and posterior apical margin (part H) are negative for carcinoma. Correlation with
operative ﬁndings is required in order to determine the final margin status.

Clinical Historv

The patient is Wman. Review of electronic medical records 2 indicates
that the patient has iopsy-proven prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason grade 3+4 in the right
mid-gland, right base, left apex, left mid-gland and left base ' ’ .. The patient now
undergoes a robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomT"

Gross Description
The specimen is received in ten parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number.
Parts A, B, and J are received fresh. The remainder of the parts are received in formalin.

Part A, additionally labeled "right posterior base - frozen section," consists of an irregular, unoriented,
red-tan soft tissue fragment (1 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm). The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section
diagnosis 1, and subsequently submitted in cassette A1. i

Part B, additionally labeled "left posterior apex margin - F5," consists of a piece of Irregular, unoriented,
red-tan soft tissue (0.8 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm). The entire specimen is frozen for frozen section diagnosis 2,
and subsequently submitted in cassette Bl. _J

Part C, additionally labeled “right external illac lymph nodes," consists of a single Irregular, unoriented,
yellow-tan fibrofatty tissue fragment (4.5 x 2.5 x 0.7 cm). Examination reveals two ovoid, firm,
light-tan lymph node candidates (both approximately 1.3 cm) which are bisected and entirely submitted
in cassette C1. . . \

Part D, additionally labeled "right obturator lymph nodes,‘ consists of multiple. soft to firm, irregular,
yellow-tan, fibrofatty tissue fragments (4 x 3 x 1 cm in aggregate). Examination reveals three firm,
irregular, light-tan lymph node candidates (1.3 cm - 1.7 cm) which are submitted as follows:

01: One lymph node candidate, bisected.
DZ: One lymph node candidate, bisected.
DB: One lymph node candidate, bisected.

Part E, additionally labeled "left external lilac lymph node," consists of multiple soft to ﬁrm, irregular,
yellow-tan fibrofatty tissue fragments (3.5 x 3 x 1 cm in aggregate). Examination reveals four firm,
light-tan lymph node candidates (0.5 cm - 1.7 cm), which are submitted as follows:

E1: One lymph node candidate, bisected.
52: One lymph node candidate, bisected.
E3: Two lymph node candidates, intact. . \

Part F, additionally labeled “left obturator lymph nodes,“ consists of multiple soft to ﬁrm, irregular,
yellow-tan fibrofatty tissue fragments (4 x 4 x 1 cm in aggregate). Careful examination reveals eight
irregular, ﬁrm, tan, unoriented lymph node candidates (0.4 cm - 1.7 cm), which are submitted as

is submitted in cassette 11.

Part J, additionally labeled "prostate and bilateral seminal vesicles," consists of a single intact radical
prostatectomy specimen with attached seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundles (53.5 gm; 3.8 cm from
apex to base x 4.5 cm in width x 3.6 cm from anterior to posterior.

GROSS PATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: There is a large, irregular, poorly deﬁned, lobular, white-tan mass (2
x 1.5 x 0.8 cm) in the right posterior mid gland through base (slices 5-7, cassettes J7 and J8). A
second solid, white, well-circumscribed, ovoid nodule (0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm) is noted in the left posterior
apex through mid gland (slices 3-5, cassettes J9 and J10). The remaining parenchyma is light-tan and
unremarkable. The central-transitional zone is of normal size and composed predominantly of striated,
ﬁbrous tissue. No other discrete masses or lesions are noted. The anterior fibrous stroma is open, and
the remaining capsule is intact. The seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundles (both measure approximately
5 x 3 x 1 cm) are soft, red-tan, whorled without discrete lesion or mass.
