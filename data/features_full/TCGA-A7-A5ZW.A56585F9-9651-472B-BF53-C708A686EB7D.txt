Invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 2; 1.7 cm (pTlc)

Ductal carcinoma in situ, cribriform type, nuclear grade 2
Resection margins negative for invasive and in situ carcinoma
Unremarkable skin

Final Surgical Pathology Report

B. Right axillary sentinel lymph node, excisional biopsy:
Metastatic ductal carcinoma, 7 mm size with extranodal extension
(snlea)

Microscopic Description:
Microscopic examination performed.
A. Microscopic examination of the right breast lumpectomy specimen is
summarized in the template below:
Invasive Carcinoma:
Histologic type: Invasive ductal carcinoma
Histologic grade: 2
Overall grade:
Architectural score: 2
Nuclear score: 2
Mitotic score: 2

Greatest dimension (pT): 1.7 CM (pTlc)

Specimen margins: Negative for carcinoma. Closest margin is
superior where tumor is 5 mm from the margin.

Vessel invasion: Not identified

Calcification: Present

Ductal carcinoma in situ:
Histologic pattern: -Cribriform
Nuclear grade: 2
Central Necrosis: Absent
% DCIS of total tumor (if mixed): Approximately 10%
Extensive intraductal component (present/absent): Absent
Specimen margins: Negative for DCIS
Calcification: Focally present

Description of non~tumorous breast: Fibrosis, apocrine metaplasia,
microcysts and ordinary ductal hyperplasia and adenosis.

Comments: Core biopsy site changes are present. The tumor areas of
slightly higher grade than the original core biopsy interpretation due
to more mitotic activity. The skin is histologically unremarkable with
no extension of tumor into the skin ellipse.

Prognostic markers: Performed on the prior core biopsy

B. Microscopic examination of the sentinel node involve the evaluation
of 3 H&E—stained sections of each of the 3 tissue blocks. Metastatic
ductal carcinoma is identified in blocks 1 and 2 and extranodal tumor
is identified in block 1. The size of the tumor is 7 mm ( l

Specimen
A. Right breast segments
B. Right sentinel lymph node axilla (hot/blue 812)

Clinical Information
Breast cancer

Gross Description

A. Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled "right
breast segment" is a 9.3 x 8.7 x 4.3 cm yellow lobular fatty tissue
fragment showing gross evidence of blue ink staining. The specimen is

received in a transpect container and is partially covered with a 5.7 X

1.3 cm brown—tan wrinkled skin ellipse. The specimen has a double
suture designating anterior and a single suture designating lateral.
The specimen is inked as follows: The margins are inked as follows
based upon the orienting sutures: superior — orange; anterior — blue;
posterior - black; inferior — green. The specimen is serially
sectioned from medial to lateral. The specimen shows a yellow white,
fibrofatty cut surface with a 1.7 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm ill circumscribed
white tan firm lesion which comes within 0.5 cm of the superior margin,
1.5 cm of the inferior margin, within 2 cm of the skin, greater than 5
cm of the posterior margin and greater than 2.5 cm of the medial and
lateral margins. The lesion is stellate and shows white rice—like
pellets, grossly consistent with previous biopsy site. No additional
gross lesions are identified. The specimen is received in pathology at
and fixed in formalin at . Representative sections of
the specimen are submitted as follows: 1 — representative medial
margin, 2 - representative lateral margin, 3 - representative section
of the deep/ posterior margin, 4 - 10 — representative sections of
tumor to closest margin and skin. RS 10.
B. Received fresh and subsequently fixed in formalin labeled "right
sentinel node" is a 2.4 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm blue stained pink yellow
irregular rubbery tissue fragment. The specimen is trisected to show an
irregular white firm central focus measuring 0.7 cm in greatest
dimension. AS— 3.
