#1 excision, portion of 6th right rib
#2 biopsy, middle lobe peribronchial lymph node
#3 right lower lobe

#4 excisional biopsy, lymph node #8

#5 excisional biopsy, lymph node #4

FROZEN SECTION DIAGNOSIS:

F82: negative for metastatic disease

FS3A: free of tumor ‘

FSBB: tumor from right lower lobe; poorly differentiated non small _
cell carcinoma. tumor and normal lung tissue submitted to tissue bank

GROSS DESCRIPTION: .

#1 Received in formalin is a single 1.7X2.2X1.Scm. portion of grossly
unremarkable rib and attached dense connective tissue and skeletal
muscle. Representatives submitted in one cassette after
decalcification.

#2 Received fresh is a single l.8x1.0x0.7cm. encapsuled mass of
mottled brown and black soft tissue. Externally unremarkable; out
section reveals anthracosis, but is otherwise unrevealing. Bisected
and submitted in toto in one cassette; portion sent frozen submitted
as F82. '

'#3 Received unfixed is a 15X10x80m. right lower lung lobe. The

visceral pleural aspect over the convexity of the lobe displays
diffuse erythema and focal frank subpleural hemorrhage within the
_postero-medial portion of the lobe. Beneath this area a large firm
mass is palpated. Examination of the hilar aspect reveals similar
discoloration around the hilum itself to a radius of 3cm. The hilum
is otherwise grossly unremarkable. Serial thin sections through the
lobe in horizontal plane reveal a 5.5x5.0x4.2cm. lobulated, well
circumscribed mottled yellow white and black firm mass. This mass
occupies a subhilar position within the central portion of the lobe.
This tumor encroaches to within 0.20m. of the visceral pleura near the
posterior reflection of the lobe and to within 0.5cm. of the lobar
hilum itself. The lobar main bronchus displays an endobronchial
component. The distal portions of the postero-inferior segments of
the lobe display marked bronchial mucous plugging and atelectasis. No

 

 

.5) LYMPH NODE #4: ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGA

 

other intraparenchymal lesions are noted.

Representatives are submitted as follows:

FSBA and B-portions sent frozen

3A-true margins, bronchial and pulmonary vascular

3B—additional bronchial margin (see FSSA) and parenchymal margins

BC to 3F—tumor and hilum .
3G—distal lung parenchyma, postero-inferior segment

3H-gross unremarkable lung tissue

31 to 3K-peribronchial and hilar lymph nodes (matted lymph nodes)

#4 Received in formalin is a single 1.5X0.7x0.7cm. oval encapsulated
mass of yellow tan and black soft tissue. Externally unremarkable;
cut section reveals a single eccentric 0.8x0.5x0.5cm. oval white
cystic mass. Bisected and submitted in toto in one cassette.

#5 Received in formalin is a single 0.4x0.3x0.3cm. oval encapsulated
mass and brown soft tissue and attached fibroadipose measuring
0.7x0.5x0.4cm. overall. Externally unremarkable; cut section is
unrevealing. Bisected and submitted in toto in one cassette;

Total number of blocks: 18

DIAGNOSIS:

2) MIDDLE LOBE, BRONCHIAL NODE: ANTHRACOSIS (NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR)

3) LOWER LOBE 0F RIGHT LUNG, RESECTION: MODERATELY TO POORLY
DIFFERENTIATED SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA OF LOWER LOBE OF RIGHT
LUNG WITH METASTASIS TO PERIBRONCHIAL LAND HILAR LYMPH NODES
(BRONCHIAL MARGIN- NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR)

4)‘LYMPH NODE #8: POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA

 

In #3 tumor shows areas of necrosis, slide 3C—there is
transition from benign to neoplastic squamous epithelium. Prominent
invasion seen in #31. Remainder of lung parenchyma shows congestion
with no evidence of pneumonia process.
