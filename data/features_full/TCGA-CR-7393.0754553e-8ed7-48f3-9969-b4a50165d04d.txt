GROSS DESCRIPTION:
1) SOURCE: Dorsal Tongue Mucosal Margin

Received on a towel with a requisition containing the patient's name and
clinical information is a 7.5 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm strip of pink-tan tissue. The
surgeon has inked one of the specimen tips in blue and has designated this
as the anterior portion. The posterior portion has been inked in yellow,

the middle portion inked in black, and the specimen has been bisected and
submitted for frozen section in its entirety.

Summary of sections: lAFSC, 2/1.

2) SOURCE: Anterior Tongue Mucosal Margin

"Anterior tongue mucosal margin" is received fresh on a towel along with a

requisition containing the patient's name and clinical information and
consists of a 2.0 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm strip of pink-tan tissue. The surgeon has
inked one of the specimen tips in blue and has indicated this as the
superior portion. The specimen is submitted in its entirety for frozen
section evaluation as follows.

Summary of sections: 2AFSC, 1/1.

3) SOURCE: Floor of Mouth Mucosal Margin

Received fresh on a towel along with a requisition containing the patient's
name and clinical information is a 4.8 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm portion of pink-tan
tissue. One tip of the specimen has been inked in blue by the surgeon, who
has designated this as the anterior portion. The posterior tip has been
inked in yellow, the middle has been inked in black and the specimen has
been bisected and submitted for frozen section evaluation in its entirety

as follows.

Summary of sections: 3AFSC, 2/1.

4) SOURCE: Posterior Tongue Mucosal Margin

Received fresh on a towel along with a requisition form containing the
patient's name and clinical information is a 1.5 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm strip of
pink-tan tissue. The surgeon has inked one tip of the specimen in blue and
has designated this as the superior portion. The specimen has been
submitted in its entirety for frozen section evaluation as follows.
Summary of sections: 4AFSC, 1/1.

5) SOURCE: Junction Anterior Tongue and Tongue Base

Received fresh on a towel along with a requisition form indicating the
patient's name and clinical information is a 0.9 x 0.4 x 0.3 portion of
pink-red, unoriented tissue. The specimen has been submitted in its
entirety for frozen section evaluation as follows.

Summary of sections: 5AFSC, 1/1

6) SOURCE: Right Lateral Tongue Dorsum

Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and "right
lateral tongue dorsal" is a single fragment of pink-tan soft tissue which
measures 5.0 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. The surgeon has designated the following
orientation: "long stitch anterior; short stitch inferior margin (not a

true margin." There is a smooth, shiny mucosal surface with multiple
papillae on the superior surface of the specimen. There is a pearly,
white-tan nodule present on this mucosal surface, which measures
approximately 2.0 cm from the anterior margin, 2.0 cm from the posterior
margin and 1.5 cm from the medial margin and appears to be in direct
contact with the lateral margin of the specimen. Using the surgeon's
orientation, the specimen has been inked in the following manner: anterior
resection margin = orange, posterior = yellow, lateral = purple, medial =
blue and deep = black. The specimen is serially sectioned from anterior to
posterior to reveal a firm, tan-brown nodule which appears to extend
approximately 0.4 cm in depth and appears to come within approximately 1.0
cm of the deep surface. Sections are submitted for evaluation as follows.
Summary of sections: 6A, anterior and posterior tips, 2/1; 6B-6F, remainder

of specimen from anterior to posterior, 6B, 2/ 1; 6C, 2/ 1; 6D, 2/ 1; 6E, 2/ 1;
6F, 3/ 1.

7) SOURCE: Right Lateral Tongue Floor of Mouth

Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and "right
lateral tongue ﬂoor of mouth" is a single fragment of pink-red, soft

tissue which measures 4.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm. There are sutures present on the
specimen, which the surgeon has designated in the following manner: "long
stitch anterior; short stitch superior margin (not a true margin)." Using

the surgeon's orientation, the specimen has been inked in the following
manner: anterior = orange, posterior = yellow, lateral = purple, medial =
blue, superior = green, and deep = black. The surface of the specimen is
red-tan, smooth and focally cauterized. There are no nodules or other
lesions apparent on the surface of the specimen. The specimen is serially
sectioned from anterior to posterior to reveal an area of firmness abutting
the right margin in the anterior portion of the specimen which measures
approximately 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is submitted in
its entirety from anterior to posterior as follows.

Summary of sections: 7A, anterior tips serially sectioned, M/1; 7B, 1/ 1;
7C, 1/1 and includes firm area; 7D, 2/ 1; 7E, 21; 7F, 1/ 1; 7G, posterior
tips serially sectioned, M/ 1.

8) SOURCE: Right Neck Level 1

Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and "right
neck level 1" is a single fragment of pink-tan, fibrofatty tissue which
measures 10.5 x 4.5 x 2.5 cm. The specimen appears to consist of a portion
of submandibular gland which measures 4.5 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm, as well as an
attached fragment of fibrofatty tissue measuring 4.5 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm. A
thorough lymph node dissection is performed on the attached fragment of
fibrofatty tissue to reveal multiple candidate lymph nodes, the largest of
which measures 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are
submitted for evaluation as follows.

Summary of sections: 8A, 8B, candidate lymph nodes, M/ 1, each; 8C,
representative sections of fibrofatty tissue, 2/ 1; 8D, largest candidate
lymph node bisected and representative section of submandibular gland, 4/ 1;
8E, representative sections of submandibular glands, 3/ 1.

9) SOURCE: Right Neck Level 2

Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and "right

neck level 2" is a single fragment of pink-tan fibrofatty tissue which
measures 7.0 x 5.5 x 1.0 cm. A thorough lymph node dissection is performed
which reveals multiple candidate lymph nodes, the largest of which measures
approximately 1.9 cm in greatest dimension.

Summary of sections: 9A-9F, candidate lymph nodes, M/1; 9G, largest
candidate lymph nodes bisected, 2/ 1.

10) SOURCE: Right Neck Level 3
Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name and "level 3

right neck" is a single fragment of pink-tan, fibrofatty tissue which
measures 5.0 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm. A thorough lymph node dissection is performed

which reveals multiple candidate lymph nodes, the largest of which measures
approximately 1.6 cm in greatest dimension.
