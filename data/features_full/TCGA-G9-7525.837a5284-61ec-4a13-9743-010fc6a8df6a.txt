GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. PROSTATE
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identification and designated "prostate" is an intact
prostatectomy specimen weighing 59 g and measuring 5.5 cm from right to left, 4.4 cm from anterior to
posterior, and 4.2 cm from apex to base. The capsule is smooth and red. Ink code: Apex-red, anterior-
orange, posterior-black, base-blue, right lateral-green, left lateral-yellow. The apex and base are
removed from the specimen to yield a new weight of 40g. The specimen is serially sectioned from apex
to base to reveal a yellow-tan ill-defined mass in the left lateral portion of the specimen, 2.2 x 1.8 x 1.5

Tss-

cm approaching the at distance of 0.2 cm. The right and left seminal vesicles, 2.3 x 1.4 x 0.3, and 2.4 x
1.2 x 0.3 cm, respectively, are bisected to show beige tan cystic tissue. The right and left vas deferens,
3 x 0.5, and 3.1 x 0.4 cm, respectively, are serially sectioned to show firm tan tube structure. A portion
of the specimen is submitted for tissue procurement, the remainder entirely submitted:
A1 -A2: Right Apex

A3-A4: Left apex

A5: Level I, right anterior

A6: Level I, right posterior

A7: Level I, left anterior

A8: Level I, left posterior

A9-A11: Level II, capsule, right side

A12-A15: Level II, capsule, left side

A16-A17: Right lateral base

A19-A21: Right base

A22: Right base with proximal urethral margin

A23: Left base with proximal urethral margin

A24-A26: Left base

A27-A28: Left lateral base

A29: Representative section (s) right seminal vesicle, right vas deferens

A30: Representative section (s) left seminal vesicle, left vas deferens

B. RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODES

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and designated "right pelvic lymph nodes" is

a fragment of fibroadipose tissue measuring 7.4 x18 x 0.3 CM. Two possible lymph nodes identified
measuring 1.8 by a 0.9 x 0.3 cm in aggregate. Cassettes are submitted as follows:

B1: 2 lymph nodes

B2-B3: Remainder of the specimen

C. LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES

Received in formalin labeled with the patient's identification and designated "left pelvic lymph nodes"
are multiple fragments of fibroadipose tissue measuring 4.3 x 3 x 0.6 cm in aggregate. Two possible
lymph nodes identified measuring 2.1 x 2 x 0.4 cm in aggregate. Cassettes are submitted as follows:
Ct: 2 possible lymph nodes

C2: Remainder of the specimen

CLINICAL HISTORY:
None given
