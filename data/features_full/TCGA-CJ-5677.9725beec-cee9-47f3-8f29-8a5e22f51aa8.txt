DIAGNOSIS
(A) RIGHT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL, RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY:

KIDNEY:
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CLEAR CELL TYPE, FUHRMAN GRADE IV/IV.
TUMOR SIZE: 6.5 X 6.5 X 2.3 CM.
TUMOR INVADES INTO PERINEPHRIC FATTY TISSUE AND APPROACHES TO WITHIN
<0.1 MM OF THE INKED SOFT TISSUE RESECTION MARGIN.
TUMOR INVADES RENAL SINUS FAT.
VASCULAR/LYMPHATIC INVASION BY TUMOR IS PRESENT.

Renal artery segment, unremarkable.
Renal vein resection margin, free of tumor.
Ureter segment, unremarkable.

Adrenal gland, no tumor present.

(B) GALLBLADDER, CHOLECYSTECTOMY:
Cholelithiasis.
Mild chronic cholecystitis.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) RIGHT KIDNEY - A nephrectomy specimen (18.0 x 7.0 x 4.0 cm) includes: the tumor-distorted right kidney (14.0 x 6.0 x 2.2
cm), segment of unremarkable renal artery, renal vein segment, unremarkable ureter segment (9.0 cm in length and 0.5 cm in
average diameter), and unremarkable adrenal gland (5.0 x 1.8 x 0.4 cm).

There is a 6.5 x 6.5 x 2.3 cm well circumscribed tumor in the upper pole of the kidney. The tumor is predominantly yellow
with pink areas and about 60-70% random areas of necrosis. The tumor appears to invade the perinephric adipose tissue but do
not extend to the Gerota’s fascia. The adjacent kidney parenchyma is unremarkable..

INK CODE:

Black: Gerota’s fascia.
SECTION CODE:
A01, ureter, renal vein and renal artery margin;
A02-A05, mass with Gerota’s fascia (inked black);
A06-A08, mass with adrenal gland;
A09,A10, mass with normal portion of the kidney;
A11-A14, mass;
A15, A16, normal kidney, representative sections.
[NOTE: Portions of the tumor have been submitted for electron microscopy (from formalin in glutaraldehyde) and research
protocols.]
(B) GALLBLADDER - An intact gallbladder measuring 11.0 cm in length and 6.5 cm in maximum circumference. The bile is dark
green. The mucosa is pink-green. The wall of the gallbladder is 0.2 cm in thickness. Multiple irregular small yellow-green
gallstones measuring 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm, the largest one.
SECTION CODE:
B1 , cyst duct;
B2, representative sections of the gallbladder. -

CLINICAL HISTORY

Right renal mass.
