(C) BILATERAL NECK CONTENTS ~One pink—red fibrous tissue (16.5 x 10.5 x 1.5 cm) and was oriented into left portion, right
portion and inferior portion. In the right portion there are multiple lymph nodes. ranging from 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm to 2.4 x 2.0 x
1.5 cm. Multiple lymph nodes consist cystic cut surface with tan, light yellow, clear fluid. In left portion, there are three tan—gray
lymph nodes, ranging from 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm to 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. In inferior portion multiple lymph nodes are identified
ranging from 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm to (3.5 x 1.8 x10 cm. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted.

SECTION CODE: Left portion lymph node; C1, three possible lymph nodes; right portion lymph node from C2-C18;
Cit—05, four possible lymph nodes, each; C6-C8, one lymph node each; C9, C10, one lymph node, serially sectioned; 011. C12,
one lymph node, serially sectioned; C13, C14, one lymph node, serially sectioned; 015, C16, one lymph node, serially
sectioned; CIT, C18, one lymph node, serially sectioned.

Inferior portion from 019-026; 019, 020, four possible lymph nodes each; 021, two possible lymph nodes; 022, two
possible lymph nodes; 023, one possible lymph node; 024, C25, one lymph node, serially sectioned; C26, one possible lymph
node.

(D) Blue I :KAL TOTAL THYROIDECTOMY, BILATERAL PARATRACHEAL DISSECTION - A total thyroidectomy with
attached adipose tissue (9.0 x 0.5 x 2.0 cm). A 4.5 x 3.5 x 0.2 cm portion of skeletal muscle fibers is attached to the right
anterior lobe of the thyroid. Thyroid overall 8.5 x 5.5 x 2.0 cm, Right lobe, 6.0 x 2.6 x 2.5 cm, and left lobe 5.5 x 2.1 x 1.5 cm.
The right upper pole of the thyroid feels nodular with a (4.0 x 2.2 x 1.8 cm) solid and cystic mass in the right upper pole. The
aining thyroid is grossly unremarkable. Dissection of the attached adipose tissue yields twelve possible lymph nodes

glng in size from 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1 to 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm. Representative tissue is submitted.

SECTION CODE: 01-03, representative sections of normal left lobe of thyroid, submitted superior to inferior; D4,
isthmus; DS-DS, mass submitted sequentially from superior to interior, right upper pole; 010, right mid pole, grossly normal
thyroid; D11, one lymph node, serially sectioned; D12, one lymph node, serially sectioned; 013. one lymph node, bisected; 014,
one lymph node bisected; D15, four possible lymph nodes; D18, four possible lymph nodes.

(E) RIGHT SUPERIOR PARATRACHEAL CONTENTS - A piece of ﬁbroadipose tissue (2.5 x 2.0 x 0.5 cm) containing a lymph
node (1.8 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm).

SECTION CODE; El, one lymph node; E2, remaining adipose tissue (Specimen entirely submitted).

(F) ADDITIONAL RIGHT PARATRACHEAL CONTENTS ~ A piece of fibroadipose tissue (2.0 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm) containing
multiple lymph nodes (0.2 to 1.1 cm in maximum dimension).

SECTION CODE: F1, two possible lymph nodes; F2, one possible lymph node, bisected; F3, one lymph node.
