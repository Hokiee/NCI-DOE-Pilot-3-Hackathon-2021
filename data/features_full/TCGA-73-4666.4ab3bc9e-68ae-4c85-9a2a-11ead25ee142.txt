Received ﬁ‘esh are two anthracotic soft tissue fragment, 0.7 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm and 0.3 x 0.1 by less
than 0.1—cm. Submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis in cassette FSD.

.,
B. RIGHT UPPER LOBE
Received fresh 16.0 x 14.0 x 3.00m.The pleural surface is gray purple and remarkable for a

palpable nodule. This area is inked Black. A gray white discolored area is also noted on the
pleural surface 3.4 x 2.0 cm. The bronchial margin is shaved and submitted in FSE. The
specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a gray white well circumscribed mass 2.0 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm,
0.4 cm from the pleural surface and 4.0 cm frorn the bronchial margin. Five hilar lymph nodes
are identiﬁed ranging from 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm to 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm. Multiple palpable nodular
areas are identified abutting the pleural surface, 0.40m in greatest dimension. The remainder of
the lung parenchyma is unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

FSE: brOnchial margin

E2: 4 lymph nodes

E3: 1 lymph node

ELI—B6: mass with pleural surface

E7-E9: gray discolored area on pleural surface
E10—E14: nodular areas

E15: uninvolved parenchyma
