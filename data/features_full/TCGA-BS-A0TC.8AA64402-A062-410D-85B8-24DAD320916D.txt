A. Submitted as “uterus, cervix. bilateral ovaries and tubes” is a uterus with attached cervix and bilateral tubes and ovaries
weighing 138 gma. it measures 7.8 x 5.2 x 5.0 cm in greatest dimension. it has been bivalved. The ectocervicsl mucosa is
smooth, the endooervical canal contains a smooth polyp which measures 1.2 cm. The endometriel cavity contains a polypoid
tan-gray mass within the uterine fundus. It measures approximately 2.4 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm in greatest drnension. Sectioning
through the mass shows equivocal early myometrial invasion. The myometrium measures apprordmately 2.2 cm in thickness.
The right tube measures 4.0 cm length and up to 0.4 cm in diameter. There s a paratubat cyst measuring 0.5. The right ovary
measures 2.0 x 0.9 rt 0.6 cm in greatest dimension and is grossly unremarkable. The left tube measures 2.9 cm in length by
up to 0.5 cm in diameter. The Ielt ovary reveals 2.3 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm and is grossly unremarkable.
