Right breast Ca, rule out deep margin positive.

GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "#1 right’modified radical mastectomy", in formalin. Received in the
container is a portion of breast with an attached skin ellipse containing the
nipple and an axillary dissection. The specimen measures 18.5 x 14 x 3.9 cm.
The attached skin ellipse measures 14.7 x 6.3 cm. The nipple appears grossly
unremarkable. There is a small 0.5 cm hole 1.7 cm inferior to the nipple. The
deep surface of the specimen is inked in blue and the specimen is serially
sectioned revealing a 3.5 x 2 x 1.5 cm firm white mass in the medial portion
of the specimen. The mass is fairly well—circumscribed but very firm to
palpation. Grossly it appears to approach within 0.2 cm of the deep surgical
margin. There is no definite biopsy cavity; however, there is a small area of
hemorrhage just adjacent to the tumor mass. Tissue from the tumor mass has
been sent for estrogen and progesterone receptors.

Block Summary:

A1~ section through nipple.

A2- section through hole in skin ellipse.

A3—A5- sections of tumor with adjacent deep margin.
A6—A9- representative sections of tumor.

AlO— representative sections of upper lateral quadrant.
All— representative section of lower lateral quadrant.
A12- representative section of upper medial quadrant.
A13— five lymph node candidates from level three.
Al4-A15— one large lymph node bisected, level three.
A16- one large lymph node bisected and one small lymph node candidate, level
three. -
A17- one lymph node candidate bisected, level three.
AlB— one lymph node candidate bisected, level three.
A19- four lymph node candidates from level II.

A20— one lymph node candidate bisected from level II.
A21- two lymph node candidates from level II.

A22- five lymph node candidates from level I.

A23— two lymph node candidates from level I.

A24- two lymph node candidates from level I.

A25— two lymph node candidates from level I.

 

 

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

Most of the tumor consists of tubules and cribriform glands composed of
atypical cells with a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm and oval
nuclei with distinct relatively small nucleoli. There is a sparse
inflammatory response. A minor non-comedo intraductal component is present,
within or near the tumor mass. Away from the tumor, no intraductal carcinoma
or epithelial hyperplasia is seen.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. "RISﬁT" BREAST, MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY:

INFILTRATING DUCTAL CARCINQMA (2.5 CM), NSABP HISTOLOGIC GRADE II/III,
NUCLEAR GRADE MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED.

A NON-COMEDO INTRADUCTAL CARCINOMA COMPONENT IS IDENTIFIED, COMPRISING
LESS THAN 10% OF THE CARCINOMA.

 

NO TUMOR IS SEEN IN THE DEEP SURGICAL MARGIN.

lof2

NO VASCULAR INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

 

TWO OF SEVENTEEN (2/17) LYMPH NODES ARE POSITIVE FOR METASTATIC
ADENOCARCINOMA.

BREAST TISSUE WITH APOCRINE METAPLASIA AND MICROCALCIFICATIONS IN
NON~NEOPLASTIC LOBULES.
