exfemai surfaces have ﬁbrous adhesions. No parathyroid glands and/or lymph nodes are identiﬁed grossly. The external
surface is painted with liquid biuing. The right lobe contains a well delineated. solid to cystic nodule that measures 4.7 cm
Si x 5.0 cm ML x 3.4 cm AP. The remainder of the thyroid tissue is grossly unremarkable. Sections of the nodule and
normal tissue are stored frozen. The remainder of the specimen is submitted as follows:
