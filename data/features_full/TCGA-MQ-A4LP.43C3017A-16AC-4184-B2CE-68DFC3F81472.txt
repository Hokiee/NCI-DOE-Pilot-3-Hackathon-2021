GROSS DESCRIPTION: Multiple parts. .

Eart A, received ﬁresh labeled pericardial fat and pleura. The specimen
consists of an irregular shaped portion of yellow lobulated glistening adipose
tissue admixed with tan-pink fibrous tissue measuring 27 cm,x 11 cm x 2.5 cm
overall. One surface shows a glistening tan-pink membranous tissue. The
opposite shows multiple nodules and pleural plaques ranging in size from 0.6 to
6 cm. Upon sectioning the nodules, the cut surface is tan~white firm and
nodular, in areas becoming more glistening and fleshy, focal areas of necrosis
are present. RepresentatiVe sections are submitted in 5 cassettes. The
section is submitted for frozen tumor bank.

Part 8 received fresh labeled diaphragmatic pleura. The specimen consists of
two fragments Of soft tissue. The largest fragment is 15 cm x 8 cm'x 1 cm in
maximum dimension, one surface is tan~pink and roughened.with fibrous
adhesions, the opposite side shows tan-white firm nodules, and plaque which
range in size from 1 cm to 6 cm. Grossly, the mass does not appear to invade
the skeletal muscle tissue. The second fragment of tissue is compOsed of a
tan~pink glistening membranous tissue measuring 9 cm x 3.5 x 0.2 cm. The
specimen has some firm modularity present. Representative sections submitted
as follows:

Cassettes l«4—largest fragment,

Cassette 5—second fragment.

Part C received fresh labeled level 4 lymph node (tracheal bronchial), the
specimen consists of an irregular portion of anthracotically pigmented lymyh
nodes and soft tissue measuring 3.5 x 1.2 x 1 cm. Specimen is submitted in
toto in two cassettes.

 

Part D received fresh labeled level 8 lymph node. The speciméﬁ"ﬁ§ﬁ3$§t§ or a

 

tan—brown rubbery lymph node measuring 1.2 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm. Specimen is
submitted in toto in one cassette labeled D.

Part E received fresh labeled level 7 lymph node (subcarinal). The‘specimen
consists of multiple fragments of anthracotically pigmented lymph nodes
aggregating to 6 cm x 3 cm x 0.3 cm. Largest lymph node is fragmented,
measures 2.5 x 1.2 x 1 cm. One of the fragments is composed of a yellow~tan
calcified nodule measuring 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm.

Summary of sections is as follows:

Cassette 1~one lymph node,

Cassette Zeone lymph node,

Cassette B-three lymph nodes,

Cassette 4~five lymph nodes,

CasSette 5—four lymph nodes

Cassette 6~five lymph nodes,

Cassette 7~largest lymph node, one half,

Cassette 8-second half of the largest lymph node.

Part E received fresh labeled pleura. The specimen consists of tan-pink
glistening tissue on one surface, the opposite surface shows white—tan nodular
plague, the specimen measures 25 cm x 13 cm x 0.5 cm overall. Multiple nodules
across this surface range in size from 0.1 to 12 cm, the 12 cm mass is a
tan—white firm plaque. Second fragment of tissue is composed of a portion of
soft tissue measuring 15 cm x 10 cm x 1 cm. One surface is tan-pink smooth and
glistening, the opposite shows fibrous adhesions, the entire surface has a
yellow~tan nodular plaque present. In addition, there is a separate tan«brown
nodular mass that has been incised in multiple areas measuring 4 cm x 2 x 1 cm.
Representative sections are submitted in 5 cassettes.
