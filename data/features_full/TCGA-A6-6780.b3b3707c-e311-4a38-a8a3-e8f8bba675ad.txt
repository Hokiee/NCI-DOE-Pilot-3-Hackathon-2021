SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

SPECIMEN
Right colon

CLINICAL NOTES
PRE—OP DIAGNOSIS: Carcinoma of the hepatic flexure.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
Received fresh labeled "right colon" is a previously
unopened, 12 cm segment of proximal right colon with
attached 6 cm of distal ileum surfaced by smooth to scabrous
tan-pink serosa with a moderate amount of attached mesocolon,

mesentery and unremarkable omentum. An unremarkable 6.6 cm appendix

averaging 0.5 cm in diameter is present. The proximal and distal
margins measure 2.8 and 5 cm in circumference respectively. On
opening, there is a nearly circumferential, 10.8 x 8 cm partially

necrotic dusky tan-gray-red tumor mass, 4 cm distal to the ileocecal

valve. On sectioning, the tumor has a maximum thickness of 2.4 cm,
grossly extending into the muscularis to within 1.1 cm of the inked

free radial serosal surface. The ileal and remaining colonic mucosa

is unremarkable, glistening tan—pink with regular folds and the
walls average 0.5 cm in thickness. Several slightly rubbery pale

tan-white tissues in keeping with lymph nodes measuring up to 1.4 cm

in greatest dimension are recovered from the attached mesocolon and
mesentery. Representative sections are submitted in 15 blocks as
labeled.

BLOCK SUMMARY: 1 — Proximal and distal margin; 2, 3 — tumor full
thickness to ink free radial serosal surface (orange); 4 - central
tumor; 5 - tumor to normal mucosa; 6 - ICV; 7 - random colon; 8 -
appendix; 9, 10, — six whole lymph es per cassette; 11-15 - one
bisected lymph node per cassette.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma with mucinous differentiation
Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated
Primary tumor (pT): Extends through muscularis propria (pT3)
Proximal margin: Not involved
Distal margin: Not involved
Circumferential (radial) margin: Not involved
Vascular invasion: Not identified
Regional lymph nodes (pN): No evidence of metastasis in 18 nodes

(pNO)

Non—lymph node pericolonic tumor: Not identified

Distant metastasis (pM): Cannot be evaluated by this specimen
(pMX)

Other findings: None

DIAGNOSIS
Right colon, resection:

Adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, with mucinous
differentiation, 10.8 cm with invasion through the
muscularis propria.

Surgical margins uninvolved.

No evidence of metastasis in 18 lymph nodes (0/18).

Appendix, appendectomy:
No pathologic diagnosis.
