DIAGNOSIS :

1) SOFT TISSUE, RETROPERITONEUN AND RIGHT KIDNEY, EXCISION: W 7/J‘d"

- HIGH GRADE DEDIPPERENTIATED LIPOSARCOHA.
- TUMOR SIZE: 29.0 C)! IN GREATEST DIMENSION.
- TUMOR INVOLVES SOFT TISSUE AND SHOWS FOCAL MINIMAL INVASION INTO RENAL
CORTEX.
- THE DEDIPFERENTIATED COMPONENT HAS A HIGH GRADE UN'DIFPERENTIATED
APPEARANCE AND SHOWS EXTENSIVE AREAS OF NECROSIS (GROSSLY ESTIMATED AS 60%) .
- THE WELL-DIFFERENTIATED COMPONENT EXTENDS TO THE HEDIAL MARGIN AND IS <
0.1 CI! PROM PROXIMAL AND INFERIOR MARGINS.

- THE DEDIPPERENTIATED COMPONENT < 0.1 C“ FROM THE SUPERIOR AND HEDIAL
MARGINS.

- ADDITIONAL NARGINS ARE WIDELY FREE OF TUMOR.

- ADRENAL GLAND AND KIDNEY PARENCHYMA ARE UNRENARKABLE.

— RENAL VESSELS ARE FREE OF TUMOR.

- IMMUNOSTAINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR 5100, CANS.2 AND AE1/AE3.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON THE PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL) BY THE PATHOLOGIST WHOSE NAME APPEARS

Gross Description:
ILD.

1).The specimen is received fresh, labeled 'retroperitoneal sarcoma with
right kidney" and consists of a soft tissue mass measuring 29.0 on lateral
to medial, 16.0 cm anterior to posterior and 14.0 cm superior to interior.

A distorted adrenal gland is identified on the superior aspect of the
specimen measuring 7.0 x 3.0 x 0.6 cm. The specimen is inked blue-superior,
red-inferior, black-posterior, green-anterior, yellow-medial and
orange-lateral and bisected to reveal a grossly unremarkable 12.0 x 7.0 x
2.5 on kidney compressed and surrounded by a poorly circumscribed white to
tan rubbery glistening mass measuring 16.5 x 13.5 x 8.5 cm mainly on the
inferior posterior and lateral aspect and a second measuring 12.5 x 8.5 x
13.5 cm fairly circumscribed light tan, soft with approximately 60% necrotic
with hemorrhagic areas mass on the superior medial aspect at the hilum level
compressing but not involving the kidney. The tumors abut the superior,
inferior, medial and posterior margins and is located 1.5 cm from the
anterior and 7.0 cm from the lateral margin. The tumors represents
approximately 80% of the specimen and grossly infiltrate the surrounding
adipose tissue. The specimen is photographed. TPS is taken.

Representative sections of the tumor, adrenal gland. kidney, and all
perpendicular margins are submitted.

Summary of sections:
AM-anterior green margin
PM-poaterior black margin
MK-medisl yellow margin
LK-lateral orange margin
SK-superior blue margin
IM-inferior red margin
KLT-kidney to lateral tumor
KMT-kidney to medial tumor
KM-kidney ureter and vessel margins
