Clinical Diagnosis E History:
Diagnosed with rectal carcinoma at 15 cm on - ' - rectal carcinoma.

Specimens Submitted:

1: SP: Rectum and rectosigmoid
2: SP: Additional sigmoid

3: SP: Proximal ring

4: SP: Distal ring

DIAGNOSIS:

1) COLON, RECTUM AND RECTOSIGMOID, SEGMENTAL RESECTION:

- THREE (3) FOCI OF ADENOCARCINOMA, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED, OF
SIGMOID AND RECTOSIGMOID.

- THE TUMORS MEASURE 2.9 x 1.8 x 0.8 CM, 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 CM, AND 0.7 x
0.5 x 0.2 CM, RESPECTIVELY.

- GROSS CONFIGURATIONS ARE POLYPOID.

- PREEXISTING TUBULAR ADENOMA IS IDENTIFIED.

- Two SMALLER TUMORS INVADE INTO THE SUBMUCOSA (pT1).
- THE LARGEST TUMOR INVADES INTO MUSCULARIS PROPRIA (pT2).

- NO VASCULAR INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

- NO PERINEURAL INVASION IS IDENTIFIED.

- SURGICAL MARGINS ARE FREE OF TUMOR.

- ADDITIONAL HYPERPLASTIC POLYP IS IDENTIFIED.

- THE UNINVOLVED COLONIC MUCOSA IS UNREMARRABLE

- LYMPH NODES: NUMBER OF METASTASES:0; NUMBER EXAMINED: 8 (0/8).

(ADDITIONAL LYMPH NODES ARE BEING EXAMINED AND AN ADDENDUM REPORT WILL
FOLLOW).

2) COLON, ADDITIONAL SIGMOID, SEGMENTAL RESECTION:
- HYPERPLASTIC POLYP.
- UNREMARRABLE COLONIC MUCOSA.
- ONE BENIGN LYMPH NODE (0/1).

3) COLON, PROXIMAL RING, EXCISION:
- UNREMARKABLE COLONIC MUCOSA.

4 COLON, DISTAL RING, EXCISION:
- UNREMARKABLE COLONIC MUCOSA.

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.

*** Report Electronically Signed Out **‘1 -

Gross Description:

1) The specimen is received fresh labeled "rectum and rectosigmoid". It
consists of a rectosigmoid colon that measures 12.0 cm in length by 7.0 cm
in circumference at the distal resection margin. The serosal surface is pink
and smooth. The radial resection margin is inked black and the specimen is
opened to reveal a pink-tan papillary tumor measuring 2.9 cm in length by
1.8 cm in width by 0.4 cm, located 3.5 cm from the distal resection margin.
There is a smooth sessile polyp measuring 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm, located 0.7 cm
from the tumor, and 5.0 cm from the closest (distal) resection margin. There
is a second pink-tan smooth sessile polyp measuring 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm,
located 1.2 cm from the tumor, and 3.2 cm from the distal resection margin
(arbitrarily designated P2). There is a third pink-tan smooth sessile polyp
measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm, 1.0 cm distal to the tumor, and 1.8 cm from
the distal resection margin (arbitrarily designated P3). The three polyps
are blocked out and entirely submitted. The tumor is sectioned to reveal a
well defined pink-white extension to depth of 0.8 cm grossly not involving
the underlying fat, and 1.2 cm from the inked radial resection margin.
Representative sections of the tumor are submitted. Remaining mucosa is
otherwise grossly unremarkable. The specimen is submitted for lymph nodes
and possible lymph nodes are submitted. TPS is taken. Representative
sections are submitted.

Summary of sections:

PM -- proximal margin
DM -- distal margin
RM -- radial margin

T-- tumor
P1, P2, P3polyps submitted from proximal to distal

T tumor
U - undesignated
LN -- -- lymph nodes

RM-- radial margin

2) The specimen is received fresh labeled "Additional sigmoid" and consists
of a previously opened portion of bowel measuring 5.6 cm in length by 5.3 cm
in circumference. There is attached pericolic fat extending 6.2 cm in
length. The mucosa reveals a central pink-tan smooth sessile polyp
measuring 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm, 2.8 cm from the nearest unoriented resection
margin. The polyp is blocked out entirely submitted. The remaining mucosa is
otherwise grossly unremarkable. Representative sections including margins

are submitted. The specimen is submitted for lymph dissection, and all
identified lymph nodes are submitted.

Summary of sections:
Ml-margin one
M2-opposing margin
P-polyp

U - undesignated

LN - lymph nodes

3) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "proximal ring" and
consists of a silver metal anastomotic pin measuring 7.5 x 2.8 x 1.5 cm. At
the center of the pin, a plastic piece is noted. A ring of pink tan soft
tissue is attached measuring 2.0 x 1.8 x 0.5 cm. The mucosal surface is
pink tan and focally hemorrhagic and the serosal surface is pink tan and
smooth. Several sutures and staples are noted. The sutures and staples are
removed and the soft tissue is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U--undesignated

4) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "distal ring" and consists
of a ring of pink tan soft tissue measuring 1.8 x 1.8 x 0.7 cm. multiple
sutures and staples are attached. The mucosal surface is pink tan and
focally hemorrhagic. The sutures and staples are removed and the soft tissue
is entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
U--undesignated
