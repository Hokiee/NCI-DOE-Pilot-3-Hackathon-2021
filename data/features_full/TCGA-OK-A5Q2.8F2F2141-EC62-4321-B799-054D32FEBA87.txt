Inﬁltrating Labular Carcinoma 62%? ’7’
CATEGORY: ; BREAST INVASIVE CARCINOMA—INFILTRATING LOBULAR 9a) Wall:
CARCINOMA

FROM PRIMARY BREAST SURGERY

CLINICAL I-IX - Invasive lobular carcinoma.

RIGHT BREAST, MASTECTOMY - Invasive lobular carcinoma, focally pleomorphic type, /—~—/
3.0cm in greatest microscopic dimension, associated with extensive duct carcinoma in-situ
(DCIS), intermediate nuclear grade, solid type with comedo necrosis. [Nottingham histologic
grading system utilized- SBR score 7; architectural grade 3, nuclear grade 2, mitotic grade 2]. No
lymphatic invasion is identiﬁed. Deep margin negative for tumor. Vessel wall calciﬁcations.
Intraductal papilloma, radial scar and ﬁbrocystic changes including sclerosing adenosis. Skin and
nipple, unremarkable. Prior biopsy site changes.

RIGHT AXILLARY CONTENTS, EXCISION - Metastatic carcinoma present in two of the
thirteen lymph nodes (2/13). Largest metastatic focus measures 4mm in greatest microscopic
dimension. No extranodal extension is identiﬁed.

Comment: AJCC pathologic stage pTZNlaMx.

Synoptic summary will follow as an addendum.

ADDENDUM l:

RIGHT BREAST, MASTECTOMY - Immunohistochemical stain for HER-Z-NEU oncoprotein
is negative (performed on formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn embedded sections by manual semiquantitative
morphometric analysis with appropriate positive and negative controls). No membranous staining
is seen. The HER-Z-NEU procedure was performed using monoclonal antibody 435 and DAB
detection system. (Staining interpretation: Weak = 1+; Moderate = 2+; Strong = 3+.)

NOTE. This evaluation was performed according to ASCO/CAP guidelines: Positive HERZ/neu
cases are those with strong and complete membrane staining (3+) in greater than 30% of invasive
cancer cells. Negative cases are deﬁned as those with no staining (0) or weak, incomplete
membrane staining (1+) in any proportion of cells. Equivocal cases are those cases with strong
staining in less than or equal to 30% of cells, or less than strong but complete membrane staining
(2+) in at least 10% of cells. Immunolu'stochemical stains were performed on formalin-ﬁxed
parafﬁn embedded tissue with appropriate positive and negative controls.

ADDENDUM 2.

Specimen Type - Mastectomy. Lymph node Sampling - Axillary dissection. Specimen Size -
Greatest dimension 3cm. Histologic Type - Invasive lobular. Grading System - Nottingham.
Tubule Formation - Minimal less than 10% (score = 3). Nuclear Pleomorphism - Moderate
increase in size, etc (score = 2). Mitotic Count - 40X objective ﬁeld with a ﬁeld area of 0.152
mm2: 6 to 10 mitoses per 10 HPF (score = 2). Total Nottingham Score - Grade II: 6-7 points.
Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma. Distance from closest margin: 5mm. Deep Primary
Tumor [pT]: pT2 - Tumor greater than or equal to 2.0—5.00m. Regional Nodes [pN]: lea:
Metastasis in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes (at least 1 tumor deposit greater than 2.0mm). Number
involved: 2. Number examined: 13. Distant Metastasis [pM}: pMX - cannot be assessed.

FROM DIAGNOSIS

CLINICAL HX - Right irregular mass, Right ax tail lymph node. RIGHT BREAST, 10:00
MASS, CORE BIOPSY - Invasive, lobular carcinoma with focal duct carcinoma in situ, solid
type, low nuclear grade. lntraductal papilloma involved by lobular carcinoma in-situ. RIGHT
AXILLA, LYMPH NODE, CORE BIOPSY - Lymph node with metastatic carcinoma
histologically identical to breast carcinoma. COMMENT. Prognostic/predictive markers are
being performed and results will follow as an addendum. ADDENDUM: Results of
immunoperoxidase steroid receptor protein determination on parafﬁn sections, visually evaluated
using DAB detection system and monoclonal antibodies (manual semiquantitative morphometric

analysis): ESTROGEN RECEPTOR PROTEIN (ER- clone SP1): POSITIVE; PROGESTERONE
RECEPTOR PROTEIN (PR- clone IE2): POSITIVE. Estimated percentage of nuclei staining
positive (ER): 100; Estimated percentage of nuclei staining positive (PR): 25. Intensity of
staining, ER: 3+ (strong). Intensity of staining, PR: 3+ (strong). Immunohistochemical stain for
HER-Z-NEU oncoprotein is NEGATIVE (performed on formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn embedded
sections by manual semiquanitative morphometric analysis). No membranous staining is seen.
The HER-Z-NEU procedure was performed using monoclonal antibody 4B5 and DAB detection
system.
