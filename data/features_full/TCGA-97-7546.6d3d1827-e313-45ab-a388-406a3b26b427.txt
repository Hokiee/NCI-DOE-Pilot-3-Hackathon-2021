CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Lung nodule

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in six parts, each labeled with the
patient's name.

1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'left upper lobe'. It

consists of an 11 x 7.5 x 3 cm lung wedge resection with a stapled
margin measuring 7 cm in length. Two defects made by the surgeon are
noted. The first defect measures 1.5 cm in length and the second
defect measures 1.8 cm in length. The pleural surface is otherwise
smooth and glistening. The surgical margin is inked black and the
pleural surface is inked blue. In the first defect area, a 1.4 cm
relatively well-circumscribed, tan-white, firm nodule, located 1.3
cm from the surgical margin and 0.2 cm from the pleural surface is
noticed. In the second defect, a 2 x 1 cm, tan-white, firm nodule is
noted. This nodule is 1.5 cm from the surgical margin and 0.2 cm
from the pleura. Other areas of lung parenchyma show patchy
congestion. Representative sections are submitted.

2. Part two is received in saline, labeled 'completion of left upper
lobe'. It consists of a partial lobectomy measuring 18 x 7 x 3.5 cm.
The specimen weighs 136 g. The specimen contains a stapled margin
measuring 15 cm, which is inked in blue. After the stapled margin

is removed, the underlying surface is inked in green. The pleural
surface is inked in black. The specimen is serially sectioned and no

masses are identified. The lung parenchyma consists of tan-pink to
tan-gray spongy parenchyma. Representative sections are submitted.

3. Part three is received in saline, labeled 'station 13 lymph
node'. It consists of two black lymph nodes measuring 1.6 x 1.2 x
0.3 cm and 1 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The lymph nodes are bisected and
entirely submitted in SA.

4. Part four is received in saline, labeled 'level 9 lymph node'. It
consists of two black lymph nodes, both measuring 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.2
cm. The specimen is entirely submitted.

5. Part five is received in saline, labeled 'level 5 lymph node'. It
consists of three black lymph nodes ranging in size form 0.4 cm to
1.2 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is submitted in toto.

6. Part six is received in saline, labeled 'level 7 lymph node'. It
consists of one black lymph node measuring 1.2 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The
lymph node is bisected and submitted entirely in BA.
