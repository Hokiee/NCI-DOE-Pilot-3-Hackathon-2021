1) Received fresh, labeled with me patlent‘s name. unite and "light radical axillary lymph node dissection“ is a 9,0 x 8.0 x
3.0 cm yellow fatty adipose lieeue Into Mulch I surgical defect has been made to reveal a well droumaa'ibed ﬂrm
tan-yellow men measuring 4.0 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm. This appears to be a punitive lymph node. Representative sections of this
node I: submitted into cassette: 1 and 2. All other possible lymph nodes are dieeeaed from the int and submitted into
cassettes 3—6.

2) Received fresh. labeled with the petIent'e name. unltﬂ and “light axillary node” are multiple ii'agrnents a! yellow fatty
adipose lleeue meeeurlng in aggregate 1.9 x 1.5 x10 cm. The entire specimen is Iubmitted into one cassette.
