GROSS DESCRIPTION

A. The specimen is received fresh labeled vaginal margin'
and consists c! an irregular segment of ten-pink mucosa-covered soft tissue, 1.0 x 0.5
excised to a depth of 1.0 cm. The resected margin is inked black and the specimen is
bisected and entirely submitted for frozen section as tea.

3. The specimen is received fresh labeled m uterus. bilateral
eslpingo-oophorectomy snd cervix” and consists of a uterus and cervix with right tube and
ovary and possible left tube that weighs 104 gm and measures 8.0 cm in length x 4.5 cm
between the cornua and 3.5 cm in AP thickness. The uterus was previousz opened by the
surgeon. In the tresh state, a portion of the tumor was submitted for and

studies. The parametrial tissue is inked black. The seroee is tan-pink, smooth and
unremarkable. The ectocervix is tan-pink and demonstrates focal red-purple areas. The
endocervical canal is stenotic and the uterine cavity is patent. The cervix and
lower uterine segment demonstrates multiple grey-white rubbery to firm nodular areas that
measure up to 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. The endcmetrium demonstrates multiple
gray-white rubbery to firm nodular areas. These areas occupy approximately 900 of the
endometrium and surrounding myometriel tissue. Sections through these areas demonstrete a
ten-grey ill-defined rubbery to firm mass that measures 5.5 x 5.0 x 2.0 cm. The greatest
depth of invasion is 1.5 cm. The myometrium in this area measures 1.6 cm. The mass
grossly appears to involve over 900 o: the myometrium. The right every measures 2.5 x 2.0
x 0.8 cm. The outer surface is yellow-tan and convoluted. Sections demonstrate
unremarkable cut surfaces. The attached fimbriatsd fallopian tube measures 5.0 x 0.4 cm.
Sections demonstrate a pinpoint patent lumen. The lett probable fallopian tube measures
5.5 x 0.4 an. The left ovary is not present. The case is reviewed with and
sectioned per his direction. Representative sections of the specimen are sub-nitted as
follows: Bl right parametrium; 32 left paremetrium; 83 serose; 84- 37 representative full
thickness section of cervix each quadrant, sequentially submitted from 1 to 12 o' clock,-
80- -Bll full thickness endomyometrimn, anterior submitted sequentially trom (undue to es,-
312-815 full thickness endomyometrium, posterior submitted sequentially from {undue to es;
316 right tube and ovary; 317 probable left tube.

GROSS DESCRIPTION (massed)

c. The specimen is received fresh labeled w right pelvic
lymph node dissection' and consists of multiple segments of golden yellow lobulated adipose
tissue, 6.5 x 4.0 x 2.0 cm. Identified within the fat are ten probable lymph nodes that
range from 0.2 to 5.0 as in maximum dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as:
Cl three lymph nodes,- c2 one lysph node; Cl-CG one lymph node each cassette, bisected;
C7-C9 one lymph node, serially sectioned; Clo-Cl: largest lymph node, serially sectioned.

D. The specimen is received fresh labeled“ 1'“ ‘°'Ci¢ lymph
nodes' and consists of multiple irregular segments of dull yellow lobulstsd adipose tissue,
4.0 x 2.5 x 1.0 as in loose aggregate. Identified within the fat are seven probable lymph
nodes that range from 0.3 to 2.0 cm in maximum dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely
submitted as: 01-02 three lymph nodes each cassette,- DJ one lymph node, bisected.

B. The specimen is received fresh labeled W lett pelvicI and
consists of multiple segments of golden yellow lobulated adipose tissue. 6.0 x 4.0 x 2.5
cm. Identified within the fat are eight probable lymph nodes that range from 0.5 to 3.0 cm
in maximum dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted as: Bl three lymph nodes,- 32
two lymph nodes; 14-26 one lymph node, serially sectioned; 37—810 largest lymph node,
serially sectioned.

F. The specimen is received fresh labeled ' right periaortic
lymph nodes" and consists of multiple fragments of golden yellow lobuleted adipose tissue.
4.0 x 3.0 x 1.5 an in loose aggregate. Identified within the fat are seven probable lymph
nodes that range from 0.5 to 4.0 cm in maximum dimension. The lymph nodes are entirely
submitted as: Fl three lymph nodes; P2 one lymph node; F3-E‘4 one lymph node each cassette,
bisected; Fs-FS one lymph node, quedrisected.

MICROSCOPIC/COW

A. Sections show vaginal mucosa. There is a focus of epithelium with marked thermal
artifact that shows occasional mid level mitoses and nuclear atypia consistent with
HGSIL (GIN grade 2 at least). No invasive squamous cell carcinoma is identified.
Bent: has reviewed this part and agrees with the diagnosis.

3. Sections show cervix and uterus with a 5.5 cm in greatest dimension invasive squamous
cell carcinoma with high grade features. No keratinization is seen in the tumor. The
tumor arises in the cervix and extensively involves the entire cervix, endccervix, lower
uterine segment and the majority of the uterine corpus. The tumor has a maximal cervical
strcmal invasion of 1.0 cm and this area of cervix shows a maximal thickness of 1.2 cm. No
lymphovascular invasion is seen. The margins are negative for invasive squamous cell
carcinoma. The invasive tumor is 0.2 cm away from the vaginal cuff margin. Most of the
squamous epithelium at the vaginal cuff margin is sloughed off and marked

thermal artifact is present. Please refer to part A (vaginal margin shows HGSIL). No
perametrial involvement is seen. The right ovary and tube show no involvement. No
definite left fallopian tube or ovary are identified grossly or microscopically.

Bent: has also reviewed this case and agrees with the diagnsos invasive see.

c. Sections show ten benign lymph nodes. Negative for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.

0. Sections show seven benign lymph nodes. Negative for metastatic squamous cell
carcinoma.

3. Sections show eight benign lymph nodes. Negative for metastatic carcinoma.

1’. Sections show seven benign lymph nodes. Negative for metastatic carcinoma.
