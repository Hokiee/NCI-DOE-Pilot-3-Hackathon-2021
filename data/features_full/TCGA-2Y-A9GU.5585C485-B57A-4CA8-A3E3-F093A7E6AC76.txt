Gross Description

A. The specimen is received fresh labeled ”segment 5 resection“. The specimen consists of
604.0 gram segmentectomy resection of liver which measures 16.0 x 11.0 x 7.0 cm. The capsule of
the specimen is pink-tan to red-brown, focally hemorrhagic, and has bosseiated surface. The
parenchymal resection margin is lan-red-brown, focally cauterized and is inked blue. The specimen is
serially sectioned to reveal an irregular, ill-deﬁned lobuiated intraparenchymal tumor mass which
measures 1t .0 x 9.0 x 7.0 cm. The tumor is bulging capsule and is 1.0 cm from the closest
parenchymal resection margin. The tumor mass is locally hemorrhagic and necrotic- Ihe areas of
necrosis range from 5.1 to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension, and occupy less than 10% of the tumor.
Representative section of the tumor in relation to the closest parenchymal resection margin is
submitted for frozen section as FSAt. Representative sections of the specimen are submitted to the

Tissue Procurement Laboratory. Additional sections or the specimen are submitted in s cassettes as
follows:

A2~A5: Tumor bulging capsule
A6: Central part of the tumor
A7; Grossiy' unremarkable liver parenchyma.
