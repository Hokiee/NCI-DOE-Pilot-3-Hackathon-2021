INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES AND PROBEJCLONE INFORMATION.

FISH:

Probe: HER2 DNA Probe

Probe Description: The HER2 DNA probe Is a 190 Kb directly labeled ﬂuorescent DNA probe
speciﬁc for the HER2 gene locus The CEP 17 DNA probe is a 5.4 Kb dIrectIy labeled

ﬂuorescent DNA probe speciﬁc for the alpha satellite DNA sequence at the centromeric region of chromosome 17 '
The probes are pro-mixed and ore-denatured in hybridization buffer.

Interpretation:
HER2 negative; HER2 genelchromosome 1? ratio less than 2.0
HER2 positive: HER2 genelchromosome 17 ratio greater than 2.0

Results should be considered along with other clinical information.

The has modiﬁed the suggested manufacturer protocol for HER2 FISH testing.
The modiﬁcations have been tested and validated. The modiﬁcations are as follows: Slides are deparatﬁnized in Tissue is
digested in protease 31 minutes; ﬂame and probe are co-denatured at 90 C for 12 minutes; Parafﬁn pretreatment reagents and
control slides are prepared in house. Ampliﬁed. non-ampliﬁed. and internal (centromere 17) controls were used in the testing. The
laboratory takes responsibiiity for the test performance.

FISH analysis was manually performed and quantitatively assessed by analysis of a minimum of 60 calls using the HER2
and the CEP1 7 probes.

IHC:
anﬁ-HER-Zlneu (485) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody

Tumors are considered POSITIVE if they show HER2 protein over-expression (3+) by IHC.

IHC scoring for HER2 in gastric and GEjunction cancer by type of diagnostic specimen:
SCORE SURGICAL SPECIMENSTAINING PATTERN

NEGATIVE

O No reactivity or membranous reactivity in <10% of tumor cells

1+ Faint/barely perceptible membranous reactivity in _>_ 10% of tumor cells;cells are reactive only in part of their membrane
EQUIVOCAL

2+ Weak to moderate complete. baseleteral or lateral membranous reactivity in z 10% of tumor cells

POSITIVE

3+ Strong complete. basolateral or lateral membranous reactivity in 3.10% of tumor cells

BIOPSY SPECIMEN-STAINING PATTERN

NEGATIVE
0 No reactivity or no membranous reactivity in any (or <5 clustered) tumor cells

1+ Tumor cell cluster (3 5 cells) with a faint/barely perceptible membranous reactivity irrespective Of percentage of tumor
cells stained

EQUIVOCAL
