Gross Description

A. The specimen is received fresh labeled "nodal iymph node“. The specimen consists of a
single roughly ovoid, rubbery iymph node measuring up to 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph
node is bisected and is submitted entirely tor frozen section as FSM.

B. The specimen is received fresh loomed “segment 4 lesion". The specimen consists of a
single pore biopsy fragment of ten brown tissue measuring 6.7 cm in iength mid iess than 0.1 cm in
diameter. The specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section as F381.

C. The specinen is received fresh labeled “superior segment 4". The specimen consists of a
single core biopsy fragment of tan brown tissue measuring 1.3 cm in length and iess than Bil cm in
diameter. The specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section as F301-

D. The specimen is received fresh labeled ”additional superior segment 4“. The specimen
consists of a single core biopsy fragment of tan brown tissue measuring up to 0.? cm in length, which
is submitted entirely for frozen section as F331.

E. The specimen is received fresh labeied ’segment 5". The specimen consists of a single core
biopsy fragment of tan brown tissue measumg {3.5 cm in length and less than 0.1 cm in diameter.
The specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section as FSEt.

F. The specimen is received fresh labeled “liver resection segment 6"; The specimen consists of
an irregular, unorlented fragment of ther parenchyma measuring 6.5 x 5.5 x to cm and weighs 79.0
grams- The capsule of the portion of liver is tan red brown, smooth and glistening. The parenchymai
resection margin is shaggy. cauterized and is marked with black ink. The specimen is serially
sectioned to reveal an irregular to roughly ovoid, welt-deﬁned, solid intraparenchymal tumor nodule,
which measures 4.0 x 3'3 x 3.5 cm. The tumor is 0.3 cm from the closest parenchymal resection
margin. The tumor partially bulges but does not appear to extend through the hepatic capsule. The
cut surface: of the tumor is variegated, pink tan to brown, focally hemorrhagic and iobulated. The
hepatic capsule overlying tumor is marked with blue inlr Representative sections of the specimen are
submitted to the Tissue Procurement Laboratory. Representative sections of the specimen are
submitted In 6 cassettes as follows:

F1-F3: Tumor In relation to obsest parenchymal resection margin

F4436: Additional sectims of the tumor bulging hepatic capsule
