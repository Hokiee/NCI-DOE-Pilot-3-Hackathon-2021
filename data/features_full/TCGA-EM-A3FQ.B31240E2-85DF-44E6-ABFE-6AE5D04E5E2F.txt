Comment

The specimen reveals a widely invasive classical variant papillary carcinoma that exhibits areas cribriform and morular
growth and extensive intrathyroidal dissemination. There is lymphatic invasion, but no evidence of angioinvasion is seen.
There is also a 0.9 cm follicular variant papillary microcarcinoma that exhibits focal capsular invasion. Although the
dominant tumor is described grossly as a 1.6 cm nodule, the extent of malignancy throughout the right lobe warrants
classiﬁcation of the entire lobe as papillary carcinoma. There is no deﬁnitive surgical margin Involvement by tumor,
owever, the tumor comes within less than 0.1 mm of the painted resection margin in numerous locations. There is no
vidence of extrathyroidal extension. -

Surgical Pathology Consultation Report Q

Q It is of note that the patient has a family history of colon cancer. Moreover, the dominant tumor exhibits areas of cribrifonn
and morular growth. This architecture is characteristic of lesions that have been reported in association with the Familial
Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) syndrome. Although this is not diagnostic of this entity. further clinical evaluation is

recommended.
