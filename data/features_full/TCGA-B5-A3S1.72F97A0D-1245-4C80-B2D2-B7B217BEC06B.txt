white—tan, whorled, circumscribed, firm nodules without hemorrhage or
necrosis. The largest posterior nodule is calcified and distorts the
posterior myometrium up to 3 cm in greatest dimension. At the fundus there is
a 5‘cm white—tan, whorled circumscribed subserosal myomatous nodule without

hemorrhage or necrosis.

cut surface is tan—yellow and homogenous with multiple corpora albicantia.

identified.

Intraoperative consultation: yes. Frozen section of mass.
Special studies prospectively ordered No.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:

A. "Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and right ovary":AF1 (tumor at deepest

invasion)—papillary serous adenocarcinoma less than one third depth of
invasion. Extensive lymphovascular involvement ( .

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:

PROCEDURE: Hysterectomy, salpingo—oophorectomy, lymphadenectomy

PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC Edition): ple le pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. "UTERUS, CERVIX, BILATERAL TUBES, RIGHT OVARY" (HYSTERECTOMY,

SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY):

CARCINOMA OF THE ENDOMETRIUM:
HISTOLOGIC TYPE: SEROUS ADENOCARCINOMA.
FIGO GRADE: 3 OF 3.

TUMOR SIZE: 3.8 X 3.5 X 1.3 CM.
TUMOR SITE: POSTERIOR CORPUS, EXTENDING INTO LOWER UTERINE SEGMENT.

MAXIMUM DEPTH OF MYOMETRIAL INVASION: 1.3 CM, IN A 1.5 CM THICK WALL,
SEE COMMENT.

LYMPHATIC/VASCULAR INVASION: PRESENT, EXTENSIVE.
ADJACENT NON-NEOPLASTIC ENDOMETRIUM: ATROPHIC.
REMAINING MYOMETRIUM: LEIOMYOMATA, LARGEST 5 CM.

CERVIX: FREE OF TUMOR.
SEROSA: FREE OF TUMOR.
SPECIMEN MARGINS: NOT INVOLVED.

RIGHT OVARY AND FALLOPIAN TUBE: FREE OF TUMOR.
LEFT OVARY AND FALLOPIAN TUBE: NOT IDENTIFIED.

COMMENT: The myometrium shows massive involvement of lymphatic/vascular
channels by carcinoma. The tumor within the endometrial cavity directly
invades only a few millimeters into the myometrium. However, there are foci
of invasive carcinoma arising from tumor in lymphatic vascular channels within
approximately 2 mm of the serosal surface (block A9).

B. "LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODES" (LYMPHADENECTOMY):

METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA IN ONE OF THIRTEEN LYMPH NODES (l/l3).

C. "RIGHT EXTERNAL LYMPH NODES" (LYMPHADENECTOMY):

‘METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA IN ONE OF TWO LYMPH NODES (1/2).

D. "RIGHT OBTURATOR LYMPH NODES" (LYMPHADENECTOMY):

METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA IN ONE OF NINE LYMJL NODES (1/9).

 

E. "RIGHT COMMON LYMPH NODES" (LYMPHADENECTOMY):

FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.
NO LYMPH NODE TISSUE IS IDENTIFIED.

F. "RIGHT AORTIC LYMPH NODES" (LYMPHADENECTOMY):

FIVE LYMPH NODES, NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY (0/5).

G. "LEFT AORTIC LYMPH NODES" (LYMPHADENECTOMY):

TWO LYMPH NODES, NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY (0/2).
