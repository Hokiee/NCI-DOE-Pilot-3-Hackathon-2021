Gross Description

Received is a single specimen. The requisition and specimen container are labelled with
the patient‘s name “The cassette and AP identifiers are labelled with the
Surgical Number

A. The liver segment measures 7.5 x 6.0 x 5.0 cm. The liver resection margin is inked
blue. The surface is nodular and has a cirrhotic appearance. The attached gallbladder
measures 9.5 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm and has a smooth surface. There is one lymph node present
near the cystic duct resection site measuring 1.3 cm in greatest dimension. Serial
sectioning of the liver reveals a tan/yellow solid mass measuring 3.4 x 3.0 x up to 2.8
cm and has a slightly hemorrhagic area measuring 0.8 cm in greatest dimension on one
side; it bulges toward one area on the liver surface. The tumor has a lobular appearance
and is at least 1.5 cm from the liver resection margin. The rest of the liver parenchyma
appears nodular, with areas of green discoloration. No second mass lesion is identified.
Grossly, the liver mass does not adhere or invade into the gallbladder. Opening of the
gallbladder reveals dark green velvety inner lining, with no calculi present and no
grossly identifiable lesion on the inner lining.

Sections are submitted as follows:

Al - liver mass with the bulging surface.

A2 — tumor with liver resection margin.

A3 through A5 — mass with hemorrhagic area in A4.

A6 - additional tumor with resection margin.

A7 — gallbladder with underlying liver.

A8 ~ liver tissue away from the mass.

A9 - cystic duct margin.

A10 — lymph node near the cystic duct, bisected.

All — section of a small 0.2 cm nodular that is 0.8 cm away from the main mass.
