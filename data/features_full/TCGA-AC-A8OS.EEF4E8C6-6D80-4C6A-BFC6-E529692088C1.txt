quadrant are three lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 cm to 1.2 x 0.8 cm each. Representative sections are
submitted.

FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

D. Part D is posterior to tumor, right breast (blue is old surface). Initially received in the fresh state for
frozen section evaluation is a 3.5 x 2.0 x 0.8 cm portion of red~tan soft tissue. The old surface has been
previously marked blue. and is now re-inked blue. The new margin is now marked black. The specimen is
serially Sectioned revealing deep red skeletal muscle without gross tumor involvement. The tissue is
entirely submitted for frozen section evaluation with the residual frozen tissue submitted in 01-03.
