SEE MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION AND COMMENT.

Operation/Specimen: Brain tumor
Clinical History and Pre—Op Dx:

GROSS PATHOLOGY:

A.

SPECIMEN: Right temporal lobe.

FIXATIVE: Formalin.

GENERAL: A tan—brown, soft tissue fragment, 1 cm in greatest dimesion.
In total, #1.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, temporal lobe: atypical glial
proliferation, consistent with glioma.

B.

SPECIMEN: Right temporal lobe.

FIXATIVE:'Formalin.

GENERAL: Pale white, oval brain tissue fragment, 5 x 4 cm in size.
The meningeal surface has tan-brown, sulci and gyri, the
resected surface has varigated papillary appearance. Serial
sectioning reveals relatively normal appearing cortex, the
cerebral white matter shows fine punctate markings.

SECTIONS: 2~5,'representative.

C.

SPECIMEN: Brain tumor.

FIXATIVE: Formalin.

GENERAL: Four irregular, tan—white, soft tissue fragments, 3—5 mm in
greatest dimension.

Iiiliiiiiis: 6i all submitted.

MICROSCOPIC: A. Portions of cerebral cortex with moderately increased
cellularity due to the presence of small round and elongated
hyperchromatic nuclei. Around vessels there are accumulations of these
nuclei cuffing the vessels. In these zones the neoplastic cells have a
definite astrocytic phenotype. There are no mitoses, microvascular

 

 

 

cellular roliferation or necrosis. . ‘ ' .

B. Portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter’and
leptomeninges. The white matter contains a neoplastic proliferation of
glial cells similar to the ones described for part A. The neoplastic
nuclei are round or elongated, have moderate pleomorphism, and
infiltrate the cerebral cortex. Around vessels, the neoplastic cells
form nests of prominently fibrillary astrocytes. In the cerebral
cortex at the pial—glial interface they accumulate focally. A couple
of nests of neoplastic cells are observed in the leptomeningeal space.
There are no mitoses, microvascular cellular proliferation, or areas of
necrosis. The neoplasm is present in the deeper margin of the white
matter throughout the specimen.

C. Portions of cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter. The tissue
is infiltrated by a glial neoplasm similar to that one described for
parts A and B. In this specimen, however, there is a focal area of
solid neoplasm, which is more cellular and contains proliferative
microvessels. A couple of these microvessels have microvascular
cellular proliferation, and one microvessel has undergone necrosis and
thrombosis, and the immediately surrounding tumor tissue is undergoing
necrosis with pseudopalading. One mitotic figure is identified.

SPECIAL STAINS: Immunoperoxidase stains for GEAP and MIBl are
performed on blocks 2 and 6.

The -demonstrates the strong fibrillary component of the tumor
cells around vessels (#2), and in solid tumor (#6). With the MIB—l
proliferation indices of 1.5% and 9% are determined in specimen B and
C, respectively.

COMMENT: In parts A and B (right temporal lobe) there is a diffusely
infiltrating glioma involving white and gray matter. The neoplasm has
moderate nuclear atypia, is devoid of mitotic figures, microvascular
cellular proliferation, and/or necrosis, and particularly in
perivascular areas has a well defined astrocytic phenotype. This
neoplasm has a MIBml proliferation index of 1.5%. A couple

of small fragments of similar neoplasm is observed in the
leptomeningeal space. These are features of a histologically low grade
(WHO grade II/IV) astrocytoma. In specimen C there is a similar
neoplasm. However, in here there is a zone of solid tumor in which
cellularity is prominent, a couple of microvessels have microvascular
cellular preliferation, one microvessel has undergone necrosis and is
surrounded by a microscopic zone of tumor necrosis, and one mitotic
figure is observed. The MIB—l proliferation index in this specimen is
9%. These morphological findings are those of a high

histological grade glioma, possibly a glioblastoma multiforme. The
Specimen is small, and may not be representative of the entire lesion.
The morphological findings may be correlated with clinical, imaging,
and intraoperative findings for final determination.
