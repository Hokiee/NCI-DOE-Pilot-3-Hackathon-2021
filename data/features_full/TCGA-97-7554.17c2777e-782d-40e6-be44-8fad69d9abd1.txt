CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Lung cancer

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in six parts, each labeled with the
patient's name.

1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'pleural biopsy'. It

consists of white to yellow soft tissue measuring 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1
cm. The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section then into
cassette 1A.

2. Part two is labeled 'level # 9 lymph node'. It consists of an
anthracotic lymph node measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is
submitted entirely in cassette 2A.

3. Part three is received in formalin, labeled 'level # 11 lymph
node'. It consists of three anthracotic lymph nodes measuring 1.2 x
0.8 x 0.3 cm in aggregate. The specimen is submitted entirely in
cassette 3A.

4. Part four is received in formalin, labeled 'level #7 lymph node.
It consists of three lymph nodes measuring 1 x 0.8 x 0.3 cm, 0.5 x
0.5 x 0.3 cm and 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is submitted
entirely.

5. Part five is labeled 'left lower lobe'. It consists of a left

lower lobe of lung, weighing 180 grams, measuring 18 x 12 x 8.5 cm.
The pleura is pink tan glistening and has a puckered area, measuring
3 x 3 cm which is inked in black. The pleura is heavily mottled with

fine black streaks. The resected bronchial margin measures 2.5 cm,
and the hilar margin measures 3 cm. The specimen is serially
sectioned and cut surface reveals an ill-defined firm gray white
tumor, measuring 4.7 x 3.5 cm, located 1 cm from the resected
bronchial margin; the overlying pleura is puckered. The remainder

of the lung parenchyma is pink red blotchy. Also noted are ten
anthracotic firm lymph nodes, ranging from 0.5 cm to 1.2 cm obtained
from the peri-hilar area. Representative sections are submitted.

6. Part six is received in formalin, labeled 'level #5 lymph node'.
It consists of an anthracotic lymph node measuring 2.5 x 1 x 0.3 cm.
The specimen is bisected and submitted entirely in BA.
