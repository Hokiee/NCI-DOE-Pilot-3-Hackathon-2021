Diagnosis:

This is a moderately differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma of the colon with focal penetration
of the tunica muscularis and infiltration of the pericolic fatty tissue. The surface of the tumor
shows necroses, in the periphery of the tumor is a moderate lymphocytic inﬂammatory reaction.
The oral resection margin shows a normal, tumor-free ileum wall; the aboral resection margin
shows a tumor-free colon wall. The area of the central vascular ligature is tumor-free.

The polyps described are tubulovillous adenomas, in some cases with slight dysplasia.

The omentum shows the metastasis of a poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. The
differentiation of this adenocarcinoma differs markedly from the adenocarcinoma in the right
ﬂexure (but see 111).

The 15 lymph nodes are tumor-free and show reactive hyperplasia.

Tumor classification:
ICDO-DA-M 8140/3
pT 3, pNO, ROI G2.
