SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

Patient: “ Specimen #:

ADDENDUM:
HERZ/NEU BY FISH = 1.1 NOT AMPLIFIED

TEST: FISH for detection of HERZ-neu gene amplification (Path Vision Her2
DNA probe by Vysis). Ratio of Her2-neu over chromosome 17 signals.

RANGE FOR INTERPRETATION:
Ratio less than 2.0: HERZ—neu gene amplification not observed.
Ratio equal to or greater than 2.0: HERZ—neu gene amplification
observed.

ER/PR IMMUNOSTAINS ARE NEGATIVE.

CIINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY:
.IO FEMALE WITH SMALL lX.6CM COMPLEX MASS BY U/S AT INFERIOR/LATERAL

RETROAREOLAR

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
FIBROUS TISSUE VS MALIGNANCY

POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Post—operative Diagnosis: SAA

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

RIGHT BREAST TISSUE "inferior lateral retro-areola" consists of a single
irregularly shaped fragment of fibro fatty tissue, which previously has
been inked and sectioned. When reapproximated, the specimen measures 2 x
l x 1 cm. The previous sectioning reveals that the specimen is mostly fat
with admixed fibrous tissue. The specimen is placed in its entirety

in the 5 gray cassettes marked Al—AS. The specimen was previously
inked blue before being received by this observer.
