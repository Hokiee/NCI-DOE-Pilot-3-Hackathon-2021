COMMENT

The intact tissue sections in part P are negative for invasive tumor. The overall findings favor an interpretation of no tumor
present.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) CONTENTS SUBMENTAL TRIANGLE — A portion of yellow-tan adipose tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.1 x 1 cm. Five potential
lymph nodes are found, ranging in greatest dimension from 0.3 to 0.6 cm. No tumor is seen rossly.

SECTION CODE: A1, five potential lymph nodes; A2, remainder of specimen. i
(B) CONTENTS RIGHT LEVEL 1 — A portion of adipose tissue measuring 4.1 x 3 x 1.5 cm. This measurement includes the
salivary gland, which measures 3 x 1 x 1 cm. Three potential lymph nodes are found, ranging in size from 0.5 to 1 cm in
greatest dimension. The salivary gland is serially sectioned and appears unremarkable.

SECTION CODE: B1, three potential lymph nodes (one bisecteil liked in blue); B2, adipose tissue from specimen (all
adipose tissue is submitted); B3, representative portion of salivary glan

*FS/DX: DETACHED FRAGMENT OF CARCINOMA IN FIBRIN (? CONTAMINANT).
(C) COMPOSITE RESECTION, TOTAL LARYNGECTOMY, TOTAL GLOSSECTOMY - The gue (8 x 7 x 3.5 cm)
and attached larynx with attached first trachea ring (8 x 5 x 4 cm). There is an ulcerated lesion (4 x 3 cm), obliterating the base
of the tongue, epiglottis, and pharynx bilaterally. An ill-deﬁned tumor associated with the ulcer invades the base of tongue,
hyoid bone, left inferior (ventral) surface of the tongue and soft tissue/ skeletal muscle deep to tongue at the neck. No tumor is
identified within the larynx. Thyroid gland is not present.

SECTION CODE: C1, CZ, midline— tumorwith base of tongue; CS, ulcerated region left; C4, ulcerated region right; C5,
06, ulceration with deep skeletal muscle extending to neck/chin region; C7, ulcerated tumor with epiglottis; CB 09 additional
ulceration bed; 010, para- laryngeal soft tissue; C11, left transglottic section' C12. right transglottic section. _

C13, representative section of hyoid bone for decalcification. -
