GROSS EXAMINATION:

A. "Rightmbreast mass #1", received fresh labeled with the patient's name and
record”humber for frozen section is a 4 x 2.9 x 2.2 cm specimen with a 2 x 2 x
1.3 cm tumor. The frozen section remnant is submitted in A1. A2—A4 represent
full cross sections of the tumor and adjacent tissue.

B. "Right breast, long lateral short superior", received fresh is a right
mastectomy specimen weighing 2040 grams. The skin ellipse measures 34.5 x
17.5 cm, has a 4 cm areola and a 0.9 cm nipple. A suture marks the lateral
aspect of the specimen. The breast measures 35 x 23 x 6 cm with an 8 x 6.5 x
1 cm axillary tail. In the upper outer quadrant is a recent sutured surgical
incision 7 cm. The soft tissue margins are inked blue. Sectioning shows a
recent biopsy cavity approximately 5 cm in diameter deep to the suture. 0n
the medial aspect of this biopsy cavity, another tumor is identified. While
contiguous with the cavity, the bulk of the tumor is more medial. This is felt
to represent a single "dumbell" shaped tumor rather than two separate tumors.
Maximal dimensions of this tumor are 5 x 3.5 x 3 cm. This tumor is also
located in the upper lateral quadrant and is 2 cm from the deep resection
margin. FUrther firm tissue suspicious for tumor is identified in the lateral
aspect of the biopsy cavity and measures 2 cm. Again this is 2 cm from the
deep resection margin. Measuring from the medially located tumor to the
lesion present at the lateral aspect of the biopsy cavity the maximum tumor
diameter is 7 cm. The axilla is sampled from medial to lateral.

BLOCK SUMMARY:

Bl - lateral aspect of biopsy cavity.

82 — medial aspect of the biopsy cavity.
B3&B4 - tumor in upper outer quadrant
B5 - tissue from lower lateral quadrant.
56 - tissue, upper inner quadrant.

B7 ~ tissue, lower inner quadrant.

BB&BQ ~ nipple

BlO&Bll — deep margin

312 — one lymph node, serially sectioned.
B13 - two lymph nodes, one inked red.
814 - three node candidates.

BlS — one lymph node

316 — highest node (ngggggggggg)

**REVISED DIAGNOSIS**:

This report is being revised to correct the specimen "B" site from "left" to
"right" breast. The remainder of the diagnosis is unchanged.

A. "RIGHT BREAST MASS", (INCISIONAL BIOPSY):

INFILTRATE DUCTAL CARCINOMA WITH PROMINENT CRIBRIFORM PATTERN.

COMMENT: The tumor size in the mastectomy specimen is 7 cm in greatest
dimension and the size of the tumor in the incisional biopsy is 2 cm. The
overall tumor size is mostly likely 9 cm in greatest dimension.

ADDENDUM 1:

Tissue was sent to the for assay of the estrogen
and progesterone receptors. The estrogen receptor activity was judged to be
positive with an estimated FMOL value of 113. The progesterone receptor
activity was judged as borderline with an estimated FMOL of value of 14.
