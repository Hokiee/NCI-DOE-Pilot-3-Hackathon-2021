CATEGORY: SARCOMA—uLEIOMYOSARCOMA

FROM PRIMARY GYNECOLOGIC SURGERY

CLINICAL HISTORY - Pelvic mass.

UTERUS, TUBES AND OVARIES (57g) - Inactive endometrium. Leiomyomas. Ovaries with
epithelial inclusions and corpora albicantia. Left ovary with serous cystadenoma. Fallopian tubes
with no diagnostic change.

CERVICAL MASS - Leiomyosarcoma with necrosis. No vascular invasion is seen. The
parametrial soﬁ tissue margin is free of tumor. Sections of the cervical resection margin pending.
An addendum will follow. Addendum: The mitotic count varies in different sections of the tumor,
but is as high as 102 mitotic ﬁgures per 10 HPF (slide B7). Additional sections of the cervical
resection margin (B 13) and the tumor with adjacent endocervix (BM-BIS) show that the cervical
resection margin is free of tumor.
