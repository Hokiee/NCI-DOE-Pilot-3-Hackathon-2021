These immunohistochemlstry and/or ln-sttu hybridization tests were developed and their nertnmance characteristics
determined by the immmohistochemistry and ln-situ hybridization laboratories a1 - hey may not have

been cleared or approved by the U.5. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, the FDA has ueremuned that such
clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as
investigational or for research.
