  

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

‘ PART 1: LYMPH NODE, RIGHT AXILLARY, SENTINEL NUMBER 1, EXCISION —

ONE LYMPH NODE, FREE OF METASTATIC CARCINOMA (0/1).
PART 2W, TOTAL MASTECTOMY —

A MULTIFOCAL INVA§11E DUCTAL CARCINOMA.
B. THE LARGEST INVASIVE TUMOR MEASURES 1. CM AND IS LOCATED AT THE JUNCTION OF THE UPPER
OUTER QUADRANT AND LOWER OUTER QUADRANT.
C. THE SMALLER INVASIVE TUMOR MEASURES 1.0 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSION AND IS LOCATED IN THE
UPPER OUTER QUADRANT, SUPEROMEDIAL To THE LARGER TUMOR.
D. TUMORS ARE SIMILAR IN MORPHOLOGIC APPEARANCE.
E. NOTTINGHAM GRADE 2 (TUBULE FORMATION 3, NUCLEAR PLEOMORPHISM 2, MITOTIC ACTIVITY 1,
TOTAL SCORE 6/9).
F. DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), NUCLEAR GRADE 2; SOLID, CRIBRIFORM, AND MICROPAPILLARY
TYPES WITH ASSOCIATED MICROCALCIFICATIONS.
G. DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS) CONSTITUTES APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THE TOTAL LARGER
TUMOR MASS AND APPROXIMATELY 20% OF THE SMALLER TUMOR MASS.
H. DCIS IS PRESENT ADMIXED AND ADJACENT TO THE INVASIVE COMPONENT.
I. NO LYMPHOVASCULAR SPACE INVASION ls NOTED.
J. RESECTION MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA: ALL MARGINS ARE GREATER THAN 0.5 CM
AWAY FROM CARCINOMA.
K. ATYPICAL DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA.
L. FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES, COLUMNAR CELL CHANGE, PSEUDOANGIOMATOUS STROMAL HYPERPLASIA,
AND FOCAL MICROCALCIFICATIONS.
M. PREVIOUS BIOPSY SITE CHANGES (AT EACH TUMOR).
N. BOTH INVASIVEM CELLS ARE POSITIVE FOR ESTROGEN AND PROGESTERONE RECEPTORS, AND
NEGATIVE FOR HER-men IBY FISHIASACRRREVIOLISRAJ'HQLQGY REPORI ‘
