’ SPECIMEN

Bladder and prostate.

CLINICAL DETAILS , ‘
Invasive bladder cancer. Extensive desmoplastic reaction ?tumour.

MACROSCOPY

Cystoprostatectomy weighing 375 g. The prostate measures 25x43x32 mm. The
bladder measures 55x70x65 mm. There is a ulcerated tumour at the posterior
bladder wall. It measures 50 mm x 30 mm with a thickness of 23 mm with invasion
of the bladder wall, but not obviously beyond into perivesical tissue. The
tumour is close to the seminal vesicles and the posterior resection margin.
MICROSCOPY

The bladder contains an ulcerated poorly-differentiated micropapillary,
transitional cell carcinoma with lymphovascular and perineural invasion. The
surface shows multinucleated giant cells amidst the granulation tissue. The
tumour is confined to the posterior bladder wall. The tumour infiltrates beyond
the muscularis propria of the posterior bladder wall with microscopic invasion
of vesical fat and is 2 mm away from the deep posterior margin. The tumour has
an accompanying fibrous response and abuts but does not invade the seminal
vesicles or prostate. Two separate deposits of tumour are seen distant from the
main mass, near the anterior wall.

The flat urothelium is not dysplastic. 5
See also * . for further information: both of the ureteric resections
show no evidence of malignancy.

The prostate shows hyperplasia and no evidence of prostatio adenocarcinoma nor
invasion by the bladder tumour.

SUMMARY

The features are those of a grade 3 transitional cell carcinoma of
micropapillary type, pT3a Nx Mx.
