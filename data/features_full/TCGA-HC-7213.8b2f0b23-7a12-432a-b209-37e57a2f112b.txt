GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in two formalin ﬁlled containers

labeled with the patient's name

A. Additionally labeled #1 and contains a 5.5 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm

aggregate of yellow-tan ﬁbrofatty soft tissue. On

palpation. four ﬁrm fatty possible lymph nodes are

identiﬁed ranging from 0.2 up to 3.0 cm in greatest

dimension. They are entirely submitted in cassettes A14

labeled designated as follows: 'l--two whole - 1n
possible lymph nodes; 2—one whole possible bisected lymph
node; 3-4—one whole possible bisected lymph node.

B. Additionally labeled #2 and contains a 42.5
gram. 4.5 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm prostate received with attached
bilateral adnexa having overall dimensions of 5.0 x 3.0 x

2.0 cm. The capsule is pink-tan smooth to shaggy. The
specimen is inked as follows: right side - blue; and left

side - black. The base and apical margins are coned and
serially sectioned. The remainder of the gland is serially
sectioned from apex to base to reveal a pink—tan focally
cystic cut surface with diffuse periurethral nodularity. A

3.5 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm yellow-tan nodular. glistening mass is
present within the right base and partially surrounds the

right seminal vesicle. This macs abuts the inked soft tissue
margin. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes
B‘l-22 labeled designated as follows: ‘l——right
prostatelseminal vesicle junction; 2—Ieft prostatelseminal
vesicle junction; 3—4—apicai margin, perpendicular;

5—6--base margin, perpendicular; T-‘lO--mass to inked soft
tissue margin and right seminal vesicle; 11-13--right _
anterior prostate. apex to base; B14-16--right posterior .
prostate. apex to base; 17—19—left anterior prostate, apex

to base; 20-22—«lett posterior prostate. apex to base.
