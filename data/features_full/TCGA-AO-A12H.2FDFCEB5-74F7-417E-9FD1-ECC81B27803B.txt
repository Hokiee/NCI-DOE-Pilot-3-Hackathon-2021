4) The specimen is received trash labeled. "Right breast. stitch marks
axillary toil" and consists of a breast measuring 25.2 x 24.6 x 3.2 cm with
overlying skin ellipse measuring 15.1 x 14.6 cm. Situated centrally on the
skin surface is an averted nipple measuring 1.1 cm and areola measuring 4.1
x 4.2 cm. There is no scar on the skin surface. A suture demarcatcs the
axillary aspect. The posterior surface of the breast is inked black and the
axillary aspect is inked green. The specimen is serially sectioned to
reveal a 2.5 x 2.2 x 2.3 cm well circumscribed, brown, focally hemorrhagic
mess located at the 11 o'clock axis (upper outer quadrant), 0.9 cm from the
deep margin. A metallic clip is identified adjacent to this lesion.
Additionally, a 1.7 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm fibrous area with areas of hemorrhage and
necrosis is present inferior to the 2.5 on mass in the 11 o'clock axis in
the retroareolnr region. No other masses or lesions are grossly identified.
The cut surfaces are composed of 60% fatty and 40% fibrous tissue.
Sectioning of the axillary aspect reveals no grossly identifiable lymph
nodes. Tissue submitted for TPS. Representative sections are submitted.

Summary of sections:
N - nipple

NB - nipple base

S - skin

D — deep margin

T ~ tumor

UIQ - upper inner quadrant
L10 ~ lower inner quadrant
U09 - upper outer quadrant
LOQ - lower outer quadrant
RA - retroareolar fibrous tissue

5) The specimen is received in {ornalin labeled. "Sentinel nodes #4 and
5, level 1. right axilla”. and consists of two tan lymph nodes measuring 2
cm and 0.8 cm respectively. Both are bisected and entirely submitted.

Summary of sections:
LLN ~ larger lymph node (bisected and submitted in two cassettes)
SLR - smaller lymph node

 

6) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Non-sentinel nodes
right axilla' and consist: of multiple pink tan firm lymph nodes ranging
from 0.2 cm to 2.1 cm in greatest dimension. All identified lymph nodes are
submitted.

Summary of sections:

LN - lymph nodes

BLN - bisected lymph node

LLN - largest lymph node bisected and submitted in two cassettes
