lateral breast measuring 18 x 16 x 3 cm. The round skin ellipse measures 5.5 x 4.0 cm in maximum dimensions.
The nipple is ﬂat and an unremarkable measures 1.4 x 1.4 cm in maximum dimensions. The areolar is dark
brown and unremarkable. The fascia is smooth and glistening. The anterior margin is inked red and the deep
posterior margin of resection is inked black. On sectioning, there is an ill-deﬁned cavitated mass surrounded by
ﬁrm ﬁbrous pink~yellow tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 cm. The mass is at 12:00, approximately 5 cm from the
nipple, 0.5 cm from the anterior margin and 3.5 cm from the posterior margin. On further sectioning there is a
second lobulated ﬁrm pink yellow mass measuring 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm, this mass is at 3:00, approximately 7 cm
li'om the ﬁrst mass at 12:00, 5 cm from the nipple, 0.6 cm from the anterior margin and 2.3 cm from the deep
posterior margin mass. The surrounding breast parenchyma is nodular and shows an area of hemorrhage
previously inked blue. Representative sections are submitted.

HER—ZNEU: SCORE 2+, EQUIVOCAL.

Immunolustochemical studies were performed on formalin ﬁxed parafﬁn embedded tissue (Blocks B4 and B7)
using the following menoclonal antibodies: Estrogen receptor (Clone SP1), Progesterone receptor (Clone 1132)
and Her—Zneu ( Clone 485); control sections for HER-ZNeu are provided within a kit (score 0 MCF—7,
score 1+ T—47D, score 2+ MBA-M3453, score 3+ BT474). Detection system used: polymer. Primary
antibodies, reagents and control sections for HER—211w are all provided by

All controls show appropriate reactivity.

Reactivity of Estrogen and Progesterone receptors is determined based on the percentage of positively

stained nuclei of tumor cells. Reference values (CAP accreditation program checklist 2010 and guidelines on
webpage):

Positive: nuclear staining in 1% or greater than 1% of invasive carcinoma cells

Negative : nuclear staining in less than 1% of invasive carcinoma cells

Staining intensity: is reported as weak, moderate or strong.

HER-Zneu reactivity; is reported applying the CAP scoring guidelines (CAP accreditation program checklist
2010 and guidelines on webpage):

Score 0 = Negative. No immunoreactivity, or faint weak immunoreactivity in <lO% oftumor cells but only a
portion of the membrane 15 positive"

Score 1 == Negative: Faint weak immunoreactivity in 10% or >l0% of tumor cells but only a portion of the
membrane is positive.

Score 2+ = Equjvocalz Weak to moderate complete membrane inununoreactivity in >10% of tumor cells or
circumferential intense membrane staining in (30% of cells.

Score 3+ =- Positive: More than 30% of the tumor cells must show circumferential intense and uniform
membrane staining. A homogeneous (chicken wire) pattern should be present.

Equivocal results for HER-Zneu (Score 2+) will be subsequently followed by a reflex dual-color ISH testing.

SPECIMEN TYPE: The HER2 Dual ISH-DNA is performed on a formalin-ﬁxed paraiﬁn-ombeddcd
tissue slide ﬁ'om block B7. -
DESCRJI’TION OF THE ASSAY: The HERZ Dual ISH DNA Probe assay

enables the HERZ gene and Chrl7 centromere to be co-hybridized and visualized via light microscopy
on the same slide. Speciﬁcally for this assay, HERZ is detected by a dinitrophcnyl (DNP) labeled probe
visualized utilizing ' SISH DN'P (silver in situ hybridization) detection kit. The Chrl7 centromere is
targeted with a digoxigenin (DIG) labeled probe. and detected using Red ISH DIG detection kit. Dual
ISH staining results in visualization by light microscopy and which HERZ appears as discrete black signals
(SISH) and Chrl 7 as red signals in nuclei of normal cells sewing as internal positive control for staining) as
well as in carcinoma cells.

SLIDE SCORING: Once an adequate target area is identiﬁed the reader records the scores for HER2 and
Chrl‘l- copy numbers that are present in 20 representative nuclei. If the resulting HERZ / Chr17 ratio falls within
1.8«22. CEQUI'VOCAL) the reader is recommended to» score an additional 20 nuclei and the resulting ratio is
calculated from the total 40 nuclei. HER2 gen-e status is reported as non-ampliﬁed (HER2/ Chr17 < 2.0) or
ampliﬁed (HER2/Chrl7 _>. 2.0).

The performance characteristics of this assay were determined by the _

This assay has been approved by the LLS. Food and Drug
Administration. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLLA-BS) as qualiﬁed to
