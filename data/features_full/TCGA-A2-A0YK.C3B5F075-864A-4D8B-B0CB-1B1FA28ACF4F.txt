PART A RECEIVED 1.1133ka MASTECTOMY STITCH AT
12 O'CLOCK, IS A SIMPLE TEC‘I‘OMY SPEC INC 15 x 15 x 3.5 CM IN

GREATEST DIMENSIONS. THE NIPPLE IS IN THE INFERIOR PORTION OF A SKIN
ELLIPSE MEASURING 9.7 X 5.5 CM IN GREATEST DIMENSIONS. A SUTURE DENOTES
12 O'CLOCK. BLUE DYE IS NOTED IN THE SUPERIOR PORTION OF THE SPECIMEN.
THE SUPERFICIAL MARGIN IS MARKED IN BLUE INK, THE DEEP MARGIN IN BLACK
INK. SECTIONING REVEALS THE CENTRAL ASPECT OF THE BREAST TO CONSIST OP
DENSE TAN FIBROUS TISSUE WITH FOCAL CYSTIC AREAS WITH BROWN MUCINOUS
MATERIAL. THIS IS SURROUNDED BY BLAND YELLOW FATTY TISSUE AT THE
PERIMETER. IN THE SUPERIOR 12 O’CLOCK AREA, THERE IS A DISTINCT PINK-TAN
GRITTY AREA WITHIN THIS FIBROUS TISSUE WHICH MEASURES 1.6 X 1.3 X 3.5 CM,
WHICH SPANS INTO THE 2 O’CLOCK AREA WHERE THERE IS FOCAL RED-TAN
DISCOLORATION SUGGESTIVE OF PREVIOUS BIOPSY. GROSSLY, THESE AREAS OF
FIRMNESS ARE CONTIGUOUS. THIS LESION IS 0.5 CM FROM THE DEEP MARGIN. A
WING CLIP IS IDENTIFIED IN THIS 12 O’CLOCK AREA. SECTIONS ARE SUBMITTED
AS FOLLOWS: A1--SKIN AND NIPPLE, A2 AND 3--12 O’CLOCK LESION WITH DEEP
MARGIN (MIRROR IMAGE TO PROTOCOL), A4--TISSUE SUPERFICIAL TO LESION TO
