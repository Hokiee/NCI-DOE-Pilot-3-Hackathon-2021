Intraoperative Consultation:

An intraoperative non—microscopic consultation was obtained and interpreted as:
“Called to pick up 'right tube and ovary,‘ consisting of a 3.5 x 2.7 x 2.5 cm
ovary with smooth serosal surface, and solid cystic areas. Solid component
measures 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm, and 2 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm (two nodules) with papillary
cut surface. Unremarkable fallopian tube measures 6 x 0.8 cm. A section is cut
for frozen section (F81) . Rest for permanents,“ by

A second intraoperative non—microscopic consultation was obtained and
interpreted as: "Called to pick up 'left tube and ovary,-' consisting of a 3 x 2

fallopian tube. Ovarian cut surface is tan—white. Tumor and fallo ian tube for
tumor bank. No frozen. All for permanents,‘1 by — '

Gross Description

The specimens are received in thirteen formalin—filled containers, each labeled
The first container is labeled “right tube and ovary.I It

con aims a preViously—opened ovary that weighs 19.17 grams, along with the

attached fallopian tube. The measurements are consistent with those in the

intraoperative consultation. Also in the container is a frozen section cassette

labeled "F51,“ with tan—white tissue measuring 2.1 x 2 x 0.2 cm. Submitted as
A1. Additional sections submitted in A2 to A4. A5 - fallopian tube.

The second container is labeled "left tube and ovary.I It contains a 15.07 gram
tubo~ovarian complex. The ovary measures 2.5 x 2 x 1.6 cm. The fallopian tube

is adhesed to the ovary, and measures 2.2 x 0.6 cm. The surface of the ovary is
irregular. Labeled Bl to B4 — ovary; BS — ovary and fallopian tube.

The third container is labeled "anterior culwde—sac.” It contains a bite—tan
fragment of fatty tissue measuring 1.2 x 1.2 x 1 cm.
The fourth container is labeled ”posterior cul—de—sac. ains a soft
tissue fragment measuring 1.1 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm.

The fifth container is labeled 'left elvic sidewall.“ It contains a 1 x 0.3 x
0.3 cm —"

The sixth container is labeled ”right pelvic sideWall.‘ It contains a 1 x 0.5 x
0.3 cm yellow—tan fatty tissue. .

The seventh container is labeled “right gutter." It contains a l‘x 0.4 x 0.4 cm
fatty tissue. '

The eighth container is labeled "left gutter.“ It contains two ellow-tan
fragments of as... measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm each. *
The ninth container is labeled “left pelvic lymph nodes. con ains atty

tissue measuring, in aggregate, 6 x 5 x 2 cm. Labeled II to IS — one putative
lymph node bisected each; 16 — multiple single lymph nodes.

The tenth container is labeled ”right pelvic lymph nodes.u It contains
fibrofatty tissue measuring ~7 x 5 x 1 cm. Labeled J1 to US — single putative
lymph node bisected; J6 - individual single lymph node.

The eleventh container is labeled “right common peri—aortic lymph node.‘ It

contains a single 3 x 2 x 1 cm yellow fatty tissue. Entire tissue a ears to be

a putative single lymph node. Serially sectioned. *
-

The twelfth container is labeled 'left common peri—aortic lymph node.II It

contains two fatty fragments of tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.6 and 1.5 x 1 x

0.3 cm. Labeled L1 — smaller fragment bisected; L2 — larger fragment in

multiple sections. '

The thirteenth container is labeled ‘omentum.' It conEains a 100~gram omentum

measuring 15 x 5 x 1 om. There are no papillary projections, or tumor nodules

noted on the omental surface. Labeled M1 to M5. Jar 2.

E!!!!!I!I!C REPORTING FORM FOR MALIGNANT OVARIAN NEOPLASMS

HISTOPATHOLOGIC TYPE
The histologic diagnosis is serous adenocarcinoma

  
 
 
 
 

TUMOR LOCATION
The locations of the primary tumor(s) are the right and left ovary (synchronous
primary tumors)

HISTOLOGIC GRADE
The histologic grade is poorly differentiated {G3)

TUMOR INVASION :
Tumor does invade the adjacent fallopian tube/peritubal soft tissue

TUMOR INVOLVEMENT
Tumor involvement of the pelvic peritoneum/soft tissue is absent

PRIMARY TUMOR (T)

Page 3 of 4

 

 

 

 

Based on the above information, the primary tumor is classified as extension
and/or implants on uterus and/or tubes (T2a/IIA)

REGIONAL LYMPH NODES (N)

The regional lymph nodes are classified as no regional lymph node metastasis
(NO)

The total number of regional lymph nodes examined is 19

DISTANT METASTASIS (M)
The status of distant tumor site cannot be assessed (MK)
