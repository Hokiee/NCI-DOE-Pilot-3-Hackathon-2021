' .
The second dominant tumor measures 0.9 cm in the left lobe and it exhibits an invasive grown-i pattern with focal hobneii cell
change and shuts focally the painted surgical margins. Since the surgical margins are involved by tumor and no extrathyroidal
tissue is included in this specimen. evaluation of extrathyroidal extension cannot be reliably performed on this specimen.
