HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT

 

Recent melanoma right back. 1. Mid right back with previous R/T failedQZ. Tumour lateral right back.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

 

Two specimens were received.

1. "R BACK". The specimen consists of an unorientated ellipse of skin measuring 23 x 8mm with an
underlying piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 12mm in depth. Resection margins inked blue. No signiﬁcant
abnormality noted on the skin surface. The specimen is transversely sectioned from one end to the other. All
embedded serially in blocks A - B.

2. “R LATERAL BACK". The specimen consists of an ellipse of skin measaring 68 x 30 x 23mm with a
central linear scar measuring 28mm. The specimen was already ? incised on deep surface prior to receipt.
Resection margin and inside of the? incised area inked blue and deep surface of the skin adjacent to the
incisions is inked black. Specimen was taken for tumour banking. Specimen is serially and transversely
sectioned from one end to the other. Sectioning of the specimen shows a tumour in subcutaneous tissue
measuring 30 x 22 x 15mm in maximum extent. The tumour lies about 2mm from deep margin.

A - C. Representative sections of the tumour with closest deep margin.

MICROSCOPIC REPORT
1. "R BACK";

 

The sections show recurrent melanoma associated with a scar. The lesion is about 9mm across and extends to
a depth of 13mm in deep dermis and subcutis. The lesion is poorly circumscribed but appears clear of
margins by about 0.2mm. The lesion is composed of large, markedly pleomorphic cells with an epithelioid
appearance. Mitoses are frequent.

2. "R LATERAL BACK".

The sections show a central nodule of metastatic melanoma about 15mm across and portion of a deeper
lesion 7mm across involving the deep margin. The cells are epithelioid in appearance but smaller and less

pleomorphic than in specimen 1. Immunoperoxidase staining is positive for $100, HMB45 and Melan-A but
negative for cytokeratin, conﬁrming melanoma.
