The specimens are received In eight formalin-tilled containers, each labeled .' The first container is
labeled “uterus. cervix. bilateral tubes and ovaries.‘ it contains a uterus with attached cervix and bilateral fallopian
tubes weighing 114 grams. The uterus and cervix measure 8.4 cm irom superior to interior x 5.5 cm from corriu to
comu x 4.5 cm from anterior to posterior. The cervix itsell measures 3.2 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm. The aerosol surface at the
uterus is tan-pink to purple and unremarkable. The ectocerle measures 3.0 x 2.8 cm. The comical as is slit-like.
measuring 0.9 x 0.3 cm. The ectocervix is tan~pink and slightly hemorrhagic. Nabothian cysts are noted at the 6 to 8
o‘clock position. The uterus and cervix have been previously opened. The endometrisl cavity is expanded by a tumor

wall thickness is 1.2 cm. A circumscribed nodular mass is located within the myometrium ol the anterior. lower and
mid-uterine segment. On cut surface, it has a white-pink. whoried texture. it measures 1.5 x 0.9 x 1.3 cm. It most
resembles a well circumscribed lelomyoma. The portion at myometrium not Involved by tumor measures 1.4 cm in
thickness. The remainder oi the endometrium that does not appear to be involved by tumor measures - 0.2 cm in
thickness. The tumor approaches the lower uterine segment at the border between the middle and lower uterine

0.3 x 0.3 cm. The lalioplan tube lumen is pinpoint and the lallopian tube wall thickness Is 02 cm. The right ovary is
serially sectioned and reveals unremarkable ovarian tissue. The lelt ovary measures 2.3 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm. The serosal

surtacs is tan-yellow and unremarkable. The left ovary is serially sectioned and reveals unremarkable ovarian
parenchyme. The left fallopian tube measures 5.5 cm in length with an average diameter of 0.5 cm. There are multiple
associated paratubel cysts. ranging from 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm to 1.5 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm. The lumen of the fallopian tube is
pinpoint. and the wall thickness measures 0.2 cm. Labeled A1 - anterior ectocerle and endocerle at 12 o'clock; A2 -
posterior ectocerle and endocerle at 6-7 o'clock; A3 - anterior lower and middle uterine segment where the tumor
most closely approaches the endocervlcal canal; A4. A5 - contiguous sections OI middle and upper uterine segment:
A6 to A8 - additional sections at tumor In the anterior endometrium, where it appears to most closely approach the
aerosol surface; A9 - anterior endomyometrlum. containing circumscribed nodule; A10, A11 - contiguous sections 01

ovary and fallopian tube including paratubal cyst. Jar 4.

The second container is labeled ‘lelt external lilac lymph nodes.‘ it contains two yellow-maroon, llbrolatty, soft tissue
fragments. measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm and 4.3 x 3.8 x 0.8 cm. Within this tissue. four possible lymph nodes are
identified. ranging lrom 0.7 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm to 3.0 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm. The possible lymph nodes are entirely submitted in
81, B2 - one lymph node bisected; as - three possible lymph nodes. Jar 1.

The third container is labeled 'lelt obturator lymph nodes.‘ it contains a yellow to maroon, flbrolatty. soft tissue
lragment, measuring 3.7 x 2.0 x 0.4 cm. Within this tissue. three possible lymph nodes are identified, ranging from 0.3
x 0.2 x 0.1 cm to 2.3 x 1.2 x 0.4 cm. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted in cassette Ct - one possible lymph node:
C2 ~ two possible lymph nodes. Jar 1.

The fourth container is labeled 'right external lilac lymph node.‘ it contains within this tissue. ﬁve possible lymph
nodes, ranging from 0.4 x 0.2 x 0.3 cm to 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.3 cm. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted. Labeled D1 -
three possible lymph nodes; D2 - two possible lymph nodes. Jar 1.

‘The lilth container is labeled 'right obturator lymph nodes.‘ it contains multiple fragments ol maroon to yellow librolatty
tissue. measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm in aggregate. Within this tissue. five possible lymph nodes are identified
measuring 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm to 2.0 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted in cassettes El - one
possible lymph node; and 52 - tour possible lymph nodes. Jar 1.

The sixth container is labeled 'right perlsortic lymph nodes.‘ it contains two, yellow to maroon. fibrolatty. soft tissue
fragments. measuring 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm and 2.2 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm. Within this tissue. two possible lymph nodes are
Identified. measuring 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm and 2.1 x 1.3 x 0.4 cm. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted in cassette F1.

The seventh container is labeled 'Ielt perlaortic lymph nodes.’ it contains a yellow to maroon. flbrofalty, soft tissue
lragment. measuring 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm. Within this tissue. one possible lymph node is identified, measuring 0.9 x 0.0 x
0.3 cm. Labeled Gl - one possible lymph node entirely submitted. Jar 1.

The eighth container ls labeled 'omentum.‘ it contains a portion of yellow to maroon omentum measuring 4.8 x 4.6 x
