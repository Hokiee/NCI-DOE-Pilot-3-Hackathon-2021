DIAGNOSIS
(A) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND:

 

RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (16.0 CM MAXIMUM DIMENSION), CONVENTIONAL TYPE

(50% CLEAR CELLS,

50% EOSINOPHILIC CELLS), FUHRMAN NUCLEAR GRADE 4, INVASIVE
INTO PERINEPHRIC

ADIPOSE TISSUE, RENAL SINUS ADIPOSE TISSUE, RENAL
PELVICALYCEAL SYSTEM, AND RENAL

VEIN, WITH EXTENSION TO RENAL VEIN MARGIN. (SEE COMMENT).
Adrenal gland, no tumor present.
Soft tissue margin free of tumor.
(B) THROMBUS:

CONVENTIONAL RENAL CELL CARCINOMA ATTACHED TO VESSEL WALL.

COMMENT

Renal cell carcinoma in the left kidney shows multifocal necrosis.
Tumor invades into the renal vein and is present in the wall of the
renal vein at the margin. Tumor extensively invades the perinephric
adipose tissue, the renal sinus adipose tissue, and also the
pelvicalyceal system.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
(A) LEFT KIDNEY AND ADRENAL GLAND - A 22.0 x 14.5 x 11.0 cm radical
nephrectomy specimen with attached segment of grossly unremarkable
ureter (5.0 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter) and grossly
unremarkable adrenal gland (6.5 x 2.7 x 1.1 cm).
A 16.0 x 12.0 x 10.0 cm mass is identified in the lower portion of the
kidney. The cut surface of the mass is yellow-tan and diffusely
necrotic with areas of hemorrhage. The tumor shows diffuse involvement
of the perinephric adipose tissue. Grossly, the mass extends into the
renal sinus adipose tissue and the renal pelvicalyceal system. A 2.5 x
1.5 x 1.5 cm tumor thrombus is identiﬁed within the renal vein, which
extends to the renal vein margin.
The remainder of the renal parenchyma is grossly unremarkable. No mass
is identiﬁed within the adrenal gland.
INK CODE: Blue - resection margin at the Gerota's fascia.

SECTION CODE: A1, resection margins of renal vein, ureter, and
renal artery; A2-A4, tumor with Gerota's fascia resection margin; A5-A6,
tumor with perinephric adipose tissue involvement; A7-A11,
representative sections from the tumor; A12-A15, tumor within renal
pelvis; A16, A17, tumor within the renal vein; A18, tumor extension
identiﬁed within the perinephric adipose tissue; A19, A20,
representative sections from the uninvolved kidney; A21 , A22,
representative sections from the adrenal gland. HW/mmc
(B) THROMBUS - Two tumor thrombi measuring 4.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm and 3.5 x
1.5 x 1.5 cm. A portion of the vessel wall is attached to the tumor

thrombus. The specimen is submitted in- -
