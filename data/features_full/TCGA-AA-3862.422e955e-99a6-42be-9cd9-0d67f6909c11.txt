Diagnosis:

This is a right-sided hemicolectomy preparation with a moderately differentiated
adenocarcinoma (in the ascending colon) of histopathological differentiation grade G2, with
erosions of the inner tumor surface, with carcinomatous lymphangitis, with tumor infiltration of
the colon wall layers into the pericolic fatty connective tissue with peritumorous chronic
recurrent secondary inﬂammation with an acute inﬂammatory ﬂare, with focal extracellular
mucus formation in the tumor tissue, with tumor-free lymph nodes (0/16) with a moderate
chronic lymphadenitis and with tumor-free overview slices from all other resection material
portions described. There is also a chronic appendicitis.

According to the section preparations available, the tumor spread of the colon carcinoma
corresponds to a tumor stage of pT3, pN0 (0/16), MX, L1, R0.
