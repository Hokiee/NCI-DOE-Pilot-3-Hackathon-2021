DIAGNOSIS:

A. Uterus, bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and

bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy: FIGO grade III (of III)
endometrial adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, is
identified forming "' M

a mass (3.6 x 2.5 x 2.2 cm) located in the anterior and
lateral

uterine wall. The tumor invades 1.7 cm into the
myometrium (total

wall thickness 2.0 cm). The tumor does not involve the
endocervix.

Lymphovascular space invasion is identified. There are
multiple

intramural leiomyomata ranging in size from 0.3 cm to 0.7
cm in
greatest dimension. The bilateral ovaries and fallopian

tubes are
atrophic and not involved.

B. Lymph node, right pelvic, biopsy: A single right
pelvic lymph

node is positive for metastatic carcinoma consistent with

endometrial primary.

C. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, biopsy: Multiple (2) left

pelvic
lymph nodes are positive for metastatic carcinoma

consistent with
endometrial primary.

examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled "uterus, bilateral fallopian
tubes and

ovaries" is a 100.0 gram uterus with attached bilateral
tubes and

ovaries. The uterine serosa is smooth. There is a 3.6 x
2.5 x 2.2

cm exophytic mass in the anterior and lateral walls of the
endometrial cavity, grossly invading 1.7 cm into a thick
myometrium.

There are multiple intramural leiomyomas, ranging in size
from 0.3

cm to 0.7 cm. There is a 2.5 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm right ovary
with a

smooth outer surface and a solid cut surface with a 5.7 x
0.5 cm

right fallopian tube which is unremarkable. There is a 2.6
x 1.4 x

0.6 cm left ovary with a smooth outer surface and a solid
cut

surface with a 5.5 x 0.7 cm left fallopian tube which is
unremarkable. Representative sections submitted.

B. Received fresh labeled "right pelvic nodes" is a 2.6 x
1.8 x 1.7

cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. Lymph nodes
all

submitted.

C. Received fresh labeled "left pelvic nodes" is a 3.1 x
1.5 x 1.2

cm aggregate of adipose and lymphatic tissue. Lymph nodes
all

submitted.
