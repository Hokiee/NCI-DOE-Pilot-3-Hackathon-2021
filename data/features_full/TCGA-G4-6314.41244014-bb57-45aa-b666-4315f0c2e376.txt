GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. RIGHT COLON, HEMICOLECTOMY:
Received in fresh state labeled with patient’s name and identification number and labeled as "right
colon". The specimen consists of a right hemicolectomy specimen. It consists of the ascending colon,
measuring 15 cm in length and with internal circumference ranging from
7.5 to 11.0 cm, attached terminal ileum measuring 6 cm in length and with internal circumference of 4
cm. A firm palpable mass is identified along the cecal area which shows a circumferential exophytic
ulcerated tumor mass measuring 5.5 x 4.0 x 3.0 cm which grossly involves the ileocecal valve and on
section grossly extends into the peri-cecal fat. A small 0.4 cm polyp seen 3 cm from the ileocecal valve
and 0.6 cm polyp located 7 cm from the distal resected margin and 7.5 cm from the ileocecal valve.
The appendix is not identified and the mucosa of ascending colon shows no other identifiable tumor
focus. Multiple sections are submitted and labeled as follows:

A1 : sections from polyp #1, 3 cm from the ileocecal valve area

A2: second polyp located 7 cm from the distal margin and 7.5 cm from the

ileocecal valve

A3: section from the proximal margin

A4: section from the distal margin

A5-A6: en bloc section of cecum, with tumor

A7-A8: en bloc section of cecal mass

A9-A10: additional sections from the tumor

A11: adjacent normal mucosa

A12-A13: possible six lymph nodes from the cecal region

A14: five possible lymph nodes near the cecal area

A15-A18: one lymph node sections from peri-cecal fatty tissue

A19-A25: one lymph node around tumor area

A26: sections of lymph nodes distal mid segment of the ascending colon

A27-A34: sections of lymph nodes from ascending colon

A35-37 lymphnodes.

B. PERITONEAL BIOPSY
Received in formalin is an unoriented piece of pink-tan soft tissue measuring 1.6 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm. The
surface has a powder-burn appearance. Specimen is bisected and submitted entirely in cassette B1.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. RIGHT COLON, RIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY:

- CIRCUMFERENTIAL, EXOPHYTIC, ULCERATED, INVASIVE, MODERATELY
TO POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA OF CECUM WITH
EXTENSION TO ILEOCECAL VALVE WITH FULL MUSCLE WALL
THICKNESS INVASION AND EXTENSION TO PERICOLIC FAT (WITH
LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION) AND METASTASIS TO FIFTY OUT
OF FIFTY-NINE PERICOLIC LYMPH NODES, WITH PERINODAL FAT
EXTENSION (50/59) AND WITH TUMOR IMPLANTS.

- SIZE OF TUMOR — 5.5 X 4.0 X 3.0 CM.

- TUBULOVILLOUS ADENOMA (0.6 CM.), 7.0 CM FROM THE DISTAL MARGIN,

- 0.4 CM POLYPOID ADENOCARCINOMA WITH SUBMUCOSAL EXTENSION

(3.0 cm from ileocecal valve,? SATELLITE).
- PROXIMAL AND DISTAL MARGINS OF THE SECTIONS ARE NEGATIVE.
- SEE NOTE.

Note: The appendix is not identified. Metastatic tumor to lymph nodes shows areas of necrosis and
calcification and there is Iymphovascular invasion.

B. PERITONEAL BIOPSY:
- POSITIVE FOR ADENOCARCINOMA.
