Gross Description:

Specimen A is labeled "left paratubal cyst" and consists of a
single'yellow/tan

soft tissue fragment measuring 1.1 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm. The external
surface is

yellow/tan, smooth, unremarkable. Cut section is smooth, with
thin walled

approximately 0.05 cm in diameter. Consists of serous yellow
fluid. The

specimen is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in block
A1,

Specimen B is received is one appropriately labeled container:
Specimen fixation: Formalin

Specimen type: Radical hysterectomy

Adnexa: Not present

Weight: 142.3 grams

Shape: Pear— shaped

Dimensions:

Height: 9.9 cm

Anterior to posterior width: 5.9 cm
Breadth at fundus: 6 cm

Serosa: Brown/tan, smooth and unremarkable
Orientation: Inking: anterior/blue, posterior/black

Cervix:

Tumor size: 3.9 cm superior to inferior, 3.3 cm in circumference
Tumor site: The tumor is circumferential except for a 0.6 cm
area on the posterior cervical lip. The tumor spans the external
08, extending

to the lower uterine segment. The tumor is brown/tan, somewhat
nodular, with

pushing heaped up edges. On cut section the tumor has a
thickness of 0.6 cm.

Ectocervical margin is 0.5 cm and the tumor abuts the right
lateral wall soft
tissue margin.
