INTERPRETATION AND DIAGNOSIS:

1. LUNG, RIGHT LOWER LOBE (LOBECTOMY): MODERATELY TO POORLY
DIFFERENTIATED INVASIVE SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA (SCM). THE TUMOR
EXTENDS SUBPLEURALLY, BUT DOES NOT INVADE THE VISCERAL PLEURA. ONE
(1) BENIGN HILAR LYMPH NODE. THE VASCULAR, BRONCHIAL AND STAPLED
MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR. THE PATHOLOGIC STAGE IS T2NOMX.

2. STATION 7, LYMPH NODE (EXCISION): TWO (2) LYMPH NODES AND
ASSOCIATED FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

3. R—11 LYMPH NODES (EXCISION): ONE (1) LYMPH NODE AND ASSOCIATED
FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

4. R—10 LYMPH NODES (EXCISION): ONE (1) LYMPH NODE AND ASSOCIATED
FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

5. R-4 LYMPH NODES (EXCISION): ONE (1) LYMPH NODE AND ASSOCIATED
FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.

PART #1: RIGHT LOWER LOBE RESECTION
Resident Pathologist:

The specimen is received fresh labeled "and designated
right lower lobe resection. It consists of one grossly recognizable
right lower lobe weighing 290 gm and measuring 16 x 13 x 4 cm.
Bronchial and vascular margins are shaved. Hilar lymph nodes are
sampled. Palpable tumor is noted. The surface is inked black. A
surgical stapled margin is noted. Hilar lymph nodes are sampled.
Palpable tumor is noted. Surface is inked black. A surgical stapled
margin is noted, measuring 7 cm in length. It is shaved and placed
in cassette A. Another stapled surgical margin is noted closer to the
hilum and meaSures 3 cm in length. It is shaved and placed in
cassette B. Another staple line is noted measuring 8 cm in the
apparent superior portion of the lobe. It is shaved and placed in
cassette C. The specimen is sectioned to reveal a firm white—gray
lohulated mass measuring 5 x 4.7 x 3 cm. This mass closely abuts the
hilar portion of the lung. In addition, it puckers to the pleura.
Representative sections of the hilar area representing probable
mucous plug in the bronchus are placed in cassette D. Normal lung is
placed in cassette E. Tumor's closest approach to hilar bronchi are
placed in cassettes FwG. Tumor does appear to invade bronchus.
Tumor‘s closest approach to pleura is placed in cassettes H and I.
Representative sections of tumor and adjacent lung are placed in
cassettes J and K. Representative tumor in cassettes L—N. L also
contains a pleural margin. No other mass lesions are noted.
Representative sections are submitted.
