DIAGNOSIS: ,; U ' .. _ , '_ 1/

l l
1. Kidney, left (left radical nephrectomy): Renal cell carcinoma, chromophobe-type, with areas of high-grade ,

sarcomatoid differentiation. Tumor approaches but does not go through the capsule. Vascular and ureteral
margins are free of tumor. Adrenal gland, no tumor seen.

2. Lymph nodes, retroperitoneal (excision): Reactive lymph nodes with marked sinus histiocytosis, no tumor
seen.

CLINICALINFORMATION: HISTORY:LEFT RENAL MASS

PRbCEDURE: PREOP' DX:#LEFT RENAL MASS POSTOP DX: LEFT RENAL MASS OPERATIVE
FINDINGS: VERY LARGE LEFT RENAL MASSAND ENLARGED HILAR LYMPH NODES

SPECIMENS SUBMITTED: 1) KIDNEY, LEFT NEPHRECTOMY
2) RETRO PERITONEAL LYMPH NODE

GROSS DESCRIPTION: Received in two formalin containers labeled with the patient's name and medical
record number, and as:

1. "Left kidney" is a large soft tissue specimen weighing 3,800 grams measuring 22 x 18 x 15 cm. The ureter
is marked with yellow ink and the vessel is marked with blue ink. The adrenal gland is 'dentified. Once cut,
there is a large, extensively red mass lesion without gross evidence of fibrosis, scarrin ,'or encapsulation. This
mass lesion occupies a major portion of the specimen. There is a small rim of normal appearing renal tissue
with a maximum dimension of 8 cm. For procurement, samples of both normal renal tissue and the mass
lesion are sent to The specimen is placed in formalin but other portions are submitted in
ethanol as a touch prep and also as electron microscopy. The special instructions are confirmatory for culture,

frozen, and touch prep.

2. "Retroperitoneal lymph nodes" is a tan soft tissue mass measuring 7.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 cm. Upon palpation, five
nodes are appreciated, the largest measuring 2.5 x 1 x 1 cm and the smallest measuring 1 x 1 x 0.7 cm. The
lymph nodes are serially sectioned.

Code of section for specimen 2:
AB - representative section of largest lymph node
