PART 1: LYMPH NODE, LEFT SENTINEL #1, BIOPSY —
ONE LYMPH NODE, FREE OF TUMOR (0/1).

PART 2: LYMPH NODE, LEFT SENTINEL #2, BIOPSY —
ONE LYMPH NODE, FREE OF TUMOR (DI1).

PART 3: W SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY -
A. AR (3A, 3B, 3C, 3D, 3E, AND 3F). THE TUMOR COMES TO WITHIN 1.0 MM
FROM THE NEAREST ANTERIOR RES CTION MARGIN (3A AND 38).
B. THE TUMOR SIZE IS 1.5 X 1.2 X 1.1 CM.
NOTTINGHAM SCORE IS 6/9 (TUBULES 3, NUCLEI 2, MITOSIS 1).
LYMPHOVASCULAR PERMEATION IS NOT APPRECIATED.
DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU, CRIBRIFORM AND SOLID TYPES, NUCLEAR GRADE 2, REPRESENTING
ABOUT 2% OF TUMOR VOLUME.
DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU IS ADMIXED WITH INVASIVE TUMOR AND COMES TO WITHIN 1.0 MM FROM
THE NEAREST ANTERIOR RESECTION MARGIN.
G. CHANGES CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS BIOPSY SITE, SEE PRIOR V
H FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES WITH FIBROADENOMATOID CHANGES. DUCTAL EPITHELIAL HYPERPLASIA,
