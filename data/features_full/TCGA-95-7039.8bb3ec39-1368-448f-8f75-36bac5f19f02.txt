COMMENT:
EGFR mutation analysis is pending on section 1H.

In specimen #4, the right level #4 lymph node, no tuomr is present within the
lymph node parenchyma. However, a small focus of tumor is noted in transit
within a lymphovascular channel of the lymph node capsule.

frozen section, freeze bronchial margin which is marked as stitch.

CLINICAL HISTORY/OPERATIVE FINDINGS:

Right lung cancer. Right VATS, right thoracotomy with right upper
lobectomy, chest wall resection.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen is received in six parts, each part labeled with the patient's
name and hospital number.

Specimen #1 is received fresh designated as "right upper lobe en bloc chest
wall resection with ribs 2, 3 and 4". It consists of a lung lobe attached to
ribs which measures 15 x 10 x 4.5 cm and weighs 220.0 grams. Just beneath the
ribs and adherent to the pleura and chest wall is a mass measuring 3.3 x 2.0 x
1.0 cm. The mass is located 7.1 cm from the bronchial margin. The pleura has
been inked blue, and the soft tissue around the ribs is inked red. Tissue has
been submitted for 5;

Specimen #2 is received in formalin designated as "right level 11 lymph
node". It consists of a single lymph node measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm and is
entirely submitted in cassette "2A".

Specimen #3 is received in formalin designated as "right level 9 lymph
node". It consists of a single lymph node measuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm and is
submitted entirely in cassette "3A".

Specimen #4 is received in formalin designated as "right level 4 lymph
node". It consists of a fragment of soft tissue measuring 3.5 x 0.8 x 0.5
cm. Two lymph nodes are identified and submitted in cassettes as follows:

Specimen #5 is received in formalin designated as "right level 10 lymph
node". It consists of a single lymph node measuring 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm. The
specimen is submitted entirely in cassette "5A".
