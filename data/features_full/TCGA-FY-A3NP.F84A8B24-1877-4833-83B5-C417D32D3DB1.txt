PROCEDURE
Thyroidectomy.
SPECIMEN:

A. Right thyroid lobe. Frozen.
B. Parathyroid.
C. Left subtotal thyroid lobe. Fresh spec.

 

HISTORY
Vocal cord paralysis. Thyroid mass.

GROSS
A. Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis in a container
labeled "right thyroid lobe“ is a lobe of thyroid (4.5 x 3 x 2.3 cm,
13.grams). The gland is largely replaced by a 3 cm in greatest
dimension discrete nodule with a tan and brown cut surface. The
discrete, focally thickened tumor margin is gritty suggestive of
calcifications. Smears are prepared from the cut surface.
Uninvolved thyroid parenchyma has a uniform red-brown cut surface.
A representative portion of the tumor is submitted for the
project. The margins are marked with black ink.

Frozen section control. INS
1-10. Additional material-nodule.
11-12. Uninvolved thyroid parenchyma.

B. Received fresh for frozen section diagnosis in a container
labeled "? parathyroid" is a tan~red tissue fragment (5 mm in
greatest dimension, 0.025 grams).

Frozen section control.

C. Received fresh in a container labeled ”left thyroid lobe" is a
portion of rough°surfaced tan thyroid tissue (3 x 1.6 x 1.2 cm, 2.9
grams). The firm, red-brown parenchyma has a 0.7 cm in diameter.
discrete tan nodule with focal calcifications. The margins are
marked with black ink. The tissue is submitted in its entirety in
three cassettes.

- Final Report -

A. Right thyroid nodule:

Follicular lesion suspicious for papillary carcinoma, defer
to permanent sections.

3. Parathyroid:
Thyroid. No parathyroid seen.

MICROSCOPIC
Performed.

DIAGNOSIS
A. Right thyroid lobe:
Atypical follicular lesion with focal nuclear features
suspicious for follicular variant of papillary carcinoma. see
note.

B. Parathyroid:
Thyroid nodule, no parathyroid identified.

C. Left subtotal thyroid lobe:
Thyroid with benign multinodular hyperplasia.

ADDENDUM REPORT
Diagnosis from by Dr.
M.D., Ph.D.
DIAGNOSIS:

Thyroid, right lobe, excision:
Papillary thyroid carcinoma, well differentiated follicular
variant, at least 2 cm, confined to the thyroid. Margins
negative.

III-leans nnnnnnnn gonna-nausea...

Dear Dr.

As we discussed today, I have reviewed the slides of the thyroid
specimen of your patient, . I completely agree with
your opinion that the right lobe contains a follicular variant of
papillary carcinoma. Interestingly, the carcinoma appears to be
arising in a benign hyperplastic nodule. This makes measuring the
carcinoma difficult, but I think it is at least 2 cm in greatest
diameter. I do not see extrathyroidal extension and the margins
appear close, but negative.

Thank you for allowing me to share in the care of this patient.
