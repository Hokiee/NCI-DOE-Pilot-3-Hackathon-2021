GR Escniprron:
A The ﬁrst container A is received in tonnalln labeled with the patients name 'level 9 right lymph node.’ The specimen consists of a
brown~tan nodule consistent with lymph node that measures 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in a single cassette

8. The second container 8 is receivw in formalin labeled .evel 11 lymph node.’ The specimen consists of a brown-tan nodule
consistent with lymph node that measures 1.0x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. The lymph node is bisected. entirely submitted in a single cassette labeled

C. The third container 0 is received in formalin labeled with the patients name ‘level 10 lymph node: The specimen consists of four
brown-tan nodules. possible lymph node: 0.2 to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension. The largest lymph node is bisected and the specimen is entirely
submitted in a single cassette l.

D. The fourth container 0 is received in formalin labeled with the patients name superior pulmonary veln lymph node.‘ The specimen
consist: of two brown4an nodules consistent with lymph nodes that measure 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 and 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted
in a single cassette labeled

E. The ﬁlth container E is received in formalin labeled with the patients name ' level 7 lymph node.‘ The specimen consists 01 two
pieces of brownish soft tissue measuring in aggregate 3.5 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm. On sectioning. there are four brown-tan nodules consistent with probable
lymph nodes that measure from 0.9 to 1.5 cm. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted in cassettes labeled as follows: two probable
nodes each bisected in block 1; one probable node bisected in block 2; one probable node bisected in blocks a and 4.

F. The sixth container F is received in formalin labeled with the patients name right lung) The specimen consists of right
pneumonectomy specimen that measures 19.0 x 14.5 x 6.5 an and weighs 353 grams. The pleural surface of the lung is crewman to gray-tan and
anthracotic. The pleura has been inked. Within the upper lobe there is a circumscribed grey-brown anthracotic mess that measures 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm
that is within 0.1 cm of the pleural margin and 7.2 cm from the bronchial margin. It is located near the ﬁssure between the upper and lower lobes. The
lung in the upper. middle and lower lobe: is brown-tan and spongy. There are no other lesions identiﬁed grossly. Warm the pensioners! soft issue.
there la a gray—tan nodule measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm, possible lymph node. Received with the specimen are usree W. are green. one yeréow.

possible lymph node bisected in block 9.

G. The seventh container G is received in lonnalin labeled with the patients narr ‘ievel 4 lymph node.’ The specimen consists of a
portion of ﬂbroedipose tissue 3.5 x 3.0 x 1.0 cr'1 Sectioning reveals eleven possible lymph nodes that measure from 0.3 to 0.9 cm. The lymph nodes are
entirely submitted in mssettes as follows: six probable nodes block 1: two probable nodes each bisected in block 2; one probable
node bisected in block 3; two pregame “Wee each bisected in block 4.
