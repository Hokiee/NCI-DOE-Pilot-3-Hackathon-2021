International Union Against Cancer (UICC).

Clinical History:
The patient is a year—old female with multicentric right breast invasive

ductal carcinoma undergoing simple mastectomy and sentinel node biopsies.

. mammogram showed a hypoechoic mass at 1:00 in the right breast, 4
cm from the nipple, measuring 20 mm in maximum diameter. A smaller round
hypoechoic mass measuring 8 mm in maximum diameter was additionally identiﬁed
at 12:00 in the right breast, 4 cm from the nipple. Clips wereplaced in the
central aspect of both lesions.

Comment

D. Immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratin 5/ 14 were performed on block D7
and support intraductal hyperplasia, usual type. Immunohistochemical stains for
p63 and mycin heavy chain were performed on D10 and support an intraductal
papilloma. All immunohistochemical controls were appropriate.

Specimens Received:

A: Right axillary sentinal node #1
B: Right axillary sentinal ' ‘ node #2
C: Superior mastectomy ﬂap

E: Inferior ﬂap right breast

F: Medial ﬂap right breast

Gross Description:
The specimens are received in six containers each labeled with the patient's
name and medical record number.

A. The first container is additionally identiﬁed as, 'right axillary sentinel

node #1 '. Received fresh for intraoperative consultation is a portion of rubbery
yellow—tan tissue measuring 2.5 x 2.3 x 0.8 cm. The specimen is bisected and
entirely frozen, and the frozen section diagnosis by Dr. _ is ’no tumor’. The
frozen section remnants are entirely submitted in A1 FS and A2 PS.

B. The second container is additionally identiﬁed as, ‘right axillary sentinel
node #2'. Received fresh for intraoperative consultation is a portion of
yellow-tan and blue-tinged tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. The specimen is
bisected and entirely frozen, and the frozen section diagnosis by Dr. is

'no tumor”. The frozen section remnant is entirely submitted in B1 F S.

C. The third container is additionally identiﬁed as, ’superior mastectomy

ﬂap'. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 26.5 gram, 10.3 x 4 x 0.9 cm
portion of lobulated yellow ﬁbroadipose tissue. There is a stitch on one aspect
of the specimen designating the ﬁnal anterior margin. The aspect of the
specimen with the stitch is inked black. The specimen is serially sectioned to
reveal grossly unremarkable lobulated yellow ﬁbroadipose tissue. Representative
sections are submitted in C1-C5.

D. The fourth container is additionally identiﬁed as, ‘right breast‘.

Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 593.6 g simple mastectomy specimen.
The specimen is oriented with a double short suture designating the superior
aspect and a double long suture designating the lateral aspect. The breast
measures 24.5 cm from medial to lateral, 18 cm from superior to inferior, and

3.5 cm from anterior to posterior. On the anterior surface is a 21.5 x 13.5 cm
brown ellipse of skin with a 5.5 x 3.8 cm areola and a 1.2 x 1.1 x 0.5 cm raised
nipple. The nipple—areolar complex reveals no evidence of ulceration or
retraction.

The specimen is inked as follows:

anterior—superior — blue;

anterior—inferior - green;

posterior - black.

The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 20 slices (slice

1 = medial, nipple in slice 10) to reveal a well-circumscribed lobulated tan

mass measuring 2.1 x 1.9 x 1.5 cm in the superior aspect of slices 7 and 8. The
mass is 1.3 cm from the posterior (black) margin, 1.3 cm from the anterior
superior (blue) margin, and 0.9 cm from the anterior skin. In slice 8, 1.8 cm
superior to the ﬁrst mass, is a 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm rubbery mass that is located

1 cm from the posterior (black) margin and 0.8 cm from the anterior superior
(blue) margin. A clip is identiﬁed in slice 8 within the second mass. There are

2 additional nodular areas in the breast. The ﬁrst measures 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm

and is located in the inferior aspect of slice 11, 1.6 cm from the posterior

(black) margin. The second nodular area measures 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm and is found
in the inferior aspect of slice 15, 1 cm from the posterior (black) margin. The
remainder of the specimen consists of approximately 25% dense gray-white ﬁbrous
breast parenchyma and 75% lobulatedyellow adipose tissue. No additional masses
or nodules are grossly identified.

E. The ﬁfth container is additionally identiﬁed as, 'inferior ﬂap right

breast stitch marks ﬁnal anterior margin’. Received fresh and placed in

formalin is a 6.5 g, 4.7 x 3.2 x 0.6 cm portion of lobulated yellow ﬁbroadipose
tissue. On one aspect of the specimen is a stitch designating the ﬁnal anterior
margin. The aspect of the specimen with the stitch is inked black. The specimen
is serially sectioned to reveal grossly unremarkable lobulated yellow
ﬁbroadipose tissue. Representative sections are submitted in El-ES.

F. The sixth container is additionally identiﬁed as, 'medial ﬂap right breast
stitch marks ﬁnal anterior margin’. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a
3.5 g, 4.7 x 1.4 x 0.7 cm portion of lobulated yellow ﬁbroadipose tissue. There
is a stitch on one aspect of the specimen designating the ﬁnal anterior margin.
The aspect of the specimen with the stitch is inked black. The specimen is
serially sectioned to reveal grossly unremarkable lobulated yellow ﬁbroadipose
tissue. The specimen is entirely submitted in F1—F4.

Tissue ﬁxed for at least 6 hours in 10% NBF and no more than 72 hours.
