GROSS DESCRIPTION:

l.Received fresh, labeled with the patient's name and unit number and Radical
Hysterectomy, is a 106 gram specimen including an unopened uterus (5 x 5.5 x 5.0 cm) with
attached cervix and vaginal cuff. There is a pink/purple polypoid mass (1.3 x 0.6 x 0.5
cm) located on the posterior surface of the exocervix (measuring 5.9 X 1.3) at the 6
o'clock position. The mass appears to invade to a depth of 0.8 cm but is grossly 0.9 cm
from the outer surface. The mass extends into the endocervical canal (0.6 cm) but not to
the lower uterine segment. The mass is 4.3 cm from the vaginal cuff margin. The external
05 is distorted by the mass and is 0.9 cm in diameter. The endocervical canal (2.4 cm in
length) has a tan herringbone mucosa. The endometrial cavity (4.1 cm from cornu to cornu,
4.6 cm in length) has a tan/pink hemorrhagic endometrium (0.4 cm in average thickness).
The myometrium measures 2.1 cm in maximum thickness and is unremarkable. The serosa is
glistening with an adhesion on the posterior surface.One possible lymph node is located in
the right parametrial soft tissue. No lymph nodes are identified in the left parametrial
soft tissue. The specimen is representatively submitted.

Cassette lA—lG: Posterior cervix including mass, 4 o'clock to 7 o'clock, entirely
submitted

Cassette lH—lM: Anterior cervix 8 o'clock to 3 o'clock, representatively submitted
Cassette 1N: Anterior vaginal cuff margin, 9 to 12:00 o'clock, en face

Cassette 1P: Anterior vaginal cuff margin, 12 to 3:00 o’clock, en facelQ: Posterior
vaginal cuff margin, 3 to 6:00 o'clock, en face

Cassette 1R: Posterior vaginal cuff margin, 6 to 9:00 o'clock, en face

Cassette ls: Anterior lower uterine segment

Cassette 1T: Posterior lower uterine segment

Cassette lU—lv: Anterior endomyometrium

Cassette lW—lX: Posterior endomyometrium

Cassette 1Y: 1 possible right parametrial lymph node, bisected

Cassette IZ—l AA: Right parametrium

CASSETTE lAB— lAC: Left parametrium

2. Received without fixative labeled "right parametria" and with the patient's name, the
specimen consists of a 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm portion of tan—pink fibroadipose tissue. The
specimen is bisected and submitted entirely in cassette 2A.

Received without fixative labeled "left parametria" and with the patient's name, the
pecimen consists of a 1.8 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm portion of tan—pink fibroadipose tissue. The
cimen is bisected and submitted entirely in cassette 3A.
