The pathologic stage assigned here should be regarded as provisional. as it reﬂects only current pathologic data and does not incorporate full
knowledge of the patient's clinical status and/or prior pathology.

Attestaﬂon:

By this signature. I attest that l have personally formulated the ﬁnal interpretation expressed in this report and that the above diagnosis is based
upon my examination of the slides and/or other material indicated in this report.

"*Electronically Signed Out By'“
Interpreted by:

A. Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and "stomach and D1, D2 lymph nodes" is a total gastrectomy specimen
measuring 24.0 x 11.5 x 5.0 cm. There is an attached mesentery measuring 30.0 x 18.5 x 3.5 cm. The gastric serosal surface is
yellow-tan. nodular and ﬁrm. The specimen was previously opened in the operating room to reveal a diffuse infiltrating nodular
tumor measuring 17 x 8 x 2 cm. There is a small section of normal gastric mucosa. Grossly the mass is located 5 cm from the
proximal margin and 9 cm from the distal margin. The tumor extends through the serosa and into the surrounding perigastric fat in
multiple areas. The rugal folds are flattened in the area of the tumor. There are multiple grossly obvious lymph nodes, the

largest of which measuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 2.5 cm which is located at the distal end of the specimen in the perigastric fat. The
specimen is submitted as follows:

A1FS: Lymph node near proximal margin
A2FS: Distal margin
A3FS: Proximal margin

Cassette A4 through A9: Tumor

Cassette A10: Multiple possible lymph nodes

Cassette A11: Multiple possible lymph nodes

Cassette A12: A serial section of the largest lymph node
Cassette A13-A22: Multiple possible lymph nodes

B. Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and "small bowel segment" is a 4.5 cm in length x 3.9 cm in diameter
portion of small intestine. At one end there are four black sutures and the opposite end has a linear row of staples. The sutures
and is shaved and bisected and entirely submitted in B1 and 32. The linear row of staples is removed and the tissue deep to that
is bisected and entirely submitted in 83-34. The specimen is opened longitudinally to reveal grossly undulating mucosa with no
discrete gross abnormalities identiﬁed. Representative sections from the central intestine are submitted in BS.

W
A1 FS. proximal lymph node. "stomach and D1. D2 lymph nodes":
Negative for malignancy.

A2FS, "distal gastric margin":
Negative for malignancy.

A3FS. "gastric biopsy":
Negative for malignancy.
