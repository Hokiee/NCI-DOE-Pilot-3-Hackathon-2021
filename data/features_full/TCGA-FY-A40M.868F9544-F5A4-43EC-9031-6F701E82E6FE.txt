FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

 

Source of Sgecimen:
A. Thyroid
B. Lymph node:Central node

Clinical HistomOgerative Dx:

Thyroid cancer

Gross Description:

A. The specimen is labeled total thyroid and is received without ﬁxative. It consists of a total
thyroidectomy specimen weighing 14 grams. A suture marks the left lobe. The right lobe measures 3.7 x
1.8 x 1.3 cm and the left lobe measures 3.7 x 2.1 x 1.5 cm. There is a triangular portion of isthmus which
measures 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm. There are no grossly obvious parathyroid glands. The anterior right thyroid is
inked blue, the anterior left thyroid is inked green, the anterior isthmus is inked yellow, and the posterior
surfaces are inked black. The thyroid lobes and isthmus are serially sectioned to reveal a sharply
circumscribed tan -white neoplasm in the superior third of the left thyroid lobe. it measures 1.7 x 1.5 x 1.4
cm. it appears contained within the thyroid gland. Representative sections of the neoplasm are obtained
for research purposes. Elsewhere within the left thyroid lobe and also in the right thyroid lobe there is a
beefy dark red thyroid gland parenchyma and areas of colloid-like change. but no other discrete masses.
The specimen is entirely submitted as summarized below. Section summary:

At-Ae) left thyroid lobe submitted from superior-interior.

A7-A11) right thyroid lobe submitted from superior-inferior,

A12-A13) isthmus. “"

B. The specimen is labeled central node and is received in formalin. It consists ot multiple fragments of
ﬁbrofatty tissue which are 2 cm in aggregate. On gentle palpation there appears to be a possible 0.3 cm
pale red lymph node. The specimen is submitted intact in cassette B1,

Microscogic Description:

A. Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic findings are reflected in the diagnosis
rendered.

8. Microscopic sections have been examined. The microscopic ﬁndings are reﬂected in the diagnosis
