DIAGNOSIS: “W! 11:44:! WM 791),“,
1) ADNBXA, RIGHT, MASS: nxcrszon: 5’3 34/3

- mansnnc ADENOCARCINOMA. ﬁxﬁu WK, Mp; (1 {3,7
2) ADNEXA, LEFT, MASS) EXCISION:

— METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA.

Al/JJﬁ

3) SOFT TISSUE, CUL-Dl-SAC; BIOPSY:

— METASTATIC ADRNDCRRCINOMA.
4) PERITONBUH. POSTERIORI BIOPSY:

- REACTIVE PAPILLARY MBSOTHELIAL PROLIFERATION.
5) UTERUS. CERVIX: HYSTERRCTOMY:

— THE MAXIMAL THICKNESS OF THE CERVICAL STROMAL INVASION IS 12 MN.
- THE THICKNESS OF THE CERVIX IN THE AREA OF MAXIMAL TUMOR INVASION IS

- NO EVIDENCE OF TUMOR MULTICENTRICITY IS IDENTIFIED.

- VASCULAR INVASION IS PRESENT.

- NO VAGINAL EXTENSION IS IDENTIFIED.

- THE TUMOR EXTENDS INTO THE LOWER UTERINE SEGMENT (MUCOSA AND STROMA)
- THE RIGHT AND LEFT PARACERVICAL SOFT TISSUE MARGINS ARE INVOLVED BY

- THE ENDOMETRIUM IS INACTIVE.
< THE MYOMETRIUM SHOWS LEIOMYOMATA.

NOTE: ER, PR VIMENTIN, P16 AND M-CEA IWOHISTOCHEMICAL STAINS WERE
PERFORMED VON REPRESENTATIVE SECTIONS OF TUMOR FROM THE ADNEXAL MASS. CERVIX
AND LOWER UTERINE SEGMENT. THE RESULTS ARE GENERALLY CONCORDANT AND
SUPPPORT AN ENDOCERVICAL PRIMARY. P16 AND M-CEA ARE POSITIVE WHILE PR AND
VIMENTIN ARE NEGATIVE. SECTIONS FROM THE CERVIX AND LOWER UTERINE SEGMENT
SHOW FOCAL ER EXPRESSION.

10) LYNN-l NODE, LEFT OBTU'RATOR) EXCISION:
- “TASTATIC ADENOCARCINONA TO ONE OF SIX LYHPH NODES (1/6) .

NOTE: HIE-1 AND P16 IMMUNOSTAINS SUPPORT THE DIAGNOSIS.

ll) LYNPH NODE. LEFT COMMON ILIAC) EXCISION:
- BENIGN FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE.

12) LYNPH NODE, RIGHT EXTERNAL ILIAC; BIOPSY
- ONE BENIGN LYMPH NODE (0/1).

13) LY‘MPH NODE, EIGHT DISTAL EXTERNAL ILIAC; BIOPSY:
- ONE BENIGN LYMPK NODE (0/1).

14) LYNPH NODE, RIGHT HYPOGASTRIC; EXCISION:
~ TWO BENIGN LYM'PH NODES (0/2) .

15) LY'MPH NODE, RIGHT OETURATOR; EXCISION:
- THREE BENIGN LYMPH NODES (0/3).

16) LYMPH NODE, RIGHT PARA—AORTIC) EXCISION:
- TWO BENIGN LYMPH NODES (0/2).

I ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON HY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF
THE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL). AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED
THIS REPORT.
