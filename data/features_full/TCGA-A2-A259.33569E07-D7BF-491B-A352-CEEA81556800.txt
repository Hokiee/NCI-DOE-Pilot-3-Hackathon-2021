CHANGES CONSISTENT WITH PRIOR BIOPSY

‘ ** Report Electronically Signed Out **

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND HISTORY:
left breast cancer

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled with the patient's name

designated "SENTINEL LYMPH NODE BIOPSY LEFT BREAST" consists of a 4.0 x
3.0 x 1.0 cm irregular portion of soft tissue. Sectioning reveals two grey
yellow fatty lymph nodes each measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm in overall
dimension. The specimen is entirely submitted as follows:

A1—A2: lymph node #1
A3-A4: lymph node #2
A5-A6: remaining adipose tissue. 6CFNS.

3. Received fresh with accompanying radiogranh and embedded localization
wire labeled with the patient’s name iesignated "LEFT
BREAST LUMPECTOMY" consists of an irregular portion of tan yellow soft
tissue oriented with short stitch superior and long lateral. The specimen
measures 9.5 cm medial to lateral, 6.5 cm superior to inferior, 2.5 cm
anterior to posterior. The superior margin is focally disrupted. The
specimen is inked as follows: superior blue, inferior green, medial red,
lateral yellow, anterior orange, posterior black. Serial sections reveal a
fairly well defined pink grey gritty mass measuring 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm in
overall dimension. The mass comes to within 0.2 cm of the anterior margin

Bl-BZ: mass
B3: anterior margin
B4: normal appearing fibrous tissue
