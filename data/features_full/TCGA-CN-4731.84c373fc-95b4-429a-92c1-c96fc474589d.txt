GROSS DESCRIPTION:
The specimen is received in a totai of 11 parts.

Part “i received fresh with the patient‘s name, initials. labeled "midline maxillary gingival biopsy" consists of two irregular
portions of pink, soft tissue. each 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm and entirely submitted following intraoperative consult labeled 1AFS.

Part 2 received fresh with the patient's name. initials I labeled "tower Iip“ consists of a 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm resection of cauterized.
pink mucosa, entirely submitted labeled 2AFS.

Part 3 received fresh with the patient's name. initials I labeied "left oral commissure" consists of 3 Irreguiar portions of pink
mucosa and tan muscle, 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm in aggregate and entirely submitted following intraoperative consult labeled 3AFS.

Part 4 received fresh with the patient's name, initiais - labeled "Ieft inferior alveolar nerve. cilp is proximal" consists of 1.2 x 0.2 x
0.2 cm segment of white soft tissue with an attached clip designating proximal aspect.

ink code: Blue-proximai
The tissue is entirely submitted following intraoperattve consult labeled 4AFS.

Part 5 received fresh with the patient‘s name, Inltlais labeled "left lingual nerve-ciip is proximai" consists of 1.4 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm
segment of white soft tissue with an attached ciip des gnating proximal aspect.

ink code: Blue-proximal
The specimen is entirely submitted following tniraoperative consult labeled SAPS.

Part 0 received fresh with the patient's name. initials labeled "left retromolar trigone" consists of a 2.5 x 0.0 x 0.3 cm resection
of pink-yellow. mucosa, fat and muscle. entirely subm ed ioliowing intraoperative consult tabeied SAFS.

Part 7' received fresh for frozen section labeled with the patient‘s name, initials and "composite resection" consists of a
composite resection of tumor with right and ieft mandibie measuring 11.5 x it. x 5.5 cm with an attached 8.0 x 5.0 cm oval
excision of skin from the anterior chin. e 4.2 x 3.2 x 1.8 cm left submandlbuiar gland. and a 5.0 x 2.0 cm portion of lower tip.

There is a 4.0 x 'i .5 cm ulcerated area on the skin surface which Is 0.2 cm inferior to the vermlillon border of the lip which ulcerates
through to an 8.5 x 6.0 x 5.0 cm firm tumor which ulceraies the floor of mouth in a U-sha ed area above the mandible measuring

1 1.5 cm Wlii a width of 2.4 cm. The Iceratlng are in the skin is 1.5 cm from the right siiin margin, 1.5 cm from the left skin
margin, an 4.5 cm from the interior s in margin. T e hone margins of resection are giossiy tree oitumor. The left bone margin is
3.0 cm proximal to the angie of the mandible and the right bone margli is is cm proximal to the angie of the mandible. The tumor
involves and replaces the mandibular bone horn mldllne to 2 cm iront i e left mandible bone margin. The tumor invades and
replaces ihe left mandible and involves the superficial soft tissue up to less than 'i mm from the prcxtrnai edge of lhe teil laterai soft
tissue.

A lymph node search of the s ecimen revealed seven potential iett ievei 1 lymph nodes measuring 1.2 to 0.3 cm. The
submandibuiar gland is serial y sectioned to reveal tan, unremarkahie pareiichyi‘na.

The iioor of mouth mucosal margin is Submitted for frozen section (TAPS).
