CLINICAL INFORMATION

SPECIMEN/GROSS DESCRIPTION

A) SOURCE: Liver, segments 5 & 6

The specimen is received fresh from the OR labeled “segments 5 and 6" and
consists a 108 gram, 10.3 x 5.5 x 4.3 cm wedge of red, pale tan liver
parenchyma. The specimen displays a smooth, focally irregular capsular
surface. The margin is inked blue and the tissue is serially
cross-sectioned.

INTRAOPERATIVE PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION: "Margins free (0.7 cm from the
smaller nodule) " is rendered by

The cut surfaces display two tumors and two small ovoid irregular nodular
foci.

Tumor #1 (4.5 x 4.2 x 2.5 cm) is located 2.2 cm from the blue-inked margin
and display vaguely lobulated tan cut surfaces interspersed with thin
fibrous septae. Tumor #1 abuts the capsular surface. Extension through the
capsule is not seen.

Tumor #2 (1 cm in diameter) is 0.7 cm from the closest blue-inked margin
and 1.3 cm from tumor #1. Tumor #2 has tan, lobulated soft cut surfaces.

The two small ovoid ill—defined nodularities each measure 0.5 cm in average
diameter. The closest nodule is 0.3 cm from the blue—inked margin. The two
nodules are at least 1 cm from the two tumors. No other lesions are seen on
the red—tan hepatic parenchyma. Representative sections are submitted in
six cassettes labeled:

2. Tumor #2 entirely submitted with closest blue-inked margin

4 Blue-inked margin closest to tumor #1 to include the two smaller
irregular nodularities, entirely submitted

5~6. Tumor #1 with adjacent hepatic parenchyma

3-

Note: The gross specimen was photographed. Representative tumor, paranormal
and normal tissue are banked.

Note: Specimen removed from patient at . Specimen placed
in 10% neutral buffered formalin at Ipecimen fixed in
formalin for a minimum of 6 hours, and not longer than 48 hours.

B) SOURCE: Gallbladder

Labeled "gallbladder" is an 8.5 x 3.3 x 2 cm intact—appearing gallbladder.
The serosa is tan~maroon and-focally roughened. The wall is 0.2—0.3 cm»-
thick. The mucosa is soft glistening, mottled green—tan. Found within the
lumen is watery yellow-green bile. After filtering and careful examination
of the lumen and specimen container contents, no discrete choleliths are
identified. No lesions or masses are seen. Representative sections
including the apparent cystic duct margin (inked blue) are submitted in a
single cassette. ‘

MICROSCOPIC

A) The background livers shows changes classical for hepatitis C including
moderate lymphoid aggregates and significant interface necroinflammatory
activity. There is also mild zone 1 steatosis without steatohepatitis.
There is no evidence of septal fibrosis or cirrhosis.

B) The microscopic appearance substantiates the diagnosis.
