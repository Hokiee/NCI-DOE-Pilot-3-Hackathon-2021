SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT

SPECIMENgsp A. 10R LYMPH NODE
B. RIGHT LUNG WITH PORTION AZYGOUS VEIN
C. 10R LYMPH NODE
D. LEVEL 8 LYMPH NODE
E. LEVEL 7 LYMPH NUDE
F. LEVEL 9 LYMPH NODE

CLINICAL HISTORY:

PRE—OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right lower lobe mass

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION DIAGNOSIS:
FSB: Right lung resection: Bronchial margin is free of tumo

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. 10R LYMPH NODE

Received in formalin is a single portion of tan-red soft tissue measuring l.2x0.7x0.4cm.
Specimen is bisected longitudinally and submitted in toto for microscopic examination in
cassette A1.

B. RIGHT LUNG WITH PORTION AZYGOUS VEIN

Received fresh labeled with patients name and “right lung with portion of azygous vein” is a
62ng, 20x15x120m lung Iobectomy specimen. There is puckering of the pleural surface that is
inked black. The specimen sectioned to reveal a 7.0x5.0x4.0cm tan-white to gray-black mass
located 1.5 cm from the bronchial margin and grossly extending to the pleural surface. The mass
encircles but grossly does not appear to invade the vascular or bronchial passages. The
uninvolved parenchyma is red-brown in color and otherwise unremarkable. Located near the
resection margin is a venous segment measuring 2.00m in length by 0.70m in diameter. It is

closed by a staple line at both ends. Multiple peribronchial lymph nodes are identiﬁed, the
largest measuring 1.1 cm in greatest dimension. The bronchial margin is shaved'and submitted
for frozen section. Tissue is obtained for procurement. Sections for microscopic examination:

B2—B8: representatives of the mass

B9: representative of unremarkable parenchyma and representative section of vein

BIG: 1 presumptive lymph node, bisected

Bl 1: 6 presumptive lymph nodes

Bl2: l presumptive lymph node, bisected

B 1 3: 5 presumptive lymph nodes

B14~B21: 1 presumptive lymph node in each cassette
C. 10R LYMPH NODE
Received in formalin are 2 portions of tan-purple soft tissue. The smaller measures
0. 7x0. 4x0. 3cm. The larger 0. 8x0. 7x0. 50m. The smaller fragment is inked black and submitted
in toto as received. The larger fragment 1s bisected longitudinally and submitted In toto. All
tissue has been submitted, 3 pieces 1 cassette labeled Cl.
D. LEVEL 8 LYMPH NODE
Received in formalin are 7 fragments of yellow and red soft tissue ranging in size from
0.7x0.4x0.2cm to l.5xl.5xl.Ocm. Cassette summary:

D1: 3 presumptive lymph nodes '

D2-D5: 1 presumptive lymph node in each cassette
E. LEVEL 7 LYMPH NODE
Received in formalin are 2 fragments of tan-gray to red soft tissue. The smaller measures
1.3xl.5x1.0cm. The larger 2.0x2.0x1.0cm. One fragment is trisected and submitted in toto in
E1. The second fragment is serially sectioned and submitted in E2.
F. LEVEL 9 LYMPH NODE
Received in formalin is a single fragment oftan—gray soft tissue measuring 1.2x0.6x0.50m. The
specimen is bisected and submitted in toto for microscopic examination in cassette F.

DIAGNOSIS:

PROBABLY SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA MEASURING 7 x 4 CM.
-PERIBRONCHIAL LYMPH NODES, POSITIVE FOR CARCINOMA (2/17).
C. LYMPH NODE, 10R, EXCISION:
~0NE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/1).
D. LYMPH NODES, LEVEL 8, EXCISION'.
-3EVEN LYMPH NODEs, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/7).
E. LYMPH NODES, LEVEL 7, EXCISION:
-TWO LYMPH NODEs, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/2).
F. LYMPH NODE, LEVEL 9, EXCISION:
-ONE LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA (0/1).
