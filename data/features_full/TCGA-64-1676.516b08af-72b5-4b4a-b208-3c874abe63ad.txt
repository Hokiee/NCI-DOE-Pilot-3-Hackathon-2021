Frozen Section Diagnosis: 7FS~ BRONCHIAL MARGIN WITH NO TUMOR.

Gross Description Received fresh for frozen section evaluation with
patient name and medical record number labeled "right lower lobe“ is a 296
gram, 18.0 X 12.5 x 4.5 cm right lower lobectomy of lung. It is covered by
a tanwpink to red—purple focally anthracotic stained pleura having up to

0.5 cm of attached bronchus. The bronchial resection margin is submitted
for frozen section evaluation and the frozen section residue is submitted

in one block. Adjacent to the bronchus, in the superior aspect of the
specimen there is a 2.5 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm firm mass having tan cut surfaces
with irregular borders. The remaining cut surfaces of lung range from
areas which are tan—pink and crepitant to areas which are red-purple, soft
and glistening. There are few palpable peribronchial lymph nodes, 0.8 cm
in greatest dimension. The cut surface of each is gray—black and
anthracotic stained. Representative sections are submitted in eight

blocks.

Designation of Sections: 7F 8- frozen section bronchial resection margin,
7A— vascular margins, 7B—7F— mass, 7G- random lung sections, 7H—
