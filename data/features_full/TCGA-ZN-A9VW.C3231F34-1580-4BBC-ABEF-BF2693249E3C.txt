O.R. CONSULTATION:
SPECIMEN LABELED "#4. RT CHEST WALL MASS" (FSA):
Spindle~cell malignant neoplasm, consistent with mesothelioma.

The senior physician certifies that he/she personally conducted a gross and/or
microscopic examination of the described specimen(s) and rendered or confirmed
the rapid diagnos(es) related thereto.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

The specimen was received fresh, in thirteen parts, and each labeled with the
patient's name and unit number.

Part A, specimen labeled "#1. Old incision", consists of a 21.5 x 0.5 cm skin
excision with an excision depth of 1.1 cm. The specimen was inked blue and
serially sectioned. No masses or lesions were seen.

Micro Al: Sections of skin, 5 frags, RSS.

Part B, specimen labeled "#2. Rib", consists of a fragment of rib 11.7 cm in

length. No masses or lesions were identified. A successful bone marrow
squeeze was performed.

Micro Bl: Rib bone marrow, multi frags, RSS.

Part C, specimen labeled "#3. Right chest wall mass", consists of a 1.6 x 0.9 x

0.6 cm red/tan/yellow soft tissue with a firm, tan (0.7 cm in greatest
dimension) nodule.

Micro Cl: Soft tissue fragment, bisected, 2 frags, ESS.

Part D, specimen labeled "#4. Right chest wall mass", consists of a 3.0 x 2.0 x
1.0 cm soft tissue fragment, which contains a 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm firm white

nodule. The specimen was bisected and one half of the nodule was submitted as
FSA and the other half of the nodule was submitted to

Micro D2: Non—frozen FSA remnant, l frag, Ess.
Part E, specimen labeled "#5. Right chest wall mass for consists of

a 2.8 x 1.8 x 0.7 cm tan/white nodular soft tissue fragment with adherent

tan/red muscular soft tissue. A representative section of the sample was
submitted to

Micro E1: Remaining soft tissue, 2 frags, ESS.

Part F, specimen labeled "#6. Right pleura for consists of a 5.0 x
4.0 x 1.2 cm aggregate of tan/pink nodular soft tissue fragment. A
representative sample (60%) was divided and sent to

Micro Fl-FZ: Sections of soft tissue, 1 and 2 frags respectively, RSS.

Part G, specimen labeled "#7. Chest wall", consists of a chest wall resection,
measuring 13.6 cm superior to inferior, 11.5 cm medial to lateral, and 13.5 cm
anterior to posterior. The specimen was oriented by the surgeon as long stitch
equals lateral spine, short stitch equals medial spine, and Vicryl equals
superior. The specimen was inked as red equals superior, green equals
inferior, black equals pleural surface, blue equals chest wall surface, yellow
equals lateral spine, and orange equals medial spine. The resection includes
three ribs (9.0, 8.7, and 8.8 cm in length). The superior most rib is
fractured. The pleural surface is relatively smooth and nodular. The largest
aggregate of nodules is 5.5 cm in greatest dimension. Grossly, the nodules are
abutting the chest wall resection edge, less than 0.1 cm/abutting the pleural
surface, less than 0.1 cm from the superior resection margin, abutting the
inferior resection margin, abutting the medial resection margin, and less than
0.1 cm from the lateral resection margin. The middle rib on the medial side
only contained a small amount of bone protruding to the resection surface. The
lower most rib on the medial side did not extend all the way to the medial soft
tissue resection edge and protruded out more towards the chest wall side. The
tumor appears to grossly invade all three ribs.

Micro Gl: Medial bone resection margin of the upper most rib, l frag, en face,
ESS.

Micro G2: Medial bone resection margin of the middle rib, en face, 4 frags,
ESS .

Micro G3: Medial bone resection margin of the lower most rib, on chest wall

Micro G7: Tumor to bone, 1 frag, RSS.

Micro G8: Superior margin, perpendicular, 1 frag, RSS.

Micro G9: Tumor to pleural and chest wall surfaces, 1 frag, RSS.

Micro G10: Tumor to inferior resection margin, perpendicular, 1 frag, RSS.

Part H, specimen labeled "#8. consists of a 5.6 x 4.4 x 3.9 cm
tan/red nodule with a partially smooth and partially disrupted surface. The

outer surface was inked black. The specimen was sectioned to reveal a tan cut
surface.

Micro H1—H2: Sections of nodule, l frag each, RSS.

Part I, specimen labeled "#9. Right pleura", consists of a 210-gram (16.7 x
13.8 x 5.2 cm) aggregate of tan, firm soft tissue (tumor) with attached pleura

and fibroadipose tissue. The largest single nodule of tumor measures 4.1 x 3.9
x 3.5 cm. '
