Addendum Discussion:

The neoplastic cells are diffusely immunoreactive for GFAP. In addition, the GFAP and
neurofilament immunohistochemistry stain demonstrates in addition to relatively solid
areas, the tumor does diffusely infiltrate the gray and white matter. The neoplastic cells
are immunoreactive for P53. In most areas, the tumor is infiltrative with NeuN positivity
among the tumor cells is not specific. In the most solid area of the tumor, there is a
suggestion of weak NeuN positivity within the tumor cells but this positivity is much
weaker than the surrounding neurons. The reticulin stain does not demonstrate
investment of individual cells. Overall, the findings are suggestive of a diffusely
infiltrative glioma. In the solid areas of tumor, scattered MlB-1 reactive cells are present
with an estimated labeling index of 3-596, consistent with a low grade process.

Addendum Diagnosis:
Diffuse well-differentiated Astrocytoma (WHO grade II).

Microscopic Description:

Sections demonstrate fragments of gray and white brain matter. A focus of markedly
increased cellularity is identified. Cells within this area appear to be glial in origin. They
are mainly small with round to ovoid nuclei. Few of the cells are larger and demonstrate
prominent nucleoli. Mitotic figures are not seen. Few neurons surrounding the focus
demonstrate enlarged nuclei with prominent nucleoli. 48 also demonstrates a nodular
focus of large fibrillary astrocytes with somewhat glassy fibrillary cytoplasm. Also,
scattered more atypical cells are seen. A rare binucleate cell is noted. Possible
eosinophilic granular bodies are seen.
