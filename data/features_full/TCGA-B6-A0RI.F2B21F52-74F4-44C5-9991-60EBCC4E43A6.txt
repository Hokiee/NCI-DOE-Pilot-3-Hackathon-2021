GROSS EXAMINATION:

Estrogen receptor tissue sent for estrogen and progesterone receptor.

A. "Tru—cut breast biopsy.": Received fresh. The specimen is a 1 cm x 0.1
cm tan piece of breast tissue. This frozen as frozen section AFl. The
frozen section remnant consists of two pieces of tan tissue measuring 0.8 x
0.1 x 0.1 and 0.7 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm. They are submitted in toto in Block Al.

B. “Right breast.": Received fresh. The specimen consists of breast with an
overlying ellipse of skin. The overall dimensions of the specimen are 15 x
11 x 2 cm with an attached axillary tail which in addition measures 7.8 x 3.5
cm. The skin ellipse measures 11.5 x 4 cm in greatest dimensions. And
contains a nipple at its center. The deep surgical margin is inked blue and
the lateral surgical margins are inked black. Several sections have been
made through the deep aspect of of the specimen revealing a 1.5 x 2.8 x 1.0
cm firm mass which radially retracts the adjacent breast tissue and which is
located approximately 0.2 cm from the deep surgical margin at one point. The
mass appears located in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. FUrther
sectioning through the specimenwre53515—unremarkable breast parenchyma in
areas away from the tumor. Material submitted for ER/PR.

Block Summary:
(a El and BZ—Closest sections of tumor to the deep surgical margin inked blue.
B3 and B4—Further sections of tumor to the deep surgical margin.
BS-Section through the nipple.
BG-Representative sampling from the upper inner quadrant.
B7-Representative sampling of the lower inner quadrant.
BS—Representative sampling of the upper outer quadrant.
BQ-Representative sampling of the lower outer quadrant.
BIO-Further sections through the lower outer quadrant.

The axillary tail is dissected. Tumor margin has been marked with surgical
suture. These are present in zone 2 at the juncture with zone 1 and are
submitted separately in Block 811.

BIZ-Sections of fat from zone 1 appear that no definite lymph nodes are
identified in zone 1.

Bl3—Candidate lymph nodes from zone 2.

314, 15 and BlS—Candidate lymph nodes from zone 3.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
AFl "Tru-cut breast biopsy": infiltrating ductal carcinoma.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. "TRU CUT BREAST BIOPSY":

INFILTRATING DUCTAL CARCINOMA.

 

B. "RIGHT BREAST":

1. INFILTRATING DUCTAL CARCINOMA, NSABP HISTOLOGIC GRADE 3, NUCLEAR
GRADE MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED. THE TUMOR COMES WITHIN 0.2 CM
(g OF THE DEEP MARGIN GROSSLY. THE TUMOR SIZE Is 1.5 x 2.8 x 1.0 CM.
VASCULAR INVASION IS PRESENT. THE TUMOR Is LOCATED IN THE UPPER
OUTER QUADRANT ONLY.
