ED?”

Operation/Specimen: Brain, left temporal.

Clinical History and Pre-Op Bx: — with difficulty with

speech and decreased short term memory. Has non—enhancing,
multicystic, large tumor in the left temporal lobe.

GROSS PATHOLOGY: A. Received fresh, three fragments, 0.6 cm. in
aggregate. Glassy, pinkishewhite and soft. In toto #1 and 2.
Tissue fixed in glutaraldehyde.

INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION: Brain, left temporal: Glial neoplasm,
possibly oligodendroglioma.

B.

SPECIMEN: Tumor.

FIXATIVE: Unfixed.

GENERAL: 2.2 X 2.0 X 0.3 cm. aggregate of mottled, tan red soft
tissue, specimen divided and all submitted.

SECTIONS: All submitted, X1 and X2.

MICROSCOPIC: A. Portions of neoplastic glial proliferation made up
of

primarily round, hyperchromatic nuclei with perinuclear halos.
Focally, the tumor is sparsely cellular and has numerous microvascular
calcospherites. In other areas, the tumor is more cellular, appears
to

be infiltrating gray matter, and has a fibrillary background with
gliofibrillary and minigemistocytic cells, or a mucinous change. Fine
capillary vessels without cellular proliferation are present. Mitoses
are difficult to be found. Nuclear pleomorphism is slight, and
necrosis is absent.

B. Portions of brain with a tumor similar to that in part A. In

here,
areas of sparsely cellular tumor with frequent microcalcification

 

 

intermingle with areas Of classical oligodendroglioma (chicken wire
and

fried egg morphology). However, there also are focal small areas that
are hypercellular and less differentiated, with apoptotic cells.

SPECIAL STAINS: Immunoperoxidase methods for GFAP, MIBl and
synaptophysin are performed on block a 2x. In the more cellular areas
a MIB~1 labelling index of 0.5% is determined. The GFAP highlights
the areas with glial fibrillary background. The synaptophysin
reflects

the synaptophysin rich background of the infiltrated grey matter.

COMMENT: The tumor, overall, is an oligodendroglioma. It has focal
areas with astrocyte phenotype, and loose areas with a mucinous
background. In part B, particularly, there are focal areas with
prominent hypercellularity. However, mitotic figures are absent, and
the MIB—l is very low at 0.5%. The tumor may be classified as a grade
B of Smith‘s {no vascular changes); however, tumors with hypercellular
areas have been referred to as "intermediate" (between low and high
grade oligodendrogliomas).
