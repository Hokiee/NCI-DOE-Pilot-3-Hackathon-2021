Specimen Description

A. Gallbladder at

B. Common bile duct lymph node
C. Level a lymph node at
D. Whipple's specimen at
Clinical Information
Pancreatic cancer.

 

Diagnosis
A. Gallbladder:
— gallbladder mucosa with nonspefic chronic and acute inflammation.
— Negative for malignancy.
- No gallstone identified.
— Cyst duct patent.
B. Common Bile Duct Lymph Node:

- Reactive lymph node, negative for malignancy.
C. Level 8 Lymph Node:

— ReactiVe lymph node, negative for malignancy.
D. Pancreas and Duodenum, Whipple Procedure:

~ Invasive moderately differentiated ductal adenocercinoma of
pancreas.

— Carcinoma invaded tissue around common bile duct, periampullary
duodenal mucosa (including mucosa layer) and peripancreatic soft
tissue.

— Duodenal-pancreas fistula formation due to carcinoma infiltration
and abscess.

- Positive for lymph-vascular invasion.

- Positive for perineural invasion.

- Uncinate margin focally involved by carcinoma.

- PanIN3 seen.

Seven of nineteen (7/19) peripancreatic lymph nodes positive for
metastatic carcinoma.

Peripancrestic soft tissue resection margin less than 0.1 cm from
infiltrating carcinoma.

- Distal resection margin of pancreas free of tumor, at least 0.6 cm
away.

- Proximal resection margin of stomach and distal resection margin of
duodenum free of tumor.

Gross Description

Received are specimen containers A to “ A“ "‘-“‘ 'tions and specimen containers are
labelled with the patient's name, cassettes and \ identifiers are
labelled with the Surgical Number

A. Specimen is received fresh. The container is designated "Gallbladder". The specimen

consists of a cholecystectomy specimen. The gallbladder is intact and measures 8.4 x 4.0
x 3.0 cm. The serosal surface appears unremarkable. The cystic duct is patent. Upon
opening, no gallstones are seen. The cystic mucosa appears unremarkable. Representative
sections are submitted in one cassette.
B. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The
container is designated as "common bile duct lymph node". The specimen consists of one
lymph node, 1.7 cm, The lymph node is bisected and submitted in cassettes El and B2.
C. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The
container is designated "C. Level 8 lymph node“. The specimen consists of a lymph node,
2.8 cm in largest dimension. The lymph node is bisected and submitted in C1 and C2.
D. The specimen is received fresh and is subsequently placed into formalin. The
container is designated as "Whipple's specimen". The specimen consists of a segment of
duodenum and portion of distal stomach, 25.0 cm in length and 8.5 cm in circumference.
_The distal duodenum, up to 8.0 cm long, appears hemorrhagic. Attached with the duodenum
is a portion of pancreas, 6.5 x 5.0 x 2.0 cm, with unremarkable outer surface and
resection margin. No tumor nodule is seen in the peripancreatic fat. The distal portion
of the common bile duct is identified, 4.2 cm in length and 1.8 cm in circumference. A
metal scent is seen within the common bile duct. The common bile duct appears
hemorrhagic and rough. The ampullary region mucosa appears slightly elevated. At 2.5 cm
away from the ampulla, there is an area of mucosal depression seemingly adherent with the
underlying lesion. At 1.0 cm away from the depressed mucosa, is a duodenal diverticula.
Otherwise. the duodenal mucosa appears unremarkable. At 2.0 cm proximal to the ampullary
opening, there is suspicious opening of pancreatic duct which is contiguous with the
common bile duct. Serial cross-sections through the pancreas reveal an ill-defined mass

lesion, 2.7 cm in maximum dimension. The pancreatic lesion appears to be 0.1 am away
from the distal resection and 0.1 cm from the uncinate margin. The distal pancreatic
margin is inked blue and the uncinate margin is inked orange. The pancreatic lesion
appears to invade around the common bile duct and focally invades into the submucosa of
the duodenum.

Representative sections are submitted in cassettes labeled as follows:

D1
D2

- shaved margin of common bile duct.
- duodenal diverticula

D3 through DE - area of depressed duodenal mucosa with underlying lesion
