Pathology Report

DIAGNOSIS
(A) LEFT KIDNEY:
RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL (80% CLEAR CELLS, 20% EOSINOPHILIC CELLS), FUHRMAN‘S
NUCLEAR GRADE 2.
TUMOR CONFINED TO THE KIDNEY.
TUMOR MEASURES 5.5 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION.
Ureteral, vascular and soft tissue margins of resection. free of tumor.
(B) RIGHT ADRENAL GLAND:
Adrenal cortical adenoma (2.9 cm in maximum dimension).
Margins of resection free of tumor.
(C) DISTAL ESOPHAGUS, PROXIMAL STOMACH:
SMOOTH MUSCLE NEOPLASM CONSISTENT WITH LEIOMYOMA. (SEE COMMENT)
TUMOR MEASURES 4.5 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION.
Distal and proximal resection margins, free of tumor.
Focal ulceration of gastric mucosa, no tumor present.
Five lymph nodes, no tumor present.

COMMENT
The tumor in the peri esophageal and gastric adipose tissue demonstrates mature smooth muscle with microscopic focus of necrosis
but without atypia or significant mitotic activity. The immunohistochemlcal stains demonstrate that the tumor is positive for desmin and

negative for c-Klt, C934 and S-100, supporting the diagnosis of leiomyoma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION
(A) LEFT KIDNEY - A left nephrectomy specimen with attached perinephric fat (overall 17.0 x 10.0 x 5.5 cm) with kidney (10.5 x 6.0 x 4.5
cm) and attached ureter (5.0 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter). Located in the upper pole Is a well-circumscribed brown-yellow tumor
(5.5 x 5.0 x 3.0 cm) with focal hemorrhage. The tumor approaches the renal capsule, but is confined to the kidney. The tumor is 0.4 cm
from Gerota‘s fasoia. No involvement of the renal sinus, renal vein, or perinephric fat is identified. The remaining renal parenchyma is
unremarkable.
INK CODE: Black - Gerota's fascia.
SECTION CODE: A1, vascular and ureteral resection margin; A2-A7. tumor with adjacent renal parenchyma; A8, A9, tumor with renal
capsule and inked Gerota's fascia; A10, grossly normal renai pelvis and renal sinus; A11, A12, normal renal parenchyma. (Note: Tumor
sample is obtained for tumor bank and possible electron microscopy study.)
(B) RIGHT ADRENAL GLAND - An adrenal giand with attached adipose tissue (4.5 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm). A welt-circumscribed homogeneous
brown-yeilow tumor (2.9 x 2.4 x 1.9 cm) is present in the adrenal. Norma! adrenal cortex is identified around
the periphery of the tumor. No necrosis or hemorrhage is identified. Representative sections are submitted in cassette 31-37. Tumor
specimen was obtained for Tumor Bank and electron microscopy studies.
(C) DISTAL ESOPHAGUS, PROXIMAL STOMACH - A specimen consisting of distal esophagus and proximal of stomach (8.0 x 6.0 x 5.0
cm overall). The distai esophagus measures 0.8 cm in length. Located in the serosai surface of the stomach. 0.5 cm from the GE junction
is a well circumscribed encapsulated tumor (4.5 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm). The tumor is firmly attached to the gastric wail. The external surface of
the tumor is smooth. Sectioning reveals the tumor parenchyma is light tan, firm and whorlecl. The center portion of the tumor is
hemorrhagic with possible necrosis. The remaining gastric and esophageal mucosa is unremarkable.

INK CODE: Blue-external surface of the tumor.
SECTION CODE: 01, esophageal margin for frozen section examination; 02-04, gastric margin for frozen section examination; 05,
tumor representative section for frozen section examination; 06-014, representative sections of the tumor (with gastric wall in 06-07
and GE junction in 013-014); 015, two possible lymph nodes,- C16, three possible lymph nodes.
*FSIDX: MARGINS NEGATIVE (ESOPHAGEAL AND GASTRIC) SPINDLE CELL NEOPLASM FINAL DIAGNOSIS AFTER PERMANENT
SECTIONS.
