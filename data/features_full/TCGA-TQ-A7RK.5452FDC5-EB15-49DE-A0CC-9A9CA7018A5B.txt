ANATOMOPATHOLOGIC RESULT
MACROSCOPY

Received two irregular, whitish and soft fragments, measuring 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm.
MICROSCOPY

The histological sections stained with H & E show fragments of glial neoplasia, mainly
located in the white matter, showing double cell population. The neoplastic cells exhibit
sometimes round nuclei, delicate chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli with scant
cytoplasm, and sometimes convoluted and irregular nuclei, with dense chromatin and
eosinophilic cytoplasm, with imprecise limits. The tumor shows looser areas where
occasional microcysts are seen, filled with amorphous and basophilic material. Mitotic
figures are rare (about 1 mitosis for 10-20 high—power fields). However, in some areas,
the tumor exhibits greater cellularity and cellular atypia. Are not observed vessels with
microvascular proliferation and l or necrotic areas in this material.

PER-OPERATIVE

Cytological findings suggestive of high-grade glioma.

DIAGNOSTIC

-Oligoastrocitoma with focal atypia (WHO grade II) in this material.
