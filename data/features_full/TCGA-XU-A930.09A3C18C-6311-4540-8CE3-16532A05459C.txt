COMMENT .

This tumor is predominantly epithelioid type composed of sheets and nests
of large polygonal cells with relatively uniform round nuclei. There is
mild lymphocytic infiltrate throughout the tumor. Focally some tumor
cells show prominent nucleoli, but there is no necrosis. Possible
lymphatic vessel infiltration is noted focally at the tumor periphery
(invasion front). Occasional mitotic figures are present. The tumor has
invaded.into the adipose tissue but has not crossed the visceral pleura
elastica into the lung. The tumor cells stain positive for high molecular
weight cytokeratin but negative for CD5 and EMA. Focally some of the
lymphocytes are CD1a positive, although the majority is CD5 positive.
Overall the histological appearances of the tumor cells, the presence of
CD1a lymphocytes and negative CDS staining‘of tumor cells are more
consistent with a predominantly epithelioid type thymoma.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as_'thymus: Thymoma,
resection of portion of innominate vein and wedge resection right upper
lobe", consists of a 15.0 x 10.3 x 3.0 cm irregular piece of soft fatty
tissue, received fresh. There is a 7.0 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm firm, tan,
irregularly shaped tumor within the specimen. An attached 4.5 x 2.7 x
1.1 cm wedge of lung tissue is adherent to the specimen, in apparent
contiguity with the tumor. A 6.0 cm length staple line partially
encircles the lung wedge. A 1.3 cm length x 0.2 cm diameter segment of
inominate vein is identified. The proximal portion of the vessel appears
to be incorporated within the mass, however, the vein margin is grossly
free of tumour. The specimen is painted with silver nitrate. The tumor
and uninvolved tissue are sampled for tiSsue banking. Representative
sections are submitted as follows:
