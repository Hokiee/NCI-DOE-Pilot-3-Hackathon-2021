- DEEPER LEVEL RECUTS AND SPECIAL STAINS HAVE BEEN ORDERED. THE

RESULTS WILL BE REPORTED IN AN ADDENDUM.

- INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, NOS TYPE, HISTOLOGIC GRADE III/III (SLIGHT
OR NO TUBULE FORMATION), NUCLEAR GRADE III/III (MARKED VARIATION IN SIZE AND
SHAPE), PRESENT AS THREE SEPARATE NODULES, RANGING IN SIZE PROM 1.0 CM UP T0

3.7 CM.

- DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS) IS ALSO IDENTIFIED, SOLID TYPE WITH HIGH

NUCLEAR GRADE AND MINIMAL NECROSIS.

- THE DCIS CONSTITUTES <- 25% OF THE TOTAL TUMOR MASS, AND IS PRESENT
ADMIXED WITH AND AWAY FROM THE INVASIVE COMPONENT.
- NO CALCIPICATIONS ARE IDENTIFIED IN EITHER THE INVASIVE OR IN SITU

CARCINOMA.
- NO VASCULAR INVASION IS NOTED.

- INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS 0.15 CM FROM THE NEAREST (SUPERIOR) MARGIN AND 0.4

CM FROM THE POSTERIOR MARGIN.

- THE NON-NEOPLASTIC BREAST TISSUE IS UNREMARKABLE.
- RESULTS OF SPECIAL STAINS (ER, PR, HERZ-NEU) WILL BE REPORTED AS AN

ADDENDUM .

1) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis, labeled,
"Sentinel node #1, level one, right axilla". It consists of a single lymph

node, measuring 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm. The lymph node is bisected and entirely
frozen.

Summary of Sections:
FSC frozen section control

2) The specimen is received fresh for frozen section diagnosis, labeled,
"Sentinel node #2, level one, right axilla". It consists of a single lymph
node, measuring 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. Bisected and entirely submitted.

Summary of Sections:

3) The specimen is received fresh, labeled, "wide excision of tumor
right breast 10:00 (short stitch superior, long stitch lateral)". It
consists of an ovoid to irregular piece of yellow lobulated adipose tissue,
measuring about 9.5 x 7.5 x 4.0 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is
oriented with a short stitch at the superior aspect and a long stitch at the
lateral margin. The specimen is inked as follows: superior-blue,

inferior-red, posterior-black, anterior-yellow. Serial sections of the
breast reveal large centrally located 3.7 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm fairly
well-circumscribed, tan lesion, located about 1.0 cm from the superior,
inferior, and medial margins. The tumor is closest to the anterior and
posterior margin and is at a distance of 0.5 cm from either of them. Cut
surface of the tumor reveals a tan, slightly granular appearance. About 1.0
cm superior and lateral to the main mass are two smaller well-circumscribed
nodules, the larger of which measures 2.2 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm. This fairly
well-circumscribed nodule is < 0.2 cm from the superior margin and is
located about 1.0 cm from the lateral and 0.5 cm from the posterior margin.
About 0.5 cm lateral to this nodule is the smallest nodule measuring about
1.0 cm in diameter. The smallest nodule is located 0.2 cm from the superior
and 0.5 cm from the lateral margin. The remaining portion of the breast
parenchyma is composed of yellow lobulated adipose tissue. Representative
sections of the specimen are submitted as follows.
