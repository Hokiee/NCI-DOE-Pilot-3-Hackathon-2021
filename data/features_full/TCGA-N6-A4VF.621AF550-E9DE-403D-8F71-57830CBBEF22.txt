SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY -

MALIGNANT MIXED MULLERIAN TUMOR OF UTERUS.

TWO (2) LARGE TUMORS MEASURING 8.5 X 5.2 AND 3.1 X 3.0 CM, RESPECTIVELY (GROSS
MEASUREMENT).

BOTH TUMORS SHOW POLYPOID GROWTH PATTERN WITH DEPTH OF MYOMETRIUM INVASION 35% (0.7
OF 2.0 CM. SLIDES K AND L).

LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IS NOTED.

CERVIX WITH SQUAMOUS METAPLASIA WITH NO TUMOR INVOLVEMENT.

LEIOMYOMA (3.5 CM) AND ADENOMYOSIS.

SURGICAL MARGINS ARE NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.

LEFT AND RIGHT OVARIES WITH BENIGN SEROUS CYSTADENOFIBROMA.

RIGHT FALLOPIAN TUBE WITH HYDROSALPINX.

LEFT FALLOPIAN TUBE WITH PARATUBAL CYSTS.

PART 3: PELVIC LYMPH NODES. LEFT, BIOPSY «-
THREE (3) LYMPH NODES. NEGATIVE FOR METASTATIC MALIGNANCY.

PART 4: PELVIC LYMPH NODE, RIGHT. BIOPSY -
ONE (1) LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTATIC MALIGNANCY.
COMMENT: _
lmmunostains for vlmentln, AE1IAE3 and cam 5.2 were performed on block 2E, 2M, 20 (desmm and caldesmon),

conﬁrming the diagnosis. The Malignant epithelial component includes endometrioid carcinoma and also undifferentiated
carcinoma (slide 2E). Pelvic wash is negative for malignancy
