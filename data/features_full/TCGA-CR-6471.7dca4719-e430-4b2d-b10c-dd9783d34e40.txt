GROSS DESCRIPTION:

1) SOURCE: Left anterior ﬂoor of mouth mucosal Margin

Received fresh is a 0.9 X 0.1 X 0.1 cm sliver of tan-pink soft tissue.

It is submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis.

Summary of sections: lAFSC, 1/1.

2) SOURCE: Left alveolar mucosal Margin

Received fresh is a 0.7 X 0.5 X 0.4 cm fragment of tan-pink soft tissue.
It is submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis.

Summary of sections: 2AFSC, 1/1.

3) SOURCE: Superior tongue Margin, Right

Received fresh are two fragments of tan-pink soft tissue measuring 1.5 X
0.5 X 0.3 cm in aggregate. They are submitted entirely for frozen

section diagnosis.

Summary of sections: 3AFSC, 2/1.

4) SOURCE: Right alveolar ridge mucosal Margin

Received fresh is a 1.2 X 0.9 X 0.4 cm fragment of tan-pink mucosa. The

specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis.
Summary of sections: 4AFSC, l/l.

5) SOURCE: Posterior ﬂoor of Mouth mucosa

Received fresh is a 1.9 X 0.3 X 0.3 cm fragment of tan-pink mucosa. The
specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis.
Summary of sections: 5AFSC, 1/ 1.

6) SOURCE: Right Neck Level 1

Received fresh is a 5.6 X 4.0 X 1.7 cm piece of tan-pink and yellow
nodular soft tissue. Three possible lymph nodes are identified as well

as what appears to be a large mass of lymph nodes that is 4.0 X 3.5 X

1.0 cm. These possible lymph nodes are submitted entirely.

Summary of sections: 6A, two possible nodes, 2/ 1; 6B, one possible node
bisected, 1/ 1; 6C-6G, lymph node mass, 1/1 each.

7) SOURCE: Anterior Right Neck level 11

Received fresh is a 4.0 X 3.0 X 1.0 cm mass of tan-pink soft tissue and
yellow adipose. Four lymph nodes are identified within the specimen.
They are submitted entirely.

Summary of sections: 7A, two lymph nodes, 2/ 1; 7B, 7C, one lymph node
bisected each, 1/1 each.

8) SOURCE: Right Neck anterior level 111

Received fresh is a 4.5 X 4.0 X 1.0 cm fragment of pink and yellow soft
tissue. Eight possible lymph nodes are identified. They are submitted
entirely.

Summary of sections: 8A-B, 4 possible lymph nodes each, 4/ 1.

9) SOURCE: Right Neck posterior level 11

Received fresh is a fragment of pink and yellow soft tissue that
measures 4.5 X 4.0 X 1.0 cm. Multiple small lymph nodes are palpated
within the specimen. The specimen is bisected and submitted entirely.
Summary of sections: 9A, half of specimen, 1/ 1; 9B, half of specimen,
1/ 1.

10) SOURCE: Bilateral one A

Received fresh is a 3.5 X 3.0 X 1.0 cm fragment of pink and yellow soft
tissue. There is no definitive lymph node identified within the

specimen. There is a small fragment of red skeletal muscle. The specimen
is bisected and submitted entirely.

Summary of sections: 10A-B, half of specimen each, 1/1 each.

11) SOURCE: Right mandible

Received fresh is a 6.0 X 4.2 X 2.6 cm specimen that consists of a 5.5

cm length of mandible and attached muscle, mucosa and soft tissue. Along
the surface of the mucosa there is a 4.2 X 1.8 cm sessile mass without
obvious areas of ulceration. The specimen in inked such that yellow is
posterior, orange is anterior, black is deep, green is lateral and blue

is medial. The specimen is serially sectioned and the above noted mass

appears to go to a depth of 1.0 cm. It appears to go down to the level

of the superior portion of the mandible but does not appear to grow into
the bone. It does not appear to involve the surrounding skeletal muscle.
Representative sections are submitted after decalcification.

Summary of sections: 11A, medial soft tissue and mass, 1/ 1; 11B,
anterior soft tissue and mass, 1/ 1; 11C, bony margin, 2/ 1; 11D, part of
anterior and posterior soft tissue margins, 2/ 1; 11E, anterior soft

tissue margin, 5/ 1; 11F and 11G, representative mass with mandible, 1/1
each.

12) SOURCE: Right Superior Tongue Margin

Received fresh is a 1.8 X 1.1 X 0.2 cm fragment of pink-red soft tissue.
It is submitted entirely for frozen section diagnosis.
Summary of sections: 12AFSC, 1/ 1.

13) SOURCE: Third Tongue Margin

Received fresh are 2 slivers of tan-pink soft tissue that measures 2.5 X
0.2 X 0.2 and 2.7 X 0.2 X 0.2 cm. These are submitted entirely for
frozen section diagnosis.

Summary of sections: 13AFSC, 2/ 1.

14) SOURCE: Right Superior Tongue

Received fresh are 2 unoriented fragments of pink and red mucosa and
underlying soft tissue that measures 2.6 X 2.4 X 0.6 cm. There are no
obvious masses or lesions noted on the fragment. They are submitted
entirely.

Summary of sections: 14A, 2/ 1.
