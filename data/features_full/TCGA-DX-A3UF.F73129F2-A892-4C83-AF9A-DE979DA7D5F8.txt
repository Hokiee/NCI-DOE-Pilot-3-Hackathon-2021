Gross Description:

1. The specimen is received fresh, labeled IIinterior vena cava with tumor-
and consists of a 9.4 on patent segment 0! vein, associated with a 6.0 x 2.8
x 2.9 cm nodular mass at one end. The nodular mass is inked black and white
consists of two separate adjacent nodules. measuring 3.7 x 2.8 x 2.9 cm and
2.9 x 1.9 x 2 .2 cm, respectively. There is a 1.3 cm staple line associated
with a thin piece 02 yellow plastic on the larger nodule. This staple line
is inked blue. Sectioning of the mass shows predominantly white, whorled cut
surfaces. There are focal areas of nodularity. Sectioning also shows both
nodules to he subjacent to the vein. The segment of vein that is not
involved by this mass measures 6.2 x 0.7 cm. There is a separate 1.7 x 1.2 x
0.8 cm nodule that is loosely attached to the larger nodule by fibrous
tissue. Cut sections of this nodule shows gray - ten solid, cut surfaces.
Tissue is submitted for TPS. Photographs are taken. Representative sections
are submitted.

Summary of sections:

DM - vein margin distal to tumor
TM — staple margin to tumor

CM - vein margin closer to tumor
LN - large nodule

SN - small nodule

N - separate nodule

(vxz)
2). C .,Lmen is received fresh, labeled “Gallbladder' and consists of a
ga\:: r measuring 8.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm. The surface of the gallbladder is

he; r. and smooth . It is opened to reveal yellow green viscous bile and
tan green sparkled mucosa. The wall thickness measures up to 0.3 cm.
Representative sections including the cystic duct margin are submitted.

Summary of sections:
M — cystic duct margin
0 - undesignxﬁad

3).The specimen is -.= d in formalin, labeled "iliac lymph node" and
consists of one pins ran ter lymph node measuring 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm. The
lymph nodes is bisected and submitted entirely.
