***‘*GROSS DESCRIPTION:*****

The specimens are received in nine properly labeled containers with the
patient' 5 name and accession number, two of which are submitted for frozen
section.

A. The specimen is designated "anterior lymph node right neck" and
consists of a 1.7 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm aggregate of soft tissue in which there is
a 1.3 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm lymph node. The specimen is resubmitted as received
from frozen section in cassette A31. TE 1

B. The specimen is designated "possible right inferior

parathyroid" and consists of a 0.4 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm piece of soft tissue. The

specimen is resubmitted as received from frozen section in cassette BFl. TE
1

C. The specimen is designated "right thyroid lobe" and consists of
a 317.6 gram hemithyroidectomy that is 13.4 cm from superior to inferior,
9.4 cm from medial to lateral and 6.5 cm in the anteroposterior dimension.
The outer surface of the hemithyroid is diffusely nodular and numerous
grossly positive lymph nodes are identified in the perithyroidal soft
tissue. The isthmic resection edge is inked orange and the outer surface of
the specimen is inked blue. The cut surface of the mass is solid tan-white
and has foci of both hemorrhage and necrosis. The greatest dimension of the
mass is 9.4 cm. The mass diffusely approaches the inked outer surface of
the thyroid. In the perithyroidal soft tissue, seven lymph nodes are
identified, six of which are grossly positive for tumor. The largest
grossly positive lymph node is 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. (

Summary of Cassettes: C1-2, isthmic resection edge, perpendicular;
C3-6, representative sections of mass to inked outer surface; C7, necrotic
and hemorrhagic portion of mass to inked outer surface; C8, one lymph node;
C9, representative section of the largest grossly positive lymph node; C10,
representative sections of three grossly positive lymph nodes; C11,
representative sections of two grossly positive lymph nodes

D. The specimen is designated "right anterior level 3 lymph nodes"
and consists of a 4.7 x 2.3 x 1.0 cm aggregate of tan-yellow soft tissue
that contains two lymph nodes that are 2.9 x 1.5 x 1.0 and 2.5 x 1.3 x 1.0
cm respectively. The lymph nodes are grossly positive for tumor involvement
(confirmed by touch preparation); one representative section of each lymph
node is submitted for microscopic examination.

Summary of Cassettes: Dl, representative section of one grossly
positive lymph node; D2, representative section of second grossly positive
lymph node

Note: Each grossly positive lymph node is submitted in its plane of
greatest dimension.

E. The specimen is designated "right central neck tissue" and
consists of one sheet of tan-yellow soft tissue that is 4.2 x 3.5 x 0.4 cm.
No lymph nodes are grossly identified. The entire specimen is submitted for
microscopic examination. TE 2

F. The specimen is designated "right level 3 and 4 lymph nodes"
and consists of an unoriented piece of soft yellow adipose tissue that is
6.2 x 5.7 x 1.9 cm. Multiple possible lymph nodes are identified that range

from 0.2 to 1.8 cm in greatest dimension. Only adipose tissue remains in
the container. RS 4

Summary of Cassettes: F1, six possible lymph nodes; F2, five possible
lymph nodes; F3, three possible lymph nodes; F4, one possible lymph node,
bisected

G. The specimen is designated "possible right inferior
parathyroid" and consists of a less than 0.05 gram aggregate of red— brown
soft tissue that is 0.7 x 0.3 x 0. 2 cm. The specimen is submitted in its
entirety for microscopic examination in cassette G1. TE 1

H. The specimen is designated "left thyroid lobe" and consists of
an 11.0 gram hemithyroidectomy that is 5.4 cm from superior to inferior,
3.6 cm from medial to lateral and 1.3 cm in the anteroposterior dimension.
The isthmic resection margin is inked orange and the outer surface of the
thyroid is inked blue. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal
homogeneous beefy red parenchyma with no focal masses or lesions. RS 4

Summary of Cassettes: H1, isthmic resection edge, shaved; H2-4,
representative sections of left thyroid lobe

I. The specimen is designated "superior central lymph nodes" and
consists of one piece of tan-white soft tissue that is 2.4 x 1.4 x 0.8 cm.
Two firm possible lymph nodes are identified that are 0.4 and 1.4 cm in
greatest dimension respectively. TE 2

Summary of Cassettes: Il, one possible lymph node; 12, one possible
lymph node, bisected
