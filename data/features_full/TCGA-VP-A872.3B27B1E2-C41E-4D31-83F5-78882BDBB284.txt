By this signature, I attest that the above diagnosis is
based upon my personal
examination of the slides(and/or other material indicated in the
diagnosis).

***Report Electronically Reviewed and Signed Out By ***
Intraoperative Consultation:
”Called to pick up ‘prostate' consisting of a 48 gm, 5 x 5 x 3 cm prostate with
attached bilateral seminal vesicles. Tissue from left and right lobes taken for
tumor bank. Rest for permanents," by
Microscopic Description and Comment:
Sections show extensive involvement of the prostate gland by mixed ductal and
acinar adenocarcinoma with greater than 50% of the tumor showing ductal
morphology. The ductal component exhibits abundant comedo—type necrosis
(Gleason grade 5). The acinar component is mainly Gleason grade 3, but a
tertiary pattern of Gleason 4 is 3150 noted. We also see foamy gland features
within the acinar component. ; has reviewed this case and
concurs.

History:

The patient is a . man with prostate cancer. Operative procedure:
Laparoscopic prostatectomy.

Specimen(s) Received:

A: LYMPH NODE, BILATERAL PELVIC

B: PROSTATE

 

Gross Description
The specimens are received in two formalin—filled containers, each labeled

The first container is labeled "Pelvic lymph nodes." It
consists of multiple fragments of adipose tissue measuring 5 x 4 x 1.2 cm.
There are multiple lymph nodes extracted, the largest measures 2 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm;
the smallest is 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm. Labeled Al and A2 — dissected putative lymph
nodes. Jar l.
The second container is labeled “prostate." It consists of a single previously
inked prostate weighing 48 gm and measuring 5 x 3 x 3 cm. The outer surface of
the prostate is rough and was previously inked black. The right seminal vesicle
measures 2.8 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm; the left seminal vesicle measures 3 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm.
The right vas deferens measures 0.8 x 0.4 cm; the left vas deferens measures 1.5
x 0.5 cm. Serial sectioning shows tan nodular area on the urethra. The largest
measures 0.5 x 0.8 cm. Also at the right apex are golden
discolorations/nodular area, the largest measuring 0.2 x 0.2cm. Labeled Bl—
right neck shave margin; BZ ~ left neck shave margin: BB and B4 - right apical
margin; B5 and B6 — left apical margin; B7 and BB - right base; B9 and 810 —
right apex; 811 and 312 — left base; B13 and 314 - left apex; B15 - right
seminal vesicle; B16 — left seminal vesicle. Jar 2.
