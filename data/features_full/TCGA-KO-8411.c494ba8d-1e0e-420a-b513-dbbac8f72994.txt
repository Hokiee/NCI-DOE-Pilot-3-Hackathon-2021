DIAGNOSIS
(A) LEFT KIDNEY:

CHROMOPHOBE RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, FUHRMAN'S NUCLEAR GRADE 3. (SEE

COMMENT)
TUMOR MEASURES 5.0 CM IN MAXIMUM DIMENSION.
FOCAL LYMPHATICNASCULAR INVASION IDENTIFIED.
Multilocular cyst. (4.0 cm)
Margins of resection free of tumor.

COMMENT

Immunoperoxidase studies demonstrate the tumor cells to be positive for
CK7 and negative for CD10 and Vimentin, supporting the diagnosis of
Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. The tumor has a pushing border but
does not invade the sinus adipose tissue or perinephric fat. The renal
vein is free of tumor.

GROSS DESCRIPTION

(A) LEFT KIDNEY - A nephrectomy specimen (15.0 x 10.0 x 8.0 cm)
including the kidney (10.0 x 6.0 x 5.0 cm) and attached ureter (9.0 cm
in length).

Located in the mid-portion of the kidney there is a orange-brown
homogeneous tumor measuring 5 x 4 x 4 cm. The tumor appears grossly to
be conﬁned to the kidney. No invasion of the renal vein is identified.
Located in the inferior pole of the kidney (0.5 cm from the main mass)
is a large muItiIocuIar cyst (4.0 x 3.0 x 3.0 cm) containing clear
ﬂuid. The cyst has a thin capsule and smooth lining.

SECTION CODE: A1, vascular and ureteric resection margin, en face;
A2-A7, tumor with adjacent kidney; A8, A9, tumor with adjacent renal
sinus; A10-A14, renal cysts with adjacent renal parenchyma and small
