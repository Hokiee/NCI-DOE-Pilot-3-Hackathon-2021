A. PROSTATE

GROSS DESCRIPTION:
A. PROSTATE
Received fresh labeled with the patient's identiﬁcation and "prostate“ is a 33-9 resected prostate gland
measuring 4 cm from right lateral to left lateral, 3.7 cm from anterior to posterior, and 2.7 cm from apex
to base. The capsule is smooth, red, and intact. ink code: Anterior-orange, apex—red, base-blue, right
lateral-green, left lateral—yeliow, posterior-black. After removal of the apex and base, the prostate
weighs 20 9. it censists of uniform tan parenchyma. The left seminal vesicle is 1.9 x 0.9 x 0.5 cm and
the right is 3.4 x 1.6 x 0.8 cm; they are made of cystic tan tissue. The left vas deferens is 2 x 0.6 cm
and the right is 1.8 x 0.9 cm; they consists of a tubular tart tissue. Tissue is procured (8 9). Submitted

DIAGNOSIS:
A. PROSTATE. SEMINAL VESICLES, AND VASA DEFERENTIA (RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY):
- PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 3 + 3 = 6 INVOLVING THE RIGHT AND
LEFT PROSTATE LOBES {APPROXIMATELY 20% OF PROSTATE TISSUE)
- NO EXTRAPROSTATlC EXTENSEON IDENTIFIED
— NO DEFINITE ANGIOLYMPHATIC AND PERINEURAL INVASION IDENTIFEED
- TUMOR MICROSCOPICALLY INVOLVES THE LEFT POSTERIOR AND LATERAL SURGICAL
MARGIN (LINEAR DISTANCE OF POSiTiVE MARGIN: <O.5-MM)
- RlGHT AND LEFT SEMINAL VESICLES AND VAS DEFERENS, NEGATEVE FOR TUMOR
