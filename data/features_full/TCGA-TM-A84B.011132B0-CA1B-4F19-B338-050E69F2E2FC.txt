and angulaled cells with hyperchromatic nuclei. Some gomislocytic
tumour cells are also present. The tumour is associated with some
microcystic change iocatly and there is also quite prominent calciﬁcation
present amongst the tumour cells. On low power also there is a line
vascular pattern with an almost chicken wire architecture. There is no
evidence of necrosis and no evidence of endothelial proliferation.

MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY AND OTHER TESTING IF REQUIRED:

FISH 1p 19q and EGFR ampliﬁcation:

Block: C. This is high recommended as whiist the cells cytologicaliy are
favoured to represent malignant astrocytic cells, the tow power
appearance together with the quite prominent calciﬁcation and vascular
pattern is reminiscent of an oiigodendmgtioma which in this case would be
an anaplastic otigodendrogiioma. given the high mitotic rate and ‘
pleornorphic nuclei. Awaiting patient agreement for this testing.
