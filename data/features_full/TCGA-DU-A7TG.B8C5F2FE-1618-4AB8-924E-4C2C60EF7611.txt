CLINICAL HISTORY

-old man with past history of long standing headaches and
depression, and ' smoking, was found unresponsive at home. On CT
there is a right frontal lobe slightly enhancing lesion, with thickened genu
of corpus callosum and expansion of left frontal lobe.
OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES
Right frontal lesion.
Operation/Specimen: A: Brain,right frontal lobe mass, biopsy
B: Brain,right frontal lobe tumor, excision biopsy
C: Brain,right frontal lobe tumor, excision biopsy
PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS:
A, B, and C. Brain, right frontal, excisional biopsies and excision:
l. Oligodendroglioma (WHO II/III).
2. MIB—l proliferation index: 2% to 4%.
See Microscopy Description and Comment.
COMMENT
The neoplasm is an oligodendroglioma devoid of nuclear anaplasia,
microvascular cellular proliferation, or necrosis. There are focal
proliferation centers, and zones of white matter rarefaction and gliosis. In
the tissues examined the neoplasm is a WHO grade II/III. The morphology is
consistent with a tumor that has 1p/19q LOH.

MGMT Promoter Methylation

Date Ordered: Date Reported:

Interpretation

POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected.

Results—Comments

Testing performed on tissue block (B3).

TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter
have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of
MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA followed

by real—time PCR amplification of methylated and unmethylated
DNA

sequences.
FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a
stand alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its performance
characteristics determined by the as
required by CLIA ' 88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for
specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results
are
provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.

Loss of Heterozygosity lp, l9q Assay (LOH)
Date Ordered: Date Reported:
Interpretation

POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1p and chromosome arm l9q is
detected.

Informative loci are: DlSlS92, DlSSSZ, D198219, D198412, and PLA2G4C
Results—Comments

Testing performed on tumor paraffin block (A2) and a blood
specimen

to establish germline genotype.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA
(baseline)/ Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers
on 1p are DlSS48, DlSlSBZ, and DlSSSZ (with DlS468, DlSl612, and DlS496 as
backup markers) and the 3 markers on l9q are D195219, D193412, and PLA2G4C
(with D198606 and D1981182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or
4

nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat)
polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score,
amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used if the
first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or otherwise
ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each
chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1p
and l9q deletion.

FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a
stand—alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its performance
characteristics determined by the as
required by CLIA ' 88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for
specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These results
are

provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in
the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria.

TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non—neoplastic cells in the
sample

may preclude the detection of allelic loss.

PRINCIPLE: Among the major subtypes of gliomas, oligodendrogliomas are
distinguished by their remarkable sensitivity to chemotherapy, with
approximately 70% of anaplastic (malignant) oligodendrogliomas responding
dramatically to treatment with procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine
(termed PCV) (Cairncross et al, 1998). Unfortunately, no clinical or
pathologic feature allows accurate prediction of chemotherapeutic response.
oligodendrogliomas are also associated with a longer average patient survival

as compared to astrocytic tumors. However, the histologic distinction between
oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma is often highly subjective, and there has
been significant interobserver variation.

Studies (Cairncross et al, 1998; Inc et al, 2001; Smith et al, 2000) have
shown that:

~ allelic loss (loss of heterozygosity) of chromosome arm lp is a
statistically significant and currently the best predictor of
chemosensitivity

— combined loss involving chromosome arms 1p and 19q predicts both
chemotherapeutic response and longer survival in patients with
oligodendrogliomas

— combined allelic loss of chromosomes lp and 19q can be considered a
molecular signature of oligodendroglioma (present in approximately 70—80% of
oligodendroglial tumors and in only 10% of astrocytomas)

INTRA«OPERATIVE CONSULTATION

tissue, 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. Frozen sections and smears are performed. Frozen
residual is submitted in Al and unfrozen is submitted in A2.

PIECES: 1 segment of brain tissue. SIZE/VOL: 5.0x2.5x2.l cm. CASSETTES: 1-6,

C. Brain,right frontal lobe tumor, excision biopsy: FIXATIVE: Formalin. NO.
PIECES: 1 segment of brain tissue. SIZE/VOL: 4.3x2.4xl.3 cm. CASSETTES: 1—4,

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

H\T\E: There is a neoplastic proliferation of oligodendrocytes that has some
"proliferation centers", and infiltrates the brain sparsely or moderately.
There are only occasional mitotic figures, more readily observed in the
proliferation centers, where there is also neovascularization. There is no
microvascular cellular proliferation. There is no necrosis. In part C, in
addition to focal neoplasm, there is rarefaction and prominent reactive
astrocytosis with Rosenthal fibers.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The GFAP demonstrates absent or sparse gliofibrillarity
by the neoplastic cells. The tumor cells do not over express the p53 protein.
Synaptophysin and NeuN demonstrate the proclivity of the neoplasm for the
cerebral cortex, and absence of positive reaction in the neoplastic cells.
The CD34 depicts the neovascularization within the tumor. With the MIBl, the
overall proliferation index is about 2%, and in the proliferation centers it
may be up to about 4%.

In the rarefied, gliotic areas of specimen C there are no neuronal elements,
neoplastic astrocytes, or diffuse reactivity with CD34.

SPECIAL STAIN: The PAS with/without diastase fails to demonstrate granular
bodies.
