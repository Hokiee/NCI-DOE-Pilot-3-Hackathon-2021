CLINICAL HISTORY:
Malignant neoplasm corpus uteri, 182.0. '

GROSS EXAMINATION:
A. "Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries (AF1\" wceived fresh for frozen
section and placed in formalin at is a 92 gram, 6.2 x 3.5 x

and 4.5 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm grossly unremarkable right ovary. Also attached is a
6.5 x 1 cm grossly unremarkable left fallopian tube, and 4.6 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm
grossly unremarkable left ovary. The cervix is grossly unremarkable. The
serosal surface of the uterus is smooth, glistening, and grossly
unremarkable.

The 3.7 x 2.7 cm endometrial cavity is entirely filled by an exophytic,
friable mass. The mass appears to grossly involve the anterior and posterior
lower uterine segments. It comes within 3 cm of the distal cervix. The
exophytic mass is 1.5 cm deep and appears to grossly invade approximately 0.4
cm into a 1.3 cm thick myometrium. There are no other lesions noted in the
myometrium or remainder of the specimen.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:

A. "Uterus, cervix, tubes, and ovary": AFl- (representative mass)— high—grade
malignancy. The tumor invades less
than half of the myometrial thickness
(one section examined) (Dr. ).

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
Microscopic examination is performed.

PATHOLOGIC STAGE:
PROCEDURE: Hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy, lymph node sampling
PATHOLOGIC STAGE (AJCC 7th Edition): pTla pNO pMX

NOTE: Information on pathology stage and the operative procedure is
transmitted to this Institution's Cancer Registry as required for
accreditation by the Commission on Cancer. Pathology stage is based solely
upon the current tissue specimen being evaluated, and does not incorporate
information on any specimens submitted separately to our Cytology section,
past pathology information, imaging studies, or clinical or operative
findings. Pathology stage is only a component to be considered in determining
the clinical stage, and should not be confused with nor substituted for it.
The exact operative procedure is available in the surgeon's operative report.

DIAGNOSIS:
A. UTERUS, CERVIX, TUBES AND OVARIES (HYSTERE OMY AND BILATERAL
SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY):

UTERUS: 92 GRAMS
CARCINOMA or THE ENDOMETRIUM:
TUMOR SITE: DIFFUSE.
HISTOLOGIC TYPE: ENDOMETRIOID ADENOCARCINOMA.
