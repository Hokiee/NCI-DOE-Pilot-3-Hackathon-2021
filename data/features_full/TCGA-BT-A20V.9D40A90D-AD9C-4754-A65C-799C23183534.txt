TUBES, RADICAL CYSTECTOMY. HYSTERECTOMY. AND BILATERAI. SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY -

URINARY BLADDER:

‘l. INVASIVE UROTI'IELIAI. CARCINOMA, HIGH-GRADE (2004 WHO/ISUP), 5.0 CM, INVOLVING THE BLADDER NECK
AND THE POSTERIOR:RIGHTTATERAL AND LEFT LATERAL WALLS OF THE BLADDER. CARCINOMA
EXTENDS INTO THE RIGHT AND LEFT URETERAL ORIFICES (SLIDES 45 AND 4C).

2. UROTHEI'JAL CARCINOMA PENETRATES THROUGH THE DETRUSOR MUSCLE AND EXTENDS INTO THE

PERIVESICAL ADIPOSE TISSUE (SLIDES ‘5. 4H, AND 4.!) AND INTO THE UTERUS (SLIDES 4L, 4W, 4X, 4Y, AND

42).

MULTIFOCAL LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IS IDENTIFIED (SLIDES 43, 4X, 4Y, AND AZ).

PERINEURAL INVASION IS IDENTIFIED (SLIDE N).

SURROUNDING BLADDER MUCOSA WITH MULTIFOCAL PAPILLARY UROTI'IELIAL CARCINOMA, FOCALLY
HIGH-GRADE. INVOLVING THE POSTERIOR BLADDER WALL (SLIDES 4L AND 4M).

UTERUS. CERVIX. BILATERAL OVARIES. AND FALLOPIAN TUBES:
1. INVASIVE UROTHELIAL CARCINOMA EXTENSIVELY INVOLVING ECTOCERVIX AND ENDOCERVIX,
MYOMETRIUM. AND ENDOMETRIUM.

2. FOCAL ENDOMETRIAL CYSTIC ATROPI-IY.

3. TWO LEIOMYOMAS, 1.5 AND 1.2 CM (SLIDES 4X AND 4V).

4. BENLGN BILATERAL OVARIES WITH MULTIPLE CORPORA ALBICANTIA.

PART 5: LYMPH MODES. RIGHT PELVIC, LYMPH NODE DISSECTION —

A. MET ASTATIC CARCINOMA IN TWO OF THREE LYMPH NODES (2I3).
B. LARGEST METASTATIC FOCUS MEASURES 1.2 cm IN A HISTOLOGIC SECTION (SLIDE SB).
C. FOCAL EXTRACAPSULAR EXTENSION IS NOTED (SLIDE 5C).

PART 6: LEFT DISTAL URETERAL SHAVE MARGIN, BIOPSY -
A. MICROSCOPIC FOCUS OF DETACHED DYSPLASTIC UROTHELIUM IS PRESENT AT THE SHAVE URETERAL
RESEC‘HON MARGIN.
B. MICROSCOPIC FOCUS OF INVASIVE UROTHELIAL CARCINOMA IS PRESENTIN THE URETERAL MUSCULARIS

PROPRIA AND PERIURETERAL SOFT TISSUE CLOSE TO BUT NOT INVOLVING THE ACTUAL URETERAL
RESECTION MARGIN (see comment).

COMMENT:

Part 1 (right distal ureteral margin): The focus of urothellai dyepiaeia is represented only on the original frozen section
. I? slidee. On the permanent section, the ureter is mpreeented as a complete omen-section with no dyspiasia represented.

Part 6 (left distal ureterai margin): On the original frozen section slides. there was a small detached fragment of
dyepiaetio urothelium, with no invasive urotheiial carcinoma present. However. on the permanent sections representing
deeper levels into the tissue, email foci of invasive urotheilai carcinoma are preeent in the muecutarie propria of the
ureter and within the pertureteral soft tissue. Therefore. invasive carcinoma is close to the true margin and detached
dyspiastic urotheiium is at the true margin.
