The tumor observed macroscopically corresponds to an uveal melanoma, mainly
composed of epithelio‘id cells (80%). The tumor cells are large in size and present a
vesicular nucleus with mild atypia. The cells are often loaded with melanin. The
mitotic index is low (4 mitoses per 10 HPF).

The tumor is developed on the temporal side of the eye. At the anterior part, the
tumor infiltrates the lateral part of the iris and the ciliary body. At the posterior part,
the tumor is close to the optic foramen. However, the optic nerve on its entire course
and its cut end are free of tumor, as well as the meningeal sheets. The sclera is also
free and there is no tumor endovascular embolism.
