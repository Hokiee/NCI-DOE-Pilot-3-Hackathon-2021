GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. PRETRACHEAL LYMPH NODE
Received in formalin and labeled as "pretracheal lymph node" is a piece of yellow-tan adipose tissue
measuring 2.8x0.9x0.2cm containing 2 possible lymph nodes measuring 0.3 and 0.5mm. Submitted in
toto in block A1.
B. LEFT PARATRACHEAL LYMPH NODE
Received fresh for frozen section and labeled "left paratracheal lymph node" are 2 lymph nodes in
aggregate measuring 1.5x0.8x0.2cm. Touch preps are performed and the specimen is submitted in toto
block FSB1.
C. RIGHT PARATRACHEAL LYMPH NODE
Received in formalin and labeled "right paratracheal lymph node" are 2 pink-tan lymph nodes
measuring 0.2 and 0.30m. Submitted in toto in block C1.
D. THYROID
Received fresh for possible tissue procurement and labeled "thyroid" is a 11.59m thyroid gland. The
right lobe is 5.0x2.3x0.5cm and the left lobe is 2.5x2.3x0.36m. Right lobe is inked blue and the left lobe
is inked yellow and the specimen is serially sectioned. Within the right lobe is a ﬁrm, tan mass,
1.7x1.1x0.90m. in the left lobe is an area of diffuse white-tan discoloration measuring up to 0.9cm in
greatest dimension. The remainder of the thyroid tissue has a meaty red-brown coloration. Sections
are submitted for tissue procurement. Specimen is submitted in toto as follows:

D1-D2: mass from the right thyroid lobe

03-07: remainder of the tissue from the right lobe of thyroid

D8: isthmus

DQ-D10: normal appearing left thyroid lobe

D11-D13: area of discoloration from left lobe
