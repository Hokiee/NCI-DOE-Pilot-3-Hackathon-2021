F31: Ovary, right, total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral

salpingo—oophorectomy — "Poorly—differentiated ad ocarcinoma,
favor mullerian origin," _

 

Microscopic Description and Comment:

Both ovaries are extensively involved by poorly differentiated
papillary serous adenocarcinoma. The tumor is predominantly
present in solid nests but focally exhibits intraluminal
complexity, papillary architecture, and marked nuclear
pleomorphism and multinucleation. The tumor is present on the
ovarian surfaces bilaterally. Metastatic papillary serous
adenocarcinoma is present in left peritubal soft tissue, in the
omentum, on the uterine serosa with focal extension to adjacent
myometrium, in the periappendiceal soft tissue with focal
extension into adjacent muscularis, in the specimen labelled
"small bowel nodule," and in the specimen labelled "sigmoid
nodule." (

measuring 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.4 cm each. Th 1 e bisected
and half is placed in a cassette.

The fifth specimen container is labeled "right external iliac
nodes." It contains a single fragment of white and yellow tissue
measuring 2.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm. Sections show two lymph nodes. The
smaller measures 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. The larger measures 1.5 x

0.7 x 0.2 cm. The l m h nodes are bisected and half is placed in

The sixth specimen container is labeled “left obturator node." It
contains a single fragment of yellow and white tissue measuring
3.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. Sections show two lymph nodes measuring 0.5
and 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. The nodes are bisected and half
is placed in a cassette

The seventh specimen container is labeled ”sigmoid nodule." It

contains a single fra ment of fibroadipose tissue measuring 2.5 x

The eighth specimen container is labeled "appendix." It contains
an appendix with attached mesoappendix. The appendix measures 5.0
cm in length with a diameter of 0.4 cm. It is stapled at the
base. The mesoappendix measures 6.0 cm in length x 1.5 cm x 0.7
cm. It consists of yellow adipose tissue. However, there are
multiple areas of well circumscribed white nodules ranging in size
from 0.1 to 0.6 Cm in greatest dimension consistent with tumor
studding. A shave section is taken of the base in the midline
portion of the specimen including mesoappendix with tumor studs.
Longitudinal section is taken of the tip. Sections demonstrate an
unremarkable lumen.

The ninth specimen container is labeled ”small bowel nodule." It
contains three unoriented fragments of whiteetan tissue measuring
1.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. Labeled E. Jar 0.
