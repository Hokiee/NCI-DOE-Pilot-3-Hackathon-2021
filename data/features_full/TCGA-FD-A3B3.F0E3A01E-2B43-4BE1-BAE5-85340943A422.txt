Specimens Received:

A: Right pe1vic 1ymﬁh nodes
B: Le t pe1vic 1ymp nodes
C: B1adder

D: Ovaries

E:

Right ureter segment
Gross Description:

The specimens are received in five containers each 1abe1ed with the patient's
name and medica1 record number.

A. The first container is additiona11y identified as, "right pe1vic 1ymph
node". Received fresh and p1aced in forma1in are mu1tip1e soft tissue fragments
aggregating to a tota1 of 6.5 x 3 x 1 cm. Mu1tip1e 1ymph node candidates are
dissected rom the specimen ranging in size from 0.9 cm to 5.5 cm in 1ongest
dimension. The 1ymph node candidates are submitted as fo11ows:

A1: 2 possib1e 1ymph node candidates

A2: One 1ymgh node, seria11y sectioned

A3—A4: one ymph node, seria11y sectioned

B. The second container is additiona11y identified as, "1eft pe1vic 1ymph
node". Received fresh and p1aced in forma1in are mu1tip1e fibrofatty soft
tissue fragments aggregating to a tota1 of 6 x 4.5 x 1.5 cm. Mu1tip1e 1ymph node
candidates are dissected from the specimen ranging in size from 0.9 cm to 2 cm
and submitted as fo11ows:

Bl: One 1ymph node candidate, bisected

32: One 1ymgh node, entire

B3: 2 possi 1e 1ymph node candidates, entire

B4: One 1ymph node, seria11y sectioned

C. The third container is additiona11y identified as, "b1adder". Received fresh
and p1ace in forma1in is a 167.1 g cystectomy specimen with overa11 measurements
of 15 x 13.3 x 2.8 cm. The right uretera1 stump measures 3.5 cm in 1ength and
0.4 cm in diameter, and the 1e t measures 1 cm in 1ength and 0.4 cm in diameter.
Both ureters demonstrate intact patent 1umens. The serosa1 surface shows ye11ow
1obu1ated fibroadipose tissue with foca1 cautery artifact. The urethra1 margin
is inked b1ack, and the b1adder is inked b1ue on the right side and b1ack on the
1eft side. The specimen is o ened anterior1¥ to revea1 a 3.8 x 2.2 cm
u1cerated, necrotic mass on t e right 1atera wa11 and trigone. In addition
there is a 1.5 x 0.9 cm, superficia1 u1cerated 1esion near the 1eft trigone
measuring 1.5 cm from the dista1 urethra1 margin. On cut section, the 1arger
mass infi1trates into the muscuiaris progria to a depth of 1.1 cm and is 0.9 cm
from the deep mar in. The surrounding b adder mucosa is edematous, pink—tan
with a uniform 1. cm wa11 thickness. Bi1atera1 uretera1 orifices, adjacent to
the trigone, are identified and probe patent.

Representative sections are submitted as fo110ws:

C1: Dista1 urethra1 margin
C2: Right and 1eft ureter resection margins (right inked b1ue)
C3: Left 1atera1 wa11 tumor, at maximum depth

C4—C8: Additiona1 sections of the_u1cerative tumor
C9-C10: U1cerated 1eSion on the ri ht Side near the trigone

C11: Uninvo1ved b1adder mucosa 1adder dome
C12: Uninvo1ved b1adder mucosa anterior wa11
C13: Uninvo1ved b1adder mucosa, right 1atera1 wa11

D. The fourth container is additiona11y identified as, "ovaries“. Received
fresh and p1aced in forma1in are unoriented, bi1atera1 adnexa1 structures. One
adnexa consists of a 4.1 cm 1ong and 0.9 cm diameter fimbriated fa11opian tube.
The serosa is pink—red and g1istening. The specimen is seria11y sectioned

Page 2

revea1ing a pinpoint 1umen and a 0.3 cm wa11 thickness. The attached white—tan,
cribriform ovary measures 3 x 2.5 x 1 cm and is sectioned to revea1ed white and
gross1¥ unremar ab1e ovarian parenchyma. An occasiona1, ye11owish firm nodu1e is
pa1pab e in the perituba1 re ion. The other adnexa consist of a 3 cm 1ong and
0.5cm diameter fimbriated fa 1opian tube. The serosa is gink—red and g1istenin .
The specimen is seria11y sectioned revea1ing a pinpoint umen and a 0.3 cm wa11
thickness. The attached white—tan, cribriform ovary measures 2.5 x 2 x 1 cm and
is sectioned to revea1 fibrotic ovarian parenchyma. Representative sections are
submitted as fo110ws:

01: First fa11opian tube and ovary

D2: Ye11owish nodu1es near the first adnexa

03: Opposite fa11opian tube and ovary

E. The fifth container is additiona11y identified as, "right ureter segment".
Received fresh and p1aced in forma1in is a segment of ureter measuring 0.9 cm in
1ength and 0.5 cm in diameter. There is a suture designating the non—margin
site. This side is inked b1ue. Opposite margin is inked green. The specimen is

submitted entire1y with the margin embedded en face in E1 .
