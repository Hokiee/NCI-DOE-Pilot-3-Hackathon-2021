REVISED REPORT (Revised information underlined)

DIAGNOSIS:

A. Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and

bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy: FIGO grade I (of III)
endometrial

adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, is identified forming a
mass (3.3 I

x 2.0 x 0.7 cm) located in the left uterine wall. The
tumor invades

0.2 cm into the myometrium (total myometrial thickness 2.5
cm). The

tumor does not involve the endocervix. Lymphovascular
space

invasion is not identified. [AJCC ple]. FIGO grade I
(of

III) endometrioid carcinoma is also identified as polyp,
confined to

 

 

the endometrium, (1.4 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm). Extensive
adenomyosis is also identified. The bilateral ovaries and
fallopian

tubes show no diagnostic abnormalities.

B. C. D. E. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, excision: Multiple
left

pelvic lymph nodes (4 external iliac, 3 common iliac, 3
obturator)

are negative for tumor. The specimen labeled "left
internal iliac

lymph nodes" contained no nodal tissue.

F. G. H. I. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, excision:
Multiple right

pelvic lymph nodes (3 external iliac, 1 internal iliac, 4
common

iliac, 2 obturator) are negative for tumor.

J. Lymph nodes, right para-aortic above the inferior
mesenteric

artery, excision: Multiple (2) right para—aortic lymph
nodes above

the inferior mesenteric artery are negative for tumor.

K. Lymph nodes, right para-aortic below the inferior
mesenteric

artery, excision: Multiple (4) right para—aortic lymph
nodes below

the inferior mesenteric artery are negative for tumor.

L. Gonadal vessels, right, excision: Negative for tumor.

M. Lymph nodes, left para—aortic above the inferior
mesenteric

artery, excision: Multiple (3) left para—aortic lymph
nodes above

the inferior mesenteric artery are negative for tumor.

N. Lymph nodes, left para-aortic below the inferior
mesenteric

artery, excision: A single left para-aortic lymph node
below the

inferior mesenteric artery is negative for tumor.

0. Gonadal vessels, left, excision: Negative for tumor.
Photographed.

This final pathology report is based on the
gross/macroscopic

examination and frozen section histologic evaluation of
the

specimen(s).

AMENDMENTS: (Previous Signout Date:

Revision Description: The polyp, designated as benign,
was

incorrectly written to the report. The oringinal
diagnosis for this

polypoid lesion was inadvertently replaced with this
benign

designation. The polyp is a focus of non-invasive FIGO
grade I

endometrioid carcinoma.

....Original Diagnosis....

A. Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;
hysterectomy and

bilateral salpingo—oophorectomy: FIGO grade I (of III)
endometrial

 

adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, is identified forming a
mass (3.3

x 2.0 x 0.7 cm) located in the left uterine wall. The
tumor invades

0.2 cm into the myometrium (total myometrial thickness 2.5
cm). The

tumor does not involve the endocervix. Lymphovascular
space

invasion is not identified. [AJCC ple]. A benign
endometrial

polyp (1.4 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm) and extensive adenomyosis are
also

identified. The bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes
show no

diagnostic abnormalities.

 

B. C. D. E. Lymph nodes, left pelvic, excision: Multiple
left

pelvic lymph nodes (4 external iliac, 3 common iliac, 3
obturator)

are negative for tumor. The specimen labeled "left
internal iliac

lymph nodes" contained no nodal tissue.

 

F. G. H. I. Lymph nodes, right pelvic, excision:
Multiple right

pelvic lymph nodes (3 external iliac, 1 internal iliac, 4
common

iliac, 2 obturator) are negative for tumor.

J. Lymph nodes, right para—aortic above the inferior
mesenteric

artery, excision: Multiple (2) right para—aortic lymph
nodes above

the inferior mesenteric artery are negative for tumor.

K. Lymph nodes, right para—aortic below the inferior
mesenteric

artery, excision: Multiple (4) right para—aortic lymph
nodes below

the inferior mesenteric artery are negative for tumor.

L. Gonadal vessels, right, excision: Negative for tumor.

M. Lymph nodes, left para—aortic above the inferior

artery, excision: Multiple (3) left para—aortic lymph
nodes above
the inferior mesenteric artery are negative for tumor.

N. Lymph nodes, left para—aortic below the inferior
mesenteric

artery, excision: A single left para-aortic lymph node
below the

inferior mesenteric artery is negative for tumor.

0. Gonadal vessels, left, excision: Negative for tumor.

GROSS DESCRIPTION:

A. Received fresh labeled "uterus, right and left
fallopian tubes

and ovaries" is a 255.0 gram uterus with attached
bilateral tubes

and ovaries and an unremarkable cervix. The uterine
serosa smooth

There is a 3.3 x 2.0 x 0.7 cm mass in the left side of the
endometrial cavity with 2.5 cm myometrial thickness.
Tumor invades

0.2 cm into the myometrium. A polypoid mass (1.4 x 1.0 x
0.6 cm)

with a narrow stalk is also identified in the posterior
fundus.

There is a 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm right ovary with a smooth
outer

surface and a solid cut surface with a 5.9 x 0.5 cm right

tube. There is a 2.7 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm left ovary with a
smooth outer

surface and a solid cut surface with a 6.2 x 0.5 cm left
fallopian

tube. Photograph taken. Representative sections
