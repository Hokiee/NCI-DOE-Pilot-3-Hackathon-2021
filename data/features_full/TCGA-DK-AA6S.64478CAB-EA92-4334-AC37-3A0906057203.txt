ABNORMALITY(IES): CHRONIC CYSTITIS, FOREIGN BODY REACTION
AND PROLIFERATIVE CYSTITIS (BRUNN'S NESTS, CYSTITIS CYSTICA,
CYSTITIS GLANDULARIS).

Gross Description:

1A) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Bladder, prostate,
urethra, urachus, right pelvic lymph nodes, right perivesicle
lymph nodes". It consists of a bladder, measuring 5.0 x 4.0 x
2.0 cm with attached prostate and urethra. The urethra measures
4.0 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm, showing a red—tan, hemorrhagic, edematous,
mucosal surface. The posterior wall of the bladder is partially
covered with pink-tan, smooth, shiny peritoneum, measuring 6.0 x
5.0 cm. The superoanterior margin of the specimen is attached
with yellow-tan, lobulated fibroadipose tissue, containing lymph
nodes, measuring 9.0 x 5.0 x 3.5 cm. Right and left ureters are
identified. The right ureter measures 3.4 cm in length and
approximately 0.4 cm in diameter. The right ureter is probed,
showing a pink-tan, smooth, shiny inner surface. The left ureter
measures 3.6 cm in length and is dilated to approximately 0.9 cm
in diameter. The left ureter is probe-patent and contains clear
fluid. The surgical margin is entirely inked. The bladder is
opened anteriorly, showing an irregular ulcerative, hemorrhagic,
firm tumor mass which occupies the left bladder wall and one of
the posterior wall includes a right and left orifice, trigone and
proximal urethral areas. The tumor mass measures 4.7 x 4.0 x 2.0
cm, protruding through the left bladder wall and extending to
paravesical fatty tissue.

The prostate is separated from the bladder and will be processed
later. Representative sections are submitted.

1B) The specimen is received fresh, labeled "Prostate and
seminal vesicles". It consists of a radical prostatectomy
specimen which includes prostate, seminal vesicles, and portions
of right and left vasa deferentia. The specimen weighs 25 grams.
The prostate measures 3.5 cm from apex to base, 3.0 cm,
transversely, and 2.8 cm from anterior to posterior. The right
seminal vesicle measures 3.5 x 1.6 x 0.9 cm and the left seminal
vesicle measures 3.3 x 1.6 x 0.8 cm. The external surface of the
prostate is smooth. The prostate is serially sectioned from apex
to base at approximately 3 mm intervals. The peripheral zone
show(s) no abnormalities. The periurethral (transitional zone)

shows no abnormalities. 100% of the prostatic tissue is
submitted.

Summary of sections:

RA — right apical margin

LA — left apical margin

BN — bladder neck margin

RSV - right vas deferens and seminal vesicle

LSV — left vas deferens and seminal vesicle

A-F — serial sections of prostate from apex to base

2) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left vas
deferens". It consists of two fragments of tubular rubbery

tissue, partially surrounded by yellow~tan fibroadipose tissue,
measuring 1.4 cm in length, 0.3 cm in diameter and 2.0 cm in
length and 0.4 cm in diameter. Representative sections are
submitted.

Summary of Sections:

SM — Surgical margin

RS - Representative sections

3) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left iliac
lymph nodes". It consists of an irregular piece of yellow—tan

fibroadipose tissue, measuring 3.0 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm which contains
several lymph nodes. The specimen is submitted entirely.

Summary of Sections:
U — Undesignated

4) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left
obturator nodes". It consists of an irregular piece of yellow—
tan fibroadipose tissue, measuring 4.0 x 3.5 x 1.4 cm, containing
several lymph nodes. The specimen is submitted entirely.

Summary of Sections:
U — Undesignated

5) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left
perivesicle lymph nodes". It consists of an irregular piece of
yellow—tan fibroadipose tissue, measuring 2.8 x 2.2 x 1.1 cm.
The specimen is submitted entirely.

Summary of Sections:
U — Undesignated

6) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Left distal
ureter". It consists of a fragment of ureter measuring 0.4 cm
in length and 0.9 cm in diameter. The specimen is submitted
entirely.

Summary of Sections:
U — Undesignated

7) The specimen is received in formalin, labeled "Right distal
ureter". It consists of a portion of ureter, surrounded by
yellow—tan fibroadipose tissue, measuring 2.7 cm in length and
0.9 cm in diameter. Representative sections are submitted.
