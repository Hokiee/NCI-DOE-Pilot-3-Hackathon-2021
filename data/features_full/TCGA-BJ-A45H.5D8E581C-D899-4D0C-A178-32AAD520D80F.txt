MOLECULAR ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY TESTING:

BACKGROUND: ' ' r '

Mutations In either BRAF or MS genes or RET/PTC rearrangements are found in more than 70% of papillary thyroid
carcinomas (t). Mutations In the RAs genes or PAXUPPARg rearrangement occur In 40% of follicular thyroid
carcinomas and with lower frequency In oncocyuc (Hiirthle cell) carcinomas (2). Finding of BRAF. RET/PTC or
PAxalPPARg mutations In thyroid FNA samples correlates with -1 00% probability of cancer and ﬁnding of RAS‘mutatlnn
correlates with malignancy In 74.85% of cocoa (3-5). Based on our prospective study at risk of cancer in thyroid
nodules negative for all of these mutations Ie 5.9% In nodulee with atypla of undetermined signiﬁcance/follicular lesion if
undetermined signiﬁcance (AUSIFLUS) cytology (including the 2.3% risk of invasive cancer and 0.5% risk of cantor with
extrathyreidai spread in this group), 14% in nodules with follicqu neoclaemleueplcioue for follicular neoplasm ’(FNI' 3‘ ii}
cytology. and 28% In nodules with suspicious for malignant oelle cytology (5). in addition. BRAFVBOOE (HEM) , - ‘
mutation has been associated with more aggressive behavior of papillary carcinoma (a) and may be used for I’Iiil'tv" .
stratiﬁcation of patients with papillary thyroid cancer (1). However, single cases of false-positive BRAF mutation
detection In thyroid FNA samples have been reported In the literature (8); therefore. the reeulte of molecular testing
should be interpreted in combination with clinical Information, Imaging. and cytology.
