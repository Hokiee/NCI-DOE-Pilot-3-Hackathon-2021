- HIGH GRADE MYXOFIBROSARCOMA INVOLVING SKELETAL MUSCLE AND FIBROADIPOSE

TISSUE .

— TUMOR MEASURES 5.4 CM GREATEST DIMENSION AND SHOWS ABOUT 20% NEGROSIS.
- TUMOR IS 0.25 CM FROM THE DEEP, 0.2 CD! FROM THE MEDIAL, 0.4 cu FROM THE

INFERIOR, AND 0.6 CM FROM THE SUPERIOR MARGIN.
- CHANGES CONSISTENT WITH PRIOR. BIOPSY.

1.) The specimen is received fresh, labeled 'radical resection of right
chest wall mess including pectoralis major and minor, short stitch superior,
long stitch lateral' and consists of an 18 x 11 x 6.5 cm fragment of soft
fibrofatty tissue with attached skeletal muscle and 11.2 cm ellipse of skin.
Located on the superior portion is a round, grossly encapsulated, well
circumscribed mass measuring 8.5 x 7 x 5 cm. Superior surface and is inked
black; it is incised and TPS is taken. The cut surface of the mass is
mostly solid with partially cystic areas. There are foci of hemorrhage and
solid areas which have a variegated yellow-red—hrown appearance.
Interspsrsed within the tumor, there are blue-grey solid hard foci. The
tumor is separated from the superior margin by a 0.2 cm strip of tissue and
is 3 cm and 2.5 cm from the lateral and medial margins. respectively. The
tumor is 2.1 cm from the posterior margin. The remaining portion of the
specimen is inked as follows: lateral-yellow, posterior (deePI—green,

medial-red and inferior—blue. Representative sections are taken. Pictures
and TPS are taken.

Summary of Sections:
Rm- red margin

Gm— green margin
Bm- black margin
Blm- blue margin

2) The specimen is received fresh, labeled l'Radical resection of left chest
wall mass short stitch superior long stitch lateral'' and consists of a 14.0
x 11.0 x 5.0 cm portion of ten soft tissue, fatty tissue and skeletal muscle
covered by an ellipse of tan-brown skin measuring 12.0 x 2.5 cm. The
specimen is inked: deep margin-black, superior margin-yellow, medial
margin~green, lateral margin—red, inferior margin-blue. Sections reveal a
relatively well circumscribed, approximately spherical ten-yellow tumor with
fibrotic foci, located within the skeletal muscle, measuring 5.4 x 5.2 x 5.2
cm. The tumor is located 0.2 cm from the deep and medial margins, 0.3 cm
from the inferior margin, 0.5 cm from the superior margin, and over 1 cm
from the lateral margin. The tumor is located 7.5 cm from the overlying
skin. The specimen is photographed. Tissue is submitted to TPS.
Representative sections are submitted.

Summary of sections:

TDM-tumor to deep margin
Tum-tumor to medial margin
TIM-tumor st inferior margin
SM-tumor at the superior margin
LM-lateral margin

T-tumor
