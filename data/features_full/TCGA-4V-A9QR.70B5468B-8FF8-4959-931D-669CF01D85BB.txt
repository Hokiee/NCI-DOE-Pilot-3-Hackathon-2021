Extemporaneous histological examination
- Gross pathology : biopsy of the pericardium measuring 2 cm in diameter.

- Extemporaneous histological examination : compatible appearance with an invasion by a

thymoma B.

- Conventional histological examination : After thawing and ﬁxation, confirmation
diagnosis thymoma (1A ) . m C)—

2) Thymectomy
Thymectomy specimen weighing 117 g is addressed oriented . It measures 15 cm x 7 cm x 5
cm and it is bordered by a strip of pericardium measuring 8 x 5 cm and resection

lung parenchyma 9 x 3 x 2.5 cm both also identified. Resection limits have been the identiﬁcation
of a color ink .

The tumor 9 cm x 6 cm. It is appearance " sweetbreads " revised its center
by areas of necrosis , calcifications .

When cut , the tumor invades the pericardium over its entire thickness .

3) Grease under xiphoid two fragments of 0.8 and 1.1 cm.

4) Ganglion Barety : a node of 2.7 cm

5 ) High latérotrachéal Ganglion constituted firstly four ganglia 0.5 cm ( 5A )
and secondly of a cystic lesion major axis of 2.5 cm , multilocular , with

fleshy part , white (5B) .

Histopathological examination :
- The samples taken at the level of the thymic tumor is characterized by
separated by thick ﬁbrous septa and lobules mainly composed of cells of

epithelial type . These polygonal cells often have a pseudo- squamous appearance and are

seat even some atypical mitosis . They have spaces around

perivascular light sometimes narrow , sometimes even expanded and cystic

- The samples taken at the level of the pulmonary parenchyma (28) are
characterized by invasion of the lung by the thymic tumor. It invades
also the bronchial tree as an endoluminal mass .

- The samples taken at the pericardium (ZG ) are also the seat of a

pericardial thickened tumor invasion by the tumor.

The limits of tumor resection pass in tissue area 2A and lungs

pericardial .

- Fat sub xiphoid addressed separately ( 3 ) consists of a tissue of

cellulo- adipose seat of a node of normal appearance . Absence of tumor invasion .

- Among the laterotracheal top four nodes of 0.5 cm ( 5A) are

normal appearance. Absence of tumor invasion . Cystic lesion calculated separately
(SB ) is thymic parenchyma partitioned by thick fibrous septa and

formed in its center is identical to that previously described proliferation . The
lesion is limited by a fibrous capsule . On the outskirts , we did not find any

normal glandular parenchyma preserved, which does not confirm the existence

a lymph node metastasis .

Immunohistochemical examination :
epithelial cells
- expression of CK19 , 7, 5/6

absence of expression of CKZO , the CD5 and CDZO

Immature T lymphocytes type : CD1A + and CD99 +

Conclusion :
Thymoma subtype B3 -type measuring 9 cm by 6 cm.

Invasion of the pericardium and lung parenchyma. lymph node metastasis

WHO classification : T4 N2 M0
