E Internal Sample IE I _

Diagnosis/Diagnoses:

Rectal resection specimen with fully developed diverticulosis in the proximal segment and
aboral, ulcerated, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma extending into the perirectal fat
(GZ). Tumor-free oral and aboral margins.

 

 

The clinically reported inﬁltration of the posterior bladder wall is not detectable microscopically

in the available material. Accordingly the neoplasia may be classiﬁed histologically as category
pT3.

A follow-up report will be issued on the histology of lymph nodes dissected out from the
perirectal fatty tissue after clariﬁcation with acetone.

Follow-up report:

Numerous lymph nodes of up to 1.2 cm in size were dissected out ﬁom the pericolic fatty tissue
in the vicinity of the tumor aﬁer clariﬁcation with acetone.

Of 30 lymph nodes embedded as samples, [8 exhibited metastatic inﬁltrates from the previously
diagnosed adenocarcinoma or colon carcinoma.

In conclusion or in summary, therefore, a stage of pT3 pN2 (18/30) is obtained.
