Gross Description

Received are specimen containers A to E. All requisitions and specimen containers are
labelled with the patient's name. . The cassettes and identifiers are
labelled with the Surgica.

A. Specimen is received £Ld3ﬂ, subsequently”placed into formalin. The container is
designated "A. Gallbladder". The specimen consists of a purple—tan gallbladder measuring
5.5 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm. Serosal surface is smooth and slightly congested. Cystic duct is
patent. The lumen contains green watery bile. Calculi are not identified. Cystic duct
lymph node is not identified. The mucosa is green and slightly granular. The wall
averages 0.2 cm in thickness. Representative sections are submitted in one cassette.

B. Specimen is received fresh. subsequently placed into formalin. The container is
designated "B. Lymph node #8". The specimen consists of an irregular portion of
fibrofatty tissue measuring 2.8 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm. A possible lymph node is identified
measuring 2.0 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm. The possible lymph node is bisected, submitted in toto in
one cassette. »

C. Specimen is received fresh, subsequently placed into formalin. The container is
designated “C. Whipple's". The specimen consists of a portion of duodenum and attached
pancreas. The duodenum measures 22.0 cm in length and averages 7.0 cm in circumference.
There is little to no attached mesentery and the serosal surface is grey-tan. The
proximal 10.0 cm of the duodenal mucosa is ten and grossly unremarkable. There is a
sharp demarcation from unremarkable to congested mucosa for the remaining length, 14.0
cm. The pancreas measures 6.0 x 5.0 x 2.5 cm. The margins are painted as follows: body
is inked blue, vessel bed orange. and uncinate margin green. The pancreas is serially
sectioned. Cut surface reveals a mucinous ill-defined tan lesion measuring 3.2 x 3.0 x
3.0 cm, and comes within 1.3 cm to'the body margin and grossly comes within less than 0.1
cm to the vessel bed and uncinate margins. The lesion abuts the common bile duct.
Remaining pancreatic parenchyma appears grossly unremarkable. The common bile duct is
present and measures 5.0 cm in length and becomes narrowed at the ampulla with thickening
of the wall. Circumference ranges from 0.5 cm at the ampulla and 2.0 cm at the common
bile duct margin. Mucosa appears grossly unremarkable. Three possible lymph nodes
ranging in size from 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm to 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm are palpated from the
peripancreatic soft tissue. Sections are submitted as follows:

C1 — shave section. common bile duct margin.

C2 - proximal margin, bisected.

C3-4 - representative sections from distal margin.

C5 - representative section from grossly normal appearing duodenum to congested
mucosa.

C6 — shave section from body margin.

C7-8 — lesion in relation to uncinate margin and peripancreatic fat.
C9-10 — lesion in relation to vessel bed margin.

C11 - common bile duct thickened area.

C12 - longitudinal sections of ampulla and common bile duct.

C13 — one possible lymph node.

C14—15 - one possible lymph node bisected each.

D. The specimen consists of soft tissue measuring 1.4 x 0.7 x 0.4 cm. with cauterized
surface. Submitted in toto.

Specimen is received fresh, subsequently placed into formalin. The container is
designated 'D. Pancreas margin".
E. Specimen is received fresh, subsequently placed into formalin. The container is
designated "E. Small bowel mass“. The specimen consists of a tan to hemorrhagic nodule
with attached soft tissue measuring 1. 3 x 0. 7 x 0. 5 cm. The specimen is bisected.
submitted in toto in one cassette.
Frozen Section Diagnosis
D. Pancreas margin:

- No tumor identified.

Reported by:
Microscopic Description

E. There is a subserosal nodule that is predominantly fibrotic with stromal
calcifications. CD117'is negative and so is $100. CD34 highlights blood vessels.

C. Best Tumor Block : C8 (but still requires macrodissection since the tumor has a

hypocellular nature and there is a lymph node in the same section); Best normal tissue
block: C4.

Pathologist Comment

C. Tumor involves the wall of the common bile duct close to the ampulla but does not
involve the ampulla proper. The uncinate and vascular bed margins show cauterized
mucinous cystic nodules that are acellular but represent tumor. Margin status was
discussed with Dr. who reviewed slide C9 and C12.
