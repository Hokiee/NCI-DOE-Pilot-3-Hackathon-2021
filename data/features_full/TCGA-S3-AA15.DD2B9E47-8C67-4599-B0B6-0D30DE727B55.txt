Received Date/Time:

Specimen is received in 2 parts:

A.'l'he specimen is labeled "RIGHT SBNTINEL NODE" and is received unﬁxed for frozen section diagnosis. (The specimen is in the
formalin more than 6 hours and less than 48 hours). It consists of a large lymph node measuring 3.5 x 2 x 2 cm. Sectioned and
entirely submitted in cassettes FSA l-FSAB. v

Time specimen was removed from the patient:

Time specimen was placed in formalin :

lschemic time: 27 minutes

B. The specimen is labeled “RIGHT BREAST AND AXILIARY NODES I AND II" and is received in formalin. (The specimen is
in the formalin more than 6 hours and less than 48 hours). It consist of mastectomy specimen with lymph nodes weighing 1150
grams and measuring” x 22 x 7 cm with brown sln'n ellipse measuring 21 x 10 cm. containing grossly unremarkable 2.0 cm in
diameter nipple. The skin is tagged with a black stitch designating the axilla . The posterior margin is composed of smooth fascia
which is inked black. The breast is sliced in sagittal planes revealing a S x S x 4 cm hemorrhagic cavity within the upper inner-central
quadrants which is 0.7 cm away ﬁ'om the closest deep fascial margin of resection. The remaining parenchyma reveals unremarkable
yellow mammary fat with streaks of white-gray mammary parenchyma. Representative sections are submitted as follows:.

Bl = one lymph node, bisected

82 = one lymph node, bisected

B3 = one lymph node, bisected

B4 = 5 lymph nodes

B5 = 2 lymph nodes, one bisected.

B6 = one lymph node. bisected

B7 = one lymph node. bisected

BS = one lymph node, bisected

B9-B12 = upper inner quadrant-Genus] mass

B 13 = mass closest to deep fascist margin of resection

314 = nipple

B 15 = upper inner quadrant

B16 = upper outer quadrant

B17 = lower outer quadrant

818 = lower inner quadrant

519-28: additional sections from biopsy cavity.
