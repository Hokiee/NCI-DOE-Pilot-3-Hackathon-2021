Tumor focality: Unifocal
Tumor size:
Greatest dimension: 4 cm
Additional measurements: 3.8 x 3.1 cm
Macroscopic extent of tumor: Conﬁned to the testis
Histologic type: Mixed germ cell tumor (embryonal carcinoma-95%. teratoma-

invasion
Regional lymph nodes: pNX: Cannot be assessed (not sampled)
Distant metastasis: Not applicable
